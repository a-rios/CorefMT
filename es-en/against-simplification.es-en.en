Against Simplification 
NEW YORK - It is said that Americans have a genius for simplification . 
Gradually , however , the quest for it has become a global trend , one that continues to conquer new territories , just as blue jeans once did . 
The speed of our daily life is visibly increased - and not for the better - by this unstoppable evolution . 
The tyranny of pragmatism seems to mark all of the complex dilemmas of our time . 
Too many valid choices are ignored or skirted through the routine of short-cuts . 
Nowhere is this trend more damaging than in today &apos;s mercantile approach to art . 
Even the much-praised notion of competition seems fake and cynically manipulated by the &quot; corporate &quot; mentality that now pervades the world of culture - by the financial pre-selection that determines what publishers , producers , and other impresarios will support . 
Just imagine what might have happened with the works of , say , Proust , Kafka , Musil , Faulkner , or Borges had they been subjected to mass-market competition like shoes or cosmetics . 
Culture is a necessary pause from the daily rat race , from our chaotic and often vulgar political surroundings , and it is a chance to recover our spiritual energy . 
Great books , music , and paintings are not only an extraordinary school of beauty , truth , and good , but also a way of discovering our own beauty , truth , and good - the potential for change , of bettering ourselves and even some of our interlocutors . 
If this respite and refuge is gradually narrowed and invaded by the same kind of &quot; products &quot; as those that dominate the mass market , we are condemned to be perpetual captives of the same stunted universe of &quot; practicalities , &quot; the ordinary agglomeration of clich√©s packaged in advertisements . 
I was thinking again about these old and seemingly unsolvable questions during my re-reading of a quite challenging novel by a close friend and a great writer , not very present in the vivid landscape of American letters of today . 
The theme , style , and echo of his work says a lot , I think , about our simplified world . 
The novel is Blinding , by Claudio Magris . 
Hailed in Europe as one of the great novels of the twentieth century , Blinding arrived in America only after a great delay , and never received the attention that it deserved . 
Unfortunately , that is no surprise . 
The number of literary translations done nowadays in the United States is , according to a United Nations report , equal to that of Greece , a country one-tenth the size . 
At the core of Magris &quot; book is the destiny of a group of Italian communists who travel to Yugoslavia after the Second World War to contribute to the construction of a socialist society , only to be caught in the conflict between Stalin and Tito . 
They are imprisoned for their Stalinist allegiance ; when they are finally allowed to return to Italy , their old comrades refuse to accept them . 
The book &apos;s plot spans two centuries of revolution . 
Then , suddenly , 
&quot; the party vanished , overnight , as if all of a sudden a giant sponge had drained the entire sea , Adriatic and Austral , leaving litter and clots of mud , and all the boats stranded . 
How can you go home again if the sea has been sucked down a vast drain that opened up beneath it , emptying it who knows where , into a void ? 
The earth is arid and dead , but there won &apos;t be another one , nor another heaven . &quot; 
The solitude of the individual facing his faith alone , without collective illusions , and forced to do something with himself in the arid , noisy world tells us something important about the exiled world of modernity and its complex and contradictory problems . 
Magris &apos;s novel is not only an important literary achievement ; it also has a deep connection to the dangers that we face now , particularly the wave of fanaticism , from Mumbai to Oslo , in the name of a holy war against the &quot; other . &quot; 
Are all the extremists searching for a new coherence , for a lost illusion of togetherness and a new hope of resurrection ? 
Can we ever forget September 11 , 2001 , the start of a bloody century in which the mystical force of hatred and destruction has recovered its strength ? 
Are Osama Bin Laden &apos;s minions , the bloody Hamas-Hezbollah battalions , or troubled loners like Timothy McVeigh , Theodore Kaczynski , and now Norway &apos;s Anders Behring Breivik , the &quot; heroes &quot; of our contemporary nightmare ? 
Is this the &quot; rebel &quot; response to an overly globalized , incoherent , and ultimately disturbing reality ? 
If so , their barbarism demands scrutiny - in relation to both historical precedent and to our modernity - rather than merely being labeled &quot; monstrous &quot; ( though it certainly is that ) . 
The new religious militants , fighting in the name of their particular and peculiar God , seem as fanaticized as the Fascists , Nazis , and Communists of earlier decades . 
Magris &apos;s main character is a rebel in more than one embodiment : as Salvatore Cipico , one of the inmates in the communist concentration camp in Yugoslavia ; as Jurgen Jurgensen , ephemeral king of Iceland and a convict forced to build his own jail ; and as Jason , the mythic adventurer searching for the volatile truth . 
A multilayered and complex chronicle of the devastating tragedies of the twentieth century , Blinding is an insistent , informed , and irreplaceable incursion into the moving landscape of the human soul , its wounds and voids , its vitality and versatility , its deep distortions and its unpredictable dynamics . 
It is a fascinating story about the conflict between ideals and reality , or Utopia and humanness ; about being faithful to a cause and betraying it ; and about sacrifice and solidarity . 
It is also a rich and original literary achievement that challenges today &apos;s consumerist ethic . 
By renouncing simplicity , it also repudiates today &apos;s prevailing confusion of information with literature , of facts with creativity , and best-selling products with true works of art .
