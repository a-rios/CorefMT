Egypt after Morsi 
BERLIN - Egypt lies at the heart of the Arab revolution , even if the original spark occurred in Tunisia . 
But Egypt - with its strategic location , stable borders , large population , and ancient history - has been the principal power of the Arab world for centuries , defining the movement of history there like no other . 
This implies that the overthrow of Egypt &apos;s democratically elected president , Mohamed Morsi , will have much broader repercussions . 
Was Morsi &apos;s ouster a classic counterrevolution in the guise of a military coup ? 
Or did the coup prevent a total takeover of power by the Muslim Brotherhood , and thus avert Egypt &apos;s economic collapse and chaotic descent into religious dictatorship ? 
No one should deny that what happened in Egypt was a military coup , or that forces from former President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s regime have returned to power . 
But , unlike in 2011 , when the few pro-Western liberals and huge numbers of urban , middle-class youth rallied against Mubarak , now the same groups support the coup , lending it a certain ( democratic ? ) legitimacy . 
Nonetheless , the overthrow of a democratically elected government by the military cannot be glossed over . 
So what options does Egypt now have ? 
Will it repeat the Algerian tragedy , in which the military canceled an election to prevent Islamists from assuming power , leading to an eight-year civil war that claimed up to 200,000 lives ? 
Will the country return to military dictatorship ? 
Or will Egypt end up with something like a Kemalist &quot; democracy &quot; of the type that long prevailed in Turkey , with a civilian government but the military pulling the strings ? 
All three alternatives are possible , though it is impossible to predict which one will come to pass . 
But one thing already can be said for certain : the basic distribution of power within Egyptian society has not changed . 
The military and the Muslim Brotherhood divide power between themselves . 
The Western-oriented liberals do not have any real power and stand , as we are seeing now , on the army &apos;s shoulders . 
We should not forget that Morsi &apos;s opponent in the presidential election in 2012 was Ahmed Shafik , a former general and the last Mubarak-era prime minister - certainly no liberal . 
A victory by either the Brotherhood or the military would not be a victory for democracy . 
Hamas , which has ruled Gaza since 2006 , may serve as an example of what the Brotherhood wants : undivided power , including over the military . 
Likewise , the Egyptian army &apos;s hold on power , beginning in the 1950 &quot; s , resulted in a decades-long military dictatorship . 
But there is a third and new factor now in play , one that does not measure power in the same way as the military and the Brotherhood . 
Through their leadership of the protests for two years , urban middle-class youth have gained their own legitimacy , and , with their technological and linguistic capacities , are able to dominate global debate about Egypt . 
These young people want progress , not power ; they want the future to resemble the life that they see on the Internet and in the West . 
If this movement were channeled into institutional politics , it would significantly affect Egypt &apos;s internal distribution of power . 
Egypt &apos;s unfolding drama will be framed by the triangle of contradictions and demands among these three groups . 
And it should not be forgotten that , along with young people &apos;s sense that they lacked a future under the nationalistic military dictatorships of the past , mass poverty was the second trigger of the 2011 revolution . 
Underlying the contradiction between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood is not only the question of religion , but also all of the social problems , including inequality , that riddle Arab societies . 
The Brotherhood has effectively assumed a role similar to that of left-wing European political parties in the nineteenth century . 
Whoever wants to weaken the Brotherhood has to address the urgent social issues that it raises and try to solve them . 
This means that whatever solution ultimately prevails will be measured according to whether it can solve the economic crisis ( particularly the lack of job opportunities for the young ) and deepening mass poverty . 
The chances of this are slim . 
Throughout the Arab world , nationalism constricts societies and retards cooperation , the dismantling of tariffs , and the creation of an economic community . 
And yet the economies of the Arab countries in crisis are too small to succeed on their own ; even if everything goes well , they cannot offer their large and young populations hope of a positive future . 
They need enhanced cooperation , which , given a common language , would rest on a stronger foundation than it does in Europe . 
In Egypt , the West should work with all three leading political forces - the military , the Brotherhood , and the urban young - because no short-term solution will come in the form of one option . 
The worst approach would be to marginalize or even persecute the Muslim Brotherhood and political Islam again . 
More broadly , with Syria &apos;s civil war destabilizing Lebanon and threatening to do the same in Jordan , and with Iraq plagued by similar sectarian violence , the military coup in Egypt appears to herald the end of the Arab revolutions , at least for the time being . 
Everywhere , the signs are pointing backwards . 
But we should not be deceived . 
Even if the struggle for power seems decided , this does not mean a return to the former status quo . 
When the revolutions of 1848 in Europe were rolled back the following year , everything was nonetheless different , as we now know . 
The monarchies remained in power for decades , but the Industrial Revolution and the advent of democracy had become unstoppable . 
We also know , however , that this led Europe to a future that was anything but serene . 
The Arab world might not be so deeply affected , but the near future there will certainly be neither peaceful nor stable .
