Writing the Future 
ADDIS ABABA - What does the future hold for the global economy ? 
Will living standards rise worldwide , as today &apos;s poor countries leapfrog technologies to catch up with richer countries ? 
Or will prosperity slip through our fingers as greed and corruption lead us to deplete vital resources and degrade the natural environment on which human well-being depends ? 
Humanity faces no greater challenge than to ensure a world of prosperity rather than a world that lies in ruins . 
Like a novel with two possible endings , ours is a story yet to be written in this new century . 
There is nothing inevitable about the spread - or the collapse - of prosperity . 
More than we know ( or perhaps care to admit ) , the future is a matter of human choice , not mere prediction . 
Despite the ongoing economic crisis in Europe and the United States , the developing world has sustained rapid economic growth . 
While the International Monetary Fund forecasts that the advanced economies will grow by just 1.5 % in 2013 , developing-country growth is projected to reach 5.6 % . 
Asia &apos;s developing economies , now the world &apos;s pacesetters , are expected to grow by 7.2 % , with output in Sub-Saharan Africa set to rise by a healthy 5.7 % . 
What is happening is both powerful and clear . 
Technologies that were once found only in rich countries now belong to the entire world . 
Mobile phone coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , has gone from nearly zero subscribers 20 years ago to around 700 million today . 
Within a few years , the vast majority of the world will have access to wireless broadband . 
Yet there is another truth as well . 
Last year was the hottest ever recorded in the US . 
Droughts afflicted around 60 % of US counties , including the breadbasket states of the Midwest and the Great Plains . 
In October , an extraordinary &quot; superstorm &quot; smashed into the Atlantic coastline around New Jersey , causing losses of around $ 60 billion . 
Climate problems - floods , droughts , heat waves , extreme storms , massive forest fires , and more - also ravaged many other parts of the world in 2012 , including China , Australia , Southeast Asia , the Caribbean , and Africa &apos;s Sahel region . 
These environmental disasters are occurring with rising frequency , as they are partly caused by human actions , such as deforestation , coastal erosion , massive pollution , and , of course , the greenhouse-gas emissions that are changing the world &apos;s climate and acidifying the oceans . 
What is new is that scourges like climate change - until recently described as a future threat - are now clear and present dangers . 
Scientists have even given a name to our era , the Anthropocene , in which humanity ( &quot; anthropos &quot; in Greek ) is having a large-scale impact on the planet &apos;s ecosystems . 
Herein lies our great challenge - the one that will determine whether we follow the path of prosperity or ruin . 
The rapidly growing developing countries cannot simply follow the economic-growth path that today &apos;s rich countries traveled . 
If they try , the world economy will push the planet beyond safe operating conditions . 
Temperatures will rise , storms will intensify , the oceans will become more acidic , and species will go extinct in vast numbers as their habitats are destroyed . 
The simple fact is that humanity faces a stark choice . 
If the world economy &apos;s current growth patterns continue , we face ecological disaster . 
If the world economy embraces a new growth pattern - one that harnesses advanced technologies like smart phones , broadband , precision agriculture , and solar power - we can spread prosperity while saving the planet . 
I call today &apos;s growth pattern the business-as-usual option ; the smart-technology growth pattern , by contrast , represents the sustainable-development option . 
Business as usual can work for a while , but it will end in tears , while the sustainable-development path can lead to long-term prosperity . 
So , what will it take to write the happy ending ? 
First , we must recognize that we , as a global society , have a choice to make . 
Business as usual is comfortable . 
We think we understand it . 
Yet it is not good enough : on our current trajectory , short-term prosperity is coming at the cost of too many future crises . 
Second , we must recognize the powerful new tools and technologies that we have at hand . 
Using advanced information technologies - computers , satellite mapping , image processing , expert systems , and more - we now have the means to grow more food with less environmental damage ; improve public health for rich and poor alike ; distribute more electricity with lower greenhouse-gas emissions ; and make our cities more livable and healthier , even as urbanization raises their populations by billions in the coming decades . 
Third , we should set bold goals for the years ahead - to spread prosperity and improve public health while saving the planet . 
Fifty years ago , US President John F. Kennedy said that we should to go to the moon not because it was easy , but because it was hard - it tested the best in us . 
In our generation , sustainable development will be our test , encouraging us to use our creativity and human values to establish a path of sustainable well-being on our crowded and endangered planet . 
I am proud and honored that United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has asked me to help mobilize the world &apos;s expertise as we seek to achieve that goal . 
The greatest talents in our societies - in universities , businesses , NGOs , and especially among the world &apos;s young people - are ready to take on our greatest challenges , and are joining the UN &apos;s new Sustainable Development Solutions Network . 
In the months and years ahead , these leaders will share their visions of a prosperous and sustainable global society .
