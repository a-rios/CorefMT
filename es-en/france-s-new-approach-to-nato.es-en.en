France &apos;s New Approach to NATO 
PARIS - What will be the consequences of France &apos;s return to NATO &apos;s integrated military structure ? 
The Allies are quietly satisfied , but nobody expects major changes in France military contribution : in the last ten years , it has been on par with the other major European allies . 
The reason is simple : since France &apos;s return to the Military Committee in 1994 , its position within NATO has allowed for full participation in the Alliance &apos;s military and political activities . 
In Paris , the move has not in itself raised major political opposition for two main reasons . 
First , nobody disputes the obvious : since Charles de Gaulle &apos;s decision to withdraw from the military organization , more than 40 years ago , the Alliance and the world have changed profoundly . 
Today &apos;s global threats demand greater European as well as NATO solidarity , and the Alliance &apos;s successive enlargements mean that most EU members are now NATO members as well . 
Second , the whole notion of &quot; integration &quot; is completely different since de Gaulle &apos;s day . 
When the Warsaw Pact existed , NATO troops were positioned in such a way that any attack would collectively involve most of the allies . 
The whole Central Front was tightly coordinated , and even France was involved in NATO planning through a set of special agreements . 
The Cold War &apos;s end , and the subsequent transformation of NATO into an &quot; expeditionary alliance , &quot; has made &quot; integration &quot; largely irrelevant : each member &apos;s contribution to NATO operations is decided by individual NATO members ad hoc and on the basis of consensus . 
This profound change in NATO &apos;s role has been matched by a parallel rise in France &apos;s role within the Alliance . 
On the military level , it is worth recalling that France &apos;s participation in NATO-led operations has been quite high since the 1999 Kosovo campaign . 
On average , between 2,000 and 3,000 French soldiers have been involved at any given moment , making France either the third or fifth largest contributor , depending on the year . 
Of 12,000 French soldiers deployed abroad this year , roughly 30 % have been serving with NATO , with 2,000 troops in Kosovo and more than 3,000 in and around Afghanistan . 
Moreover , in Paris there is a widely shared view that complementarity between the European defense project and NATO is both a major challenge and a worthy goal . 
As French President Nicolas Sarkozy has put it , France &apos;s return to a full role in NATO should allay some of the fears expressed by members in Central Europe : the idea that France has been attempting to create an alternative to NATO through the European defense project is an old and stupid canard , but that has never prevented many from believing it . 
France shares the wide consensus among allies on the need to renovate the transatlantic relationship and of the Alliance itself . 
A new transatlantic relationship should involve both the Alliance and the European Union , making explicit reference to the further consolidation of the common European Security and Defense Policy . 
President George W. Bush &apos;s positive declaration about the ESDP at NATO &apos;s Bucharest summit in 2008 was a welcome sign that the dispute about whether NATO should continue to maintain a monopoly on European security issues is now behind us . 
NATO itself should also undertake a long-delayed transformation . 
So far , there has been more talk than action . 
Almost everyone recognizes that the present structure of NATO is obese and outdated . 
Given the national interests involved , it will continue to be a difficult process , but , given the pressures on military budgets , the political context has never been more favorable . 
France &apos;s new attitude toward NATO is therefore designed to be a contribution to achieving these twin objectives : it is a means to reforming the transatlantic relationship and NATO rather than an end in itself . 
France &apos;s own strategic approach stresses that its forces must adapt further to the new dimensions of military operations overseas and to asymmetric warfare . 
French forces will maintain a robust capacity for overseas military operations within the framework of NATO-led operations , but not exclusively so . 
Hence , the commitment undertaken in France &apos;s new military financial law to undertake major investments in force protection and intelligence , as well as recognition of the urgent need to close the gap between European forces on strategic transportation and tactical air mobility . 
This requires , despite the current economic crisis , maintaining substantial military investment and a much greater degree of intra-European cooperation . 
The ISAF mission in Afghanistan has more than confirmed the importance of better coordination of civilian and military activities in stabilization and reconstruction , an area where the EU has a major role to play , because it has already begun to develop the necessary tools . 
Therefore , there is no need for NATO to duplicate those functions ; instead , it must learn to cooperate more closely with them . 
All these changes are essential if we want to prevent NATO from gradually deteriorating into some kind of &quot; OSCE in uniform &quot; and eventually ending up as just another talking shop for Western democracies and like-minded countries .
