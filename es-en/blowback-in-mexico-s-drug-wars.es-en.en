Blowback in Mexico &apos;s Drug Wars 
MEXICO - Drug trafficking has existed in Mexico for decades . 
By that time , Mexican police institutions were in a state of decomposition , making them fertile ground for the drug traffickers to corrupt . 
And so they have . 
The dismantling of Colombia &apos;s Cali and Medellin cartels in the 1990 &quot; s created a vacuum that Mexico &apos;s cartels were able to fill , ultimately consolidating their position in the drug trade . 
Still , the levels of drug-related violence in Mexico remained relatively low . 
This &quot; dealers &quot; peace &quot; can be explained by the Mexican government &apos;s policy of tolerance , which sought a degree of equilibrium between the drug cartels and the state in terms of trafficking routes and the territories that the cartels infiltrated . 
This secret truce was maintained even after Mexico &apos;s first open democratic presidential election in 2000 , when the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party was ousted from power . 
Then former President Vicente Fox ordered a crackdown . 
As drug lords were arrested , the equilibrium between gangs was destroyed , paving the way to a war between the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels - the two largest - which has generated enormous violence , as well as sharp US protests because of the impact of the fighting along the border . 
When President Felipe Calderón took office in 2006 , he inherited rising violence , with drug traffickers controlling parts of the country . 
He responded by quickly launching a frontal assault on the cartels , with the support of the army . 
Calderón &apos;s offensive increased his popularity , but it also provoked a new rise in violence , as the drug gangs not only battled government forces , but also settled accounts among themselves . 
The US government complained again , but at the same time the Bush administration delivered a $ 1.4 billion aid package , the so-called &quot; Merida Initiative , &quot; to fight the traffickers . 
In 2008 , Mexico &apos;s government decided to attack the drug cartels &quot; operational nerve centers . 
But this only accelerated the gangs &quot; fragmentation , provoking a new and extraordinary increase in violence . 
Indeed , over 5,000 people were killed by organized drug criminals last year , more than double the death toll in 2007 . The violence has also become crueler . 
Since 2007 , many of the cartels &quot; victims have been decapitated - a tactic clearly aimed at intimidating their enemies . 
And , as the grotesqueness of the violence has grown , so has pressure for a more effective strategy . 
Some critics of Calderón &apos;s government now say that it is time to change strategy , perhaps even returning to the pre-Fox policy of tolerance . 
Nevertheless , public-opinion polls still show broad backing for Calderón &apos;s strategy . 
The government insists that drug-related violence is concentrated in just three of the country &apos;s 32 states , but the problem has spread to most of the country . 
Of course , most victims are traffickers . 
Ultimately , this may turn public opinion against Calderón &apos;s policy - a development that some drug trafficking groups are encouraging with anonymous posters , and by sponsoring popular protests in northern Mexico that demand the army &apos;s return to its barracks . 
But , at least in the short term , there seems to be no alternative to Calderón &apos;s strategy . 
After all , while his policy of confrontation has generated high levels of violence , tolerance of the drug cartels corrupted state institutions , sowing the ground for the problem in the first place . 
So it seems that the government &apos;s only option is to continue the war , hoping that its longer-term effort to strengthen state institutions &quot; capacity and integrity will eventually prove effective . 
But corruption remains a profound and persistent threat to this effort , and if the government cannot reduce it significantly - especially among its anti-drug forces - a return to tolerance is inevitable .
