Mexico Turns a Corner 
MEXICO CITY - Years of political squabbling and divided governments weakened state institutions in Mexico , greatly hampering their ability to meet their basic obligations to the country &apos;s citizens : to foster economic growth , to create well-paying jobs , to provide quality education and social services , and to guarantee public safety . 
But that has begun to change , thanks to a political innovation that has united Mexico &apos;s political leaders around a shared reform agenda . 
In 2012 , I campaigned for the presidency on a promise to transform Mexico into a more modern , dynamic , and competitive country , one that could compete and succeed in the twenty-first century . 
In order to achieve this , I proposed major structural reforms . 
Soon after a majority of Mexico &apos;s voters backed my candidacy at the ballot box , my team met with the leaders of the country &apos;s three main political forces to define a common reform agenda and a collaborative framework to realize it . 
The result was a political agreement on a clear and comprehensive action plan consisting of 95 points , now known as the &quot; Pact for Mexico . &quot; 
Among the Pact &apos;s provisions are major structural reforms that all parties agreed to support at the outset of the current administration . 
A package of education reforms , which Congress has already approved , will improve the quality of teaching and the formation of human capital throughout the country . 
Teachers will be assessed , schools will be managed with greater autonomy , and a commitment to academic excellence will become the backbone of the public education system . 
Equally important , telecommunications reforms will expand coverage , lower consumer prices , and improve the quality of services . 
By allowing more open markets and leveling the playing field , we seek to increase productivity and ensure that companies operating in Mexico have access to strategic inputs . 
As for financial reform , the Chamber of Deputies has already approved legislation ( soon to be taken up by the Senate ) that promises to foster economic growth and enhance financial inclusion . 
By enabling financial institutions to grant more loans at more favorable rates , small and medium-sized businesses will have the means to grow and prosper . 
Finally , the tax reform that Congress recently approved will guarantee sound public finances and promote growth by increasing public investment in infrastructure , education , research and development , and welfare services ( including universal pension and unemployment insurance ) . 
And yet , while the Pact for Mexico has led to important legislative developments , some key items on the agenda are still pending . 
The most important of these items - energy and political reforms - are currently under consideration in Congress . 
Indeed , reform in this sector of the economy is both desirable and necessary . 
Today , it is neither technically nor economically feasible for Mexico to take full advantage of its energy resources without legislative changes . 
Energy-sector reform is crucial if we want to strengthen energy security and increase our economy &apos;s productivity . 
Our new legislation , recently passed , allows for more private investment in the energy sector , while guaranteeing that Mexico maintains the property rights over its vast natural resources . 
I firmly believe that with the implementation of these structural reforms , Mexicans will be able to resolve the country &apos;s most pressing problems and build a more prosperous , inclusive , and productive country . 
The Pact for Mexico has already taught us the important lesson that national priorities and partisan loyalties are not mutually exclusive . 
Broad agreement on a bold reform package is possible . 
To be sure , as is true in any other democracy , elections will continue to be highly competitive ; but , despite our differences , the vast majority of Mexicans - regardless of their partisan loyalties - share an overriding desire to build a better future for Mexico . 
I hope other countries that struggle regularly with political paralysis can find similar roads to reform .
