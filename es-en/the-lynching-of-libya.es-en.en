The Lynching of Libya 
NEW YORK - Many would say that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi got what he deserved . 
Live by the sword , die by the sword . 
The Libyan tyrant happily allowed his opponents , or anyone who annoyed him , to be tortured or killed . 
So it seems only right that he died with summary violence . 
After being hunted down in a dirty drainpipe , he was displayed like a bloody trophy before being battered and shot by a lynch mob . 
And it happened in his hometown of Sirte . 
This is primitive justice , to be sure , but how else could justice be done to a mass murderer ? 
Yet there is something deeply disturbing about a lynching , regardless of the victim . 
Even as cheering crowds in Sirte and Tripoli were rejoicing at the despot &apos;s death , others voiced doubts over the manner of his humiliating end . 
The French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy , who had promoted the Libyan revolution with a strong dose of narcissistic showmanship , wrote that the lynching of Qaddafi &quot; polluted the essential morality &quot; of the people &apos;s rebellion . 
One might quibble with this description . 
As in all violent revolutions , the morality of the dictator &apos;s opponents was never entirely without blemish . 
The rebels , who reduced Qaddafi &apos;s birthplace to rubble , were in some cases as ruthlessly brutal as the men against whom they were fighting . 
But there is something else wrong with Lévy &apos;s critique . 
To talk about the pollution of morality is to miss the point . 
The problem with rough justice , in the form of revenge , is not that it is immoral . 
Many of us can see the appeal of the Old Testament principle of &quot; an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth . &quot; 
We want a person who made others suffer to suffer as well , preferably in equal measure . 
Justice almost always contains an element of revenge . 
The problem with revenge , however , is that it provokes further revenge , setting in motion a cycle of violence and counter-violence - the culture of vendetta . 
And vendetta is by definition not so much immoral , or even unjust , as it is lawless . 
It thrives in societies that are not bound by laws that apply equally to all , or even by any formal laws at all . 
Codes of honor are not the same as the rule of law . 
While the rule of law does not necessarily satisfy everyone &apos;s sense of justice , it does stop the cycle of violent retribution . 
The ancient Greeks understood this well . 
The greatest play about the tension between law and justice is Aeschylus &apos;s The Eumenides , a story of murder and vengeance in which the furies represent justice . 
They drive people to avenge terrible misdeeds , saying : &quot; We claim we represent true justice .... Blood avengers , always in pursuit , we chase them to the end . &quot; So it is that the furies help Orestes to wreak vengeance on his mother , Clytaemnestra , for killing his father , Agamemnon . 
Orestes murders her , thus continuing the cycle of violence . 
Athena , the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of Athens , decides that only a fair trial , with a jury of twelve men , can pacify the furies and restore peace . 
But trials are rarely perfect . 
In this case , the jury is evenly divided , forcing Athena to give the verdict , which is to acquit Orestes . 
This may not have served the rough justice demanded by the furies , but it established the rule of law , which civilized Athens . 
To be sure , Athenian democracy was not much like our modern democracies , nor is ancient Athens much like Tripoli today . 
Even so , The Eumenides holds an important lesson that remains valid : violence , unchecked by law , will not end . 
Revolutions born in bloodshed almost always create more bad blood . 
This was true 2,500 years ago , and it is true today . 
Few people have understood this better than the Polish democratic activist and thinker Adam Michnik , one of the heroes who in the 1980 &quot; s helped to end the Communist dictatorship in his country . 
While other Poles demanded vengeful rough justice against the Communist rulers and their accomplices , Michnik counseled negotiation , compromise , and reconciliation , even with former oppressors . 
Michnik admits that all revolutions are incomplete in the sense that not all sinners are punished , and not all virtuous people are rewarded . 
But , he says , that outcome would mean further violence : &quot; The compensation for suffered harm invariably brings new harm , often more cruel than what came before . &quot; 
This is why Qaddafi &apos;s lynching party is a dangerous omen for Libya . 
It would have been far better if he had been handed over alive to be judged in a court of law . 
A criminal trial in Libya might have been difficult . 
A 42-year dictatorship does not exactly provide fertile ground for the learning and experience needed to create an impartial court . 
And it is probably impossible for a former dictator &apos;s victims to judge him without prejudice . 
That is precisely why the International Criminal Court in The Hague was established . 
Putting Qaddafi on trial probably would not have satisfied every Libyan &apos;s feeling of injustice , but it might have helped to instill in Libyans greater respect for the rule of law . 
Perhaps a trial of Qaddafi &apos;s son , Saif al-Islam , will have this effect . 
If so , standing trial in The Hague would be the best service he could render to his country .
