Energizing Europe 
In France &apos;s pre-presidential electoral campaign , European affairs are mentioned or whispered , but almost never debated . 
France is mostly concerned with its own problems , particularly the supposed malfunctioning of its political class and the apparent laziness of the French public , which is blamed for weak economic growth , especially when compared to the United States . 
France needs a debate on European Union affairs , but only as long as it does not degenerate - as is common in Europe - into self-flagellation . 
But the germ of such a debate exists , and it sounds very different from that which dominated the failed constitutional referendum campaign in France two years ago . 
The operation of European institutions - the European Central Bank , the European Commission , and the Stability Pact - is facing severe criticism , but not in the name of a nostalgia for national sovereignty . 
Europe is not being rejected ; instead , the criticism has been in the spirit of improving European institutions in the name of the common good . 
Both of the major candidates for the French presidency , Ségolène Royal and Nicholas Sarkozy , have called for the creation of an economic government for the euro zone . 
Of course , such a &quot; government &quot; already exists in the form of the European Central Bank . 
But what is needed is an institutional framework that would establish greater political responsibility concerning the primary economic objectives that Europe should pursue - full employment and growth - and that would at least partly close the democratic deficit implied by the ECB &apos;s takeover of monetary policy from euro-zone states . 
A moment of seeming political disunity , such as exists today , may not seem the right one to initiate such a project . 
But , historically , Europe has succeeded when , at moments of danger , it has initiated irreversible processes that outweigh any other consideration . 
Europe &apos;s founding fathers understood this when they hatched the idea of creating the European Coal and Steel Community : encouraging old enemies to pool some of the most powerful tools of war under the pretext of advancing their economic interests was a strategy of rare intelligence . 
We now live in a similar moment of uncertainty and danger , and this time , too , there is a project , both economic and political , that can unite the Union : energy independence , a key factor in national sovereignty . 
Today , there is nothing on a pan-European scale that guarantees the responsibility of each member state to ensure the security of its future supplies . 
The European Commission is weary of trying to build a single energy market , which has required it to persuade governments that they must dismantle their existing monopoly operators - a prerequisite to competition . 
Although member states appear to have resigned themselves to this , they fervently resist other European firms taking control of their &quot; national champion &quot; companies . 
To be sure , governments cannot escape their responsibilities to their citizens , and only the most naïve technocrat believes that the market alone can ensure energy independence . 
At the same time , however , purely bilateral negotiations between individual EU members and oil- and gas-producing countries weakens the member states &quot; bargaining power , as well as undermining Europe &apos;s geopolitical weight in world affairs . 
Yet , fortunately , there is no need for resignation . 
There is an obvious solution , similar to the Coal and Steel Community implemented by our founding fathers : a European energy , environment , and research community ( E3RC ) . 
It is a mistake to believe that ecological concerns can be addressed only through negative growth . 
In fact , the opposite is true . 
New energy and environmental technologies will undoubtedly drive growth in the future . 
But only if research is doubled to create new energy-efficient technologies will we eventually consume less energy overall and more energy in an environmentally friendly way . 
The ecological disasters that today &apos;s economic activity has already produced and the catastrophic potential of those to come have at last brought home the fact that energy policy and environmental protection cannot be separated . 
As it is , the E3RC would pursue two directly related objectives : European energy independence , which would be helped by new energy and environmental technologies , and Europe &apos;s increased bargaining power in global markets . 
Its creation would also send out a new message to the European public : competition alone is not the only thing on Europe &apos;s horizon . 
Above all , the EU requires cooperation .
