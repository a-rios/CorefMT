Taking the Long View 
NEW YORK - The coming year will be a narrative of tension - a series of difficult choices between the imperatives of the present and those of tomorrow . 
How we resolve this tension will be the measure of our vision and our leadership . 
As a community of nations , we face three immediate tests in the coming year . 
The first has just begun . 
Not the global financial crisis , important as it is . 
I am speaking , here , about climate change , the one truly existential threat . 
We have only 12 short months until a key summit in Copenhagen , where world leaders will gather next December to reach an agreement to curb global warming . 
We need a deal that will extend , deepen , and strengthen the Kyoto Protocols . 
We need a new treaty for the twenty-first century that is balanced , inclusive , and comprehensive - one that all nations can embrace . 
We took an important step in early December in Poznan , Poland , where climate ministers and experts met to hammer out a work plan toward the future . 
The negotiations were difficult . 
Some argued that , amid our current difficulties , we cannot afford to tackle climate change . 
I say we cannot afford not to . 
The future of the planet is at stake . 
Our second test is economic . 
Clearly , we need a global stimulus . 
Major economies have responded to the current crisis with ambitious fiscal and monetary rescue plans . 
The emergency G-20 summit in Washington in November showed that governments are working together to coordinate policies . 
Those efforts were broadened at a more recent meeting in Doha . 
All of this is welcome . 
Above all , we need to think boldly and freshly . 
If we are to spend our way out of the financial crisis , we should be smart about it . 
They must be sustainable , so that we are not merely throwing money at problems but , instead , are using those funds to lay the foundations of a more stable and prosperous future . 
China has shown leadership . 
Fully one-third of its recently announced $ 586 billion economic stimulus program will be channeled into green growth and infrastructure . 
The Chinese have seized an opportunity to address several challenges at once - to create jobs , conserve energy , and combat climate change . 
The United States under President Barack Obama plans to do the same . 
These policymakers know that investment in alternative fuels and eco-friendly technologies will deliver a massive future pay-off in terms of a safer environment , energy independence , and sustainable growth . 
But they also know that green investment can produce jobs and spur growth in the here and now . 
We will never usher in an era of sustainable prosperity in the absence of a big , global push , with all nations moving in the same direction . 
If ever there were a time for bold and ambitious vision - a chance to chart a new and better path - it is now . 
Our third test is a matter of pragmatic principle . 
Indeed , they compound other threats : food insecurity , volatile energy and commodity markets , and the terrible persistence of poverty . 
No nation has been spared . 
If not handled correctly , today &apos;s financial crisis will become tomorrow &apos;s human crisis . 
Social unrest and political instability will grow , exacerbating all other problems . 
The danger , ultimately , is a cascading series of crises , each building on the others , with potentially devastating consequences for all . 
During the coming year , therefore , we must act in a spirit of global solidarity . 
Measures we take to deal with the financial crisis must be in the interests of all nations - the poorest as well as the rich and powerful . 
Aid programs for developing nations should be considered a part of any global stimulus and long-term economic recovery plan . 
At the very least , that means not using the financial crisis as an excuse to reduce international aid and development assistance . 
We must honor our commitments under the Millennium Development Goals as a pragmatic as well as a moral responsibility . 
We stand on the threshold of a new multilateralism . 
The pendulum of history is swinging back toward the United Nations and collective action . 
The challenges we face as a community of nations today are increasingly those of collaboration and cooperation : fighting climate change , rebuilding the global financial system , and promoting sustainable development . 
In this interconnected world , the challenge is to see the nexus among these three sets of problems . 
But it will take leadership to translate that vision into action , just as it will take leadership to balance our larger long-term interests against the fierce urgencies of now .
