A Return to Reason 
COPENHAGEN - Common sense was an early loser in the scorching battle over the reality of man-made global warming . 
For nearly 20 years , one group of activists argued - in the face of ever-mounting evidence - that global warming was a fabrication . 
Their opponents , meanwhile , exaggerated the phenomenon &apos;s likely impact - and , as a consequence , dogmatically fixated on drastic , short-term carbon cuts as the only solution , despite overwhelming evidence that such cuts would be cripplingly expensive and woefully ineffective . 
This scientific pie fight , characterized by juvenile name-calling , ignoble tactics , and intellectual intransigence on both sides , not only left the public confused and scared ; it undermined the efforts of the most important organizations working on advancing the science of climate change . 
Almost inevitably , at international summits from Kyoto to Copenhagen , governments failed to take any meaningful action on global warming . 
Fortunately , there finally seems to be a growing number of influential scientists , economists , and politicians who represent a more sensible approach to the issue . 
As I argued in my 2007 book Cool It , the most rational response to global warming is to make alternative energy technologies so cheap that the whole world can afford them . 
In broad strokes , this requires a deliberate and significant boost to research and development spending . 
Based on recent work by Isabel Galiana and Chris Green of McGill University , I advocate expenditure totaling around 0.2 % of global GDP - roughly $ 100 billion a year . 
Of course , no fix to global warming will work overnight . 
At the same time , we should explore the practicality of climate engineering , which we may need to buy more time for a smooth transition away from fossil fuels . 
Acknowledging that man-made climate change is real , but arguing that carbon cuts are not the answer , amounts to staking out a middle ground in the global warming debate - which means being attacked from both sides . 
For so-called &quot; alarmists , &quot; pointing out what &apos;s wrong with drastic carbon cuts is somehow tantamount to denying the reality of climate change , while so-called &quot; deniers &quot; lambast anyone who accepts the scientific evidence supporting this &quot; mythical &quot; problem . 
Nevertheless , there are encouraging signs that the minority of sensible voices in this debate are beginning to get the attention they deserve . 
In mid-2009 , as part of a project by the Copenhagen Consensus Center to assess different responses to global warming , Green and Galiana performed a cost-benefit analysis of R D spending on green technologies . 
Green , a long-time proponent of a technology-led response to global warming , demonstrated the effectiveness of a policy of government investment in R D aimed at developing new low-carbon technologies , making current technologies cheaper and more effective , and expanding energy-related infrastructure such as smart grids . 
As Green and Galiana bluntly noted , &quot; No approach to climate stabilization will work without an energy technology revolution . &quot; 
Another academic who has advocated a smarter response to global warming is Roger Pielke , Jr. of the University of Colorado , the author of this year &apos;s must-read global-warming book The Climate Fix . 
Along with Green , Pielke was one of 14 noted academics who co-wrote February &apos;s &quot; Hartwell Paper , &quot; commissioned by the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford . 
The paper made the case for developing alternatives to fossil fuels , ensuring that economic development doesn &apos;t wreak environmental havoc , and recognizing the importance of adaptation to climate change . 
In the US , we witnessed an equally promising development in the climate debate just last month , when the conservative American Enterprise Institute , the liberal Brookings Institution , and the centrist Breakthrough Institute teamed up to publish a report that called for revamping America &apos;s energy system with the aim of making clean energy cheap . 
Entitled &quot; Post-Partisan Power , &quot; the report comprehensively and convincingly argues that the US government should invest roughly $ 25 billion per year ( about 0.2 % of America &apos;s GDP ) in low-carbon military procurement , R D , and a new network of university-private sector innovation hubs to create an &quot; energy revolution . &quot; 
This sensible proposal predictably drew fire from committed &quot; alarmists &quot; and &quot; deniers . &quot; 
But , promisingly - and surprisingly , given the somewhat toxic state of US politics - it attracted broad support and intelligent commentary from many mainstream pundits . 
Adding to the swell of voices , November will see the documentary film based on my book &quot; Cool It &quot; released in the US . 
It is too early to suggest that politicians might make real progress toward implementing genuinely effective policies on climate change . 
But , given the dearth of common sense in recent years , the mere fact that a growing chorus of reasonable voices can now be heard is nothing short of miraculous .
