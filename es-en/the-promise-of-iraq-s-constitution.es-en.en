The Promise of Iraq &apos;s Constitution 
The constitutional process now under way in Iraq represents a hopeful milestone for all Iraqis . 
After decades of successively imposed constitutions , an elected assembly has overseen the process of drafting a new permanent constitution , and the draft text will be voted on by ordinary Iraqis on October 15 . 
Much of the current talk about the draft &apos;s various provisions thus misses the point . 
Regardless of whether the referendum succeeds or fails , and regardless of the details of the constitutional text , what is most important is the establishment of constitutional processes and institutions in Iraq , before and after the referendum . 
Concerning the pre-referendum phase , the National Assembly largely succeeded in this task . 
Although Iraq &apos;s interim constitution gave the Assembly exclusive control over the drafting process , the Assembly wisely reached out beyond its membership in creating a constitutional drafting committee . 
Iraqi leaders were well aware of the decreased participation in the election by a significant portion of Iraq &apos;s multi-ethnic and multi-confessional mosaic , particularly the Sunni community . 
Accordingly , they sought out those who were under-represented in the Assembly , but whose sense of participation in and ownership of the process was essential , not merely to the constitutional exercise , but to binding the nation &apos;s wounds . 
This was no mere gesture . 
Reaching out was an important component of establishing the rule of law , and it also sent a message that Iraq had truly turned a corner - that no single party sought to dominate Iraq . 
This was an important signal that those elected to the National Assembly understood that democracy does not mean merely the will of the majority . 
Instead , all Iraqis were allowed to participate in the process , and , though consensus was not ultimately reached , that , too , was a part of the democratization process . 
In the end , Iraq &apos;s voters will decide whether this is a constitution under which they wish to be governed for the foreseeable future . 
Those who chose not to participate in last January &apos;s elections will most certainly do so now , both in the referendum and in the upcoming elections to a new Assembly in December . 
A second important feature of the drafting process was the extent to which the National Assembly complied with the requirements of Iraq &apos;s interim constitution , the Transitional Administrative Law ( TAL ) . 
At the time of the transfer of authority in June of 2004 , many pundits predicted that an elected National Assembly would ignore an interim constitution drafted by an unelected Governing Council and promulgated by an occupying authority . 
Yet that did not happen . 
The TAL set a rigorous schedule for the Assembly to complete an initial constitutional draft , and the Assembly essentially abided by those limits . 
The deadline extension that it passed was in keeping with both the spirit and the letter of the TAL . 
At long last , it can be said that an Iraqi legislature understood that it was constrained by constitutional principals and the rule of law . 
The test for institution building , however , will come once a constitution has been approved and a new government installed . 
Regardless of who wins the elections , there will be temptations to tinker with the constitutional text . 
Such temptations are understandable , and need not be animated by improper motives . 
However , given the little weight given to constitutions in Iraq &apos;s modern history , it is likely that the political class will leave the text alone . 
Barring some compelling need , the calculus might well arise that it is more important to abide by the constitution for some time - and to be seen to be abiding by it - than it is even to improve its provisions . 
Changes can always be proposed after a decent interval passes . 
It goes without saying that it will be essential to establish that governance in Iraq is institutional , not personal . 
The American administration was absolutely right to resist the call to turn Iraq over to a caudillo , as some wanted . 
Iraq &apos;s salvation from the nightmare that it endured over the previous 35 years lies not in any one man ; indeed , reliance on &quot; one man &quot; was the central ingredient in Saddamist rule . 
Here again , Iraq &apos;s immediate past history allows one to be optimistic . 
The Iraqi Governing Council was not dominated by any single member , and Iraq &apos;s subsequent governments have also operated collegially . 
Giving life to constitutionally defined political institutions is far more important to the course of Iraq &apos;s immediate future than the specific provisions that the constitution contains . 
That has been the missing ingredient , not only in Iraq , but also in other countries ruled by despots . 
Constitutions frequently enshrine lofty principals , and nobly assure protection of fundamental rights . 
The question is whether those guarantees are given meaning on the ground . 
If the immediate past is a guide , one has reason for optimism in Iraq .
