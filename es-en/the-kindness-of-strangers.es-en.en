The Kindness of Strangers 
NEW HAVEN - I admit that it is an unusual way to see the world , but , when reading the newspaper , I am constantly struck by the extent of human kindness . 
The newest bit of good news comes from The Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College , which estimates that Americans will give about $ 250 billion in individual charitable contributions in 2010 , up several billion from last year . 
People donate their blood to strangers , travel on humanitarian missions to places such as Haiti and the Sudan , and risk their lives to fight injustice elsewhere . 
And New Yorkers have grown accustomed to reading about subway heroes - brave souls who leap onto the tracks to rescue fallen commuters and then often slip away , uncomfortable with attention or credit . 
As a psychologist , I am fascinated by the origin and consequences of such kindness . 
Some of our moral sentiments and moral motivations are the product of biological evolution . 
This accounts for why we are often kind to our own flesh and blood - those who share our genes . 
It also can explain our moral attachments to those we see as members of our immediate tribe . 
There is an adaptive logic to being kind to those with whom we continually interact ; we scratch their backs , they scratch ours . 
But there is no Darwinian payoff to sacrificing our resources to anonymous strangers , particularly those in faraway lands . 
The explanation for our expanded morality comes from intelligence , imagination , and culture . 
One powerful force is the use of language to tell stories . 
These can motivate us to think of distant people as if they were friends and family . 
The vicarious experiences generated by Greek tragedies , televised sitcoms , and newspaper stories have all played an important role in expanding the scope of moral concern . 
Another factor is the spread of ideologies , both secular and religious , that encourage us to care for distant others , that persuade us to expand our kindness beyond our immediate circle . 
Even the much-maligned force of capitalism might make us nicer . 
A recent study of 15 diverse populations , reported in the journal Science , found that the societies that treat anonymous strangers most fairly are those with market economies . 
As Robert Wright has emphasized , as people become increasingly inter-dependent , the scope of moral concern expands accordingly . 
Nobody would argue that we are losing the distinction between those who are close to us and distant strangers . 
I can &apos;t imagine that this would ever happen . 
An individual who didn &apos;t distinguish between his or her own child and an unknown child in a faraway land - who felt the same love and the same obligation toward both - would hardly be human anymore . 
What has happened , though , is that the distinction between &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them &quot; is not as sharp as it used to be . 
The effects of our kindness are not zero-sum . 
Those who receive charity have their lives improved , but those who provide it also benefit . 
It feels good to be good . 
Indeed , one recent study found that spending money on others is more rewarding than spending it on oneself . 
It &apos;s not just short-term pleasure : those who donate wealth and time to others tend to be a lot happier in their entire lives than those who do not . 
The paradoxical finding here is that one great trick to being happy is to forget about being happy and instead try to increase the happiness of others . 
All is not sweetness and light , though ; morality is more than compassion and charity . 
As moral creatures , we are driven to enforce justice . 
Experimental economists have found that people will sacrifice their own resources to punish cheaters and free riders , and will do this even to anonymous strangers that they will never again interact with - a behavior dubbed &quot; altruistic punishment . &quot; 
There is a pleasure to this as well . 
Just as giving to someone in need elicits a positive neural response , so does taking from someone who deserves it . 
This is the flip side of charity . 
We are motivated to be kind to anonymous others , but we are also motivated to harm those who treat these anonymous others badly . 
This can drive our powerful impulse to deal with distant evils through sanctions , bombings , and war . 
We want these wrongdoers to suffer . 
The problem that arises is that our gut moral feelings are poorly attuned to consequences . 
The patterns of charitable donation to foreign countries often have more to do with the salience of news reports than to actual considerations about where the money is most needed . 
It is not difficult to see the consequences of this in the real world . 
The extension of human morality is a wonderful development for humanity , but it would be even better if it were tempered by cold-blooded rationality .
