Democracy in Inaction at the World Bank 
James Wolfensohn , the president of the World Bank , has announced his intention to leave , and the search is on for a new head of the world &apos;s most important multilateral organization promoting development . 
The choice is especially important now , when poverty in the Third World is finally being recognized as our greatest problem and challenge . 
The World Bank &apos;s designation as a &quot; bank &quot; understates its importance and its multifaceted roles . 
It does lend money to countries to undertake a variety of projects , and to help them through crises ( such as the $ 10 billion it provided to Korea in 1997-1998 ) . 
It has been , and is , playing a vital role in post-conflict reconstruction around the world . 
But the Bank also provides grants and low-interest loans to the poorest countries , particularly for education and health , and advises these countries on development strategies . 
It has often joined with the IMF in strong-arming countries into accepting this &quot; advice &quot; : unless they do , they will not only be cut off by the IMF and the World Bank , but also by other donors , and capital markets will be discouraged from providing funds . 
Sometimes - its critics will say often - the advice provided by the IMF and World Bank is misguided . 
This was certainly true in the 1980 &quot; s and early 1990 &quot; s , when right-wing ideology dominated , producing a one-size-fits-all prescription entailing privatization , liberalization , and macroeconomic stability ( meaning price stability ) , with little attention to employment , equity , or the environment . 
The term &quot; bank &quot; is a misnomer in a second sense : while the World Bank refers to its members as &quot; shareholders , &quot; it is hardly a private bank . 
On the contrary , the World Bank is a global public institution . 
Indeed , the entire process of choosing these international institutions &quot; leaders is a historical anachronism that undermines their effectiveness and makes a mockery of the G-7 countries &quot; commitment to democracy . 
This process , established at the outset 60 years ago , is framed by an agreement that an American would lead the World Bank and a European would lead the IMF . 
The American president would choose the Bank &apos;s head , and Europe would collectively decide on the IMF leader , with the understanding that the other side would exercise its veto only if a candidate were totally unacceptable . 
Within the United States , all major presidential appointments must be ratified by the Senate ; even if rejections are rare , the vetting process is important , for the president knows that he can go only so far . 
But the presidency of the World Bank is a rare presidential plum - an appointment that is not subject even to Congressional hearings . 
How can advice on democratic reforms be taken seriously when the multilateral institutions that offer it do not subscribe to the same standards of openness , transparency , and participation that they advocate ? 
Why should the search for Wolfensohn &apos;s successor be limited to an American ( and especially an American loyal to a particular political party ) ? 
Why is the search process going on behind closed doors ? 
Shouldn &apos;t these international public institutions be looking for the best-qualified person , regardless of race , religion , gender , or nationality ? 
The two names that have been floated so far Â­ - presumably leaked as trial balloons - are particularly disturbing . 
To put it bluntly , given the World Bank &apos;s importance , consideration of either putative US candidate , Assistant Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz or former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carleton Fiorina , have been highly controversial around the world . 
Even if convention allows the American president to appoint the World Bank &apos;s head , the organization &apos;s success depends on the confidence of others . 
Neither Wolfowitz nor Fiorina have any training or experience in economic development or financial markets . 
Of course , some past appointees turned out to be far better than anticipated ; they rose to the occasion , despite qualifications that , in any open and objective selection process , would never even have left them on the short list . 
They proved that there is always a chance of outperforming . 
There are some absolutely first-rate individuals who could step into the job , people who have shown their command of economic development , their intellect and personal integrity , and their political and managerial skills . 
Such potential candidates include former Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo , a Yale Ph.D. who now teaches there and has been strongly supported in an editorial in the Financial Times ; 
Arminio Fraga , a Princeton Ph.D. and former head of Brazil &apos;s central bank ; and Kemal Dervis , a former World Bank vice-president who has taught at Princeton and successfully managed one of Turkey &apos;s crises as finance minister . 
Why should the world settle for anything less than candidates of this caliber ? 
It is time that the G-7 countries back up their democratic rhetoric with action . 
Many stood up to the US as it pushed for the war in Iraq . 
They were right to be skeptical about US claims of an imminent danger from weapons of mass destruction . 
What is at stake here is no less important : the lives and well being of billions in the Third World depend on a global war on poverty . 
Choosing the right general in that war will not assure victory , but choosing the wrong one surely enhances the chances of failure .
