Iraqi Hope Dies Last 
BAGHDAD - Ten years have passed since Saddam Hussein was removed from power , following more than three decades of tyrannical rule . 
The dream of Iraqis after Saddam &apos;s fall was to build a new , prosperous , and democratic Iraq . 
A country at peace with itself and its neighbors , with a constitution upholding basic human rights and the rule of law , was the desire of almost everyone . 
But the United States and its allies , lacking a coherent vision of Iraq &apos;s future , much less a sound policy for the post-Saddam era , declared Iraq an occupied country , with a US-appointed administrator to run the country , who soon decided to dismantle all existing security , military , and media institutions . 
He also introduced a de-Baathification law , which evicted members of the Baath Party from official positions without legal recourse , paving the way for sectarianism and , ultimately , communal violence and unrest . 
These unfortunate - and ultimately disastrous - events established an unstable foundation in a strategic country at the core of a highly troubled yet vital region of the world . 
As Iraq moved through progressive phases of mismanagement over the subsequent ten agonizing years , the country fractured , shattering the dreams of Iraqis who saw their beloved homeland once again sliding toward authoritarianism , with almost daily violations of the constitution . 
The world watched , seemingly helpless to do anything . 
Iraq &apos;s last general election , in 2010 , brought hope of recovery in the form of a power-sharing agreement among Sunni , Shia , and Kurds , which was supposed to ensure that the country did not revert to dictatorship . 
Iraqiya , which I lead , was the largest electoral bloc to emerge from that vote . 
But , despite our status , we agreed to give up the leadership position afforded by the Constitution in the belief that power-sharing and respect for the rights of all Iraqis is the only formula for governing the country democratically . 
These hopes , however , soon vanished , as Iraq &apos;s two-term prime minister , Nouri al-Maliki , subsequently reneged on the agreement . 
Today , the very human rights that were guaranteed by the constitution are being violated , with a politicized judiciary routinely abused and manipulated in order to justify the prime minister &apos;s actions . 
Instead of keeping the Maliki government in check , the courts facilitate its quest for ever-greater power . 
Making matters worse for ordinary Iraqis , public services have deteriorated to a dismal level , and unemployment is rising sharply , despite public expenditure in excess of $ 500 billion over the seven years of Maliki &apos;s rule . 
Sectarianism and racism have become a regular feature of the political landscape . 
Corruption is rampant , and Baghdad is now considered one of the world &apos;s worst places to live . 
If Iraq continues along its current disastrous path , mayhem and civil war will be the inevitable outcome , with dire consequences for the entire region . 
Yet Iraqis continue to hope for a better future . 
The advent of a new electoral cycle , which begins with local elections in April , may provide another opportunity to put Iraq on the right path . 
But that can happen only if the voting is free and the counting is fair . 
The current government , however , is unable to supervise free and fair elections . 
Significant measures must be taken , including the active involvement of neutral international agencies and observers to keep the government in check and ensure that voters can have their say . 
We are hopeful that Iraqis , who have had their fill of sectarian political parties , will be allowed freely to choose candidates who embrace a non-sectarian and non-racist agenda . 
Given a new law limiting senior officials to two terms in office , we also hope to see new and accountable leaders in positions of power . 
I am certain that power-sharing , reconciliation , and accountability are the only way forward for Iraq . 
Let us hope that this spring - ten years after the US invasion and Saddam &apos;s downfall - brings Iraq a new and constructive beginning .
