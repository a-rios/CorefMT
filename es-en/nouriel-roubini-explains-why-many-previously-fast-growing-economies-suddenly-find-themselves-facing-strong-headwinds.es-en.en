The Trouble with Emerging Markets 
LAGOS - The financial turmoil that hit emerging-market economies last spring , following the US Federal Reserve &apos;s &quot; taper tantrum &quot; over its quantitative-easing ( QE ) policy , has returned with a vengeance . 
This time , the trigger was a confluence of several events : a currency crisis in Argentina , where the authorities stopped intervening in the forex markets to prevent the loss of foreign reserves ; weaker economic data from China ; and persistent political uncertainty and unrest in Turkey , Ukraine , and Thailand . 
This mini perfect storm in emerging markets was soon transmitted , via international investors &quot; risk aversion , to advanced economies &quot; stock markets . 
The list includes India , Indonesia , Brazil , Turkey , and South Africa - dubbed the &quot; Fragile Five , &quot; because all have twin fiscal and current-account deficits , falling growth rates , above-target inflation , and political uncertainty from upcoming legislative and / or presidential elections this year . 
Political and / or electoral risk can be found in all of them , loose fiscal policy in many of them , and rising external imbalances and sovereign risk in some of them . 
Then , there are the over-hyped BRICS countries , now falling back to reality . 
Three of them ( Brazil , Russia , and South Africa ) will grow more slowly than the United States this year , with real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP rising at less than 2.5 % , while the economies of the other two ( China and India ) are slowing sharply . 
Indeed , Brazil , India , and South Africa are members of the Fragile Five , and demographic decline in China and Russia will undermine both countries &quot; potential growth . 
The largest of the BRICS , China , faces additional risk stemming from a credit-fueled investment boom , with excessive borrowing by local governments , state-owned enterprises , and real-estate firms severely weakening the asset portfolios of banks and shadow banks . 
Most credit bubbles this large have ended up causing a hard economic landing , and China &apos;s economy is unlikely to escape unscathed , particularly as reforms to rebalance growth from high savings and fixed investment to private consumption are likely to be implemented too slowly , given the powerful interests aligned against them . 
Moreover , the deep causes of last year &apos;s turmoil in emerging markets have not disappeared . 
For starters , the risk of a hard landing in China poses a serious threat to emerging Asia , commodity exporters around the world , and even advanced economies . 
At the same time , the Fed &apos;s tapering of its long-term asset purchases has begun in earnest , with interest rates set to rise . 
As a result , the capital that flowed to emerging markets in the years of high liquidity and low yields in advanced economies is now fleeing many countries where easy money caused fiscal , monetary , and credit policies to become too lax . 
Another deep cause of current volatility is that the commodity super-cycle is over . 
This is not just because China is slowing ; years of high prices have led to investment in new capacity and an increase in the supply of many commodities . 
Meanwhile , emerging-market commodity exporters failed to take advantage of the windfall and implement market-oriented structural reforms in the last decade ; on the contrary , many of them embraced state capitalism , giving too large a role to state-owned enterprises and banks . 
These risks will not wane anytime soon . 
Chinese growth is unlikely to accelerate and lift commodity prices ; the Fed has increased the pace of its QE tapering ; structural reforms are not likely until after elections ; and incumbent governments have been similarly wary of the growth-depressing effects of tightening fiscal , monetary , and credit policies . 
Indeed , the failure of many emerging-market governments to tighten macroeconomic policy sufficiently has led to another round of currency depreciation , which risks feeding into higher inflation and jeopardizing these countries ability to finance twin fiscal and external deficits . 
Nonetheless , the threat of a full-fledged currency , sovereign-debt , and banking crisis remains low , even in the Fragile Five , for several reasons . 
All have flexible exchange rates , a large war chest of reserves to shield against a run on their currencies and banks , and fewer currency mismatches ( for example , heavy foreign-currency borrowing to finance investment in local-currency assets ) . 
Many also have sounder banking systems , while their public and private debt ratios , though rising , are still low , with little risk of insolvency . 
Over time , optimism about emerging markets is probably correct . 
Many have sound macroeconomic , financial , and policy fundamentals . 
Moreover , some of the medium-term fundamentals for most emerging markets , including the fragile ones , remain strong : urbanization , industrialization , catch-up growth from low per capita income , a demographic dividend , the emergence of a more stable middle class , the rise of a consumer society , and the opportunities for faster output gains once structural reforms are implemented . 
So it is not fair to lump all emerging markets into one basket ; differentiation is needed . 
But the short-run policy tradeoffs that many of these countries face - damned if they tighten monetary and fiscal policy fast enough , and damned if they do not - remain ugly . 
The external risks and internal macroeconomic and structural vulnerabilities that they face will continue to cloud their immediate outlook . 
The next year or two will be a bumpy ride for many emerging markets , before more stable and market-oriented governments implement sounder policies .
