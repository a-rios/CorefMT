Turning Point at Chernobyl 
The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl 20 years ago this month , even more than my launch of perestroika , was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later . 
Indeed , the Chernobyl catastrophe was an historic turning point : there was the era before the disaster , and there is the very different era that has followed . 
The very morning of the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear station on April 26 , 1986 , the Politburo met to discuss the situation , and then organized a government commission to deal with the consequences . 
The commission was to control the situation , and to ensure that serious measures were taken , particularly in regard to people &apos;s health in the disaster zone . 
Moreover , the Academy of Science established a group of leading scientists , who were immediately dispatched to the Chernobyl region . 
The Politburo did not immediately have appropriate and complete information that would have reflected the situation after the explosion . 
Nevertheless , it was the general consensus of the Politburo that we should openly deliver the information upon receiving it . 
This would be in the spirit of the Glasnost policy that was by then already established in the Soviet Union . 
Thus , claims that the Politburo engaged in concealment of information about the disaster is far from the truth . 
One reason I believe that there was no deliberate deception is that , when the governmental commission visited the scene right after the disaster and stayed overnight in Polesie , near Chernobyl , its members all had dinner with regular food and water , and they moved about without respirators , like everybody else who worked there . 
If the local administration or the scientists knew the real impact of the disaster , they would not have risked doing this . 
In fact , nobody knew the truth , and that is why all our attempts to receive full information about the extent of the catastrophe were in vain . 
We initially believed that the main impact of the explosion would be in Ukraine , but Belarus , to the northwest , was hit even worse , and then Poland and Sweden suffered the consequences . 
Of course , the world first learned of the Chernobyl disaster from Swedish scientists , creating the impression that we were hiding something . 
But in truth we had nothing to hide , as we simply had no information for a day and a half . 
Only a few days later , we learned that what happened was not a simple accident , but a genuine nuclear catastrophe - an explosion of a Chernobyl &apos;s fourth reactor . 
Although the first report on Chernobyl appeared in Pravda on April 28 , the situation was far from clear . 
For example , when the reactor blew up , the fire was immediately put out with water , which only worsened the situation as nuclear particles began spreading through the atmosphere . 
Meanwhile we were still able to take measures in helping people within the disaster zone ; they were evacuated , and more than 200 medical organizations were involved in testing the population for radiation poisoning . 
There was a serious danger that the contents of the nuclear reactor would seep into the soil , and then leak into the Dnepr river , thus endangering the population of Kiev and other cities along the riverbanks . 
Therefore , we started the job of protecting the river banks , initiating a total deactivation of the Chernobyl plant . 
The resources of a huge country were mobilized to control the devastation , including work to prepare the sarcophagus that would encase the fourth reactor . 
The Chernobyl disaster , more than anything else , opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression , to the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue . 
It made absolutely clear how important it was to continue the policy of glasnost , and I must say that I started to think about time in terms of pre-Chernobyl and post-Chernobyl . 
The price of the Chernobyl catastrophe was overwhelming , not only in human terms , but also economically . 
Even today , the legacy of Chernobyl affects the economies of Russia , Ukraine , and Belarus . 
Some even suggest that the economic price for the USSR was so high that it stopped the arms race , as I could not keep building arms while paying to clean up Chernobyl . 
My declaration of January 15 , 1986 , is well known around the world . 
I addressed arms reduction , including nuclear arms , and I proposed that by the year 2000 no country should have atomic weapons . 
I personally felt a moral responsibility to end the arms race . 
But Chernobyl opened my eyes like nothing else : it showed the horrible consequences of nuclear power , even when it is used for non-military purposes . 
One could now imagine much more clearly what might happen if a nuclear bomb exploded . 
According to scientific experts , one SS-18 rocket could contain a hundred Chernobyls . 
Unfortunately , the problem of nuclear arms is still very serious today . 
Countries that have them - the members of the so-called &quot; nuclear club &quot; - are in no hurry to get rid of them . 
On the contrary , they continue to refine their arsenals , while countries without nuclear weapons want them , believing that the nuclear club &apos;s monopoly is a threat to the world peace . 
The twentieth anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe reminds us that we should not forget the horrible lesson taught to the world in 1986 . 
We should do everything in our power to make all nuclear facilities safe and secure . 
We should also start seriously working on the production of the alternative sources of energy . 
The fact that world leaders now increasingly talk about this imperative suggests that the lesson of Chernobyl is finally being understood .
