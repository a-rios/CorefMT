How Musharraf Survives 
The devastating Kashmir earthquake is once again testing the skills of one of the world &apos;s great political survivors . 
General Pervez Musharraf , president of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , has few friends and many enemies . 
Pakistan &apos;s major political parties oppose him . 
For the religious right and the mullahs , he is an agent of America , the great Satan , and has thus betrayed the cause of Islam . 
Somewhere out there , gunning for Musharraf , are Islamic militants furious at being dumped after they fought his covert wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir . 
Many in Musharraf &apos;s own army despise him for the same reason . 
For Pakistan &apos;s small and embattled liberal and left-wing forces , he is yet another military dictator who seized and holds power by force , undermining the development of democracy . 
So how does Musharraf survive ? 
In large part , he can thank 9 / 11 . 
Faced by a United States bent upon bloody vengeance , Pakistan &apos;s military establishment scurried to join the US-led coalition and take up arms against its own creation , the Taliban . 
Only a few senior officers with an Islamic bent resisted this straightforward betrayal . 
They were soon marginalized , drawing praise from Washington . 
With US help , an economy that had nearly run aground was suddenly righted by a wave of international aid and loan write-offs . 
Even more important was a decision , taken in the hope of choking off funds to extremist groups , to require all expatriate Pakistani earnings to be remitted through official banking channels . 
In a curious way , nuclear weapons also are crucial to Musharraf &apos;s survival , for they create conditions that distract Pakistan &apos;s highly ideological army from its objective of war with India . 
The dispute over Kashmir had occupied the minds of military planners throughout Pakistan &apos;s history , and war had been the raison d &apos;etre for maintaining the world &apos;s eighth-largest standing army . 
But nukes , a belief in deterrence , and the growing realization that Kashmir is a lost cause , have freed the army from the hard life of the trenches . 
Ideology is increasingly irrelevant as the officer class scrambles to build vast personal fortunes . 
A look at Pakistan &apos;s economic landscape says it all . 
The CEO &apos;s of many , if not most corporations , public and private , are retired military officers - many fairly young . 
The military owns airlines and freight companies , petrochemical factories , power generation plants , sugar mills , cement and fertilizer plants , construction firms , banks and insurance companies , advertising agencies , and more . 
Vast tracts of prime real estate in cities , sold to officers for a pittance , have turned into mega housing developments . 
Musharraf defends the military acquisitions , claiming that they are economically efficient , and angrily dismisses criticism as the ranting of unpatriotic Pakistani pseudo-intellectuals . 
But they are &quot; efficient &quot; only in the sense that they dampen the threat to Musharraf posed by the military . 
No so Pakistan &apos;s Islamists , however , whom Musharraf infuriated yet again last month , when he ordered his foreign minister to initiate the first official contact with Israel . 
But the Islamists &quot; call for nationwide protests flopped . 
The military , after decades of rule , has dismantled all forms of political organization - parties , trade unions , and student associations - leaving a Pakistani society immobilized , apathetic , and incapable of articulating its preferences . 
As Islamists &quot; anger at Musharraf &apos;s betrayals increases , so does his global standing and image as a world statesman . 
Scenes of wild-eyed mullahs demonstrating in the streets of Pakistani cities are a boon to his position . 
Surely the Pakistani public needs to be tamed by a strongman . 
No harm if it is an army general . 
But the truth is more complex . 
Musharraf flits effortlessly between personae . 
At one moment he is the &quot; responsible &quot; world leader who speaks charmingly to the international media about moderate Islam ; at the next , he is the cunning conspirator who rigs elections , destroys political opponents , breaks promises on relinquishing power , enters into mutually beneficial relationships with mullahs , and castigates human-rights activists as &quot; Westernized fringe elements &quot; that &quot; are as bad as the Islamic extremists . &quot; 
To forestall the possibility of a coup , the army is being cleansed of hardline Islamists . 
Soldiers charged with mutiny have received the death penalty . 
This process has deepened pro- and anti- US divisions within the army , both among commissioned and non-commissioned officers , but nothing in Pakistan today suggests that radical change is imminent . 
To be sure , more incidents of global terrorism associated with Pakistan , such as July &apos;s London bombings , will bring new pressures . 
The US and Europe will make their usual demands to close down the country &apos;s hate-spewing madrassas , and to reform a public-school system that , unhindered by the government , churns out young militants burning to kill and die for Islam . 
For Musharraf , this means that continuing to hunt with the hounds and run with the hares might get harder . 
But the current constellation of forces suggests that , barring unforeseen developments , his survival instincts will serve him well for years to come .
