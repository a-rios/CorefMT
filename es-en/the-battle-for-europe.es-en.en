The Battle for Europe 
The European summit in Brussels this weekend was intended to equip the European Union with a constitution that would enable it to handle the challenges posed by the admission of ten new member states next spring . 
Instead , the summit &apos;s breakdown may be an advance warning that this enlargement could prove to be so disruptive as to lead , not to a benign transformation of the EU , but to its radical dislocation . 
On past precedent , the odds ought to be against any dramatic disaster . 
The EU has confronted many political crises in the past , some much more severe than this one . 
On every previous occasion , member states preferred compromise to rupture . 
Chances are they will do so again . 
Indeed , downplaying the gravity of the latest crisis is easy : one can argue that the immediate cause of the breakdown , when examined closely , is not really all that serious . 
The crux of the problem is that the draft Constitution would give the EU a new and much simpler method of taking majority votes in the Council of Ministers . 
Under the method adopted three years ago at the EU &apos;s Nice summit , each member state has a certain number of votes , weighted according to population , but small countries are protected by having proportionally more votes than big countries . 
This system is known as Qualified Majority Vote . 
A majority decision requires 50 % of the member states , about 72 % of their weighted votes , and 62 % of the EU &apos;s total population . 
The proposed new system would do away with weighted votes . 
Member states would each have one vote , and a majority decision would require 50 % of the member states and 60 % of the population of the EU . 
This new system is simpler and more comprehensible ; arguably , it is also more democratic . 
But in arithmetic terms it is less favourable to the smaller countries , since they lose their weighting advantage . 
It is much less favourable to Spain and Poland , since the weighting they received at Nice is almost as great as that of Germany , even though heir population are only half as large . 
This was the trigger for Saturday &apos;s breakdown : Spain and Poland refused to surrender the voting privileges they received at Nice . 
But if this were the real reason for the breakdown , one would expect it to be resolved by detailed haggling over the voting arrangements . 
But it seems probable that the argument over majority voting rules is really a stalking horse for deeper differences about the future of the EU . 
One ( unstated ) difference is about money . 
The Poles claim - self-righteously - that they are representing not their own national interest , but that of all the smaller member states . 
The facts tell a different story . 
Two-thirds of the EU budget goes to agriculture and the development of poor regions . 
Spain , together with Portugal , Greece , and Ireland , has been an enormous beneficiary of the budget on both counts ; and Poland , another poor country , wishes to join the gravy train . 
Everyone knows that reform of the farm policy is overdue by several decades ; and reform means cutting farm subsidies . 
But reform won &apos;t happen without the right majority in the Council of Ministers . 
So obviously Spain and Poland do not want to give up their voting privileges there . 
But the more serious differences are political . 
What kind of EU do the member states - present and future - want ? 
In the long run , do they want something approaching a federal Union ? 
Or do they want a free-trade area based on some form of inter-governmental arrangement ? 
These questions have become much more acute with the impending mega-enlargement , partly because of the sheer weight of numbers of newcomers , but mainly because the central European accession countries are essentially strangers to the learning process of integration that the existing members have gone through these past 50 years . 
Moreover , that learning process has been seriously contaminated . 
In 1950 , when the EU was born , the political dilemma was comparatively simple . 
So was its solution : the large member states - France , Germany , and Italy - accepted some common decision-making , because they believed they were still independent nation states . 
The three small Benelux member states - Netherlands , Belgium , and Luxemburg - accepted common decision-making , because they believed that this would maximise their national interests . 
Over the years , they continued to believe , logically if paradoxically , that the small countries could best safeguard their interests by submitting to the logic of majority voting . 
The 10 new EU members do not have the same history as the Netherlands , Belgium , and Luxembourg . 
The problem is not just that they are economically less developed , or that their political institutions are inadequate and corrupt . 
The real problem for the EU is that there is no sign that the 10 new members have any desire to learn the same lessons , because they do not agree with the old members about the real purpose of the European enterprise . 
But do the old members really agree about the real purpose of the European enterprise ? 
Unfortunately , they do not - not since the British joined 30 years ago . 
The British have long resisted European integration . 
Tony Blair says he wants Britain to be at the center of Europe . 
This is just talk : Tony Blair has not the faintest idea about what the center of Europe means . 
The question is : do the new member states want a more politically integrated Europe ? 
Or do they in fact want a free-trade Europe politically subservient to the United States ? 
These are the real questions posed by Sunday &apos;s breakdown of the constitutional negotiations in Brussels .
