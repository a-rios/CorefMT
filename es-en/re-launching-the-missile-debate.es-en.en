Re-Launching the Missile Debate 
WASHINGTON , DC  -  
Persistent differences with Poland over its conditions for accepting defensive interceptor missiles have led American officials to hint that they might consider Lithuania as an alternative deployment site . 
This shift appears aimed at pressuring Poland into showing greater flexibility in the negotiations , but the idea of America establishing military bases in a country that was once part of the Soviet Union has raised the Kremlin &apos;s ire . 
In June , the chief US negotiator on the issue , John Rood , flew to Lithuania to brief its government on the status of the Polish-American negotiations . 
America is seeking to deploy ten interceptor missiles in Poland and an advanced missile defense radar station in the Czech Republic . 
This week Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Prague to sign an agreement with the Czechs , the Polish-American talks , however , remain stalemated . 
Although the US State Department has declined to characterize Rood &apos;s discussions in Vilnius as formal negotiations over a possible alternative site , the Department of Defense acknowledged that America was considering other options should the talks with Poland remain deadlocked . 
Lithuanian Defense Minister Juozas Olekas , while affirming that he expected Poland and America to reach a deal , added that , &quot; Lithuania would consider the possibility of participating in the anti-missile shield if asked . 
We should consider all the pluses and minuses . &quot; 
Two factors have impeded consummation of a Polish-American agreement . 
Polish officials want compensation in the form of US-funded military modernization and other measures designed to ensure that Poland &apos;s security does not suffer because of the deployments . 
Indeed , Russian officials have hinted at serious retaliation should Poland accept the interceptors . 
For the past few months , American officials have offered proposals designed to assuage Russian security concerns about the planned ballistic missile defenses ( BMD ) . 
The envisaged confidence-building measures aim to increase the transparency of operations at the base to the Russian government and to limit any theoretical threat the systems might pose to Russia &apos;s own missile arsenal . 
At his April 2008 summit with President Bush in Sochi , then-Russian President Vladimir Putin praised what he uncharacteristically described as sincere American efforts to meet Russia &apos;s security concerns . 
Putin told the media that , &quot; certainly , in principle , adequate measures of confidence-building and transparency can be found . &quot; 
But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently said that the Russian-US dialogue on the confidence-building measures &quot; has stalled . &quot; 
Precise details concerning what the Americans are offering remain unclear , but Russian and US sources have revealed their basic content . 
America has proposed that Russian personnel could , with the host governments &quot; approval , conduct detailed inspections at the bases . 
In addition , US officials have offered not to put the systems into operation until Iran demonstrates the capacity to attack Europe with ballistic missiles . 
Finally , American officials have indicated they would accept limits on the scale of the BMD systems deployed in Russia &apos;s vicinity in order to avoid threatening to overwhelm Russia &apos;s own ballistic missile arsenal . 
Translating these concepts into operational arms-control limits has proven challenging . 
For starters , Russia &apos;s role in determining whether Iran is capable of threatening Europe with missile attacks , which would justify activating the missile interceptors in Poland , remains unclear . 
The two sides have differed for years about whether Iran presents a genuine threat to NATO &apos;s security . 
Russian analysts have long accused the Americans of exaggerating Iranian capabilities to justify stationing BMD systems in Europe that really aim to counter Russia &apos;s own nuclear deterrent . 
American officials insist they will not give Russia the right to veto the operations of Western missile defenses . 
In addition , Putin and other Russian officials are demanding that Russia receive a permanent presence at the BMD facilities to monitor their operations . 
Lavrov has publicly stated that Russia would insist on having a permanent military presence at the planned BMD sites in Poland and the Czech Republic in order to monitor events at the facilities &quot; second-by-second . &quot; 
Czech and Polish leaders , recalling past periods of Russian and Soviet occupation , categorically reject hosting a permanent Russian presence . 
A day after the Sochi summit , Poland &apos;s deputy foreign minister , Witold Waszczykowski , warned that a &quot; Russian presence in Poland is out of the question . 
Such a solution had been resorted to in the past and will not be repeated . &quot; 
On June 5 , Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski reaffirmed that Poland was prepared to allow Russian government representatives &quot; regular access to the bases for inspections &quot; but not the &quot; permanent presence &quot; sought by Moscow . 
In the past , the Czech Republic and Poland also sought reciprocation from the Kremlin , but Russian officials have dismissed as &quot; ridiculous &quot; the idea of granting Czech or Polish representatives &quot; access to Russian defense sites , even for short-term inspections , and the Czechs and Poles appear to have dropped the idea . 
Even so , what steps the US might take to overcome Russian fears about a BMD breakout - in which America would rapidly increase the capacity of its missile defenses around Russia - also remains uncertain . 
For example , it is unclear where any limits might apply , how long they might last , and whether they might restrict the joint BMD research and development programs the US is conducting with foreign allies such as Australia , Israel , and Japan . 
Moreover , it is unclear how these measures would be enforced . 
The Bush administration shuns overly rigid arms agreements , which could constrain US flexibility in responding rapidly to emerging threats . 
In recent arms-control negotiations , however , Russian policymakers have rejected informal arrangements , insisting that the US negotiate formal , legally binding treaties . 
Not unreasonably , Russian leaders worry that a future Czech , Polish , Lithuanian , or American government might simply decide to stop enforcing any informal understandings , confronting Russia with a fait accompli .
