China &apos;s Slave Power 
When a government-run brick plant in Hongdong County of Shanxi Province was revealed to be using slave labor , a famous episode from a Beijing opera flashed through my mind . 
In that opera , a prostitute named Su San , after being sentenced to death , pleads for mercy to unconcerned passersby as she is marched down the main roads of Hongdong County in shackles . 
As I click on the Web site of the county government , there is no mention of slave labor or child workers at the brick factory . 
All you can find are newsreaders from national television covering the smiling faces of people who come back to Hongdong to seek their roots and pay homage to their ancestors . 
There are also reports of visits by high officials to Hongdong . 
Indeed , were it not for the 400 fathers who petitioned for the rescue of their kidnapped children who had been sold into slavery , Hongdong County would still remain a tourism hot spot for Chinese people seeking their roots . 
As a result of the slave-labor brick plants , as well as reports of an eight-year-old child worker being buried alive and migrant workers killed , Hongdong &apos;s name has become infamous . 
Yet despite the scandal , migrant workers and children in school uniforms are still being abducted from other provinces and pushed into monstrous brick plants and coalmines . 
Girls are forced into prostitution at a mere $ 5 a session . 
The 400 fathers of the enslaved children , of course , are left to wonder where , precisely , respect for life is in President Hu Jintao &apos;s so-called &quot; harmonious society . &quot; 
How many more Chinese children will become slaves in the maw of our capitalist / communist system ? 
Who is responsible when such crimes happen ? 
These men simply want their children back , but all the government is doing is watching these anxious fathers with suspicion . 
Moreover , these fathers are allowed to demand only their children , not compensation . 
After all , the brick factory bosses paid 400 Yuan for each child , so their property rights are at stake . 
China is now a society rotten to the core . 
For slavery is not confined to Hongdong &apos;s brick plants . 
There are such dark spots everywhere in the country . 
What makes matters worse is that the state authorities , particularly the police , patrol these slave operations to keep them running . 
Four years ago , a college graduate named Sun Zhigang was arrested for walking on the streets of the city of Guangzhou . 
He was beaten to death while in custody . 
This incident revealed the extent to which the police cooperated in turning ordinary Chinese into slaves . 
Media coverage fueled a backlash of overwhelming public revulsion . 
But change went only skin-deep . 
Human trafficking was transferred from the police to job agencies and the Ministry of Labor Supervision . 
State officials themselves are among the worst human traffickers . 
And the grimmest statistic of all is that many child slaves who are rescued are resold by officials to another slave-labor plant . 
Seven years ago , a lawmaker from Hunan province went to Shanxi province to rescue slave workers from brick plants . 
At that time , the rescued workers knelt down and wept . 
Fortunately , they were not beaten or buried alive for not showing up for their shift , as has happened to others . 
Today , however , that legislator would not be able to rescue a single worker , because the local government and police have learned from past experience how to keep busybodies away . 
There are more than 1,000 brick plants and coalmines around China , and most are under the protection of corrupt officials . 
Hu Wenhai , a brave man from Shanxi who killed two corrupt officials , said before his execution , &quot; Officials are forcing people to rebel . 
I can &apos;t let these assholes squeeze people any more . 
I know I &apos;m going to die , but my death will get the attention of those officials . &quot; 
So , instead of China being convulsed with rage at news that children are being turned into slaves , the media are censored and the 400 parents of the Hongdong children are blacklisted by the government . 
They cannot leave their homes to find their children . 
It seems today that in China the daily work of government is to keep people from protecting themselves and their families in an attempt to gloss over the crimes of a &quot; harmonious society . &quot; 
The socialism established by Mao Zedong has been replaced by a thoroughly cynical creed . 
Organized criminals lead much of the country &apos;s economic development . 
The former paradise of the poor has become a living hell for them . 
And the corrupt officials ? 
You can be sure that , this time next year , they will be paying homage to their ancestors , as they tramp over the ground where child slaves were buried alive for daring to proclaim their humanity .
