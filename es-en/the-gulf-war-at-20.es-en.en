The Gulf War at 20 
NEW YORK - It was 20 years ago this month that Saddam Hussein , then the unchallenged ruler of Iraq , invaded Kuwait . 
What ensued was the first great international crisis of the post-Cold War era , one that , in less than a year , led to the liberation of Kuwait , along with the restoration of its government . 
This was accomplished with only modest human and economic cost to the extraordinary multi-national coalition assembled by President George H.W. Bush . 
Since then , the United States has used military force numerous times for a range of purposes . 
Today , the US is working to extricate itself from a second conflict involving Iraq , trying to figure out a way forward in Afghanistan , and contemplating the use of force against Iran . 
So the question naturally arises : what can we learn from the first Iraq war , one widely judged as a military and diplomatic success ? 
One important lesson stems from the rationale for war . 
It is one thing to modify the behavior of a state beyond its borders , but quite another to alter what takes place within another country &apos;s territory . 
The 1990-1991 Gulf war was about reversing Iraq &apos;s armed aggression , something that was fundamentally inconsistent with respect for sovereignty , the most basic of all rules governing relations among states in today &apos;s world . 
Once Iraqi military forces were expelled from Kuwait in 1991 , the US did not march on Baghdad to replace Iraq &apos;s government - or remain in Kuwait to impose democracy there . 
The 2001 war against Afghanistan and the 2003 war against Iraq were markedly different . 
Both interventions sought to oust the governments in place at the time , and both succeeded in that goal . 
I maintain that the effort against Afghanistan was justified ( to remove the Taliban government that helped bring about the 9 / 11 attacks ) , and that ousting Saddam Hussein was not . 
But , regardless of one &apos;s position on these questions , it cannot be disputed that replacing a government with something better and lasting is a different and much more ambitious goal than changing a government &apos;s behavior . 
Successful regime change requires a long-term commitment of military force , of civilian experts trained to build a modern society , and of money and attention - and even then there is no assurance that the results will justify the investment . 
Another set of lessons from the first Iraq war ( and the second as well ) suggests a limit to what can be expected from economic sanctions . 
Sanctions alone , even those supported by the United Nations Security Council and backed by military force , could not persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait , control of which was a major prize for him . 
Nor could sanctions trigger a change in government in Baghdad . 
Indeed , over time their ability to bring results diminished . 
A third set of lessons concerns international support . 
The participation of many governments not only distributes the costs of going to war , but also lends legitimacy to the enterprise . 
Multilateral backing can help sustain domestic approval , or at least tolerance , in the US and other countries , including the one where the hostilities are taking place . 
So what do these lessons tell us about how to move forward in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Iran ? 
In the case of Iraq , President Barack Obama has repeated his pledge to end all US combat operations by the end of August , and to withdraw all US military forces by the end of next year . 
But , judging by Iraqi politicians &quot; inability to form a new government months after national elections , their failure to provide essential services , and , above all , the continuing deadly violence , nation-building in Iraq is far from complete . 
The Obama administration may want to reconsider its commitment to leave and , instead , negotiate a new accord ( one that would allow as many as 20,000 US troops to stay in Iraq for years to come ) if and when a new Iraqi government emerges . 
In Afghanistan , the lessons revolve around the nature of what is being sought . 
History suggests that the US ought to think twice before continuing its effort to remake Afghan society or its government . 
Instead , the US would be wiser to limit itself to a narrower counterterrorism mission , one akin to what is being done in Somalia and Yemen ( and , to some extent , in Pakistan ) . 
In the case of Iran , the first Iraq war teaches us that economic sanctions will likely not be enough to persuade the Revolutionary Guards ( who increasingly dominate the country ) to accept verifiable limits on their nuclear program . 
Sanctions may , however , persuade some other powerful constituencies within Iran , namely the clerics , the businessmen of the bazaar , and political conservatives , to turn on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his Revolutionary Guard base . 
But , if not , the question of whether to use military force to slow the development of an Iranian nuclear weapon will come to the fore . 
Only a few governments , at most , will support doing so . 
No one can predict or assume what a limited attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear installations would accomplish , cost , or lead to . 
But not acting , in effect accepting Iran &apos;s nuclear might , risks bringing about a more dangerous and possibly costlier future . 
As a result , it is Iran , even more than Iraq or Afghanistan , where the lessons of the Gulf war are likely to be debated and , ultimately , applied .
