Physics Confidential 
PRINCETON - Each February , I begin the introductory electricity and magnetism course at Princeton University by telling my students that the material we will cover during the semester provides the basis for modern civilization . 
Who could quibble with such an innocent statement ? 
Without the discoveries of nineteenth-century physicists and their successors , we could hardly imagine today &apos;s world : no electrical power grid , no televisions , no satellites , no iPads . 
Physicists are justly proud of the many ways that their achievements have benefited humankind . 
But building a light bulb or a telephone doesn &apos;t mean that you understand its basic principles ( Thomas Edison and Alexander Bell certainly didn &apos;t ) . 
Unfortunately , many of my colleagues - particularly those who write textbooks - present physics as a towering , seamless basilica , ignoring the gaps in our hodge-podge of skewed models . 
In fact , what is presented as a shimmering cathedral often more closely resembles a hastily erected shantytown . 
For example , one needs only first-semester equations to describe reasonably well the behavior of a gyroscope ; engineers can then go off and build gyrocompasses that guide aircraft or missiles to their destinations . 
But if you merely ask , &quot; At what , exactly , is the gyroscope pointed ? &quot; you are plunged headlong into one of physics &quot; deepest questions , one that led Einstein to develop his general theory of relativity - and that , even today , has no definitive answer . 
I know of no undergraduate textbook that acknowledges the question . 
On a more blatant , if less exalted , level , the force of friction makes its appearance in the first days of any first-year course . 
We declare , as if there can be no doubt , that friction impedes the motion between two bodies , and we invoke sophisticated microscopic models that show how the soles of running shoes bind to a track . 
Yet friction produces heat and thus an increase in entropy - which measures the amount of energy that cannot be used to perform work - and it therefore distinguishes past from future . 
The increase in entropy - the second law of thermodynamics - is the only law of nature that makes this fundamental distinction . 
If Newtonian mechanics is at the bottom of everything , then one should be able to derive the second law of thermodynamics from Newtonian physics . 
But this has never been accomplished satisfactorily : the incompatibility of the second law with the other fundamental laws is perhaps the greatest paradox in all of physics . 
Still , we brazenly drop this enigma into the first days of a first-year course without batting an eye . 
We write down equations that show how friction slows the motion of sliding objects or dampens the vibrations in springs , but , ultimately , the math merely reproduces our observations while disguising our ignorance of what underlies them . 
After decades - indeed , centuries - of employing such tricks , physicists have forgotten that they are modeling phenomena , not necessarily uncovering Divine Truth . 
For instance , we can easily write down the equations for a ball on a swinging spring , but if we stretch the spring enough and swing the ball hard enough , we can &apos;t solve those equations . 
The motion becomes chaotic , making an exact mathematical solution impossible . 
Nowadays , with computers , we can approximate the trajectory as closely as we want . 
But that is the point : most physicists and students have lost sight of the distinction between the approximate and the exact . 
We can certainly learn something about chaotic systems without actually solving the equations , but if an old-fashioned mathematician demanded that a student predict where that ball was heading , the student would inevitably fail . 
Even something as fundamental as Newton &apos;s law of gravity is ultimately an approximation . 
Textbook authors dutifully write down the famous law without remarking that it results in infinite forces when the two attracting objects get infinitely close together . 
Never mind that infinite forces are a sure sign that your theory has gone up in smoke : in the current crop of textbooks sitting on my desk , not one mentions the obvious pathology . 
Our Princeton text compounds the oversight by declaring that , &quot; strictly speaking &quot; Newton &apos;s law of gravity is valid only for particles . 
Well , particles are exactly where Newton goes awry - and not just in first-semester physics . 
The basic equation of electricity is &quot; Coulomb &apos;s law , &quot; which governs the electrical attraction or repulsion between charged particles and looks exactly like Newton &apos;s law of gravity . 
Now , we always tell students to imagine electrons as point particles , in which case they really do need to worry about those infinite forces . 
The problems that arise from modeling particles as vanishingly small points infect all advanced areas of physics . 
Central to any quantum mechanics course is the concept of electron &quot; spin , &quot; but what , exactly , is spinning is never made clear . 
Wolfgang Pauli , one of the concept &apos;s originators , at first rejected the idea , because if the electron has a finite radius , then the surface would be spinning faster than the speed of light . 
On the other hand , if you view the electron as a point particle , how are you to imagine something without a radius spinning ? 
To cure the point-particle pathologies , physicists invented modern field theories , with impressive names such as quantum electrodynamics . 
But these theories turned out to be as riddled with infinities as their grandparents , and elaborate ad hoc schemes were invented to deal with the new problems encountered . 
And so , despite headline-grabbing advances such as string theory , it goes to this very day . 
One can hardly challenge the predictive success of modern physics , but one should remember that one is describing nature , and not always understanding it .
