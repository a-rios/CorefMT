The Chaotic Birth of South Sudan 
MADRID - The Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) that was reached in 2005 between mostly Christian southern Sudan and the country &apos;s Muslim North , ended one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern times . 
Lasting 22 years , that war left more than two million dead . 
Now the CPA is poised to face its most vital test : the South &apos;s referendum on independence , scheduled for January 9 . 
Whether or not a new state is born in one of the most strategically sensitive areas of the world is of utmost concern to Sudan &apos;s neighbors and others . 
Vital issues are at stake : the scramble for oil ; 
The fact that Omar al-Bashir , Sudan &apos;s president , is not especially keen to agree to the United Nations &quot; plan to beef up its peacekeeping force in the country ahead of the referendum raises concern about his intentions . 
He would certainly be happy to delay the vote - and , if it is held , to dispute its legitimacy . 
He might not find that very difficult . 
Preparations for the referendum are lagging and inadequate . 
Brinkmanship and broken agreements threaten to turn the referendum &apos;s technical and political difficulties into yet another disaster for the country . 
The 2.5 million Southern Sudanese known to live in the North are under explicit instructions by the South &apos;s Sudan People &apos;s Liberation Army to boycott the referendum , as the SPLA has grounds to believe that Bashir would use their registration to rig the results in favor of unity . 
Indeed , if not convincingly deterred by the international community , it is extremely difficult to believe that Bashir would let the South secede without a fight . 
A crucial bone of contention that might ignite a new war is the future of the country &apos;s oil industry and the North-South border demarcation . 
So far , the good offices of the Norwegian government have failed to produce an agreement on the key question of the post-independence distribution of oil revenues between North and South . 
Given that most of Sudan &apos;s oil wealth is concentrated in the South , the management of the oil industry and its revenues after secession is an existential problem for Bashir &apos;s regime and its capacity to control his vast and ethnically diverse country . 
It is in the oil-rich border areas that a new war might erupt . 
As one of the poorest and neediest countries in the world , for which oil revenues would be the only source of income for years to come , an independent South Sudan could not be expected to rescue the debt-ridden North . 
Its own challenge lies in reforming the entire oil industry , which for years has been brutally and irresponsibly exploited by Chinese and Malaysian companies , with devastating environmental consequences . 
Conspicuously , Bashir &apos;s regime has been disqualified in the eyes of its neighbors in Africa and the Arab world to a degree that makes the South &apos;s secession a more acceptable option to the main regional stakeholders than ever before . 
Indeed , the Arab world as a whole seems to have given up on Bashir . 
Some Arab leaders still toy with the idea that overthrowing him might yet salvage a united Sudan , but it is probably too late for that . 
After failing to moderate Bashir into accepting a secular decentralized or confederate Sudan , Egypt , a key Arab player concerned about the stability of its southern border , has come to accept the inevitability of secession - so long as the new state lines up with it on the issue of the Nile &apos;s waters . 
Egypt &apos;s fears are mainly of Sudan &apos;s disintegration into a chaotic tapestry of mini-states controlled by warlords and plunged into lawlessness and bloody tribal feuds . 
In that case , what remains of &quot; Sudan &quot; - Khartoum , Gezira , and the two northern states - might degenerate even further , probably turning into a base for global Islamic terrorism . 
Black Africa , particularly the East African Community , cannot think of any solution other than secession . 
To EAC members , this is a matter of de-colonization , for southern Sudan &apos;s people have been enslaved , dehumanized , and humiliated for centuries by the Arabs . 
Hence , as the Kenyans put it , the border between northern and southern Sudan should become the border between Black Africa and the Arab World . 
Concerned by Bashir &apos;s delaying tactics , both Kenya and Uganda have advised their southern Sudanese friends not to make demarcation of the border a pre-condition for the referendum , as doing so would only play into Bashir &apos;s hands . 
United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rightly defined the upcoming referendum as a &quot; ticking time bomb . &quot; 
She also made it clear , however , that the outcome , independence for the South , is &quot; inevitable . &quot; 
But , to avoid a cataclysm , the US and its allies must defuse the bomb by enforcing the provisions of the 2005 CPA , which they all endorsed . 
They would have virtually all of the regional stakeholders on their side as well .
