The Uncertain Future of Central Bank Supremacy 
NEWPORT BEACH - History is full of people and institutions that rose to positions of supremacy only to come crashing down . 
In most cases , hubris - a sense of invincibility fed by uncontested power - was their undoing . 
In other cases , however , both the rise and the fall stemmed more from the unwarranted expectations of those around them . 
Over the last few years , the central banks of the largest advanced economies have assumed a quasi-dominant policymaking position . 
In 2008 , they were called upon to fix financial-market dysfunction before it tipped the world into Great Depression II . 
In the five years since then , they have taken on greater responsibility for delivering a growing list of economic and financial outcomes . 
The more responsibilities central banks have acquired , the greater the expectations for what they can achieve , especially with regard to the much-sought-after trifecta of greater financial stability , faster economic growth , and more buoyant job creation . 
And governments that once resented central banks &quot; power are now happy to have them compensate for their own economic-governance shortfalls - so much so that some legislatures seem to feel empowered to lapse repeatedly into irresponsible behavior . 
Advanced-country central banks never aspired to their current position ; they got there because , at every stage , the alternatives seemed to imply a worse outcome for society . 
Indeed , central banks &quot; assumption of additional responsibilities has been motivated less by a desire for greater power than by a sense of moral obligation , and most central bankers are only reluctantly embracing their new role and visibility . 
With other policymaking entities sidelined by an unusual degree of domestic and regional political polarization , advanced-country central banks felt obliged to act on their greater operational autonomy and relative political independence . 
At every stage , their hope was to buy time for other policymakers to get their act together , only to find themselves forced to look for ways to buy even more time . 
Central banks were among the first to warn that their ability to compensate for others &quot; inaction is neither endless nor risk-free . 
They acknowledged early on that they were using imperfect and untested tools . 
And they have repeatedly cautioned that the longer they remain in their current position , the greater the risk that their good work will be associated with mounting collateral damage and unintended consequences . 
The trouble is that few outsiders seem to be listening , much less preparing to confront the eventual limits of central-bank effectiveness . 
As a result , they risk aggravating the potential challenges . 
This is particularly true of those policymaking entities that possess much better tools for addressing advanced economies &quot; growth and employment problems . 
Rather than use the opportunity provided by central banks &quot; unconventional monetary policies to respond effectively , too many of them have slipped into an essentially dormant mode of inaction and denial . 
In the United States , for the fifth year in a row , Congress has yet to pass a full-fledged budget , let alone dealt with the economy &apos;s growth and employment headwinds . 
In the eurozone , fiscal integration and pro-growth regional initiatives have essentially stalled , as have banking initiatives that are outside the direct purview of the European Central Bank . 
Even Japan is a question mark , though it was a change of government that pushed the central bank to exceed ( in relative terms ) the Federal Reserve &apos;s own unconventional balance-sheet operations . 
Markets , too , have fallen into a state of relative complacency . 
Comforted by the notion of a &quot; central-bank put , &quot; many investors have been willing to &quot; look through &quot; countries &quot; unbalanced economic policies , as well as the severe political polarization that now prevails in some of them . 
The result is financial risk-taking that exceeds what would be warranted strictly by underlying fundamentals - a phenomenon that has been turbocharged by the short-term nature of incentive structures and the lucrative market opportunities afforded until now by central banks &quot; assurance of generous liquidity conditions . 
By contrast , non-financial companies seem to take a more nuanced approach to central banks &quot; role . 
Central banks &quot; mystique , enigmatic policy instruments , and virtually unconstrained access to the printing press undoubtedly captivate some . 
Others , particularly large corporates , appear more skeptical . 
Doubting the multi-year sustainability of current economic policy , they are holding back on long-term investments and , instead , opting for higher self-insurance . 
Of course , all problems would quickly disappear if central banks were to succeed in delivering a durable economic recovery : sustained rapid growth , strong job creation , stable financial conditions , and more inclusive prosperity . 
But central banks cannot do it alone . 
Their inevitably imperfect measures need to be supplemented by more timely and comprehensive responses by other policymaking entities - and that , in turn , requires much more constructive national , regional , and global political paradigms . 
Having been pushed into an abnormal position of policy supremacy , central banks - and those who have become dependent on their ultra-activist policymaking - would be well advised to consider what may lie ahead and what to do now to minimize related risks . 
Based on current trends , central banks &quot; reputation increasingly will be in the hands of outsiders - feuding politicians , other ( less-responsive ) policymaking entities , and markets that have over-estimated the monetary authorities &quot; power . 
Pushed into an unenviable position , advanced-country central banks are risking more than their standing in society . 
They are also putting on the line their political independence and the hard-won credibility needed to influence private-sector behavior . 
It is in no one &apos;s interest to see these critical institutions come crashing down .
