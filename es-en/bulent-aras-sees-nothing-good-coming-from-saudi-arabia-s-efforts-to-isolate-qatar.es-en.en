The Gulf States &quot; Widening Gulf 
ISTANBUL - President Barack Obama is arriving in Saudi Arabia at a critical moment for the country . 
Its recent decision to withdraw its ambassador from Qatar has revealed the gravity of the crisis in the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) , composed of the Kingdom &apos;s most immediate neighbors . 
Indeed , Gulf politics is shifting toward a new balance in the wake of the Saudi-UAE rapprochement and the recent attempt to isolate Qatar . 
The UAE and Bahrain have joined Saudi Arabia in downgrading relations with Qatar . 
This is an unusual move , considering the Gulf states &quot; tradition of treating political disagreements as a family matter , to be handled behind the scenes . 
Oman is keeping its distance from the situation , while Kuwait has attempted to mediate between Saudi Arabia and Qatar . 
Several factors are driving Saudi Arabia &apos;s moves against Qatar , which include a ban prohibiting Saudi intellectuals from contributing to Qatari newspapers . 
There is Qatar &apos;s support for the Muslim Brotherhood ( in Egypt and elsewhere ) ; the speeches by the Islamic theologian Yusuf al-Qardawi and the broadcasting policy of Qatar-funded Al Jazeera since the Arab Spring ; and the credence given to the view that Qatar is hosting Western institutions with the intent of orchestrating a coup in the Kingdom . 
That view reflects Saudi Arabia &apos;s tough stance against the Muslim Brotherhood , which it has declared a terrorist organization . 
The Kingdom perceives the Brotherhood &apos;s influence in Arab countries , particularly the Gulf states , as a serious threat to its internal stability and survival . 
The voluntary abdication by Qatar &apos;s Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani in June 2013 , and his replacement as Emir by his son Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani , failed to satisfy Saudi expectations of change in Qatari foreign policy . 
And now the Kingdom has made it clear that it has reached the limits of its patience . 
But Saudi Arabia &apos;s attitude toward Qatar may generate some difficulties for its own policy . 
There is considerable transnational movement of goods and services , and billions of dollars of cross-border investment , across the Gulf - economic activity that would be endangered by the GCC &apos;s further disintegration . 
The Muslim Brotherhood is not a violent organization , and it has not engaged in illegal activities in the Gulf countries . 
Other GCC states , eager to avoid escalating political tensions in their own countries , are unlikely to declare it a terrorist organization . 
Even Saudi Arabia &apos;s special relationship with Jordan will not push its government to adopt such a declaration . 
For the time being , harsh policies toward the Muslim Brotherhood are likely to be confined to Egypt and Saudi Arabia . 
The problem for the Kingdom is that simply &quot; correcting &quot; the Qatari position cannot change the political trajectory within the region - particularly in Syria and Egypt . 
Moreover , Saudi Arabia &apos;s imposition of its preferred policies on the GCC , together with the possibility of sanctions on Qatar , risks jeopardizing all that the GCC ( which already has fallen into political decline in the wake of the Arab Spring ) has achieved over the past 33 years . 
Although Qatar &apos;s rulers are concerned about the Kingdom &apos;s growing antipathy toward them , they have shown no indications of submitting to Saudi demands that they change course . 
Moreover , given the impact on regional geopolitics of the recent interim nuclear deal between Iran and the West , Saudi Arabia &apos;s alienation of its neighbors is all the more hazardous . 
Making matters worse , it is clear that disagreements within the GCC can no longer be resolved behind closed doors , and that member states are unable to air them publicly without risking a diplomatic rupture . 
Across the region , minorities are feeling more empowered and citizens are making ever-stronger demands for better government . 
There is a burgeoning desire for a future that dispenses with traditional policies based on fear and anger . 
In this context , Saudi policy seems to be stuck in the past , and the Kingdom has chosen to adopt a strategy of self-help in order to isolate itself from problems outside its borders , though it continues to regard itself as the region &apos;s power broker . 
The sudden rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and the UAE resulted not from the attractiveness of Saudi policy , but from their rulers &quot; shared perception that there is a dearth of political options . 
It would , of course , be wiser to address the real problems facing GCC governments , which range from embittered minorities to economies that are unable to create enough jobs for young people . 
But resolving these issues would require an inclusive and accommodating approach , both domestically and regionally , and Saudi Arabia , in particular , is not prepared to take that route . 
The Gulf impasse will exacerbate the already-fragile situation in the Middle East . 
Regional political realities , transnational interaction , and the common search for a better future should , eventually , prevail over policies geared for repression , discipline , and order . 
The GCC should be accustomed to conflicting perspectives on regional design and differing degrees of cooperation across regional actors , and it should draw on these differences as a source of strength . 
This crisis may create an opportunity to rethink and recalibrate GCC strategies , based on a more realistic view of regional interdependence , common security , and shared decision-making . 
A new mentality in GCC governance could result in the creation of mechanisms of constructive engagement in the region , while maintaining cooperation with international actors . 
Clearly , this policy would be more constructive than Saudi Arabia &apos;s desire for a lone-wolf role that merely results in a deadlock within and around the Gulf .
