The Digital Road From Poverty 
COPENHAGEN - Where should the global community focus its attention over the next 15 years ? 
Health , nutrition , and education may seem like obvious choices ; more surprisingly , there is a strong case for making broadband access a top priority . 
Consider this simple fact : Tripling mobile Internet access over the next 15 years could make the developing world $ 22 trillion richer . 
Such improvement in the lives and earning potential of poor people could indirectly help with the other challenges ; after all , more prosperous people tend to be healthier , better fed , and more highly educated . 
This discussion matters , because the world &apos;s 193 national governments will meet at the United Nations in September to finalize a list of development targets for the world to meet by 2030 . 
My think tank , the Copenhagen Consensus , has asked 60 teams of economists , including several Nobel laureates , to investigate which targets would do the most good for every dollar spent , to help this meeting make the best choices . 
In a new analysis , Emmanuelle Auriol and Alexia Lee Gonz√°lez Fanfalone of the Toulouse School of Economics suggest that broadband could be one of the best investments for the future . 
Clearly , the rapid rollout of broadband services has transformed the lives of people in the industrialized world ; there is every reason to expect that developing countries could benefit at least as much . 
Access to market information , for example , can ensure that farmers selling their surplus crops are not cheated by unscrupulous traders , and that fishermen can land their catch at the port offering the best price . 
A McKinsey report estimates that bringing mobile broadband in the developing world to the levels of the industrial world could add $ 400 billion annually to global GDP and create more than ten million jobs . 
Similarly , the World Bank has shown that a 10 % increase in broadband penetration increased GDP growth by 1.4 % in low- to medium-income countries . 
This implies that closing the persistent digital divide between the world &apos;s developed and developing regions could give a big boost to development . 
For example , mobile broadband penetration stands at 83 % in the former , but only 21 % in the latter . 
While governments in Europe and elsewhere continue to invest in faster and better broadband , the biggest benefits will always come from providing Internet access to people who do not already have it , most of whom live in developing and emerging countries . 
In fact , developing countries can leap-frog the developed world by going straight to mobile broadband , thereby avoiding the need for expensive fiber-optic cables for the &quot; last mile &quot; - or access point - of the network . 
Mobile phone use is already spreading rapidly in developing countries , making old-style fixed infrastructure unnecessary ; data services can use the same system . 
In China , three-quarters of Internet users get online via mobile phones already ; in Ethiopia and Uganda , four out of five do . 
Thus , given the pervasiveness of mobile telephony and recent technological advances in mobile networks , rolling out mobile broadband seems a cost-effective solution . 
The study by Auriol and Fanfalone shows that increasing mobile broadband about three-fold in developing regions - from 21 % to 60 % - will cost a substantial $ 1.3 trillion , as a significant amount of extra infrastructure is needed to establish about three billion more Internet connections . 
By 2020 , the benefits would be almost $ 500 billion annually , and would continue to rise each year . 
Over the coming decades , the total benefit would reach about $ 22 trillion . 
As a result , every dollar spent on mobile broadband in the developing world would yield an estimated gain of $ 17 . 
That looks like a really smart investment . 
Of course , broadband is such an important enabling technology that it is difficult to predict its full economic impact , which will vary with local circumstances . 
What the Auriol-Fanfalone study does show , though , is that rolling out Internet access is money very well spent . 
Jobs are created directly in the organization providing the network and indirectly in the supply chain . 
Once in place , broadband helps create more jobs in the wider economy . 
Companies become more efficient and innovative . 
All of these factors increase the pace of economic growth . 
Apart from the direct effects on economic growth and job creation , broadband can have some other very important benefits for Least Developed Countries . 
Nine hundred million people live in LDCs , and , as Pantelis Koutroumpis of Imperial College London points out , only 6.7 % are Internet users . 
On the other hand , almost 60 % of these people use a mobile phone . 
They could profit from smartphones with simple adaptations that can be used in a range of health-screening tests ( for example , for cardiovascular disease , HIV and other pathogens , or malaria ) , with the results being sent straight to hospitals for an immediate response . 
The potential benefits of mobile broadband for LDCs extend even further . 
Internet access could provide educational material and improve schooling . 
With the Internet now such an important resource in the modern world , broadband has become a vital technology , promising to boost economic growth , lift people out of poverty , and improve their health , nutrition , and education . 
When governments finalize the next set of global development targets , there is now a strong case for broadband access to be among them .
