Will Olmert Survive ? 
After Israel &apos;s inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over Hezbollah in southern Lebanon , public pressure forced Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure . 
How could a small militia , numbering less than a few thousand combatants , survive the onslaught of the Middle East &apos;s most formidable military machine ? 
The commission , headed by retired Supreme Court judge Eliyahu Winograd , has just published its interim report . 
Its criticism of Olmert , Defense Minister Amir Peretz , and Chief-of-Staff Dan Halutz - set forth in a detailed and meticulous 117-page assessment - is harsh , but not surprising . 
The Winograd Commission articulated what most Israelis already think : Olmert and Peretz lacked the military , security , and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that raided Israeli territory , killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two , and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month . 
Indeed , the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in Israel &apos;s history . 
Olmert , who stepped into Ariel Sharon &apos;s shoes as leader of the new Kadima Party , was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian - and later mayor of Jerusalem - who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas . 
For most Israelis , even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon &apos;s legacy after the Gaza disengagement , Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister . 
Likewise , Peretz , a rabble-rousing but effective trade unionist , surprised all when he won the Labor Party &apos;s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury . 
To many , the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble . 
Precisely because Israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country , they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war - but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail . 
When such a moment arrived , totally out of the blue ( or so it seemed ) with Hezbollah &apos;s raid on July 12 , 2006 , Israel &apos;s two top politicians were completely out of their depth , stumbling into a war for which neither they nor the Israeli Army were prepared . 
The military was led - for the first time in its history - by an Air Force general , Dan Halutz , who believed that everything could be solved by air power , creating a combustible combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogance . 
In measured but devastating prose , the Winograd Commission gives failing marks to all three leaders . 
Olmert decided to go into battle recklessly and unaware of the consequences . 
Halutz already resigned a few months ago . 
Will Olmert and Peretz be able to stay on ? 
Their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority ; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative . 
Later this week , demonstrations calling for the government &apos;s resignation are planned , and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function . 
There are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima , aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister , the veteran Shimon Peres , or the popular foreign minister , Tzipi Livni . 
In fact , Olmert &apos;s weak and discredited government may yet survive . 
If the government were to fall and new elections held , there are strong indications that the winner might be Binyamin Netanyahu , of the right-wing Likud , which was decimated in the 2006 elections , but is now patiently waiting in the wings . 
Many who want Olmert to go would still not welcome a Netanyahu comeback , which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of Olmert by the United States . 
Only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed . 
As a result , the prospects for meaningful continuation of Israeli-Palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before . 
Indeed , the real loser of the 2006 Lebanon war was neither Israel nor Hezbollah , but , at least for the time being , the peace process .
