Are We Running Out of Oil ( Again ) ? 
Oil prices are now running well above $ 50 a barrel , partly owing to short-run supply shocks , such as the Iraq conflict , Nigerian labor disputes , the conflict between Yukos Oil and the Russian government , and Florida &apos;s recent hurricanes . 
Oil prices may fall once these shocks dissipate , but speculative effects could keep them relatively high , weakening the world economy and depressing stock markets . 
Even a temporary spike in oil prices can have long-term effects because of the social reactions they provoke . 
High oil prices fuel public discussion about the future of oil prices . 
The outcome of any public discussion can never be known with certainty , but chances are that it will amplify stories that imply risks of higher oil prices . 
Experts may say that short-run supply factors caused the recent price increases , but the price increases will nonetheless lend credibility to scarier long-term stories . 
The scary story that is being amplified now concerns the developing world , notably China and India , where rapid economic growth - and no restrictions on emissions under the Kyoto Protocol - are seen as creating insatiable demands for oil . 
The story &apos;s premise is that the world will run out of oil faster than we thought , as these billions of people chase their dreams of big houses and sport utility vehicles . 
Is this plausible ? 
Certainly , China , India , and some other emerging countries are developing fast . 
But experts find it difficult to specify the long-run implications of this for the energy market . 
Too many factors remain fuzzy : the rate of growth of these countries &apos; energy demand , discoveries of new oil reserves , developments in oil-saving technology , and the ultimate replacement of oil by other energy sources . 
But what matters for oil prices now and in the foreseeable future is the perception of the story , not the ambiguities behind it . 
If there is a perception that prices will be higher in the future , then prices will tend to be higher today . 
That is how markets work . 
If it is generally thought that oil prices will be higher in the future , owners of oil reserves will tend to postpone costly investments in exploration and expansion of production capacity , and they may pump oil at below capacity . 
They would rather sell their oil and invest later , when prices are higher , so they restrain increases in supply . 
Expectations become self-fulfilling , oil prices rise , a speculative bubble is born . 
But if owners of oil reserves think that prices will fall in the long run , they gain an incentive to explore for oil and expand production now in order to sell as much oil as possible before the fall . 
The resulting supply surge drives down prices , reinforces expectations of further declines , and produces the inverse of a speculative bubble : a collapse in prices . 
All of this may seem obvious , but we tend not to think of oil prices as being determined by expectations of future prices . 
For example , in January 1974 , when the first world oil crisis began , oil prices doubled in just days . 
The immediate cause was believed to have been Israel &apos;s stunning success in the Yom Kippur War , which led Arab oil producers to retaliate by choking off output . 
The second crisis , in 1979 , is usually attributed to supply disruptions from the Persian Gulf following the Islamic revolution in Iran and the subsequent start of the Iran-Iraq war . 
Why , then , did real inflation-corrected oil prices remain at or above their 1974 levels until 1986 ? 
Speculative pressures are likely to have been at work , influencing the decisions of OPEC and many others . 
Although changes in market psychology are difficult to understand , the broad concerns that underlie such episodes of irrational exuberance are almost always clear . 
For example , in 1972 , scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , including computer pioneer Jay Forrester , published The Limits to Growth . 
The book launched an international debate on whether the world would soon face immense economic problems due to shortages of oil and other natural resources - problems that seemed to be presaged by OPEC &apos;s production cuts eighteen months later . 
The second crisis was immediately preceded by the accident at the Three-Mile Island nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania in March 1979 , which reinvigorated the anti-nuclear movement . 
With nuclear power - regarded as the main technological bulwark against depletion of the world &apos;s oil supplies - suddenly suspect , oil prices doubled again by the year &apos;s end . 
After 1979 , fears about limits to growth and nuclear power ebbed . 
Oil prices gradually fell , and the stock market began its long climb towards its peak in 2000 . 
But the current rise in oil prices shows that people are still eager to embrace &quot; running out of oil &quot; stories - this time focused on China and India - even when short-run factors are to blame . 
Indeed , the International Energy Agency noted in September that the usual relationship between oil prices and inventory levels has broken down , with prices much higher than the usual relationship would suggest . 
The IEA &apos;s report calls this breakdown evidence of a &quot; structural shift in the market . &quot; 
But the same pattern followed the 1973-4 and 1979-80 oil crises , when prices dropped from their highest peaks , but stayed quite high for years , representing a drag on the stock market , the housing market , and the world economy . 
Let &apos;s hope that the effects of the present spike will be more short-lived . 
But don &apos;t hold your breath .
