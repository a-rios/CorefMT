Gambler &apos;s Ruin 
San Francisco - From Adam Smith ( 1776 ) until 1950 or so , capital was considered by economists to be absolutely essential for economic growth . 
You also needed a few good basic institutions . 
If these fundamental institutions were right , then landlords , merchants , and manufacturers would invest and improve . 
In investing and improving , they would add to the capital stock : &quot; In all countries where there is a tolerable security &#91; of property &#93; , every man of common understanding will endeavor to employ whatever &#91; capital &#93; stock he can command , in procuring either present enjoyment or future profit ... 
A larger capital stock would mean thicker markets , a finer division of labor , and a more productive economy . 
A highly productive society based on a sophisticated division of labor was how you secured &quot; the wealth of nations . &quot; 
Reverse the process , however , and you get the poverty of nations , which Smith believed he saw in the Asia of his time . 
For Smith and his successors over the first 175 years , any episode of sustained economic growth overwhelmingly required investment capital . 
We economists were by and large capital boosters , and our magic formula for economic development was saving , investment , thrift , and wealth accumulation . 
The last and fullest expression of this line of thought comes at the end of the 1950 &quot; s with W.W. Rostow &apos;s book The Stages of Economic Growth . 
Then Robert Solow and Moses Abramovitz challenged this near-consensus . 
They calculated that 75 % to 80 % of economic growth did not come from increasing the capital-output ratio - at least not if the private marginal product of capital was taken as an indicator of the social marginal product . 
Instead , the keys to growth and development appeared to lie beyond an increase in capital intensity as measured by capital-output ratios : skills , education , technology broadly understood , and improvements in organizational management . 
Yet capital continued to be seen as necessary , if not sufficient . 
In the framework developed by the development economist Dani Rodrik , a shortage of capital can be a binding &quot; growth constraint &quot; : the place where &quot; the biggest bang for the &#91; policy &#93; reform buck can be obtained . &quot; 
And even when other factors constrain growth more , they cannot be changed without changing the shape and form of the economy &apos;s capital stock . 
Indeed , high investment serves as a sign that other binding constraints to growth are absent , implying prosperity and that things are going right . 
The problem is that for poor economies , raising the capital needed to relax binding growth constraints is difficult . 
That &apos;s why the world took the neo-liberal bet in the 1990 &quot; s : international capital mobility would come to the rescue by relaxing capital constraints where they were binding , and by reducing the scope for corruption and rent-seeking , which was often a more significant binding growth constraint . 
The hope was that , like the pre-1913 era of British overseas investment , which financed a huge amount of industrialization in the resource-rich , temperate periphery of the world economy , net capital outflows from the industrial core would finance much late twentieth and twenty-first century industrialization . 
But we all know the outcome : while international capital flows soared , the large net flow of capital from rich to poor countries simply never materialized . 
In fact , the principal outcome was an enormous flow of capital from the periphery to the rich core . 
For most of the past generation , and looking into the future , the message of the market is that the benefits of international capital mobility do not include a relaxation of the capital constraint , and thus an acceleration of growth in the global periphery . 
The reason is not that the periphery offers an attractive labor force from which capital profits , but rather that the core - especially the United States - offers a form of protection for capital against unanticipated political disturbances . 
But even though net international capital flows are going the wrong way , there are still substantial gross capital flows outward from the world economy &apos;s core to its periphery . 
And we can hope that these capital flows will carry with them the institutions and managerial expertise that have made the core so wealthy . 
Nevertheless , a dispassionate observer might point out that for someone with limited resources and opportunities for policy reform to keep betting double-or-nothing on neo-liberalism is a strategy that has a well-deserved name : &quot; Gambler &apos;s Ruin . &quot;
