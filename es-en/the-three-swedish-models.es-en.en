The Three Swedish Models 
Sweden &apos;s economic and social system , sometimes called the &quot; Swedish Model , &quot; is often depicted either as an ideal or an abnormality . 
In fact , broadly speaking there have been three different Swedish &quot; models &quot; since the late nineteenth century . 
The first model lasted from about 1870 until the 1960 &quot; s . 
During this &quot; liberal &quot; period , the government basically provided stable market-supporting legislation , education , health care , and infrastructure . 
As late as 1960 , both total government spending ( as a share of GDP ) and the distribution of earnings were similar to those prevailing in the United States . 
During this century-long period , Sweden moved from being one of the poorest western countries to being the third richest country in terms of GDP per capita . 
In other words , Sweden became a rich country before its highly generous welfare-state arrangements were created . 
A second era lasted from 1960 until 1985 . 
The free-trade regime of the liberal period was retained during this period - indeed it was deepened by the various rounds of global trade liberalization - but the dominant thrust was the creation of a generous welfare state . 
By the late 1980 &quot; s , total public spending reached 60-65 % of GDP , compared to about 30 % in 1960 . 
Moreover , marginal tax rates hit 65-75 % for most full-time employees , compared to about 40 % in 1960 ( all taxes on households being included ) . 
Economic incentives to work , save , and start businesses were also reduced through the compression of wage differentials and a big squeeze on company profits , both largely the result of strong and centralized labor unions . 
Moreover , new labor-market regulations were introduced , the most important being strict job-security legislation implemented in the early 1970 &quot; s . 
The regulation of financial markets that was imposed during WWII was retained . 
It is this economic and social system that is usually identified as the &quot; Swedish model . &quot; 
Although economic performance during this period was not dismal , it was certainly not impressive . 
Between 1970 and 1995 , GDP per capita in Sweden lagged by about 18 % behind the average of rich OECD countries . 
As a result , Sweden fell from third to approximately seventeenth place in the OECD in terms of GDP per capita . 
This can partly be explained by the &quot; catch up &quot; mechanism , as technologically less advanced countries imported technology from more advanced countries . 
The removal of capital-market regulations and foreign-exchange controls in the late 1980 &quot; s , and Sweden &apos;s entry into the EU in the early 1990 &quot; s , signaled a new era - the embryo of a third Swedish model . 
In 1991 , marginal tax rates were cut by 10-20 % for large parts of the population . 
These reforms had broad political support and were , in fact , initiated during a social-democratic government . 
Subsequently , mainly during a period of center-right governance , several product markets were deregulated : telecommunications , electricity , road transport , taxis , and , to some extent , railways . 
A process of deregulation and privatization , although with continued tax-financing ( in fact , basically a voucher system ) , began in the field of &quot; human services , &quot; in particular for childcare , education , and old-age care . 
One purpose of this was to increase competition and freedom of choice . 
Partly in response to these reforms , Sweden &apos;s growth rate picked up from the mid 1990 &quot; s , and today about a third of the previous lag in GDP per capita since 1970 ( as compared to other developed countries ) has been recovered . 
However , Sweden is still characterized by high welfare dependency , with about 23 % of working-age people in recent years living on various types of government benefits , including temporary and permanent disability payments . 
The new center-right government elected in the fall of 2006 has committed itself to continuing economic liberalization . 
The government has announced plans to privatize state-owned companies , improve conditions for small firms , and continue increasing individual freedom of choice in the case of human services . 
It has also abolished the wealth tax ( after the previous social-democratic government had already abolished the inheritance tax ) . 
Moreover , the government has modestly reduced taxes on wages and slightly scaled down the generosity of some benefits . 
One argument for the latter policy is to improve the government &apos;s budget , another to make work more economically rewarding relative to government benefits . 
Indeed , in important respects today &apos;s Sweden is moving back to the liberal economic regime that existed before the explosion of government interventionism in the 1960 &quot; s . 
First , all political parties agree that welfare-state arrangements should remain tax-financed , although possibly with a stronger application of insurance principles in the social insurance systems . 
So even if the generosity of state benefits may be curtailed , aggregate government spending is unlikely to be rolled back dramatically from the current 53 % of GDP . 
Second , there is general agreement that the government should take more active responsibility for environmental issues , although policies in this area increasingly rely on market instruments ( prices for environmental disturbances ) rather than on quantitative regulations 
Clearly , some of these policy measures may conflict with traditional egalitarianism in Sweden , at least in the short term . 
Hence , the big question underlying the current wave of liberalization is whether these reform tendencies are politically sustainable . 
The next general election in 2010 will give part of the answer .
