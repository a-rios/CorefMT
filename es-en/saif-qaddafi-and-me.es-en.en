Saif Qaddafi and Me 
CAMBRIDGE - Not long ago , a Harvard colleague wrote to me that Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi , a son of Libya &apos;s dictator , would be in town and wanted to meet me . 
He is an interesting fellow , my colleague said , with a doctorate from the London School of Economics and Political Science ( LSE ) ; 
The meeting , as it turned out , was a letdown . 
I was first briefed by a former Monitor Company employee , who gently intimated that I should not to expect too much . 
Saif himself held photocopies of pages from one of my books on which he had scribbled notes . 
He asked me several questions - about the role of international NGOs , as I recall - that seemed fairly distant from my areas of expertise . 
I don &apos;t imagine he was much impressed by me ; nor was I much taken by him . 
As the meeting ended , Saif invited me to Libya and I said - more out of politeness than anything else - that I would be happy to come . 
Saif never followed up ; nor did I. But if a real invitation had come , would I have traveled to Libya , spent time with him , and possibly met his father and his cronies ? 
Would I have been tempted by arguments such as : &quot; We are trying to develop our economy , and you can really help us with your knowledge ? &quot; 
In other words , would I have followed in the footsteps of several of my Harvard colleagues who traveled to Libya to exchange views with and advise its dictator - and were paid for their services ? 
These scholars have been pilloried in the media in recent weeks for supposedly having cozied up to Qaddafi . 
Sir Howard Davies chose to resign as Director of the LSE , which awarded Saif his doctorate ( which some allege was plagiarized ) and took money for the school from the Libyan regime . 
There is a strong sentiment that academics and institutions that collaborated with such an odious regime - often with the encouragement of their governments , no doubt - suffered a grave lapse of judgment . 
Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s murderous stance during the uprising has revealed his true colors , regardless of his more moderate posture in recent years . 
And Saif al-Islam &apos;s recent support for his father suggests that he is not the liberal reformer many took him to be . 
But it is much easier to reach such judgments with hindsight . 
Were the moral overtones of dealing with the Qaddafis so obvious before the Arab revolutions spread to Libya ? 
Or to pose the question more broadly , is it so clear that advisers should always steer clear of dictatorial regimes ? 
Universities all over the world are falling over each other trying to deepen their engagement with China . 
Most academics would jump at the chance to have a meeting with China &apos;s President Hu Jintao . 
I haven &apos;t heard much criticism of such contacts , which tend to be viewed as normal and unproblematic . 
And yet few would deny that China &apos;s is a repressive regime that deals with its opponents harshly . 
Memories of Tiananmen are still fresh . 
Who is to say how the Chinese leadership would respond to a future pro-democracy uprising that threatened to undermine the regime ? 
Or what about a country like Ethiopia ? 
I have had intensive economic-policy discussions with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi in Addis Ababa . 
I must confess to having enjoyed these talks more than most meetings I have in Washington , DC and other democratic capitals . 
I have no illusions about Meles &quot; commitment to democracy - or lack thereof . 
But I also believe that he is trying to develop his economy , and I offer policy advice because I believe it may benefit ordinary Ethiopians . 
The conundrum that advisers to authoritarian regimes face is akin to a long-standing problem in moral philosophy known as the dilemma of &quot; dirty hands . &quot; 
A terrorist is holding several people hostage , and he asks you to deliver water and food to them . 
You may choose the moral high ground and say , &quot; I will never deal with a terrorist . &quot; 
But you will have passed up an opportunity to assist the hostages . 
Most moral philosophers would say that helping the hostages is the right thing to do in this instance , even if doing so also helps the terrorist . 
But choosing an action for the greater good does not absolve us from moral culpability . 
Our hands do become dirty when we help a terrorist or a dictator . 
The philosopher Michael Walzer puts it well : &quot; It is easy to get one &apos;s hands dirty in politics . &quot; 
He immediately adds , however , that this getting one &apos;s hands dirty in this way is &quot; often the right thing to do . &quot; 
In the end , an adviser to authoritarian leaders cannot escape the dilemma . 
Often , leaders seek the engagement only to legitimize their rule , in which case the foreign adviser should simply stay away . 
But when the adviser believes his work will benefit those whom the leader effectively holds hostage , he has a duty not to withhold advice . 
Even then , he should be aware that there is a degree of moral complicity involved . 
If the adviser does not come out of the interaction feeling somewhat tainted and a bit guilty , he has probably not reflected enough about the nature of the relationship .
