European Discrimination on Trial 
What good are Europe &apos;s treaties aimed at ensuring the legal equality of all citizens when entire groups face systematic discrimination ? 
That is the question that the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) faces this week as its Grand Chamber , consisting of 17 judges , begins considering an appeal of an initial ruling that rejected claims of discrimination against the Roma by the Czech Republic &apos;s education authorities . 
All European states are members of the Council of Europe , all have signed the European Convention on Human Rights , 39 of the 46 member states have adopted the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities , and 14 have ratified Protocol 12 on the prohibition against discrimination . 
Nevertheless , the living conditions of many Roma remain appalling . 
Although recent reports published in 2006 by the European Union &apos;s Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia and the Council of Europe &apos;s Human Rights Commissioner note some improvements , they indicate Roma living conditions have stagnated , if not deteriorated . 
Roma are still victims of discrimination in access to housing , employment , healthcare , and education , despite significant local efforts at the Council of Europe &apos;s instigation and with its support . 
Discrimination in educational access is particularly important , given its profound effect on its victims &quot; life prospects . 
In the most extreme cases , the education system itself is segregated : isolated schools in remote camps ; special classes for Roma children in mainstream schools ; and an over-representation of Roma children in classes for children with learning difficulties . 
The EHCR was confronted with the third issue in the case D.H. and others vs. Czech Republic . 
The Court was referred to 18 cases of girls and boys who , between 1996 and 1999 , were placed in special schools for children with learning difficulties , either directly or after a period of time in primary schools . 
The question was whether the children were victims of discrimination owing to their national minority status . 
The Czech government admitted that some of the special schools &quot; student bodies comprised 80 % to 90 % Roma children . 
However , if there was discrimination , it was not direct , because under Czech law , such a move could be decided only by a school headmaster based on the results of an intelligence test at an educational psychology counseling centre , and subject to the approval of the child &apos;s parents or legal guardian . 
A difference in treatment is not discriminatory in itself . 
According to the case law of national supreme courts and the ECHR , discrimination exists only when people in a similar situation are treated differently . 
Yet national and international case law recognizes that a non-discriminatory measure in theory can be discriminatory in practice . 
So , in the current case , the alleged discrimination does not stem from the law itself , but from its effects , with the plaintiffs relying mainly on statistics showing the over-representation of Roma in special schools . 
Many other reports on the situation of Roma in the Czech Republic , including by the Council of Europe , are available . 
But , as the Court rightly noted , it should rule only on the cases to which it is referred , and should not make known its opinion on the Czech education system &apos;s legitimacy , as choices concerning educational opportunities fall under the jurisdiction of states and therefore can vary accordingly . 
Working on this assumption and given the case it had to solve , an EHCR panel of seven judges ruled against the plaintiffs in February 2006 , concluding that the law on special schools is not aimed specifically at Roma and does not apply only to them . 
According to the Court , the law &apos;s legitimate purpose is to adapt teaching to the difficulties of a specific category of pupils , and psychological tests seem to be objective enough not to be suspected of racial bias . 
Moreover , the requirement of parents &quot; approval for placing children in special schools remains valid , while Roma children who were initially placed in those schools could have returned to mainstream schools later , and thus reintegrated into normal schooling . 
As well-founded as the Court &apos;s reasoning may be , a feeling of unease persists . 
The statistics showing the enormous proportion of Roma children in those schools are hard to ignore , and the suspicion of discrimination is difficult to avoid . 
While laws have changed , mentalities do not always follow at the same pace , and we intuitively know that it is easy to get psychology to mean a lot of things . 
Indeed , before announcing its decision , the Court felt it necessary to state that while it did not conclude that the Convention had been violated , statistics still revealed &quot; worrying figures , and the situation in general in the Czech Republic regarding Roma children &apos;s education needs to be improved . &quot; 
The Court &apos;s president , Jean-Paul Costa , expressed a similar view , without questioning the legitimacy of the decision , although Judge Cabral Barreto wrote a dissenting opinion . 
Moreover , it is significant that the Court agreed , at the request of the parties , to refer the case on appeal to its Grand Chamber . 
According to Costa , rejecting the ruling in February 2006 would contradict previous case law . 
Will the Court , then , decide on the workings of the Czech education system itself ? 
Or will it follow Judge Barreto , who calls for recognition of an obligation to adopt affirmative action policies aimed at benefiting Romanies ? 
Whatever formula is adopted , it is certain that Roma children should be afforded the same opportunities as other children . 
It is this imperative that underlies the importance of the coming decision , for it provides an occasion for the Court to reassert the fundamental principle of non-discrimination that defines our democratic societies .
