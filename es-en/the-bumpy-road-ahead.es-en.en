The Bumpy Road Ahead 
CAMBRIDGE - If stock market and interest-rate spreads are to be believed , America &apos;s economy has seen the worst and may be on its way to a slow recovery . 
If globalization does not get the fix it needs , economic prospects will be dim for rich and poor countries alike . 
The worst that could happen is a return to the 1930 &quot; s , when countries put up high trade barriers and retreated into isolationism , to the detriment of all . 
Fortunately , this is a remote scenario today . 
It will take real effort and creativity to repair the deep cracks in globalization revealed by the financial crisis . 
First , the good news . 
The global response to the crisis may not have been stellar , but neither has it been the free-for-all that might have been feared . 
The G-20 could not agree on coordinated fiscal stimulus or concrete steps towards banking reform . 
Despite scores of new protectionist measures around the world since the onset of the financial crisis , the vast majority are nothing to lose sleep over . 
Globalization has not received a mortal blow - at least not yet . 
The real test is yet to come . 
The problem is that none of globalization &apos;s underlying weaknesses is likely to be adequately addressed under the current agenda . 
Financial regulation and supervision will surely be strengthened , but they will remain national in character , with little safeguard against cross-border spillover and regulatory arbitrage . 
Moreover , the World Trade Organization &apos;s agenda will remain irrelevant and , in any case , deadlocked . 
China has yet to discover and adopt an alternative growth strategy that does not rely on a large trade surplus . 
Trade and immigration ( legal and illegal ) , if left unchecked , will continue to exert downward pressure on rich countries &quot; labor markets . 
The financial crisis has not helped improve the image of globalization , which has long been deeply unpopular among ordinary voters in most of the world &apos;s advanced countries . 
As a result , globalization &apos;s tendency to produce macroeconomic imbalances and financial fragility , its adverse impact on equality and social peace in many countries , and its weak political legitimacy will continue to generate tension and periodic crises . 
Two other developments will greatly aggravate these weaknesses . 
The first is that the United States and other advanced countries are unlikely to recover their previous economic dynamism even after financial stability is restored . 
Rich-country households have suffered a momentous loss of wealth ( amounting to tens of trillions of US dollars ) . 
This implies that consumption growth will remain muted for some time . 
With public debt rising very rapidly , and in some countries projected to exceed 100 % of GDP , governments will not be in a position to take up the slack . 
The restructuring of economies away from finance will necessarily take some time . 
Stagnation rather than growth will be the name of the game . Second , global leadership is likely to remain in very short supply . 
The US will be crippled by its high debt , under-performing economy , and discredited economic model . 
The European Union will be preoccupied with its own internal integration process . 
History teaches that global economic order is difficult to establish and maintain in the absence of a dominant economic power . 
The interwar period , which suffered from a similar crisis of leadership , produced not only a collapse of globalization , but a devastating armed conflict on a global scale . 
So the stakes in righting the world economy could not be higher . 
Mismanage the process , and the consequences could be unimaginable . 
Unfortunately , many of the solutions on offer are either too timid or demand too much of a global leadership that is in short supply . 
The conundrum of global reform is that the proposals that go far enough , such as establishing a global financial regulator , are wildly unrealistic , while those that are realistic , such as reform of the IMF , fall far short of what is needed . 
What we need is a vision of globalization that is fully cognizant of its limits . 
We can start with a simple principle : We should strive not for maximum openness in trade and finance , but for levels of openness that leave ample room for the pursuit of domestic social and economic objectives in rich and poor countries alike . 
In effect , the best way to save globalization is to not push it too far . 
Consider a traffic analogy . 
One way to prevent traffic accidents is to require everyone to drive a similar car , travel at the same speed , and head in the same direction . 
Another is to enforce some simple rules : don &apos;t drive in the fast lane if going slow , stop at red lights , use a signal before a turn , and so on . 
The first approach may maximize the traffic load that can be carried safely , but it fails to take most people where they want to go and is ultimately self-defeating . 
The second approach allows drivers to make their own choices , even if this means that they will have to slow down or stop on occasion . 
Similarly , healthy and sustainable globalization should not impose a straitjacket of common rules on everyone . 
The financial crisis laid bare the soft underbelly of globalization . 
It would be a mistake to respond by trying to take globalization to the next level . 
The economic and political obstacles that block deep integration cannot be wished away by exhortations . 
It would serve us far better to take these limits into account and scale down our ambitions .
