Latin America \ u0027s Visions of Kerry 
The tin man vs. the straw man . 
The candidate with a brain but without a heart against the president with a heart but without a brain . 
That &apos;s how many Latin Americans are viewing the race between John Kerry and George W. Bush . 
Even from afar , people perceive the forthcoming US election as a contest between two contending world views , two opposite visions , two ways of viewing reality and dealing with it . 
Kerry represents reason and Bush faith . 
Kerry embodies rationality and Bush morality . 
Kerry understands the real world , while Bush lives in one of his own making . 
South of the US border , many countries perceive that Kerry embraces multilateralism , while Bush rejects it . 
Kerry refers to terrorism as a problem that should be contained , while Bush views it as an epic war that must be won . 
Kerry speaks of friends and allies , while Bush alienates many of them . 
As a result , for Latin Americans the choice has never been as clear-cut . 
Across the hemisphere , citizens from Buenos Aires to Brasilia and from San Salvador to Santiago de Chile know that Bush means more of the same , while Kerry offers the possibility of a different course . 
More of the same in US-Latin American relations would mean four more years of &quot; the war on terror &quot; at center stage , four more years of pressing issues - trade , poverty , the environment , immigration - placed on the back burner , and four more years of an American foreign policy that defines friendship in terms of the number of troops sent to Iraq . 
Latin Americans have been there and done that . 
The results have not been pretty . 
While bombs drop over Baghdad , instability grows in Bogot√° . 
While &quot; freedom is on the march &quot; in Afghanistan , poverty marches on in the Andes . 
While the Middle East burns , Latin America simmers . 
So Latin Americans believe that Bush must go . 
They view him as a man who trusts his instincts more than empirical evidence , who prays as a way of making policy , who doesn &apos;t recognize his mistakes in Iraq , and who listens to his inner voice instead of to what other countries have to say . 
Latin Americans recoil from Bush &apos;s faith-based presidency because it has meant thousands dead and wounded in Iraq , a more polarized world , and a hemisphere neglected . 
As a result , many Latin Americans view Bush with panic , fear , and growing antipathy . 
They view him as a menace , not a salvation . 
Although Kerry may not fill them with enthusiasm , Latin Americans perceive him as a necessary replacement . 
Across the continent , millions believe that Kerry is right about Bush . 
As the senator has put it : &quot; It is possible to be certain and to be wrong . &quot; 
It is possible to have a vision and for that vision to be distorted . 
Throughout Latin America , no one doubts that Bush believes what he says and acts according to what he believes . 
He has done so with determination , with force , without doubts , without second guesses . 
Since September 11 , 2001 , the American President has remodeled the international stage and his country &apos;s role in it . 
He has transformed the war on terror into the guiding force of US foreign policy . 
He intends to win reelection by presenting himself as the only leader who can keep America safe . 
But the majority of Latin Americans believe - as Kerry does - that terrorism can be addressed in a better way . 
They perceive that the US has not won the peace in Iraq and will need international collaboration to achieve that goal . 
They don &apos;t want a president who speaks to God , but one who engages the world . 
They don &apos;t want a president who says that freedom is on the march , and then sabotages it in Abu Ghraib . 
They want an American leader who asks questions , who faces facts , who changes tactics when it becomes necessary to do so . 
And although John Kerry isn &apos;t the most charismatic of candidates or the savviest politician , he represents the possibility of removing George Bush from the White House . 
Although Kerry doesn &apos;t have a lot of options in Iraq , he represents the possibility of addressing the conflict in a new way . 
For Latin America , a fresh start and a different tone would be enough , because a willingness to engage the world instead of shunning it would at least constitute progress . 
In the meantime , throughout the hemisphere , citizens are watching and waiting . 
They &apos;re wondering whether Americans will choose a reasonable leader over a faith-based president . 
They &apos;re questioning whether Americans will support a man rooted in reality over a man who constructs his own vision of it . 
They &apos;re hoping that reason and realism will return to the White House .
