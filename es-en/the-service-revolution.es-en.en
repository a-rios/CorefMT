The Service Revolution 
WASHINGTON , DC - China and India are both racing ahead economically . 
But the manner in which they are growing is dramatically different . 
Whereas China is a formidable exporter of manufactured goods , India has acquired a global reputation for exporting modern services . 
Indeed , India has leapfrogged over the manufacturing sector , going straight from agriculture into services . 
The differences in the two countries &quot; growth patterns are striking , and raise significant questions for development economists . 
Can service be as dynamic as manufacturing ? 
Can late-comers to development take advantage of the increasing globalization of the service sector ? 
Can services be a driver of sustained growth , job creation , and poverty reduction ? 
Some facts are worth examining . 
The relative size of the service sector in India , given the country &apos;s state of development , is much bigger than it is in China . 
Despite being a low-income region , India and other South Asian countries have adopted the growth patterns of middle- to high-income countries . 
Their growth patterns more closely resemble those of Ireland and Israel than those of China and Malaysia . 
India &apos;s growth pattern is remarkable because it contradicts a seemingly iron law of development that has held true for almost 200 years , since the start of the Industrial Revolution . 
According to this &quot; law &quot; - which is now conventional wisdom - industrialization is the only route to rapid economic development for developing countries . 
As a result of globalization , the pace of development can be explosive . 
But the potential for explosive growth has usually been seen only in the manufacturing sector . 
This is no longer the case . 
There is evidence that countries with high growth in services also tend to have high overall economic growth ; conversely , countries with high overall economic growth have high services growth . 
To be sure , the causal connection remains uncertain : after all , there is also a positive relationship - widely accepted in development economics - between manufacturing growth and overall growth . 
But what has been overlooked is that the effect of services growth on aggregate economic growth appears to be as strong , if not stronger , than the effect of manufacturing growth on overall growth . 
Moreover , the trend over time to a higher service-sector share in the economy suggests that higher real growth in services has not been offset by price declines . 
There is no outbreak of the so-called &quot; Dutch disease &quot; - that is , the price of services do not fall with an increase in the supply . 
India has a higher share of services , and more rapid service-sector growth , than China , although the latter is richer and has grown faster over time . 
This indicates that services are not simply responding to domestic demand ( which would be higher in China ) , but also to export opportunities . 
India &apos;s growth experience suggests that a global service revolution - rapid growth and poverty reduction led by services - is now possible . 
In India , the service sector has not only led overall economic growth , but is also characterized by higher labor productivity than in the industrial sector . 
Indeed , productivity growth in India &apos;s service sector matches productivity growth in China &apos;s manufacturing sector , thereby reducing poverty by enabling wages to rise . 
Service-led growth is sustainable , because globalization of services , which account for more than 70 % of global output , is still in its infancy . 
Moreover , the long-held view that services are non-transportable , non-tradable , and non-scalable no longer holds for a host of modern impersonal services , which can now be produced and exported at low cost . 
Developing countries can thus sustain service-led growth , given the huge room they have for catch-up and convergence . 
India &apos;s experience offers hope to other development late-comers . 
The process of globalization in the late twentieth century led to a sharp divergence of incomes between those who industrialized and broke into global markets and the &quot; bottom billion &quot; in some 60 countries where incomes stagnated for twenty years . 
It seemed as if the &quot; bottom billion &quot; would have to wait their turn for development , until giant industrializers like China became rich and uncompetitive in labor-intensive manufacturing . 
The globalization of services , however , provides alternative opportunities for developing countries to find niches , beyond manufacturing , where they can specialize , scale up , and achieve explosive growth , just like the industrializers . 
As the services produced and traded across the world expand with globalization , the possibilities for all countries to develop based on their comparative advantage expand . 
That comparative advantage can just as easily be in services as in manufacturing or agriculture . 
The promise of the service revolution is that countries do not have to wait to get on the path to rapid development . 
There is a new way ahead .
