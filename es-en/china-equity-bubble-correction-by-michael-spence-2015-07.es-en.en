Letting China &apos;s Bubble Burst 
NEW YORK - The problems with China &apos;s economic-growth pattern have become well known in recent years , with the Chinese stock-market &apos;s recent free-fall bringing them into sharper focus . 
But discussions of the Chinese economy &apos;s imbalances and vulnerabilities tend to neglect some of the more positive elements of its structural evolution , particularly the government &apos;s track record of prompt corrective intervention , and the substantial state balance sheet that can be deployed , if necessary . 
In this regard , however , the stock-market bubble that developed in the first half of the year should be viewed as an exception . 
Not only did Chinese regulators enable the bubble &apos;s growth by allowing retail investors - many of them newcomers to the market - to engage in margin trading ( using borrowed money ) ; the policy response to the market correction that began in late June has also been highly problematic . 
Given past experiences with such bubbles , these policy mistakes are puzzling . 
I was in Beijing in the fall of 2007 , when the Shanghai Composite Index skyrocketed to almost 6,000 ( the recent peak was just over 5,000 ) , owing partly to the participation of relatively inexperienced retail investors . 
At the time , I thought that the greatest policy concern would be the burgeoning current-account surplus of over 10 % of GDP , which would create friction with China &apos;s trading partners . 
But the country &apos;s leaders were far more concerned about the social consequences of the stock-market correction that soon followed . 
Although social unrest did not emerge , a prolonged period of moribund equity prices did , even as the economy continued to grow rapidly . 
In 2008 , it was a combination of exploding asset prices and excessive household-sector leverage that fueled the global financial crisis . 
When such a debt-fueled bubble bursts , its effects are transmitted directly to the real economy via household-sector balance sheets , with the reduction in consumption contributing to a decline in employment and private investment . 
It is much harder to find circuit breakers for this dynamic than for , say , that caused by balance-sheet distress in the financial sector . 
Yet the Chinese authorities seem not to have learned the lessons of either episode . 
Not only did they fail to mitigate the risks , underscored in the 2007 collapse , that new retail investors introduce into the market ; they actually exacerbated them , by allowing , and even encouraging , those investors to accumulate leverage through margin buying . 
Making matters worse , when the current stock-market correction began in early June , Chinese regulators relaxed margin-buying restrictions , while encouraging state-owned enterprises and asset managers to purchase more stocks . 
The authorities , it seems , were more interested in propping up the market than allowing for a controlled price correction . 
To be sure , China &apos;s stock-market bubble did not emerge until recently . 
Last October , when the Shanghai Composite Index was in the 2,500 range , many analysts considered equity prices undervalued . 
Given relatively strong economic growth , rising prices seemed justified until about March , when the market , driven by mostly thinly traded small- and mid-cap stocks , shot to over 5,000 , placing the economy at risk . 
( And , in fact , many still claimed that the rally was not unsustainable , as the stock market was trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 15 , consistent with its ten-year average , in mid-April . ) 
But it was a bubble - and a highly leveraged one at that . 
While periodic bubbles may be unavoidable , and no bubble is without consequences , a highly leveraged bubble tends to cause far more damage , owing to its impact on the real economy and the duration of the deleveraging process . 
This is reflected in the persistently sluggish recovery in the advanced economies today . 
Even the United States , which has fared better than most since the crisis , has recorded GDP growth of little more than 10 % since the start of 2008 ; over the same period , China &apos;s economy grew by about 66 % . 
Of course , with China &apos;s household sector holding a relatively small share of equities compared to real estate , the current stock-market slump is unlikely to derail the economy . 
Nonetheless , as in 2007 , the prospect that lost savings will trigger social unrest cannot be dismissed , especially at a time when tools like social media enable citizens easily to share information , air grievances , and mobilize protest . 
As previous crises have shown , and as the current downturn in China has highlighted , steps must be taken to mitigate market risks . 
Specifically , China needs prudential regulation that limits the use of leverage for asset purchases . 
Here , the country already has an advantage : relatively high levels of equity and low mortgage-to-value ratios typically characterize real-estate purchases by China &apos;s household sector . 
Moreover , once a market correction begins , the authorities should allow it to run its course , rather than prop up prices with additional leverage - an approach that only prolongs the correction . 
If Chinese regulators allow the market to correct , sophisticated institutional investors with a long-term value orientation will ultimately step in , enhancing the market &apos;s stability . 
In the interim , the use of public balance sheets to purchase enough equity to prevent the market from over-correcting may be justified . 
As China &apos;s markets expand - the capitalization of the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets is on the order of $ 11 trillion - they are increasingly outstripping policymakers &quot; capacity to manage prices and valuations . 
The only practical way forward is for the Chinese authorities to focus on regulatory and institutional development , while following through on their commitment to allow markets to play the decisive role in allocating resources .
