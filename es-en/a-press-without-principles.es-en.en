A Press Without Principles 
NEW YORK - Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , is in the news again , this time after former Swiss banker Rudolf Elmer turned over to him confidential records on roughly 2,000 wealthy individuals that Elmer claims contain evidence of money laundering and tax evasion . 
Elmer was quickly convicted of violating Switzerland &apos;s bank-secrecy law , but few journalists have demanded that Assange be prosecuted for his role in the affair . 
That , apparently , happens only in the United States . 
There , in the midst of the debate over WikiLeaks &quot; ongoing release of classified US State Department cables , and as the government threatens Assange with extradition and prosecution , respected journalists are running for cover . 
One would expect lead editorials by The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal , and USA Today , not to mention all major television outlets , defending WikiLeaks &quot; right to publish . 
Instead , all we have heard is an awkward , deafening , and breathtakingly hypocritical silence - or worse . 
Most American journalists fully understand that Assange did not illegally obtain classified material ; the criminally liable party is whoever released the material to the site . 
He is not the equivalent of Daniel Ellsberg , who in 1971 illegally released the Pentagon Papers , the US military &apos;s secret history of the Vietnam War ; rather , he is analogous to The New York Times , which made the brave and correct decision to publish that material . 
Moreover , American journalists know perfectly well that they , too , traffic in classified material constantly - indeed , many prominent US reporters have built lucrative careers doing exactly what Assange is doing . 
Any dinner party in media circles in New York or Washington features journalists jauntily showing prospective employers their goods , or trading favors with each other , by disclosing classified information . 
On CNN recently , a long pause followed when I asked legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin - who was calling for Assange &apos;s arrest - if he had really never handled classified information . 
That is what serious journalists do , after all : their job is to find out what government officials do not want revealed . 
American journalists also know that the government classifies information mostly to spare it embarrassment , or for expediency , rather than because it has genuine national-security concerns . 
Many of the Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward &apos;s bestselling books , which have made him America &apos;s highest-paid print journalist , are based on classified information . 
So where are the calls for Woodward &apos;s arrest ? 
Why do all these reporters , who get praise and money for doing what Assange has done , maintain a cowardly silence ( at best ) while a fellow publisher faces threats of extradition , banning , and espionage charges ( which can incur the death penalty ) , not to mention calls for his assassination ? 
One reason might be the sexual-misconduct charges against Assange . 
But any serious journalist knows that the two issues must not be conflated . 
The right to free expression applies to rogues and scoundrels , sleazy personalities , and even criminals . 
Indeed , the most famous free-speech cases - the ones that are supposed to showcase America &apos;s strength and moral power - involve the protection of speech that most decent people hate . 
So , again : why have US journalists and editors turned Assange into a pariah ? 
According to Nancy Youssef , a journalist for McClatchy Newspapers , the Freedom of the Press Committee of the Overseas Press Club of America in New York City declared Assange to be &quot; not one of us . &quot; 
The Associated Press refuses to comment on him . 
And even the National Press Club decided not to speak publicly about the possibility that Assange may be charged with a crime . 
Instead , it has fallen to foreign press organizations to defend him . 
The Assange case shows that no coup is needed to close down an open society . 
You need only accomplish a few key critical tasks . 
One is to intimidate journalists , say , by accusing a high-profile reporter of &quot; treason &quot; or endangering national security through his reporting , and then threatening him with torture , a show trial , or indefinite detention . 
No mass arrests or further threats are required , because other reporters immediately start to police and censor themselves - and to attack the &quot; traitor &quot; in their midst . 
There is another sense in which , from the perspective of establishment US journalists , Assange is &quot; not one of us . &quot; 
American journalism &apos;s business model is collapsing ; the people who should be defending Assange are facing salary cuts or unemployment , owing in large part to the medium that he represents . 
These journalists &quot; self-interested prejudice against a medium in which they are not the gatekeepers prevents them from conceding that Assange is a publisher , rather than some sort of hybrid terrorist blogger . 
In this , paradoxically , they have become like the outraged US government officials who are now threatening Assange , and who also are no longer able to control the flow of information . 
In their behavior toward Assange , the US government and major American media are lashing out at the face of a future in which there are no traditional gatekeepers , and all institutions live in glass houses . 
This is why pursuing Assange is futile and absurd . 
Even if he is locked up forever , the world of the future is a WikiLeaks world . 
Trying to convict him is like trying to convict the first person who installed a telephone . 
In five years , every major institution could be held accountable by its own version of WikiLeaks - so that taxpayers , shareholders , members of university communities , and so on , can find out what the traditional gatekeepers prefer to hide . 
When bullied , journalists can protect themselves only by fighting back - as a group . 
And when a technology-led change is inevitable , integrating it into an open society should be one of journalism &apos;s chief tasks . 
But that mission now seems lost in America .
