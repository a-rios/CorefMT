The Right Revolution for France 
Is France about to exchange the fake revolution of May 1968 for a sham counter-revolution this year , or have the French given Nicolas Sarkozy a mandate for real change to modernize their country ? 
Why has Sarkozy won election as France &apos;s president , and what are the likely consequences of his victory for France , Europe , and the world ? 
Above all , Sarkozy won because , while some who voted for him may have feared that he was &quot; too much &quot; in terms of personality , many more believed that Ségolène Royal was simply &quot; too little &quot; in terms of gravitas - an impression more confirmed than dissipated by their one face-to-face debate . 
Royal &apos;s failure , despite her energy and determination , was not because she is a woman , but in spite of it . 
In 1968 , after ten years of Charles de Gaulle , and in the midst of a period of strong growth and full employment , the French were bored . 
Today , after 12 years of Jacques Chirac and 14 years of François Mitterrand , with a growth rate lower than most of Europe and a level of debt and unemployment higher than most , France is worried about decline and ripe for reform . 
What Sarkozy understood better than anyone is that , 39 years after May 1968 , France is in the mood for work , not love . 
Most voters who backed Sarkozy expect a different sort of state , one that is more capable of providing physical security against violence and less capable of complicating their lives in economic and fiscal terms . 
This France endorses Sarkozy with enthusiasm ; others view him as the unpleasant but necessary medicine France needs to cure its malaise . 
Royal &apos;s last-minute warnings that France would explode as a result of Sarkozy &apos;s election were neither serious nor dignified . 
Yet France is a deeply divided country and a difficult one to reform . 
It is not Great Britain in the 1970 &quot; s , a country that truly had nothing to lose by taking Margaret Thatcher &apos;s harsh road of structural change . 
From their unique lifestyle to their still efficient public services , the French know that their country is not performing so badly . 
But , with a mixture of moroseness and voluntary submission , they now know that they must face their limitations . 
Sarkozy has less than six months to implement the key reforms necessary if France wants to catch up with Europe &apos;s growth leaders . 
For that to happen , he needs a parliamentary majority , which he should get in the upcoming legislative elections . 
But most of all , Sarkozy needs the French to be coherent about themselves . 
To achieve this , he must rally the positive energies that brought him to power , without inflaming the negative energies that will gather to resist change . 
Indeed , this will be Sarkozy &apos;s main challenge . 
He demonstrated his pedagogic talents during the campaign . 
But firmness must be accompanied by a strong sense of respect for all those , particularly in the immigrant community , who did not vote for him . 
To win , he exploited the fears of a large part of the electorate ; to succeed , he must instill hope . 
For Europe , Sarkozy &apos;s election is not a bad omen . 
While the European Union &apos;s problems will not be resolved because France has a new president , Sarkozy &apos;s vision of a simplified constitutional treaty to replace the draft that French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005 is more realistic than Royal &apos;s call for a new referendum . 
A few years ago , Sarkozy alluded to a Club of Six to guide Europe . 
But Poland has excluded itself from the countries that matter politically , and leaders in Italy and Spain openly campaigned for Royal . 
The seemingly euro-skeptic Gordon Brown is about to replace Tony Blair in Britain . 
So the Franco-German alliance will resume a leading role , if only by default . 
Of course , Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not reproduce the special alliances of Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , or François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl . 
But the future of Europe will once more depend largely on the governments in Berlin and Paris . 
That said , Sarkozy &apos;s victory will not make a huge difference for the world beyond Europe . 
While Chirac took a keen interest in world affairs , Sarkozy , by both inclination and political calculus , will concentrate , at least initially - and in the absence of a major international crisis - on internal matters . 
Even in transatlantic relations , change will be more a matter of style than content . 
Yet Sarkozy &apos;s international influence has already been felt in the case of Turkey . 
The combination of his clear opposition to Turkey &apos;s admission to the EU and uncertainty about the ultimate agenda of the Islamist party in power there has contributed , at least in part , to the current Turkish crisis . 
Why should the opposing forces in Turkey behave with restraint if the moderating prospect of EU membership no longer exists ? 
France has a unique opportunity to adjust itself to the necessity of reform . 
The French people have demonstrated maturity . 
But Sarkozy will have to act responsibly in proving that he really can change the country and reconcile the French with themselves and with France &apos;s position in a globalized world .
