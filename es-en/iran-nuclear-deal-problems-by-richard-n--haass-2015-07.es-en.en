Living With the Iran Nuclear Deal 
NEW YORK - It is probable that after 60 days of intense debate in Washington , DC , and conceivably Tehran , the &quot; Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , &quot; signed on July 14 by Iran and the UN Security Council &apos;s five permanent members plus Germany ( the P5 + 1 ) , will enter into force . 
But no one should confuse this outcome with a solution to the problem of Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions or its contributions to the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East . 
On the contrary , depending on how it is implemented and enforced , the agreement could make matters worse . 
This is not to suggest the JCPOA makes no contribution . 
It places a ceiling for the next decade on the quantity and quality of centrifuges Iran is allowed to operate and allows the country to possess only a small amount of low-enriched uranium for the next 15 years . 
The agreement also establishes , in US President Barack Obama &apos;s words , a &quot; where necessary , when necessary &quot; inspections mechanism that has the potential to verify whether Iran is meeting these and other commitments . 
The net result is that the accord should lengthen the period it would take Iran to produce one or more nuclear weapons from several months to as much as a year , making it more likely that such an effort would be discovered in time . 
The prospect that the JCPOA could keep Iran without nuclear weapons for 15 years is its main attraction . 
Sanctions alone could not have accomplished this , and using military force would have entailed considerable risk with uncertain results . 
On the other hand ( there always is another hand in diplomacy ) , the agreement permits Iran to keep far more nuclear-related capacity than it would need if it were interested only in civil research and in demonstrating a symbolic ability to enrich uranium . 
The agreement also provides Iran with extensive relief from economic sanctions , which will fuel the regime &apos;s ability to support dangerous proxies throughout the Middle East , back a sectarian government in Baghdad , and prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
Moreover , the accord does not rule out all nuclear-related research and does not constrain work on missiles . 
Sales of ballistic missiles and missile parts to Iran are banned for no more than eight years . 
Sales of conventional arms to Iran are prohibited for no more than five years . 
There is also the danger that Iran will fail to comply with parts of the agreement and undertake prohibited work . 
Given Iran &apos;s record , this has understandably been the focus of much concern and criticism regarding the pact . 
What matters is that non-compliance be met with renewed sanctions and , if needed , military force . 
A bigger problem has received much less attention : the risk of what will happen if Iran does comply with the agreement . 
Even without violating the accord , Iran can position itself to break out of nuclear constraints when the agreement &apos;s critical provisions expire . 
At that point , there will be little to hold it back except the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , a voluntary agreement that does not include penalties for non-compliance . 
It is important that the United States ( ideally , joined by other countries ) let Iran know that any action to put itself in a position to field nuclear weapons after 15 years , though not explicitly precluded by the accord , will not be tolerated . 
Harsh sanctions should be reintroduced at the first sign that Iran is preparing a post-JCPOA breakout ; this , too , is not precluded by the accord . 
Iran should likewise be informed that the US and its allies would undertake a preventive military strike if it appeared to be attempting to present the world with a fait accompli . 
The world erred in allowing North Korea to pass the nuclear-weapons threshold ; it should not make the same mistake again . 
In the meantime , a major effort must be launched to assuage the concerns of Iran &apos;s neighbors , several of which will be tempted to hedge their bets against Iran &apos;s potential breakout in 15 years by pursuing nuclear programs of their own . 
The Middle East is already nightmarish enough without the added risks posed by a number of would-be nuclear powers . 
Obama &apos;s claim that the agreement has &quot; stopped the spread of nuclear weapons in this region &quot; is premature , at best . 
It will also be essential to rebuild strategic trust between the US and Israel ; indeed , this will need to be a high priority for Obama &apos;s successor . 
And the US should push back as warranted against Iran &apos;s foreign policy or treatment of its own people . 
None of this rules out selective cooperation with Iran , be it in Afghanistan , Syria , or Iraq , if interests overlap . 
But here , too , realism should prevail . 
The notion that the nuclear agreement will lead Iran to moderate its radicalism and rein in its strategic ambitions should not be anyone &apos;s baseline scenario . 
In fact , the emergence of an ever more capable Iran , not a transformed one , is likely to be one of the main challenges confronting the Middle East , if not the world , in the coming years .
