The Real Danger of Global Warming 
PRAGUE - I am surprised at how so many people nowadays in Europe , the United States , and elsewhere have come to support policies underpinned by hysteria over global warming , particularly cap-and-trade legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and subsidies for &quot; green &quot; energy sources . 
I am convinced that this is a misguided strategy - not only because of the uncertainty about the dangers that global warming might pose , but also because of the certainty of the damage that these proposed policies aimed at mitigation will impose . 
I was invited to address this issue at a recent conference in Santa Barbara , California . 
My audience included business leaders who hope to profit from cap-and-trade policies and from subsidies for renewable energy and &quot; green &quot; jobs . 
My advice to them was to not get caught up in the hysteria . 
Europe is several years ahead of the US in implementing policies intended to mitigate global warming . 
All of the European Union &apos;s member countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and adopted a wide range of policies to lower their emissions and meet their Kyoto targets . 
These policies include a cap-and-trade initiative known as the Emissions Trading Scheme , steep fuel taxes , and ambitious programs to build windmills and other renewable energy projects . 
These policies were undertaken at a time when the EU economy was doing well and - one hopes - with full knowledge that they would have significant costs . 
With the global financial crisis and the sudden economic downturn , two things are becoming clear . 
First , it will be difficult to afford these expensive new sources of energy . 
Second , energy rationing policies like cap-and-trade will be a permanent drag on economic activity . 
Ironically , emissions have not decreased as a result of these policies , but are doing so now as the world economy moves into recession . 
This is not a surprise to someone like me , having been actively involved in my country &apos;s transition from communism to a free society and market economy . 
The old , outmoded heavy industries that were the pride of our Communist regime were shut down - practically overnight - because they could not survive the opening of the economy . 
The result was a dramatic decline in CO2 emissions . 
The secret behind the cut in emissions was economic decline . 
As the economies of the Czech Republic and other central and eastern European countries were rebuilt and began to grow again , emissions have naturally started to increase . 
It should be clear to everyone that there is a very strong correlation between economic growth and energy use . 
So I am amazed to see people going along with the currently fashionable political argument that policies like cap-and-trade , government mandates , and subsidies for renewable energy can actually benefit an economy . 
It is claimed that government , working together with business , will create &quot; a new energy economy , &quot; that the businesses involved will profit , and that everyone will be better off . 
This is a fantasy . 
Cap-and-trade can only work by raising energy prices . 
Consumers who are forced to pay higher prices for energy will have less money to spend on other things . 
While the individual companies that provide the higher-priced &quot; green &quot; energy may do well , the net economic effect will be negative . 
It is necessary to look at the bigger picture . 
Profits can be made when energy is rationed or subsidized , but only within an economy operating at lower , or even negative , growth rates . 
This means that over the longer term , everyone will be competing for a piece of a pie that is smaller than it would have been without energy rationing . 
This does not auger well either for growth or for working our way out of today &apos;s crisis .
