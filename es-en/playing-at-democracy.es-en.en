Playing at Democracy 
In Calcutta , when some younger kid came along and insisted on joining the game my friends were playing , we would let the new kid in , but only after whispering into each other &apos;s ears the words , elé belé . 
An elé belé is a player who thinks he is participating but , in truth , is merely going through the motions . 
Everybody knew that a goal scored by him was not a real goal . 
As a child , mastering the cruel art of elé belé was important . 
When a new kid arrived , accompanied by a doting mother , we could convey to one another with a mere glance that the kid would be an elé belé . 
The technique of elé belé also thrives in the adult world . 
All of us can recall collective decision-making situations - a selection committee , a team for drafting rules - where some members were elé belés . 
All of us have been elé belés at one time or another , though we may not be aware of it . 
What &apos;s true of children and adults is also true of international institutions . 
Indeed , organizations that are officially committed to involving all nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations , while others merely go through the motions of participation . 
The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , supposedly run on the principle of one country one vote , actually has its agenda selected behind the stage by a small group of nations . 
It is now standard practice for international organizations publishing a report to involve all the &quot; stakeholders &quot; and to reflect their opinions . 
So the evolving report is usually put up on a Web site and suggestions are invited from one and all - NGOs , trade unions , and other organizations of civil society . 
This promotes a sense of participation , but as a friend , seasoned in such matters , informed me , the key in the end is to ignore all the comments received and to write up the report as if there were no Web site and no participation . 
Increasingly , free expression of opinion does not influence or restrain how government behaves . 
Consider the United States . 
People expressed their opinion freely - in newspapers , on television , in Internet chat rooms - concerning George Bush &apos;s planned war on Iraq . 
Never before was there so much opposition to a war before it occurred . 
Yet the invasion went ahead . 
The same holds true for Britain and Australia , where public opposition to war counted for naught . 
Part of what happened - or , rather what didn &apos;t happen - is admirable : almost no effort was made to muzzle criticism of the government , as happens in China and scores of dictatorial countries . 
But the world &apos;s great democracies - the US , India , the UK , and others - are increasingly adept at not allowing freely expressed opinions to constrain what the government does . 
The current war in Iraq is perhaps the strongest proof of this . 
Leaving aside the immorality of this war - and immoral it is - I wish to draw attention to this increasing ability and inclination of democracies to &quot; deal &quot; with ( meaning neutralize ) public opinion . 
They have embraced the elé belé strategy : let people believe that their opinion counts , that they are participating in their nation &apos;s decision making , while keeping them out of the real game . 
As democracies mature they become ever more practiced at managing opinion , and in many cases , at shaping opinion . 
Every time Hans Blix commented on the UN inspections of Iraq that he was conducting , members of the Bush administration would paraphrase what Blix said . 
The paraphrasing would subtly change Blix &apos;s comments to suit America &apos;s case for war . 
By repeating the altered comments , it was hoped , mass opinion would shift in favor of the war . 
Overthrowing a totalitarian regime and organizing elections may be hard , but the harder task is to go from voting to establishing a true democracy . 
For people accustomed to living in a totalitarian state , learn what participation means is not easy . 
Hence the popular belief that democracies , like wine , improve with age . 
While this may be true , there is a downside to maturity . 
Just as citizens in a democracy continuously learn to participate , democratic governments continuously learn how to get their way despite the participation . 
It is no use denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize a sham . 
We must recognize and confront this problem to prevent established democracies from atrophying and to help new democracies become more effective . 
For it is not only morally wrong to leave nations and communities feeling marginalized and without voice ; it is a recipe for frustration , rage , and terrorism .
