The Caesar Temptation 
BUENOS AIRES - On June 28 a coup deposed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya , ending his attempt to hold a referendum that would permit his re-election . 
That same day in Argentina , former president Nestor Kirchner was defeated in a mid-term election that many people viewed as a test of whether or not he or his wife Cristina , Argentina &apos;s current president and Nestor &apos;s successor , would continue as president after the vote of 2011 . 
Both events crystallized a peculiar Latin American phenomenon : the temptation to empower a new , local Caesar . 
This &quot; Caesarism &quot; is not a new idea . Instead , it marks the return of a practice that had seemed to have been consigned to history &apos;s dustbin which has now returned with a vengeance . 
In 1919 , the first edition of Democratic Caesarism , by the Venezuelan historian and sociologist Laureano Vallenilla Lanz , was published and widely circulated across the continent . 
Vallenilla claimed to be seeking an effective ( as opposed to the formal ) constitutional system for his country . 
Ninety years later , it looks as though , with the rise of a variety of neo- caudillos , Vallenilla &apos;s idea of the &quot; good Caesar &quot; is coming back . 
Indeed , the victory of presidential incumbents across Latin America has become the predominant trend in the region &apos;s elections . 
For most of the nineteenth century and well into the Cold War era , re-election of a sitting president was generally prohibited in the great majority of Latin American countries , owing to a general fear of leaders remaining permanently in power , abetted by the prevalence of electoral fraud . 
Permanence and fraud are , of course , the hallmarks of authoritarian governments everywhere . 
In the last century , coups d &quot; état were often the means by which ( mostly military ) rulers remained in power for many years , outlawing and persecuting the opposition . 
Nowadays , leaders are achieving the same end at the ballot box . 
This phenomenon is relatively new . 
With Latin America &apos;s most recent democratic transition , which began in the 1980 &quot; s , national constitutions and electoral laws were gradually reformed and modernized . 
Several democratically elected leaders urged constitutional modifications in order to remain in power . 
Over time , what had been an exception became routine : the possibility of consecutive terms or alternating re-election of presidents in countries with little democratic tradition . 
This trend was accompanied by the fact that these societies were marked by a high degree of inequality , as well as unstable economies , weak political parties , fragmented oppositions , and fragile institutions . 
Indeed , in Latin America today there are 14 representative democracies that allow presidential re-election : seven consecutively and seven discontinuously . 
But something new has recently been introduced in Latin America &apos;s political system : the notion of unlimited re-election . 
Hugo Chávez first achieved this in Venezuela , and there are other specters of potentially perpetual re-elections . 
In the Dominican Republic , Leonel Fernández ( 1996-2000 , 2004-2008 , 2008-2012 ) began serving his third four-year term in office in 2008 , and the party in power has not ruled out the possibility of modifying the Carta Magna to allow him yet another term . 
In Colombia , Álvaro Uribe ( 2002-2006 , 2006-2010 ) , in power since 2002 , got his chance for a first re-election in 2006 through a questionable constitutional reform , and appears set to try for a third term by forcing a referendum to amend the constitution again . 
In Brazil , Luis Inácio Lula da Silva , in power since 2003 , was re-elected in 2007 , and now many members of his party are pushing for a constitutional reform that would allow him a third term . 
In a recent interview with the British journalist David Frost , Nicaragua &apos;s President Daniel Ortega , who returned to power in 2006 , declared himself in favor of immediate re-election . 
Before having completed a year in office , Fernando Lugo , President of Paraguay , declared himself in favor of presidential re-election , currently prohibited in his country . 
In Bolivia and Ecuador , immediate re-election is already possible . 
In short , Latin America appears to be becoming a region of democracy by plebiscite . 
Many of the presidents re-elected , either directly or by alternating terms with someone else , a la the Kirchners , won because they seemed to be responding to social demands for more security or less poverty . 
So Latin America is now constantly presented with &quot; extraordinary &quot; situations that supposedly require a certain individual , such as a great , benevolent cacique , to occupy the center of the political scene and govern with an enormous discretionary capacity . 
But , as the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham once wrote , the more one is exposed to the exercise of political power , the greater the temptations . 
True to that dictum , the excessive personalization of politics , the search for political hegemony , and the fragmentation of the opposition reflected in Latin America &apos;s neo-caesarism have served to concentrate power in the executive and hollow out countervailing institutions , including intermediary bodies between the state and society . 
The attraction of remaining in power is getting stronger across the region . 
In view of this , it is essential to seek better systems of checks and balances as well as to strengthen and sharpen public control of the executive . 
All of these tasks are domestic ; the danger posed by the profusion of re-elected presidents will not be checked by external forces . 
Moreover , since Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo , the United States has lost its formerly strong authority in promoting democracy . 
Confused and self-absorbed , Europe is not in the best position to wield influence . 
Russia and China continue to apply their own authoritarian formulas at home and have little to offer internationally to curb caudillismo . 
So the problem of democratic caesarism is one for Latin America &apos;s people to confront .
