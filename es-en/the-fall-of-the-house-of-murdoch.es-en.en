The Fall of the House of Murdoch 
NEW YORK - During the four decades since the Watergate affair engulfed US President Richard Nixon , politicians have repeatedly ignored the scandal &apos;s main lesson : the cover-up is worse than the crime . 
Like Nixon , they have paid a higher price for concealing their misdeeds than they would have for the misdeeds alone . 
Now , for once , comes a scandal that breaks that rule : the United Kingdom &apos;s phone-hacking affair , which has shaken British politics to its foundations . 
Over the past decade , the tabloid newspaper The News of the World , owned by Rupert Murdoch &apos;s News Corporation , targeted 4,000 people &apos;s voicemail . 
The list includes not only royalty , celebrities , and other VIPs , but also the families of servicemen killed in Afghanistan and Iraq , and those of victims of the July 2005 terrorist attack in London . 
It all unraveled when The Guardian reported that the tabloid had hacked into the voicemail of missing 13-year-old Milly Dowler , apparently in the hope of obtaining some private expressions of family members &quot; grief or desperation that it could splash on its front page . 
When the girl &apos;s murdered body was found six months later , the family and the police thought she might still be alive , because The News of the World &apos;s operatives were deleting messages when her phone &apos;s mailbox became full . 
( According to Scotland Yard , Murdoch hacks reportedly bribed mid-level police officers to supply information as well . ) 
In the extensive annals of eavesdropping , all of this is something new . 
Not even Stalin wiretapped the dead . 
A cover-up ensued . 
James Murdoch , Rupert &apos;s son and Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corporation &apos;s European and Asian operations , authorized a secret payment of Â£ 1 million ( $ 1.6 million ) to buy the silence of hacking victims . 
Millions of in-house emails reportedly have been destroyed . 
Still , it seems safe to say that the peculiarly repellant inhumanity of the original deeds will remain more shocking than the details of this or any other cover-up . 
Even so , the political consequences of the phone-hacking scandal will depend on far more than the outcome of the official investigations now underway in Britain . 
Above all , the scandal &apos;s impact will depend on how governments and citizens assess what News Corporation really is . 
The Murdochs call News Corporation a journalistic enterprise . 
In fact , it is , first , an entertainment company , with the bulk of its revenue coming from its film and television holdings . 
Second , and more importantly , it is a propaganda machine for right-wing causes and political figures . 
This is News Corporation &apos;s main face in the US , in the form of Fox News , whose hallmark has been relentless propagation of right-wing ideology . 
Whereas political propaganda had once been the domain of governments and political parties , Fox News is formally independent of both - though itoverwhelmingly serves the interests of America &apos;s Republican Party . 
In Britain , News Corporation has been creating a sort of state unto itself by corrupting the police , assuming police powers of surveillance , and intimidating politicians into looking the other way . 
In the US , it has behaved similarly , using corporate media power to breathe life into a stand-alone political organization , the Tea Party . 
All of this is far removed from what a journalistic organization is supposed to do . 
Journalism &apos;s essential role in a democracy is to enable people to fulfill their roles as citizens by providing information about government , other powerful institutions , civil movements , international events , and so on . 
Not surprisingly , at Fox News , as at many other News Corporation outlets , editorial independence is sacrificed to iron-fisted centralized control . 
News and commentary are mingled in an uninterrupted stream of political campaigning . 
Ideology trumps factuality . 
Indeed , its specific genius has been to turn propaganda into a popular and financial success . 
Given The News of the World &apos;s profitability , no one should be surprised if the Murdochs have been replicating their sunken British flagship &apos;s reprehensible behavior elsewhere . 
The Murdochs are fusing these entities into a single unaccountable power that , as we see in Britain today , lacks any restraint or scruple . 
That effort should compel us to confront an uncomfortable reality underlying both the British phone-hacking scandal , with its penumbra of appalling cruelty and wanton corruption , and Fox News , America &apos;s most popular news channel : too many people want what the News Corporation has been offering . 
To glimpse just how dangerous , consider Italy , where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s MediaSet conglomerate has seduced broad swathes of the electorate since the 1980 &quot; s with a Murdoch-like combination of insipid variety shows and partisan political theater . 
When Italy &apos;s postwar party system collapsed in the early 1990 &quot; s , Berlusconi was able to establish his own political party , win power , and , over the course of three governments , bend laws and government institutions to serve his business and personal interests . 
The News Corporation seems determined to take Britain and the US down a similar path . 
Prime Minister David Cameron - who previously cultivated close ties with News Corporation leaders , even employing as his press secretary The News of the World &apos;s former editor , who was recently arrested for his role in the scandal - called the phone hacking &quot; disgusting . &quot; 
Meanwhile , Labour leaders , who had also sought the Murdochs &quot; favor , have vowed to block News Corporation &apos;s bid for full ownership of Britain &apos;s largest pay-television broadcaster . 
Whether the rebellion will jump across the Atlantic remains to be seen .
