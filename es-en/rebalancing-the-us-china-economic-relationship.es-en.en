Rebalancing the US-China Economic Relationship 
CAMBRIDGE - As the global economy stabilizes , there is a growing danger that the United States and China will slip back into their pre-crisis economic patterns , placing themselves and the rest of the world at risk . 
Despite Chinese official rhetoric about the need for a new global currency to replace the dollar , and US lawmakers &quot; flirtation with &quot; Buy American &quot; clauses ( which scares everyone , not just the Chinese ) , no one will want to rock a boat that has almost capsized . 
So China continues to run a giant trade surplus , and the US continues to spend and borrow . 
Short-run stability certainly seems attractive right now . 
But if the US-China trade and debt relationship merely picks up where it left off , what will prevent recurrence of the same unsustainable dynamic that we just witnessed ? 
After all , huge US foreign borrowing was clearly a key factor in creating the recent financial mess , while China &apos;s excessive reliance on export-driven growth has made it extraordinarily vulnerable to a sudden drop in global demand . 
A giant fiscal stimulus in both countries has helped prevent further damage temporarily , but where is the needed change ? 
Wouldn &apos;t it be better to accept more adjustment now in the form of slower post-crisis growth than to set ourselves up for an even bigger crash ? 
True , both the US administration and China &apos;s leadership have made some sensible proposals for change . 
But is their heart in it ? 
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has floated a far-reaching overhaul of the financial system , and China &apos;s leaders are starting to take steps towards improving the country &apos;s social safety net . 
Both of these measures should help a lot in bringing the US and Chinese trade balances toward more sustainable levels . 
Greater financial regulation in the US means consumers will not be able to borrow so easily to rack up huge mortgage and credit card debt . 
Chinese consumers , on the other hand , might actually start spending more of their income if they can worry a bit less about saving for health care , their children &apos;s education , and their old-age retirement . 
Nevertheless , there is cause for concern . 
As the world seems to emerge from its horrific financial crisis , it is human nature for complacency to set it , and the domestic politics of the US-China trade and financial relationship is deeply rooted . 
One shudders to think what lessons the US financial sector will draw if , after the multi-trillion dollar bailout , there are only superficial , toothless reforms . 
And will China &apos;s coastal export interests again prevail in exchange rate policy decisions , at the expense of poor inland consumers ? 
Another reason to worry is that the global recovery is still fragile . 
US and Chinese leaders have fought the crisis with not only massive fiscal stimulus , but also deep intervention into credit markets . 
Such extraordinary fiscal largesse , all at taxpayers &quot; expense , cannot continue indefinitely . 
World Bank President Robert Zoellick has rightly warned that all this massive temporary fiscal stimulus is a &quot; sugar high &quot; that will ultimately pass without deeper reforms . 
As I have argued before , the endgame to the financial bailouts and fiscal expansion will almost certainly mean higher interest rates , higher taxes , and , quite possibly , inflation . 
For better or for worse , it may not be possible to turn back the clock . 
The US consumer , whose gluttony helped fuel growth throughout the world for more than a decade , seems finally set to go on a diet . 
In addition to tighter credit , falling home prices and high unemployment will continue to put a crimp on US consumer spending . 
Frankly , higher US personal saving rates would not be a bad thing . 
It would almost certainly help reduce the risk of an early repeat of the financial crisis . 
The obvious candidates to replace them are Chinese and other Asian consumers , whose combined economies are more than equal to that of the US . 
But are Asian governments prepared to abandon their mercantilist paradigm ? 
Outside Japan , Asia policymakers certainly don &apos;t seem amenable to exchange-rate appreciation 
Since the beginning of this decade , at least a few economists ( including me ) have warned that the global trade and current-account imbalances needed to be reined in to reduce the chance of a severe financial crisis . 
The US and China are not solely responsible for these imbalances , but their relationship is certainly at the center of it . 
Prior to the crisis , there was plenty of talk , including high-level meetings brokered by the International Monetary Fund , but only minimal action . 
Now , the risks have spilled out to the entire world . 
Let &apos;s hope that this time there is more than talk . If US and Chinese policymakers instead surrender to the temptation of slipping back to the pre-crisis imbalances , the roots of the next crisis will grow like bamboo . And that would not be good news for the US and China , or anyone else .
