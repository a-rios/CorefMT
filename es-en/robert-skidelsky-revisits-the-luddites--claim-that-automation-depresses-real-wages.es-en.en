Death to Machines ? 
LONDON - At the start of the Industrial Revolution , textile workers in the Midlands and the North of England , mainly weavers , staged a spontaneous revolt , smashing machinery and burning factories . 
The rebels took their name , and inspiration , from the apocryphal Ned Ludd , supposedly an apprentice weaver who smashed two knitting frames in 1779 in a &quot; fit of passion . &quot; 
Robert Calvert wrote a ballad about him in 1985 : &quot; They said Ned Ludd was an idiot boy / That all he could do was wreck and destroy , &quot; the song begins . 
And then : &quot; He turned to his workmates and said : &quot; Death to Machines &quot; / They tread on our future and stamp on our dreams . &quot; 
The Luddites &quot; rampage was at its height in 1811-12 . 
An alarmed government sent in more troops to garrison the disturbed areas than were then available to Wellington in the Peninsular War against Napoleon . 
More than a hundred Luddites were hanged or transported to Australia . 
These measures restored peace . 
Historians tell us that the Luddites were victims of a temporary conjuncture of rising prices and falling wages that threatened them with starvation in a society with minimal welfare provision . 
The Luddites , however , blamed their misfortune on the machines themselves . 
The new knitting frames and power looms could weave yarn into cloth much faster than the most skilled artisan weaver working in his own cottage . 
Caught between fixed costs ( the hire and upkeep of their domestic appliances ) and falling prices for their products , tens of thousands of families were doomed to become paupers . 
Their plight evoked some sympathy ( Lord Byron made a brilliant speech in their defense in the House of Lords ) ; their arguments , however , did not . 
There could be no rejecting progress : the future lay with machine production , not with old-fashioned handicrafts . 
Trying to regulate trade , Adam Smith taught , was like trying to &quot; regulate the wind . &quot; 
Thomas Paine spoke for middle-class radicalism when he said , &quot; We know that every machine for the abridgment of labor is a blessing to the great family of which we are part . &quot; 
There would , of course , be some temporary unemployment in the technologically advancing sectors ; but , in the long run , machine-assisted production , by increasing the real wealth of the community , would enable full employment at higher wages . 
That was the initial view of David Ricardo , the most influential economist of the nineteenth century . 
But in the third edition of his Principles of Political Economy ( 1817 ) , he inserted a chapter on machinery that changed tack . 
As a result , &quot; the opinion entertained by the laboring class , that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests , is not founded on prejudice and error , but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy . &quot; 
Just consider : machinery &quot; may render the population redundant &quot; ! 
A bleaker prospect is not to be found in economics . 
Ricardo &apos;s orthodox followers took no notice of it , assuming it to be a rare lapse by the Master . 
But was it ? 
The pessimistic argument is as follows : If machines costing $ 5 an hour can produce the same amount as workers costing $ 10 an hour , employers have an incentive to substitute machines for labor up to the point that the costs are equal - that is , when the wages of the workers have fallen to $ 5 an hour . 
As machines become ever more productive , so wages tend to fall even more , toward zero , and the population becomes redundant . 
Now , it did not work out like that . 
The pessimistic argument ignored the fact that by lowering the cost of goods , machines increased workers &quot; real wages - enabling them to buy more - and that the rise in labor productivity enabled employers ( often under pressure from trade unions ) to pay more per worker . 
It also assumed that machines and workers were close substitutes , whereas more often than not workers could still do things that machines could not . 
However , over the last 30 years , the share of wages in national income has been falling , owing to what MIT professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee call the &quot; second machine age . &quot; 
Computerized technology has penetrated deeply into the service sector , taking over jobs for which the human factor and &quot; cognitive functions &quot; were hitherto deemed indispensable . 
In retail , for example , Walmart and Amazon are prime examples of new technology driving down workers &quot; wages . 
Because computer programs and humans are close substitutes for such jobs , and given the predictable improvement in computing power , there seems to be no technical obstacle to the redundancy of workers across much of the service economy . 
Yes , there will still be activities that require human skills , and these skills can be improved . 
But it is broadly true that the more computers can do , the less humans need to do . 
The prospect of the &quot; abridgment of labor &quot; should fill us with hope rather than foreboding . 
But , in our kind of society , there are no mechanisms for converting redundancy into leisure . 
That brings me back to the Luddites . 
They claimed that because machines were cheaper than labor , their introduction would depress wages . 
They argued the case for skill against cheapness . 
Above all , they understood that the solution to the problems created by machines would not be found in laissez-faire nostrums . 
The Luddites were wrong on many points ; but perhaps they deserve more than a footnote .
