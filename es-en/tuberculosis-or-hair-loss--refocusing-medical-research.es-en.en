Refocusing Medical Research 
PRINCETON - In an ideal world , the amount of money we spend on medical research to prevent or cure a disease would be proportional to its seriousness and the number of people who suffer from it . 
In the real world , 90 % of the money spent on medical research is focused on conditions that are responsible for just 10 % of the deaths and disability caused by diseases globally . 
In other words , the diseases that cause nine-tenths of what the World Health Organization refers to as &quot; the global burden of disease &quot; are getting only one-tenth of the world &apos;s medical research effort . 
As a result , millions of people die every year from diseases for which no new drugs are in the pipeline , while drug companies pour billions into developing cures for erectile dysfunction and baldness . 
But blaming drug companies is too easy a response . 
They cannot justify developing new drugs unless they can expect to recoup their costs through sales . 
If they target diseases that affect affluent people , or people living in countries with national health insurance , they will be able to patent any new drugs they discover . 
For the 20 years that the patent lasts , they will have a monopoly on the drug &apos;s sale and be able to command a high price . 
If drug companies target diseases that affect only people who are unable to pay high prices for drugs , they cannot expect to cover their research costs , let alone make a profit . 
No matter how much their directors may want to focus on the diseases that kill the most people , the current system of financial incentives means that if they did so , their shareholders would remove them , or their companies would soon be out of business . 
The problem is with the system , not with the individuals who make their choices within it . 
At a meeting in Oslo in August , Incentives for Global Health , a nonprofit organization directed by Aidan Hollis , professor of economics at the University of Calgary , and Thomas Pogge , professor of philosophy and international affairs at Yale , launched a radical new proposal to change the incentives under which corporations are rewarded for developing new medicines . They suggest that governments contribute to a Health Impact Fund that would pay pharmaceutical companies in proportion to the extent to which their products reduce the global burden of disease . 
The fund would not replace existing patent laws , but would offer an alternative to them . Pharmaceutical companies could continue to patent and sell their products as they do now . Alternatively , they could register a new drug with the Heath Impact Fund , which would set a low price based on the drug &apos;s manufacturing cost . 
Instead of profiting from sales at high prices , the corporation would become eligible for a share of all payments made by the fund over the next ten years . 
The size of the share would be calculated by assessing the contribution the drug has made to reducing death and disability . 
The beauty of the scheme is that it gives economic support to the idea that all human lives are of equal value . 
For products that drug companies register with the Health Impact Fund , corporations would get the same reward for saving the lives of Africans living in extreme poverty as they would get for saving the lives of wealthy citizens of affluent nations . 
The most potentially lucrative targets would become the diseases that kill the most people , because that is where a breakthrough drug would have the biggest impact on global health . 
Moreover , companies would have an incentive to produce and distribute drugs at the lowest possible price , because only when the poor could use them would the drug save the greatest possible number of lives . 
A company might choose to allow cheap generic copies of its drug to be made in developing countries , because that would enable it to be used more widely , and to save more lives - for which the Health Impact Fund would reward the company that registered it . 
Hollis and Pogge estimate that about $ 6 billion a year would be required to enable the Fund to provide a sufficient incentive for drug companies to register products that target the diseases of the poor . 
That figure would be reached if countries accounting for one-third of the global economy - say , most European nations , or the United States and one or two small affluent nations - contributed 0.03 % of their gross national income , or three cents for every $ 100 they earn . 
That &apos;s not a trivial sum , but it isn &apos;t out of reach , especially considering that affluent nations would also benefit from cheaper drugs and from medical research that was focused on reducing disease rather than on maximizing profits .
