NATO and the New Turkey 
ISTANBUL - Turkey joined NATO at the beginning of the Cold War to gain United States protection in the event of a Soviet attack . 
Back then , Turkey was clearly on the frontline ; today , however , its leaders are assertively pursuing an independent foreign and security policy , and their growing confidence is now testing the Alliance &apos;s cohesion . 
Meanwhile , cooperation between NATO and the European Union remains stalled , owing to the dispute with Turkey over divided Cyprus . 
Moreover , in sharp contrast to the majority of NATO members , Turkey maintains that Iran and Syria should not be viewed as threats . 
And , at the height of the Libyan crisis , while NATO officials were preparing operational plans to intervene , Turkey &apos;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan was speaking out against military action . 
As a result , some now say that Turkey is turning its back on the West . 
But it would be more accurate to say that Turkey is broadening its reach . 
Turkey may indeed cause tensions within NATO , but its position represents an astute balance between loyalty to the Alliance and appropriate regard for its own national interests . 
Geopolitical changes like the end of the Cold War and , lately , the push for democracy in the Middle East , along with the desire to have &quot; zero problems &quot; with Turkey &apos;s neighbors , have created new objectives for Turkish foreign-policy strategists . 
Indeed , Turkey &apos;s leaders are downgrading the importance of &quot; hard power &quot; security issues in favor of enhancing the country &apos;s soft power while also grasping economic opportunities . 
A primary consequence of this &quot; de-securitization &quot; of Turkish foreign policy has been an altered balance of power between the country &apos;s military and civilian establishments . 
A no less important consequence is the changed relationship between Turkey and the West . 
In years past , defense partnership constituted a pillar of Turkey &apos;s relations with the West . 
But it was an asymmetrical relationship , in which Turkey , as a consumer of security , was largely dependent on the West . 
Turkey &apos;s foreign-policy choices were constrained by the need to remain aligned with its security provider . 
Nowadays , however , declining threat perceptions have fundamentally altered this perspective , and reduced Turkey &apos;s need to act in unison with the West . 
Moreover , Turkey &apos;s shrinking pre-occupation with its territorial integrity has significantly diminished the West &apos;s leverage . 
The loosening of the security relationship has given Turkey greater latitude in foreign policy . 
Yet it would be wrong to argue that Turkey is pulling away from NATO . 
Turkey is still an active and influential member , and hopes to benefit as much as possible from membership . 
Turkey is committed to NATO , and its military budget more or less fulfills NATO &apos;s defense-spending criterion of 2 % of GDP . 
It also commits troops to NATO operations , notably to the ISAF operation in Afghanistan . 
Turkey &apos;s role within the Alliance is more active than that of the vast majority of other member states . 
Turkey is pushing the alliance to adapt to new security challenges , yet it nonetheless remains steadfast in its adherence to NATO &apos;s nuclear-sharing policies . 
Turkey is one of the six NATO countries that have hosted US tactical nuclear weapons for more than 40 years , including 90 B61 gravity bombs . 
The readiness of the nuclear weapons based on its territory - a matter of weeks or months rather than hours - provides little strategic value . 
Yet Turkey has always argued that a credible NATO nuclear deterrent is vital to the alliance &apos;s collective defense . 
Indeed , Turkey &apos;s position is now at odds with the three West European countries - Belgium , Germany , and the Netherlands - currently calling for a withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from their territory . 
Turkey insists that such decisions cannot be taken unilaterally , and that a NATO-wide consensus is necessary to change this critical element of the alliance &apos;s nuclear deterrence . 
Turkey is also actively involved in NATO &apos;s ongoing deterrence review , which aims to strike a balance between the Alliance &apos;s nuclear and conventional capacities , and is also set to clarify the role of missile defense in this context . 
Turkish officials say that they would not oppose any program that would strengthen NATO &apos;s security . 
But they fear the deployment of a missile-defense system exclusively targeting Turkey &apos;s neighbors . 
As a result , Turkey &apos;s leaders have set out three conditions for acquiescing in such a program . 
First , the system should take into consideration current security risks , based on the existing missile capabilities of non-NATO countries . 
Second , it should cover all of Turkey &apos;s territory . 
Finally , because Turkey has no desire to be a frontline state in the Middle East , as it was during the Cold War , it strenuously objects to Iran and Syria being identified as direct threats . 
Today , Turkey sees its NATO membership as just one aspect of its wider security policy . 
Its government is seeking a strong role in world affairs , and consequently its policies have not always aligned with those of a majority of NATO members . 
Ultimately , though , Turkey &apos;s leaders have no intention of undermining NATO &apos;s cohesiveness and effectiveness . 
On the contrary , their aim is to assert Turkey &apos;s position in NATO so that the Alliance more closely mirrors their own objectives .
