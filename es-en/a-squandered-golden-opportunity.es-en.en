A Squandered Golden Opportunity 
PALO ALTO - A group of multi-national European scientists has used gene-splicing techniques to create an extraordinary tomato . 
It boasts a deep purple skin and flesh , and contains levels of antioxidants 200 % higher than unmodified tomatoes . 
When fed to highly cancer-susceptible mice , the tomatoes significantly extended the mice &apos;s lifespan . 
These studies have received wide attention , but an equally momentous achievement of genetic modification has been largely ignored for almost a decade . 
That innovation is &quot; Golden Rice , &quot; a collection of new rice varieties that is bio-fortified , or enriched , by genes that express beta-carotene , the precursor of vitamin A , which is converted in the body , as needed , to the active form . 
Most physicians in North America and Europe never see a single case of vitamin A deficiency in their professional lifetimes . 
But the situation is very different in poor countries , where vitamin A deficiency is epidemic among the poor , whose diet is heavily dominated by rice ( which contains neither beta-carotene nor vitamin A ) or other carbohydrate-rich , vitamin-poor sources of calories . 
In developing countries , 200-300 million children of preschool age are at risk of vitamin A deficiency , which can be devastating and even fatal . 
It increases susceptibility to common childhood infections such as measles and diarrheal diseases , and is the single most important cause of childhood blindness in developing countries . 
Every year , about 500,000 children become blind as a result of vitamin A deficiency , and 70 % die within a year of losing their sight . 
In theory , we could simply supplement children &apos;s diets with vitamin A in capsules , or add it to some staple foodstuff , the way that we add iodine to table salt to prevent hypothyroidism and goiter . 
Unfortunately , neither the resources - hundreds of millions of dollars annually - nor the infrastructure for distribution are available . 
Biotechnology offers a better , cheaper , and more feasible solution : Golden Rice , which incorporates beta-carotene into the genetically altered rice grains . 
The concept is simple . 
Although rice plants do not normally synthesize beta-carotene in the endosperm ( seeds ) , they do make it in the green portions of the plant . 
By using gene-splicing techniques to introduce the two genes that express these enzymes , the pathway is restored and the rice grains accumulate therapeutic amounts of beta-carotene . 
Golden Rice offers the potential to make contributions to human health and welfare as monumental as the discovery and distribution of the Salk polio vaccine . 
With wide use , it could save hundreds of thousands of lives every year and enhance the quality of life for millions more . 
But one aspect of this shining story is tarnished . 
Intransigent opposition by anti-science , anti-technology activists - Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth , and a few other groups - has spurred already risk-averse regulators to adopt an overly cautious approach that has stalled approvals . 
There is absolutely nothing about Golden Rice that should require endless case-by-case reviews and bureaucratic dithering . 
As the British journal Nature argued in 1992 , a broad scientific consensus holds that &quot; the same physical and biological laws govern the response of organisms modified by modern molecular and cellular methods and those produced by classical methods .... 
Put another way , government regulation of field research with plants should focus on the traits that may be related to risk - invasiveness , weediness , toxicity , and so forth - rather than on whether one or another technique of genetic manipulation was used . 
Nine years after its creation , despite its vast potential to benefit humanity - and a negligible probability of harm to human health or the environment - Golden Rice remains hung up in regulatory red tape , with no end in sight . 
( Cancer-preventing tomatoes , take notice . ) 
By contrast , plants constructed with less precise techniques such as hybridization or mutagenesis generally are subject to no government scrutiny or requirements ( or opposition from activists ) at all . 
That applies even to the numerous new plant varieties that have resulted from &quot; wide crosses , &quot; hybridizations that move genes from one species or genus to another - across what used to be considered natural breeding boundaries . 
Judith Rodin , the president of the Rockefeller Foundation , announced last October that her organization will provide funding to the International Rice Research Institute to shepherd Golden Rice through national regulatory approval processes in Bangladesh , India , Indonesia , and the Philippines . 
This is good news , but what is really needed is a multi-faceted , aggressive reform of the regulatory process so that all new genetic constructions will have a chance to succeed . 
In an April editorial in the journal Science , Nina Fedoroff , an eminent plant geneticist who serves as senior scientific advisor to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , wrote : &quot; A new Green Revolution demands a global commitment to creating a modern agricultural infrastructure everywhere , adequate investment in training and modern laboratory facilities , and progress toward simplified regulatory approaches that are responsive to accumulating evidence of safety . 
The Golden Rice story makes it clear that we do not yet have the will and the wisdom to make that happen .
