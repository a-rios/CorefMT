Obama &apos;s Hardest Choices Lie Ahead 
TEL AVIV - It was only natural that Barack Obama , a president whose election was one of the most revolutionary events in American history , should fill his first 100 days in office with a breathtaking , all-embracing agenda . 
These are times of trial and upheaval that call for such daring . 
Strikingly energetic and self-confident , Obama has set out on a titanic journey to remake America &apos;s economy and redress a broken and dysfunctional international system . 
It is perhaps especially in Obama &apos;s domestic policy - the shift to a more social-democratic tax system and universal health care - that one can best see the new president &apos;s ideological drive . 
When it comes to salvaging America &apos;s collapsing financial system , Obama has been far more interventionist than any European government . 
For once , the faltering Czech presidency of the EU reflected a European consensus when it defined Obama &apos;s astronomic financial stimulus as a &quot; road to hell . &quot; 
The unprecedented explosion of America &apos;s fiscal deficit raises the risk of high inflation in the future - exactly the kind of scenario that Europeans want to prevent at all cost . 
Obama &apos;s foreign policy agenda has been no less audacious than his domestic undertakings . 
After eight years of American unilateralism that left behind a broken transatlantic alliance , resuscitated the specter of a cold war with Russia , and saw the Middle East decline into a doomsday politics , Obama &apos;s injection of new thinking to endemic problems is extremely welcome . 
The organizing principle in the new president &apos;s foreign policy is one of not having principled , ideological guidelines . 
Essentially , his approach to international issues is pragmatic , and , in departing from his predecessor &apos;s penchant for machtpolitik , Obama has pledged always to exhaust diplomacy first . 
But Obama might soon realize that most of his predecessors started as believers in international cooperation , until events forced them to fall back on a strategy of confrontation . 
Not even George W. Bush seemed to be committed to any particular doctrine in foreign affairs before the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , drove him to unleash his ill-conceived &quot; global war on terror . &quot; 
The real test of Obama &apos;s strategy of dialogue and cooperation will come only when it fails , and tough choices will have to be made . 
Repairing old alliances is vital not only for the exercise of American power , but also for Europe &apos;s empowerment as a global player . 
Yet America &apos;s European allies administered Obama &apos;s first setback . 
They applauded him everywhere on his recent trip to Europe , but sent him home almost empty-handed , resisting the idea of a coordinated fiscal stimulus and , after years of preaching multilateralism , turning down his call for more European troops for Afghanistan . 
For many in Europe , it was easier to live against Bush than to make sacrifices with Obama . 
Obama also pushed the &quot; reset button &quot; with Russia , and suggested that he might freeze Bush &apos;s plan to deploy a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland . 
The expectation was that Russia would join the United States in putting pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions . 
Nor was North Korea impressed by Obama &apos;s warnings that America might shoot down its rocket if they went ahead with their launch in defiance of the United Nations . 
Shielded behind a protective China , Kim Jong-il launched his rocket anyway , and the US refrained from action . 
Iran is another front where Obama might be forced to recognize the limits of his conciliatory approach . 
He has waived America &apos;s long-standing demand that Iran stop uranium enrichment as a precondition for negotiations , and he has sworn off any idea of regime change . 
If that happens , then what ? 
Nor is it clear what Obama really means by saying that he recognizes Iran &apos;s &quot; rightful place in the community of nations . &quot; 
If this means a special status at the expense of other Middle East powers such as Egypt or the Gulf states , Obama might run into strong opposition from America &apos;s traditional allies in the region . 
It is right and refreshing that Obama has made clear that America &apos;s aspiration is to lead , not dominate . 
Nor would old enemies and competitors like Russia and China readily abandon the benefits of spoiling American plans . 
It is when this becomes crystal clear , and also when some worn-out foreign-policy paradigms , such as the fetish of a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict fail once again , that real choices will have to be made .
