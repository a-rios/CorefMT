The Elephant &apos;s Choices 
New Delhi - A month after they first queued to vote in India &apos;s mammoth general election , the country &apos;s voters will learn the outcome on May 16 . 
The election , staggered over five phases - involving five polling days over four weeks , rather than one &quot; election day &quot; - will determine who rules the world &apos;s largest democracy . 
Only one thing is certain : no single party will win a majority on its own . 
India is set for more coalition rule . 
That may not be a bad thing . 
India &apos;s last two governments each served a full term and presided over significant economic growth , even though they comprised 23 and 20 parties , respectively . 
Coalition politics gives representation to the myriad interests that make up a diverse and complex society , and ensures that the country as a whole accepts the policies ultimately adopted . 
But coalition rule can also often mean governance of the lowest common denominator , as resistance by any of the government &apos;s significant members to a policy can delay or even thwart it . 
In India &apos;s parliamentary system , if a coalition loses its majority , the government falls , and keeping allies together can sometimes prove a greater priority than getting things done . 
India &apos;s national elections are really an aggregate of thirty different state elections , each influenced by its own local considerations , regional political currents , and different patterns of political incumbency . 
Soon after May 16 , the largest single party that emerges will seek to construct a coalition out of a diverse array of victors from the various states . 
Several outcomes are possible . 
The most likely is that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh &apos;s Indian National Congress , currently leading the government , emerges once again as the largest single party and assembles a new ruling coalition . 
The main alternative would be majority alliance put together by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , led by the 82-year-old Lal Krishna Advani . 
But there is a third possibility : a motley collection of regional parties , together with the Communists , gets enough seats to prevent either of the two big parties from forming a government . 
In that case , a &quot; hung parliament &quot; could see a &quot; third front &quot; coming to power as a minority government , supported tactically by one of the big parties . 
This has happened before - and each time , the government that resulted fell within a year . 
Each alternative could have serious implications for India . 
Though the big parties are broadly committed to continuing an economic policy of liberalization and growth , the BJP is mostly focused on the well-being of India &apos;s merchant class , whereas Congress wishes to redistribute enhanced government revenues to the poor through generous social programs . 
The left , which would strongly influence any &quot; third front &quot; government , are staunchly opposed to economic liberalization and wish to strengthen , rather than dilute , India &apos;s large public sector . 
In foreign policy , India &apos;s growing closeness with the United States under both the BJP and the Congress has proved controversial at home , with leftist parties threatening to scrap the Indo-US nuclear deal and break defense ties with Israel if they come to power . 
Should the regional parties dominate the government , domestic politics would strongly impact India &apos;s foreign policy : the anger of Tamil voters over events in Sri Lanka , or of Muslims over Gaza , would be reflected in the government and therefore constrain policy options . 
The BJP has promised a more hawkish security posture than Congress in the wake of the Mumbai terrorist attacks , but when it was in power it conducted itself remarkably similarly to its rival , initiating a peace process with Pakistan . 
The biggest differences among the various groupings consist in the tone and tenor of their respective visions of India . 
Congress remains a &quot; big tent &quot; party , committed to preserving India &apos;s pluralism and conscious of the multiple identities and interests of India &apos;s many peoples . 
The BJP , which accuses Congress of &quot; appeasing &quot; India &apos;s minorities , hews to a staunchly Hindu-chauvinist line , and has received support from some of the most bigoted and intolerant sections of Indian society . 
The &quot; third front &quot; involves assorted petty particularisms - parties representing the sectarian interests of specific castes , sub-regions , or linguistic groups . 
The danger is that such groups could accentuate the divisions of a fractious society , rather than pull everyone together in the collective national interest . 
That would be a startling change from five years ago . 
The 2004 elections were won by the Congress party , led by a woman political leader of Roman Catholic faith and Italian descent ( Sonia Gandhi ) , who made way for a Sikh prime minister ( Manmohan Singh ) to be sworn by a Muslim ( President Abdul Kalam ) in a country that is 81 % Hindu . 
That single moment captured much of what elections have meant for this diverse democracy . 
But the ultimate reality will remain that of a coalition government trying to make progress in a contentious polity . 
In India , policy changes require political consensus within the ruling coalition , labor laws are strongly defended by unions and political parties , and controversial decisions can be challenged on the streets , in the courts , and ultimately at the polls . 
Necessary policy reforms advocated by a ruling party are often held hostage to the prejudices of its allies . 
So change comes slowly . 
Indian democracy has often been likened to the stately progress of the elephant - ponderous in its gait and reluctant to change course , but not easily swayed from its new path when it does . 
The elephant of Indian democracy will acquire a new set of mahouts before the month &apos;s end . 
That alone makes the election results due on May 16 worth the world &apos;s attention .
