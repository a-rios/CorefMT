The Inflation of Hugo Chávez 
MEXICO CITY - Supporters of Hugo Chávez , the recently deceased Venezuelan president , and even many of his critics , have repeatedly emphasized two supposed achievements that will burnish his legacy . 
First , the share of people living in poverty plummeted to approximately 28 % in 2012 , from a peak of 62 % in 2003 ( though it was 46 % three years earlier , at the beginning of Chávez &apos;s first term ) . 
Second , he gave to a majority of Venezuelans a sense of identity , pride , and dignity long denied them by a corrupt , elitist , light-skinned oligarchy . 
Both claims , however , are only partly true , and only partly account for Chávez &apos;s recurrent electoral victories - 13 of 14 popular votes , including referenda . 
As for the first claim , both The Economist and the Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa were right to put Chávez &apos;s achievement in perspective . 
Almost every country in Latin America has reduced poverty significantly since the beginning of this century , with the extent of progress depending on baselines and cut-off dates , good years and bad years , the reliability of official data , and other factors . 
The reasons for this progress are well known : with the exception of 2001 and 2009 , these were boom years for commodity-exporting countries like Brazil , Argentina , Peru , Chile , and , of course , Venezuela , as well as for manufacturing-based economies , like Mexico . 
Furthermore , during these nearly 15 years , most governments have managed their accounts responsibly : small or no fiscal deficits , low inflation , well-targeted anti-poverty programs , and so on . 
This has helped to lower not only poverty , but also inequality , Latin America &apos;s traditional scourge . 
According to the economist Nora Lustig , between 2000 and 2010 , &quot; income inequality ... declined in all 17 Latin American countries for which comparable data exist . &quot; 
The decline was especially pronounced in the three largest countries - Brazil , Mexico , and Argentina - which comprise nearly 75 % of the region &apos;s population . 
One difference in Venezuela is that Chávez spent more than $ 1 trillion to achieve the same feat - in a country with a population one-sixth the size of Brazil &apos;s and slightly more than one-quarter the size of Mexico &apos;s . 
While the long-term viability and effectiveness of conditional cash-transfer programs in Brazil and Mexico is questionable , these anti-poverty initiatives certainly are better designed than Chávez &apos;s massive , blanket subsidies on everything from poultry and flour to housing and gasoline . 
Then there is the destruction of Venezuelan industry , the spectacular increase in violence , the explosion of foreign debt , and the depletion of foreign-currency reserves that has accompanied Chávez &apos;s so-called &quot; Bolivarian socialism of the twenty-first century . &quot; 
None of these problems has afflicted the region &apos;s other large countries - or at least not to anywhere near the same extent . 
If Chávez had not played with the numbers , as demagogues and populist leaders tend to do , the results would be more disheartening . 
The second argument in defense of Chávez &apos;s legacy is a bit more robust , but not much . 
True , Venezuela &apos;s immense natural riches have been exploited and often squandered by elites more accustomed to the boulevards of Miami than to the slums of Caracas . 
But it is equally true that Venezuela enjoyed 40 years of democratic rule before Chávez , under the 1958 Punto Fijo Pact , whereby two parties , one social democratic and the other social Christian , alternated in power peacefully . 
Venezuela also boasted one of the region &apos;s most vibrant civil societies , with some of its freest and most vigorous media . 
With the exception of the Caracazo - a wave of protests against free-market reforms in 1989 that resulted in an estimated 3,000 deaths - there were only minor bouts of repression . 
To be sure , large swaths of Venezuelan society rightly felt excluded from the country &apos;s cozy elite consensus and insular governing arrangements , and resented it immensely ; but an aspiring middle class comprised roughly half the population . 
Chávez exploited - and widened - that division ; indeed , as the current campaign to elect his successor shows , the country remains more polarized than ever . 
It may well be that Chávez &apos;s purported feats and popularity will outlast him . 
Instead of a simple rotation of elites in power , perhaps what occurred during his time in office was the advent of political leadership that looks , talks , worships , and loves like the people of the country - leadership that identifies with and benefits the millions of Venezuelans who previously were marginalized . 
In that case , Chávez &apos;s designated successor , Nicolás Maduro , will make short work of opposition candidate Henrique Capriles in the upcoming election . 
Chavismo will outlive Chávez . 
But , whatever the outcome , all the mourning and embalming will not alter a simple fact : Venezuela and its people are not clearly better off than they were 14 years ago . 
And whatever modest improvements they may feel in their lives were also secured elsewhere , at a far lower economic and political cost .
