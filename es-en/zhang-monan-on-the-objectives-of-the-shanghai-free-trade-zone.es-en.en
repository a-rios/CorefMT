China &apos;s Quest for Value 
BEIJING - At the end of September , a new free-trade zone was launched in Shanghai , the aim being to mark the start of a new era not only of openness in investment , trade , and finance , but also of deeper Chinese integration into the global value chain . 
The zone promises to kick-start a new round of liberalizing reforms and help China &apos;s economy adapt to the latest demands of globalization . 
Over the next decade , global competition will come to be defined as competition over the global value chain . 
As the United States and other developed countries pursue &quot; re-industrialization &quot; and the Chinese economy &apos;s low-wage comparative advantage diminishes , China must re-establish its competitiveness by positioning itself at the top of the global value chain , which implies the need to promote trade and upgrade its industrial infrastructure . 
This requires , first and foremost , that China build a national value chain and elevate its manufacturing sector , which currently depends excessively on foreign research and development , imports of raw materials and semi-finished parts , and external demand . 
The sector &apos;s domestic value chain is woefully weak . 
The Shanghai free-trade zone promises to facilitate progress in three crucial areas . 
First , it should improve the manufacturing sector &apos;s localization rate for parts and components by accelerating the transmission of raw materials and intermediate inputs and integrating export-oriented producers with domestic industries . 
Second , in accordance with China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan , the free-trade zone aims to extend the industrial value chain and improve value-added content , promote the coordination of domestic and foreign investment in manufacturing , and strengthen the sector &apos;s classification and assessment capacity . 
At the same time , it should preserve a level playing field by explicitly prohibiting rule changes , limiting the establishment of entry and exit barriers in various industries , and using taxation , finance , and brand authentication to cultivate core competitiveness . 
Third , the free-trade zone should encourage multinational corporations ( MNCs ) to expand their Chinese operations beyond factories ; 
China should be home to their design , distribution , and service divisions as well . 
This would optimize relationships between parent and subsidiary companies and prompt a shift from the simple production model of the past to a model characterized by integrated services and global operations . 
Over the last decade , MNCs have increasingly expressed interest in establishing regional and global headquarters and R D centers in Shanghai . 
As of September 2012 , Shanghai was home to 393 MNCs &quot; regional headquarters . 
In this sense , China has a rare opportunity to expand its growth potential by stimulating domestic demand . 
The gradual improvement of its labor force in terms of skills and productivity , together with its relatively strong capacity to absorb high-value foreign investment , will drive economic development ; and MNCs &quot; shift in strategic focus from Western markets to those in the Asia-Pacific region will transform the global value chain . 
As the Shanghai free-trade zone becomes a global financial hub , it will have to determine how to attract high-level factors of production . 
To this end , in addition to its taxation , finance , and trade-facilitation policies , it should establish trade-promotion mechanisms in the world &apos;s major export markets , so that firms can build comprehensive networks of international trade-service platforms and trade-cooperation zones overseas . 
China &apos;s future competitiveness also depends on its integration into a new wave of global and regional regulatory regimes . 
Although there are several ongoing trade and investment negotiations - including the Trade in Services Agreement ( TISA ) , the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) - Chinese policies remain largely defined by the traditional World Trade Organization ( WTO ) framework . 
But the emerging arrangements would offer far more room for maneuver than the more restrictive WTO regime . 
For example , TISA negotiations in the fields of finance , securities , and legal services have resulted in no restrictions on foreign ownership or the scope of business . 
But China &apos;s adherence to WTO rules on foreign investment prevented it from participating in TISA negotiations , ultimately impeding its trade and investment ambitions . 
( International politics was responsible for China &apos;s exclusion from the TPP and TTIP negotiations . ) 
Against this background , the Shanghai free-trade zone demonstrates China &apos;s readiness to participate actively in global free-trade negotiations , with the goal of promoting a comprehensive free-trade strategy and safeguarding Chinese interests worldwide . 
Shanghai &apos;s role in trade , finance , investment , and shipping - together with an increasingly open service sector , improved regulatory environment , and focus on institutional innovation - will eventually lead to domestic market reform and drive China &apos;s integration into new trade agreements . 
The Shanghai free-trade zone &apos;s final objective is to help China exploit fully the demand potential of its domestic market . 
China &apos;s initial globalization &quot; dividend , &quot; accrued through low factor costs , is rapidly diminishing , and a new era - characterized by reliance on the massive domestic market to absorb foreign high-level factors of production , such as technology and human capital - is just beginning . 
The task for China &apos;s leaders is to expand policies aimed at boosting domestic demand , while working to improve the economy &apos;s skills base and enhance its relative capacity to absorb high-value-added , high-tech foreign investment . 
Advancing an innovation-driven development strategy and promoting emerging industries would improve the quality and level of foreign support and cooperation . 
With rapid growth in the local market , China could become a leading source of global demand , a hub of high-level factors of production , and a strategic center , with the Shanghai free-trade zone at its core . 
At this level , China would finally have the domestic value chain that it needs to sustain competitiveness and rapid economic growth .
