Democracy , Responsibility , and Honor 
Hardly a day goes by on which we do not hear of a government minister somewhere resigning his or her office . 
In a sense , this is hardly surprising . 
After all , the twenty-five member states of the European Union alone employ hundreds of ministers between them - and even more if junior ministers are included . 
But why do ministers resign ? 
More interestingly still : why do some not resign although there seem to be compelling reasons for some to do so ? 
In the absence of empirical research , generalizations must be guesswork . 
Ministers frequently resign because they find themselves involved in scandals , often connected in recent times with financing political parties . 
In Italy , one encounters several ghosts of such past misdeeds . 
Sometimes ministers resign for what they call &quot; personal reasons . &quot; 
Such reasons may conceal more compelling factors , as the recent resignation of American CIA Director George Tenet suggests . 
But Tony Blair lost one of his best and most loyal cabinet friends , Alan Milburn , because he genuinely wanted to spend more time with his family . 
Blair also lost his ministers of foreign affairs and of development assistance , Robin Cook and Clare Short , respectively . 
In their case , it was a serious policy disagreement - over the Iraq war - that made them go , and Mr. Cook certainly remains a politician-in-waiting . 
Yet Geoff Hoon , Prime Minister Blair &apos;s defence minister , as well as his American counterpart , Donald Rumsfeld , remain in office . 
Neither , to be sure , is clearly involved in a manifest scandal , nor do they disagree with the policies set by their leaders . 
On the contrary , they not only support these policies but stubbornly defend even their aberrations , like the mistreatment of prisoners of war . 
These ministers institute investigations , they move generals sideways or even into premature retirement , they haul perpetrators before military tribunals ; but they apparently see no reason to respond to those members of Congress or Parliament , let alone of the public , who wonder whether it is not time for the ministers themselves to go . 
The case of crimes in Iraq is particularly dramatic , but less obvious cases make the same point . 
The German minister of transport , for example , presided over a catastrophic and costly failure of a road toll system that he had proudly announced . 
But even he may stay in office to try again , having blamed others - in this case private companies - for the debacle . 
If something unacceptable happens without a minister &apos;s direct involvement , he or she can get away with it , or so it seems , by pointing a finger at the bureaucrats or contractors who are responsible for implementing an approved policy . 
Was it always thus ? 
One would like to think not . 
In any case , two ethical concepts come to mind , neither of which is much in vogue these days when talking about government : responsibility and honor . 
Both values are , or at least used to be , part of the ethics of governance . 
Responsibility concerns the fact that ministers are accountable for everything that happens within their sphere . 
In fact , they alone are accountable in the strict sense . 
In parliamentary systems , they can and must appear before the elected representatives of the people and explain what happened . 
Because they alone are directly accountable , it is not enough for a minister to point to and name the miscreants in any particular case . 
Civil servants cannot defend themselves in the same way ; they have to be defended by their ministers . 
If something of such severity has happened that a minister finds it impossible to defend them , they may have to pay the penalty , but the minister still must assume responsibility . 
It is proper to assume that Secretary Rumsfeld did not condone , let alone order , the abuse of Iraqi prisoners . 
There may be the vexing question of whether instructions or reports passed over his desk that contained relevant information . 
But , either way , the minister is ultimately and uniquely responsible for what happened under his command . 
He cannot escape this responsibility even if the perpetrators are identified and prosecuted . 
This is where the second ethical concept , honor , comes into play . 
What it says in Rumsfeld &apos;s case is that there may be no legal or constitutional obligation for a responsible minister to resign over the Iraqi abuse scandal ; but once upon a time it would have been regarded as a matter of honor that he does resign . 
Such a step not only demonstrates that the minister in question is fully aware of the burden of his responsibility , but also that he puts the integrity of democratic institutions above his personal interest , let alone the electoral prospects of those whom he served . 
Democracy is a precious but also a precarious set of values . 
If we want to persuade others to subscribe to it , we do well to demonstrate that we not only believe in elections and majorities but also in the virtues of responsibility and honor .
