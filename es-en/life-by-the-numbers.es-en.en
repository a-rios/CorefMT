Life by the Numbers 
NEW YORK - Last week , I learned that I don &apos;t have cancer . 
My doctor called and said , &quot; I have some good news ! &quot; 
Fortunately , we were in the middle of a fire drill in my office at the time , so no one noticed as I blinked back tears of relief . 
I had found the lump almost two weeks earlier , while at a conference in South Africa . 
I returned home early to have a biopsy , but the pathology lab was achingly slow ; days passed with no word . 
Clearly they were working hard to figure out exactly how bad my condition was . 
In fact , they were working hard not to miss anything before they concluded that my tumor was rare but benign . 
I had been preparing for the diagnosis for more than a week ... and to some extent for years , as I turned my investing focus from &quot; all things Internet &quot; to all things health-related . 
It turns out that understanding and promoting health is a great application of information technology . 
Health increasingly involves numbers . 
Many of those numbers aren &apos;t just medical probabilities ; they concern daily life choices that you can make before you get sick ( or are threatened , as I was ) . 
As a director of 23andMe , a consumer genetics start-up , and a participant in the Personal Genome Project research study ( http : / / www.personalgenomes.org / public / 3.html # Data _ Sets ) , I have been studying how genes affect one &apos;s chances of getting various diseases , and how much impact behavior can have on those chances . 
For most people and for most conditions , the genetic chances of becoming ill are well below 20 % . 
Moreover , regardless of your genotype , you can raise or lower those chances through diet , exercise , avoidance of stress , and engagement with friends . 
Yet there is some emerging thinking - and statistics - about how the toxins we encounter in the modern world affect our immune system , which in turn affects our bodies &quot; ability to combat cancerous cells . 
Everyone has cancer cells every day , but usually the body deals with them , using strength gained from eating right , exercise , and social engagement . 
When the body gets overloaded or weakened , cancer has an extra chance of winning , especially if you have a genetic vulnerability to a particular cancer . 
Before finding out that I would get a free pass - this time , at least - I had already started considering my options . 
I have no particular risk for breast cancer - no family history , and no known genetic markers . 
But that is true for many of the one-in-eight women who get breast cancer over their lifetimes in the United States . 
Given that I &apos;m almost 60 , it &apos;s probably not life-threatening ( or not that much more so than being 60 itself ! ) . 
Even without cancer , I have perhaps 30 years left , 40 if I &apos;m lucky . 
If I were a young mother , I would trade almost anything for the chance to see my kids grow up , but , as an older person , I &apos;m more concerned with quality of life than length . 
Of course , if the cancer was aggressive , I would take more treatment now just to stay alive . 
If it was slow-growing , I &apos;d remove the tumor and engage in what is called &quot; watchful waiting . &quot; 
Perhaps the most important thing to understand is statistics - whether for cancer or health in general . 
In my case , they could have gone something like this : assume you have a 70 % chance of survival ( defined as no recurrence for five years ) if you simply have the tumor removed . 
Radiation and chemotherapy treatments can reduce recurrence by a further 30 % . 
That sounds like a lot , until you realize that it means your &quot; survival &quot; chances go up only nine points , from 70 % to 79 % , because it is the 30 % recurrence rate that drops 30 % , to 21 % . 
That is not such a great increase in odds , given that there may be better treatments available by the time the cancer recurs , and that costs of treatment - in time , pain , and side-effects such as heart disease and cognitive impairment ( &quot; chemo brain &quot; ) , as well as money - are high . 
Was I willing to take on three years of aggressive treatment and potential long-term side-effects for a 10-point increase in my chances of being alive and cancer-free for five years , especially since no one really knows what the chances of recurrence in 10 or 20 years are ? Meanwhile , five years from now there may be new drugs that are more effective and less toxic , mitigating the downside of a later recurrence . 
These numbers may be perplexing , but they are useful to understand . 
Almost everyone is faced at some point with decisions about treatments and side-effects , for themselves and for loved ones . 
Indeed , you are probably facing such choices right now - if you pay attention to them . 
A large number of painful , dangerous conditions are more likely if you are overweight , under-exercised , a big drinker , lonely , or stressed . 
Even if you &apos;re not and get such a disease anyway , you will be better able to cope and undergo treatment if your health is good . 
It may be that the main value of services such as 23andMe ( at least until researchers use its data and others to learn a lot more about genetics ) is not the specific genetic details , but the way that it makes us focus on the numbers . 
Whether we are choosing what to eat or how much to exercise , or trying to assess our chances of a specific condition , the numbers make it feel real and immediate . 
For example , a vague warning against diabetes is a lot easier to ignore than the fact that your risk of diabetes is 22 % ( as mine is , slightly above normal ) , but that you can lower it substantially ( as I have ) by eating right , exercising , and so forth . 
Yet many people are afraid of knowing these numbers ; they don &apos;t realize that they are a guide , and something that they can change , rather than an immutable destiny . 
Just as a student can improve his grades by studying or an athlete can improve his performance by practicing , so you can change many of the numbers that define your health prospects .
