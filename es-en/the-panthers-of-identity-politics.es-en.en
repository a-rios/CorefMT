The Panthers of Identity Politics 
LONDON - I was in Jordan , that beautiful oasis of calm and moderation in a difficult and dangerous neighborhood , when I first heard the news about the murder of two British soldiers and a Catholic policeman by dissident republican terrorists in Northern Ireland . 
We had looked out across what Christians call the Holy Land from the Jordanian hills . 
What struck me , thinking back to the days I once spent in Northern Ireland , was how both there and here the crucible of so much struggle , bitterness , and bloodshed is very small . There is an intimacy about the geography of Northern Ireland , Gaza , and the West Bank that makes the violence seem all the more inexplicable and obscene . 
Is this violence made inevitable by the clash of cultures , religions , and ethnicities ? 
Is it programmed into DNA by history , language , and our different ways of meeting our spiritual yearnings ? 
It was my good fortune to be reading in Jordan a book called On Identity by Amin Maalouf . 
It is a brilliant assault on what the author , who is Lebanese , French , Arab and Christian , calls &quot; the panthers &quot; of identity politics . 
Maalouf hopes that one day he can call all of the Middle East his homeland , and that his grandson will find his book a strange memento of a time when these arguments had to be put forward . 
What is true of identity politics in the Middle East , and in shaping America &apos;s and Europe &apos;s relationship with the Islamic world , is equally true about Northern Ireland . 
I spent part of my life working on the problems of terrorism in Northern Ireland , first as a minister in the early 1980 &quot; s and , later , chairing the commission that drew up reform for policing and security in the Province as part of the Belfast Peace Agreement . 
For centuries , the Protestant and Catholic tribes had intermittently clashed , and over a period of three decades - a time euphemistically known as &quot; the Troubles &quot; - terrorism had claimed more than 3,000 lives and tens of thousands of injuries . 
This was an identity clash that had nothing to do with the essential messages of Christianity . 
I recall that the first time I visited a hospital in Belfast , the young nurses in the Accident and Emergency Unit had to describe patiently to me the difference between a Protestant and a Catholic knee-capping . 
This was not a matter of theology or even liturgy . 
&quot; That is all for the history books , &quot; we thought , until the recent murders . 
The Belfast peace agreement of 1998 has secured more than 10 years of peace . 
At its heart lay a simple proposition : the republicans , who called for and bombed for a United Ireland - hammering together the predominantly Protestant North and the overwhelmingly Catholic South - accepted that constitutional change could come only through the ballot box . 
We talked the terrorist IRA and their political wing into the political process and the sharing of power . 
In return , the Protestant majority in the north accepted that republicans should not have to accept the symbols of a state to which they felt no loyalty . 
Moreover , the police and security forces were to be reorganized so that they were seen to represent the whole community , not primarily its Protestant majority . 
Interestingly , the issue of police reform was the only one that the political parties could not resolve by themselves . 
So I was called in , together with a group of experts on policing , to sort it out . 
The result of that deal has been years of peace . It is not perfect . 
Some of the compromises that democrats must occasionally make with one-time terrorists are difficult to stomach . 
I do not take an apocalyptic view of what recently happened - tragic though it is for the bereaved families . 
It is an anarchic spasm of violence by a tiny minority . 
In a way , it underlines the importance of what has been achieved in Northern Ireland . 
First , virtually the whole of Ireland is united against what has happened . 
Second , the violence has strengthened the political process , with one-time IRA leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with the police to condemn the murders . 
Third , the reformed police service itself has been widely seen as the protector of the whole community , and young Catholics have been encouraged to join it by their priests and bishops . 
It is now more , not less , able to deal with terrorism . 
So did I think of lessons to be learned in the Middle East as I drove from one end of Jordan to the other ? 
Perhaps there are two . 
Obviously , there will be no peace in Palestine unless we start to talk to Hamas - a point that President Barack Obama &apos;s special envoy to the region , Senator George Mitchell , will surely appreciate after his experiences as a successful mediator in Northern Ireland . 
And , second , we should abandon outdated and wrong-headed notions of identity . 
That is perhaps an easy point to recognize for this author , the Catholic grandson of Irish potato famine emigrants who , nevertheless , became a British minister and Britain &apos;s last colonial governor .
