Russia \ u0027s New Anti-Oligarch War 
Moscow &apos;s sleepy political summer has been stirred by a Kremlin attack , initiated by President Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest aides , on Russia &apos;s leading oligarch and the country &apos;s richest man - Michael Khodorkovsky , the principal shareholder of the oil company Yukos . 
Of course , there is nothing new in such battles . 
Elements within Russia &apos;s political power structure have periodically waged war on the country &apos;s business elite - either to rein in the political ambitions of the oligarchs or to grab a bit of wealth for themselves - ever since the Soviet collapse . 
What is different now is that this war - a defining feature of the Yeltsin era - was supposedly settled by President Putin early on in his administration , when he offered the oligarchs a deal : keep your wealth , we won &apos;t investigate how you got it , but stay out of politics . 
Why has that deal apparently collapsed ? 
Equally unclear is why Khodorkovsky , the oligarch who has gone the farthest in making his business modern and transparent , the target of attack ? 
During Putin &apos;s first term , the Kremlin &quot; power structures &quot; ( now dominated by former KGB cronies of Putin from Saint Petersburg ) failed to gain control over the country &apos;s key financial and economic institutions . 
None of the real wealth of Russia has come their way . 
But this does not explain why they attacked Khodorkovsky rather than some other businessman with a shady past . 
One clue as to why they attacked Russia &apos;s richest man is the fact that Khodorkovsky is the first oligarch to help the country &apos;s liberal parties as opposed to the ruling party of power , to support independent mass media , and to provide money to lawyers and legal assistants . 
Moreover , they also feared that Khodorkovsky was preparing to enter politics . 
He was beginning to support the idea of Russia becoming a parliamentary , not a presidential , republic and was gaining influence ahead of this year &apos;s Duma elections . 
Such activity crossed the line drawn by Putin . 
The logic of Russia &apos;s presidential regime dictates that only the leader is permitted to control political institutions . 
All other attempts to shape the political atmosphere and influence events , especially by a powerful oligarch , violate this logic . 
Putin feared that the return of oligarchic political influence would bring back the chaos of Yeltsin &apos;s rule . 
So Khodorkovsky was targeted . 
No doubt , Putin is now likely to behave like a peacemaker . 
He is not interested in reinforcing the power of his Kremlin aides . 
He also realizes that big business is crucially important for Russia &apos;s modernization . 
He simply wants the oligarchs to stick to their sphere of activity and to leave politics to him . 
But the problem won &apos;t go away . 
Today &apos;s anti-oligarch war has exposed Putin &apos;s failure to deliver the &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; he promised when he took office . 
The attack on Khodorkovsky clearly demonstrates that prosecutors and courts can readily be manipulated by the politically powerful . 
That revelation has undermined much of the good Putin has achieved in office , for it has made foreign investors wary once again of doing business in Russia . 
Foreign investors aren &apos;t alone in worrying . 
Frightened by the attack on Khodorkovsky , Russian businessmen worry that success will bring harrassment from the Kremlin . 
Some are removing their assets from Russia . 
Roman Abromovictch , for example , just acquired London &apos;s Chelsea football club - a witty way to join English society , no doubt , but an investment unlikely to offer the kind of financial returns he could make in Russia if his confidence in the country were undented . 
This &quot; anti-oligarch &quot; war has not damaged Putin &apos;s popular standing because most Russians perceive the oligarchs as alien and corrupt . 
They object to vast differences in wealth and think large accumulations of it must be the product of theft , not work and risk . 
The current generation of big business in Russia will be considered illegitimate for a long time . 
The oligarchs would help their own cause by becoming more socially active and spending their money on philanthropical pursuits . 
In fact , most oligarchs have started charities and foundations . 
Worse still , Russia &apos;s bureaucracy would likely perceive such activity as a threat , and so spare no effort to hinder Russia &apos;s businessmen from civilizing themselves . 
Sooner or later Putin will have to choose between the bureaucracy and business . 
He will hardly want to depend on his siloviki ( those in the Kremlin power structures ) . 
He understands the worldview of the ex-KGB men in the Kremlin very well and is unlikely to approve of revisiting how property and wealth are divided in Russia . 
After all , a new division of wealth could occur only in the wake of a revolution that would disturb his hold on power . 
Yet Putin knows that he must curtail the political ambitions of the oligarchs if Russian business is to be modernized . 
Otherwise , they will continue to use the state to generate huge rents for themselves at the cost of distorting the rest of the economy . 
But neither the Kremlin &apos;s power elite , the bureaucracy , nor the oligarchs seem capable of reforming themselves . 
Each wants to shape the state to serve its interests alone . 
So the summer attack on the Russian oligarchs may turn out to be a litmus test that reveals not only Putin &apos;s ability to control the oligarchs , but also the retrograde interests of his closest aides . 
Sadly , in this clash of titans , postcommunist Russia &apos;s main values - liberty and private property - hardly get a mention .
