Don &apos;t Cripple the Tigers 
COPENHAGEN - This December , global leaders will meet in Copenhagen to negotiate a new climate change pact to reduce carbon emissions . 
Yet , the way that it has been set up , it will inevitably fail . 
The best hope is that we use this lesson finally to deal with this issue in a smarter fashion . 
The United States has made it clear that developing countries must sign up to substantial reductions in carbon emissions in Copenhagen . 
Developing nations - especially China and India - will be the main greenhouse gas emitters of the twenty-first century - but were exempted from the Kyoto Protocol because they emitted so little during the West &apos;s industrialization period . 
Europe , too , has grudgingly accepted that without developing nations &quot; participation , rich nations &quot; cuts will have little impact . 
Some would have us believe that getting China and India on board will be easy . 
According to former US Vice President Al Gore , &quot; developing countries that were once reluctant to join in the first phases of a global response to the climate crisis have themselves now become leaders in demanding action and in taking bold steps on their own initiatives . &quot; 
But Gore &apos;s fellow Nobel laureate , Rajendra Pachauri , the chair of the United Nations &quot; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , is not so sure . 
He recently told an Indian audience , &quot; of course , the developing countries will be exempted from any such restrictions , but the developed countries will certainly have to cut down on emissions . &quot; 
It is likely that Pachauri is right and Gore is wrong : neither China nor India will commit to significant cuts without a massive payoff . 
Their reasons are entirely understandable . 
The biggest factor is the massive cost and the tiny reward . 
Reducing emissions is the only response to climate change that environmental campaigners talk about , despite the fact that repeated attempts to do so - in Rio in 1992 and in Kyoto in 1997 - failed to make a dent in emission levels . 
Some believe that past agreements did not go far enough , but Kyoto actually turned out to be overly ambitious . 
Ninety-five percent of its envisioned cuts never happened . 
Yet , even if Kyoto were fully implemented throughout this century , it would reduce temperatures by an insignificant 0.3 ° F ( 0.2oC ) , at an annual cost of $ 180 billion . 
China and India are enjoying swift growth that is helping millions of people lift themselves out of poverty . 
India &apos;s External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee recently said , &quot; India is very concerned about climate change , but we have to see the issue in the perspective of our imperative to remove poverty so that all Indians can live a life of dignity . &quot; 
And Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao recently said , &quot; it &apos;s difficult for China to take quantified emission reduction quotas at the Copenhagen conference , because this country is still at an early stage of development . 
Europe started its industrialization several hundred years ago , but for China , it has only been dozens of years . &quot; 
Some environmental campaigners argue that , given the effects of global warming , every nation must act . 
But if one takes a closer look at China , this argument disintegrates . 
Climate models show that for at least the rest of this century , China will actually benefit from global warming . 
Warmer temperatures will boost agricultural production and improve health . 
The number of lives lost in heat waves will increase , but the number of deaths saved in winter will grow much more rapidly : warming will have a more dramatic effect on minimum temperatures in winter than on maximum temperatures in summer . 
There are few arguments for China and India to commit to carbon caps - and compelling reasons for them to resist pressure to do so . 
Kyoto &apos;s successor will not be successful unless China and India are somehow included . 
To achieve that , the European Union has made the inevitable , almost ridiculous proposal of bribing developing nations to take part - at a cost of € 175 billion annually by 2020 . 
In the midst of a financial crisis , it seems unbelievable that European citizens will bear the financial burden of paying off China and India . 
The sadder thing , though , is that this money would be spent on methane collection from waste dumps in developing nations , instead of on helping those countries &quot; citizens deal with more pressing concerns like health and education . 
There is an alternative to spending so much to achieve so little . 
Cutting carbon still costs a lot more than the good that it produces . 
We need to make emission cuts much cheaper so that countries like China and India can afford to help the environment . 
This means that we need to invest much more in research and development aimed at developing low-carbon energy . 
If every country committed to spending 0.05 % of its GDP exploring non-carbon-emitting energy technologies , this would translate into $ 25 billion per year , or ten times more than what the world spends now . 
Yet , the total also would be seven times cheaper than the Kyoto Protocol , and many times cheaper than the Copenhagen Protocol is likely to be . 
It would ensure that richer nations pay more , taking much of the political heat from the debate . 
Decades of talks have failed to make any impact on carbon emissions . 
Expecting China and India to make massive emission cuts for little benefit puts the Copenhagen meeting on a sure path to being another lost opportunity . 
Yet , at the same time , the Chinese and Indian challenge could be the impetus we need to change direction , end our obsession with reducing emissions , and focus instead on research and development , which would be smarter and cheaper - and would actually make a difference .
