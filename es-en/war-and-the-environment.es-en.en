War and the Environment 
Concern about the environmental consequences of war probably started after the first atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at World War Two &apos;s end , when no one knew how long lasting the radioactive contamination would be or what clean-up measures could be taken . 
During the Cold War , the environmental effects of an all-out nuclear confrontation became a matter of forecast and speculation , illustrated by the concept &quot; nuclear winter . &quot; 
Not only nuclear weapons incited these fears . 
The use of Agent Yellow and Agent Orange as defoliants during the Vietnam War gave rise to an intensive debate about - and some investigations of - such chemicals &apos; toxicological and ecological effects . 
Before the first Gulf War in 1991 , there was discussion of the possible effects on the global climate if Iraq set the Kuwaiti oilfields on fire - which subsequently became the prime image of that war &apos;s environmental impact . 
Attempts have been made ever since to systematically examine and document the environmental consequences of wars . 
Studies of the Balkan wars and the many wars that consumed Afghanistan during the 1990 &apos;s have been launched through international organisations like the United Nations Environment Progam ( UNEP ) . 
Unfortunately , Africa &apos;s wars - in Congo , Rwanda and Burundi , Liberia , Sierre Leone , and the Ivory Coast - have not yet received the attention they require . 
What have we learned about the environmental consequences of wars ? 
First of all the effects depend upon the type of war and the type of environment . 
A high-tech armed conflict has different - and not necessarily more benign - effects than one fought with machetes . 
A war in the jungles of Southeast Asia is different from one in the deserts of Kuwait or one in the mountains of Afghanistan . 
Despite these vast differences , it is possible to draw some conclusions : 
Effects following destruction of infrastructure . These include burning oil wells , along with chemical or radioactive spills from bombed factories or storage facilities , bacterial contamination of water when sewage treatment systems are destroyed , and flooded or dessicated lands following the destruction of dams and irrigation systems ; 
Effects of physical or chemical impact on land cover . This category includes erosion and lack of re-growth - or significantly different growth - following deforestation , sand drift caused by damage to the &quot; desert crust , &quot; or beach erosion after destruction of coral reefs ( e.g. , by oil spills or bombs ) ; 
Effects of chemicals used by armed forces . Restrictions on civilian use are often not applied to the military . 
Thus , Soviet-built tanks and artillery use PCB &apos;s in their hydraulic systems , airplanes in combat mission add ozone destroying halons to their fuel , and marine units use organic-tin compounds in the paint used on their hulls ; 
Effects of the weapons themselves . Ordinary bullets often consist of lead , tank-buster missiles contain uranium , and explosives are organic nitrogen compounds , sometimes containing mercury . 
Moreover , mines , bombs , and grenades that failed to explode during combat often continue to render areas inaccessible both for humans and larger animals long after a war ends . 
Among the environmental effects are also health effects following exposure to hazardous materials , such as inhalation of smoke from burning oil fields or uranium dust , resulting in asthma and possibly lung cancer . 
Other health problems , such as &quot; Gulf War Syndrome , &quot; have proven more difficult to assign to any specific cause , despite much research . 
Among the explanations are the combinations of pesticide fogging military camps , the treatment with a bromide compound , the use of insect repellents , vaccinations and exposure to depleted uranium . 
Exposure to chemical warfare agents following the detonation of Iraq munitions in Khamisiyah has been discussed as a cause of the syndrome . 
The massive scale of many wars and their impact is a special factor in their environmental impact . 
The amount of oil pumped into the Persian Gulf by the Iraqis in 1991 , probably to prevent an American Normandy-style landing , was over a million barrels and most likely close to 1.5 million tons - fifty times the amount released from the tanker &quot; Prestige &quot; off the Spanish coast last fall and forty times as much oil as ravaged the coast of Alaska in the 1980 &apos;s , after the Exxon &quot; Valdez &quot; disaster . 
Given the logistics involved in large-scale wars , there are also significant indirect or second-order effects , such as when a civilian oil tanker on route to Vietnam with fuel for America &apos;s forces there ran aground on the coral island of Kiltan in the Laccadives . 
The environmental consequences measured in economic terms are also significant . 
The cost of environmental restoration from oil on 640 kilometers of Saudi beaches after the 1991 Gulf War was $ 540 million . 
Removal of some 1.6 million landmines in Kuwait cost in more than $ 400 million . 
These are only two components of the environmental debt of that war . 
Paradoxically , while wars are environmentally destructive , former military zones , both within and between countries , often become wildlife refuges where endangered plant and animal species thrive . 
In Europe , both the black stork and the European sturgeon have survived in such areas , and the former line of demarcation between East and West Germany is today a biodiversity sanctuary .
