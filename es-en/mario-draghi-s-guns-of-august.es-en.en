Mario Draghi &apos;s Guns of August 
WASHINGTON , DC - August has been a dangerous month in European history , but this year it could be the turning point for the eurozone - and perhaps for the world economy . 
On July 26 , Mario Draghi , President of the European Central Bank , declared that his institution would do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to preserve the euro , and added : &quot; Believe me , it will be enough . &quot; 
Draghi &apos;s strong - indeed , unprecedented - statement was widely interpreted as signaling that the ECB would soon revive its bond-purchase program , focusing on Spanish debt in particular . 
Stock markets around the world soared . 
Jens Weidemann of the Bundesbank immediately expressed reservations , but the next day German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Fran√ßois Hollande issued a joint statement expressing their determination &quot; to do everything in order to protect the eurozone . &quot; 
I recently argued that the ECB , working with the nascent European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , was the only institution that could save the eurozone . 
It could do so by buying Italian and Spanish bonds in the secondary market with the pre-announced intention of keeping their sovereign interest rates below a certain threshold for a certain time . 
It is likely that Draghi &apos;s statement will indeed be followed by ECB purchases of Spanish ( and Italian ) sovereign bonds . 
A man like Draghi would not have issued such a statement without believing that he could follow through on it . 
First , the ECB &apos;s renewed bond purchases must express the clear intention of reducing sovereign interest rates to sustainable levels , which are at least 200 basis points below their July averages . 
A high-level German diplomat reportedly dismissed Spain &apos;s 6.5-7 % interest rates recently , on the grounds that Spain borrowed at nearly the same rates in the 1990 &quot; s . 
For countries that are following agreed reform programs , the ECB should commit itself to bringing down interest rates to levels compatible with projected inflation and growth rates , and announce how long ( say , nine months ) this will continue . 
A sporadic program without such announced objectives is unlikely to work , and could even be counterproductive , as private investors might well demand even higher returns because the growing ECB share of the debt would be considered senior , augmenting their risk . 
That would not happen if the ECB announced - and demonstrated - its determination to bring down interest rates , whatever it takes , for a significant period of time . 
Doing so would allow the eurozone to establish the institutional and legal means to achieve greater cooperation and integration , as agreed at the European Council &apos;s meeting in June . 
The second thing that must happen is that eurozone leaders and parliaments , with the cooperation of the courts , must be seen to push ahead with institutional reforms to establish not only the ESM , but also a banking union and partial debt mutualization . 
The eurozone can no longer sustain continued uncertainty and high real interest rates in the peripheral countries , so the ECB must provide a solid and credible bridge to the future . 
Finally , the adjustment programs themselves must be carefully re-calibrated . 
It should be clear by now that excessive , front-loaded austerity measures tend to be self-defeating , because they trigger a downward spiral of output , employment , and tax revenues . 
Indeed , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s most recent report on the eurozone says as much ( if cautiously ) . 
The pace of deficit reduction must be slowed , particularly in Spain , because output is determined in the short run by demand , and private demand cannot replace public demand until a degree of faith in the future is restored . 
This move toward support of effective demand must be combined with the kind of structural reforms that will allow more rapid , supply-side growth in the longer term . 
If these three steps - an ECB bond-buying program to hold down sovereign interest rates , concrete progress on establishing a real economic union , and realistic revision of current adjustment programs - could be achieved as a package , the resources that the ECB would need to use for its bond purchases would drop , because credibility would be restored . 
Even if there is further bad news for Europe - from Greece , for example , or from a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China - the eurozone could begin to move out of crisis mode this month . 
But that is possible only if , this time , the &quot; big bazooka &quot; really is put in place . 
Otherwise , the eurozone &apos;s position - financially , politically , and socially - will soon become undefendable .
