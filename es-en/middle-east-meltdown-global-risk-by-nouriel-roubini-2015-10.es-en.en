The Middle East Meltdown and Global Risk 
NEW YORK - Among today &apos;s geopolitical risks , none is greater than the long arc of instability stretching from the Maghreb to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . 
With the Arab Spring an increasingly distant memory , the instability along this arc is deepening . 
Indeed , of the three initial Arab Spring countries , Libya has become a failed state , Egypt has returned to authoritarian rule , and Tunisia is being economically and politically destabilized by terrorist attacks . 
The violence and instability of North Africa is now spreading into Sub-Saharan Africa , with the Sahel - one of the world &apos;s poorest and most environmentally damaged regions - now gripped by jihadism , which is also seeping into the Horn of Africa to its east . 
And , as in Libya , civil wars are raging in Iraq , Syria , Yemen , and Somalia , all of which increasingly look like failed states . 
The region &apos;s turmoil ( which the United States and its allies , in their pursuit of regime change in Iraq , Libya , Syria , Egypt and elsewhere , helped to fuel ) is also undermining previously secure states . 
The influx of refugees from Syria and Iraq is destabilizing Jordan , Lebanon , and now even Turkey , which is becoming increasingly authoritarian under President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan . 
Meanwhile , with the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians unresolved , Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon represent a chronic threat of violent clashes with Israel . 
In this fluid regional environment , a great proxy struggle for regional dominance between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran is playing out violently in Iraq , Syria , Yemen , Bahrain , and Lebanon . 
And while the recent nuclear deal with Iran may reduce the proliferation risk , the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran will provide its leaders with more financial resources to support their Shia proxies . 
Further east , Afghanistan ( where the resurgent Taliban could return to power ) and Pakistan ( where domestic Islamists pose a continued security threat ) risk becoming semi-failed states . 
And yet , remarkably , even as most of the region began to burn , oil prices collapsed . 
In the past , geopolitical instability in the region triggered three global recessions . 
The 1973 Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab states caused an oil embargo that tripled prices and led to the stagflation ( high unemployment plus inflation ) of 1974-1975 . 
The Iranian revolution of 1979 led to another embargo and price shock that triggered the global stagflation of 1980-1982 . 
And the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in 1990 led to another spike in oil prices that triggered the US and global recession of 1990-1991 . 
This time around , instability in the Middle East is far more severe and widespread . 
But there appears to be no &quot; fear premium &quot; on oil prices ; on the contrary , oil prices have declined sharply since 2014 . 
Why ? 
Perhaps the most important reason is that , unlike in the past , the turmoil in the Middle East has not caused a supply shock . 
Even in the parts of Iraq now controlled by the Islamic State , oil production continues , with output smuggled and sold in foreign markets . 
And the prospect that sanctions on Iran &apos;s oil exports will be phased out implies significant inflows of foreign direct investment aimed at increasing production and export capacity . 
Indeed , there is a global glut of oil . 
In North America , the shale-energy revolution in the US , Canada &apos;s oil sands , and the prospect of more onshore and offshore oil production in Mexico ( now that its energy sector is open to private and foreign investment ) have made the continent less dependent on Middle East supplies . 
Moreover , South America holds vast hydrocarbon reserves , from Colombia all the way to Argentina , as does East Africa , from Kenya all the way to Mozambique . 
With the US on the way to achieving energy independence , there is a risk that America and its Western allies will consider the Middle East less strategically important . 
That belief is wishful thinking : a burning Middle East can destabilize the world in many ways . 
First , some of these conflicts may yet lead to an actual supply disruption , as in 1973 , 1979 , and 1990 . 
Second , civil wars that turn millions of people into refugees will destabilize Europe economically and socially , which is bound to hit the global economy hard . 
And the economies and societies of frontline states like Lebanon , Jordan , and Turkey , already under severe stress from absorbing millions of such refugees , face even greater risks . 
Third , prolonged misery and hopelessness for millions of Arab young people will create a new generation of desperate jihadists who blame the West for their despair . 
Some will undoubtedly find their way to Europe and the US and stage terrorist attacks . 
So , if the West ignores the Middle East or addresses the region &apos;s problems only through military means ( the US has spent $ 2 trillion in its Afghan and Iraqi wars , only to create more instability ) , rather than relying on diplomacy and financial resources to support growth and job creation , the region &apos;s instability will only worsen . 
Such a choice would haunt the US and Europe - and thus the global economy - for decades to come .
