Palestine at the Crossroads 
President George W. Bush &apos;s long-awaited speech on the Middle East combined hope for both sides with extremely tough language . 
The hope was clear : Israelis deserve security and a life without fear of suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism ; 
Palestinians deserve dignity , an end to the Israeli occupation , sovereignty , and statehood . 
But the toughness was reserved solely for the current Palestinian leadership : without mentioning Yasir Arafat by name , Bush clearly called for a new Palestinian leadership , one &quot; not compromised by terrorism . &quot; 
The current leadership , he maintained , has not fought terrorism , but has instead encouraged and even &quot; trafficked &quot; in it . 
He condemned the Palestinian Authority &apos;s rejection of Israeli peace offers and promised US support for statehood if the Palestinians change their leadership , reiterating that &quot; a Palestinian state will not be achieved by terrorism . &quot; 
One cannot imagine a harsher condemnation of Arafat and the entire Palestinian leadership . 
Bush is now clearly suggesting that Arafat is not a partner for peace , that the Oslo agreements are , in effect , dead , and thus that the Palestinian Authority as constituted by them does not exist anymore . 
By adopting this policy , Bush is walking a fine line between Arab pressure to support the emergence of a Palestinian state and his own commitment to fight terrorism and not reward suicide bombers . 
The speech was a masterful blend of the carrot and the stick . 
But Bush now faces two challenges - one major , the other minor - in pushing his policy forward . 
The major challenge is how the demand for a change in the Palestinian leadership will be met . 
A crucial hallmark of Palestinian society is the weakness of its institutions : civic organizations are woefully under-developed , and responsive party structures that can effectively representing social interests do not exist - except those of the armed militias , like Fatah or Hamas . 
As a result , elections in Palestine currently mean about as much as they did in the old Soviet Union . 
How will democratic change come about in such a society ? 
Will it follow the path of chaotic , violent regime collapse by which Nicolae Ceausescu lost power in Romania ? 
Or will the Palestinians change their autocratic leadership peacefully , as in Serbia when Slobodan Milosevic was ousted ? 
Both options cannot be ruled out . 
President Bush also mentioned Arab help in bringing about a change of Palestinian leadership . 
Does he have in mind something like a Saudi protectorate over the Palestinians , sanctioned by the Arab League ? 
It may not be a bad idea . 
But until now , at least , the Palestinians have not been good at building institutions that are not contaminated by terrorism . 
How to build them remains the central question , and Bush has yet to offer a clear answer . 
The minor challenge is to get the Europeans to support Bush &apos;s policy . 
Some Europeans may see Bush &apos;s approach as another example of American unilateralism - and in a way they are right . 
But so what ? 
The problem with the Europeans is that all they have are declarations and speeches - a policy toward the region that is rich in lofty rhetoric , but poor if not starved in the capacity to implement anything concrete . 
Of course , this has characterized EU positions in the past as well - most glaringly in Bosnia and Kosovo . 
The EU does not have a comprehensive foreign policy and has no power to pursue one . 
It needed the US - i.e. , NATO - to save Bosnian Muslims and then Kosovar Albanians from near-genocidal Serb policies in the 1990s . 
The same will probably happen regarding the current crisis in the Middle East . 
The Europeans will grumble about Bush &apos;s policy , and they may even send Arafat a generous package of compassionate rhetoric . 
But the bottom line is that they have no alternative policy that can be effective . 
Bush has just relegated Arafat and his colleagues - Saeb Erekat , Hanan Ashrawi , Nabil Sha &apos;at , Abu Mazen - to the dustbin of history . 
They deserve it . 
Beginning with Oslo , these leaders had a chance to establish a Palestinian state . 
But they squandered the opportunity in 2000 at Camp David , when Ehud Barak proposed what no other Israeli leader was ever ready to offer : a two-state solution with shared sovereignty over Jerusalem . 
These leaders preferred terrorism , because they were not ready for a historic compromise with the Jewish state .
