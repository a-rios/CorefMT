Tobin Trouble 
CAMBRIDGE - European leaders are seriously considering a Tobin tax , which would put a small levy on financial transactions , thereby dampening trading . 
But will the tax do as much as its proponents hope ? 
The popularity of the tax ( named for the late Nobel laureate economist James Tobin , for whom its aim was to reduce exchange-rate volatility in currency markets ) reflects widespread animus directed at the financial sector , but it far exceeds any real benefits that the tax would deliver . 
Nonetheless , elected officials find a Tobin tax highly appealing , because it could blunt criticism and divert attention from fundamental , but politically paralyzing , problems surrounding economic policy , particularly budgets , debt , and slow growth . 
A Tobin tax does have benefits , even if it cannot address enough of the problems that afflict financial markets today . 
A tax on stock transactions encourages longer-term holdings . 
It taxes liquidity , which many believe is overly abundant . 
It encourages fundamental analysis of a company &apos;s operations , and some advocates hope that a Tobin tax would push firms themselves to focus even more on long-term value . 
Moreover , a Tobin tax moves financial traders - talented people with strong work habits - into other activities , which ( policymakers hope ) will benefit the economy more . 
And , if financial innovations like derivatives and short-term repurchase agreements have made markets more volatile and fragile , a Tobin tax could help to stabilize and strengthen them . 
While these are worthy goals , there are good reasons to believe that the tax would not achieve most of them . 
Long-term stockholders alone do not encourage a firm &apos;s managers to manage for the long term . 
In fact , to the extent that dampened trading diminishes market feedback to firms and their directors , it could make managers complacent . 
Traders might stop trading , but shareholders still might not conduct more fundamental , long-term analysis : the rise of index funds , which hold a broadly-diversified swath of the entire stock market , reflects this trend toward stockholder passivity . 
Lowering volatility and sopping up excess liquidity can be beneficial , but there are risks here as well : regulators can easily overshoot the mark , leaving financial markets with weakened capacity for price discovery and too little liquidity . 
That leaves the hope that a Tobin tax would induce high-IQ financial traders to do something else , with higher net benefits to society . 
If trading today is not helping to move capital to its highest and best use , reallocating inefficiently employed financial talent could yield big benefits . 
But is too much trading really a critical economic problem ? 
Consider the following . 
The financial crisis erupted in 2008 when mortgage-backed securities were revalued at much less than what they had been thought to be worth . 
The problem was not that these securities were ferociously traded ( most were not , and thus were not the kind of security that a Tobin tax would hit hard ) , but rather that everyone in financial markets revalued them at the same time . 
That left the financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities in much weaker condition , and several failed . 
At the time of the crisis itself , however , the main problem was not too much trading , but too little , as liquidity dried up for many financial transactions . 
Still , in one area , a Tobin tax could provide an unmitigated benefit . 
Many of the largest , most precarious financial institutions now finance themselves via repo : they buy a long-term security ( often government debt ) and sell it , promising to buy it back the next day for a slightly higher price . 
Dampening the repo market could be economically useful , because this funding has proven to be unstable : Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers used repo heavily in ways that made them unable to withstand investment reversals elsewhere in their business . 
The same was true of MF Holdings last fall . 
Stronger , longer-term financing might have allowed these firms to survive . 
If a Tobin tax induced financial institutions to finance themselves with more longer-term debt and less overnight repo , it could play a significant stabilizing role . 
While it is well known that a Tobin tax would have little effect on markets unless all major financial centers adopted it , what is true of markets is not necessarily true of financial institutions . 
If , say , French President Sarkozy wanted to stop too-big-to-fail French financial institutions from transacting in ways that weaken them , a Tobin tax on their transactions , wherever in the world they occurred , could work ; the tax would affect the institutions , even if it could not shape world-wide markets . 
To be sure , markets might move those transactions from France and from French financial institutions , and , if the regulators erred - because the business was profitable and not destabilizing - French institutions would lose out . 
But , if the regulators were right , the French institutions would be more stable . 
If the Tobin tax aims to strengthen institutions ( instead of altering markets ) , it could bite hard , even without the buy-in of every major country . 
Overall , there is not much to be said against the tax ( other than what is said against all taxes ) , and something to be said for it . 
But it does not help to solve major financial problems , and those that it does address ( short-term , overnight financing ) could be dealt with more directly , with a more focused tax , better rules governing those transactions , and improved prudential regulation . 
As of now , Europe &apos;s Tobin tax proposals are not well targeted . 
Sound transactions would be taxed along with destabilizing , overnight financing of fragile financial institutions . 
A Tobin tax does , however , allow elected politicians to look like they are doing something useful - which they are , but without addressing more serious economic problems .
