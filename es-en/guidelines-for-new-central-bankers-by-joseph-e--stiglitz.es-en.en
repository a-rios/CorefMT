The Changing of the Monetary Guard 
NEW YORK - With leadership transitions at many central banks either under way or coming soon , many of those who were partly responsible for creating the global economic crisis that erupted in 2008 - before taking strong action to prevent the worst - are departing to mixed reviews . 
The main question now is the extent to which those reviews will influence their successors &quot; behavior . 
Many financial-market players are grateful for the regulatory laxity that allowed them to reap enormous profits before the crisis , and for the generous bailouts that helped them to recapitalize - and often to walk off with mega-bonuses - even as they brought the global economy to near-ruin . 
True , easy money did help to restore equity prices , but it might also have created new asset bubbles . 
Meanwhile , GDP in many European countries remains markedly below pre-crisis levels . 
In the United States , despite GDP growth , most citizens are worse-off today than they were before the crisis , because income gains since then have gone almost entirely to those at the top . 
In short , many central bankers who served in the heady pre-crisis years have much to answer for . 
Given their excessive belief in unfettered markets , they turned a blind eye to palpable abuses , including predatory lending , and denied the existence of an obvious bubble . 
Instead , central bankers focused single-mindedly on price stability , though the costs of somewhat higher inflation would have been miniscule compared to the havoc wrought by the financial excesses that they allowed , if not encouraged . 
The world has paid dearly for their lack of understanding of the risks of securitization , and , more broadly , their failure to focus on leverage and the shadow banking system . 
Of course , not all central bankers are to blame . 
It was no accident that countries like Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , India , and Turkey avoided financial crisis ; their central bankers had learned from experience - their own or others &quot; - that unfettered markets are not always efficient or self-regulating . 
For example , when Malaysia &apos;s central-bank governor supported the imposition of capital controls during the East Asian crisis of 1997-1998 , the policy was scorned , but the former governor has since been vindicated . 
Malaysia had a shorter downturn , and emerged from the crisis with a smaller legacy of debt . 
Even the International Monetary Fund now recognizes that capital controls may be useful , especially in times of crisis . 
Such lessons are most obviously relevant to the current competition to succeed Ben Bernanke as Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board , the world &apos;s most powerful monetary authority . 
The Fed has two main responsibilities : macro-level regulation aimed at ensuring full employment , output growth , and price and financial stability ; and micro-level regulation aimed at financial markets . 
The two are intimately connected : micro-level regulation affects the supply and allocation of credit - a crucial determinant of macroeconomic activity . 
The Fed &apos;s failure to fulfill its responsibilities for micro-level regulation has much to do with its failure to meet macro-level goals . 
Any serious candidate for Fed chairman should understand the importance of good regulation and the need to return the US banking system to the business of providing credit , especially to ordinary Americans and small and medium-size businesses ( that is , those who cannot raise money on capital markets ) . 
Sound economic judgment and discretion are required as well , given the need to weigh the risks of alternative policies and the ease with which financial markets can be roiled . 
( That said , the US cannot afford a Fed chairman who is overly supportive of the financial sector and unwilling to regulate it . ) 
Given the certainty of divisions among officials on the relative importance of inflation and unemployment , a successful Fed chairman must also be able to work well with people of diverse perspectives . 
But the next leader of the Fed should be committed to ensuring that America &apos;s unemployment rate falls below its current unacceptably high level ; an unemployment rate of 7 % - or even 6 % - should not be viewed as inevitable . 
Some people argue that what America needs most is a central banker who has &quot; experienced &quot; crises firsthand . 
But what matters is not just &quot; being there &quot; during a crisis , but showing good judgment in managing it . 
Those in the US Treasury who were responsible for managing the East Asian crisis performed miserably , converting downturns into recessions and recessions into depressions . 
So , too , those responsible for managing the 2008 crisis cannot be credited with creating a robust , inclusive recovery . 
Botched efforts at mortgage restructuring , failure to restore credit to small and medium-size enterprises , and the mishandling of bank bailouts have all been well documented , as have major flaws in forecasting both output and unemployment as the economy went into free-fall . 
Even more important for a central banker managing a crisis is a commitment to measures that make another crisis less likely . 
By contrast , a laissez-faire approach would make another crisis all but inevitable . 
A top contender to succeed Bernanke is Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen , one of my best students when I taught at Yale . 
She is an economist of great intellect , with a strong ability to forge consensus , and she has proved her mettle as Chair of the President &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers , President of the San Francisco Fed , and in her current role . 
Yellen brings to bear an understanding not just of financial markets and monetary policy , but also of labor markets - which is essential in an era when unemployment and wage stagnation are primary concerns . 
( A classic article that she co-authored remains , many years later , on my list of required reading for Ph.D. students . ) 
Given the fragile economic recovery and the need for continuity in policy - as well as for confidence in the Fed &apos;s leadership and global cooperation based on mutual understanding and respect - Yellen &apos;s steady hand is precisely what US policy making requires . 
President Barack Obama is supposed to appoint senior officials with the &quot; advice and consent &quot; of the US Senate . 
Roughly one-third of Democratic senators have reportedly written to Obama in support of Yellen . 
He should heed their counsel .
