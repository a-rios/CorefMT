Asia &apos;s Giants Under New Management 
BALI - More than one-third of the world &apos;s population lives in just three countries : China , India , and Indonesia . 
With all three undergoing significant political transitions - whether electing a new leader or experiencing a recently installed leader &apos;s first key decisions - this is a decisive moment in shaping the global economy &apos;s future . 
If Narendra Modi and Joko &quot; Jokowi &quot; Widodo win the upcoming elections in India and Indonesia , respectively , they will join Chinese President Xi Jinping in spurring regional economic growth - likely causing Asia &apos;s rise to global economic preeminence to occur faster than the world ever imagined . 
In the year since Xi assumed the Chinese presidency , he has centralized power to a remarkable degree . 
Not only has he positioned himself as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission ; he has also neutralized potential rivals , including former Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai and former security chief Zhou Yongkang . 
Consolidating power in a country as large and messy as China is extremely difficult , making Xi &apos;s accomplishment remarkable , to say the least . 
After all , it took Xi &apos;s predecessor , Hu Jintao , far longer to achieve a similar degree of authority . 
Xi is now attempting to use this power to push through the difficult reforms that Hu and his prime minister , Wen Jiabao , have been widely criticized for neglecting . 
Despite the pressure to make up for lost time , Xi knows that he must be pragmatic in his reform efforts . 
First , he must build a national consensus capable of overcoming the powerful vested interests that oppose changes - including the dissolution of monopolies , improved market regulation , increased transparency , and tax reform - that would level the economic playing field . 
While Western leaders generally support Xi &apos;s market-oriented reform strategy , they remain puzzled by his devotion to the CCP . 
To the Western mind , any truly effective reformer must be a closet democrat , like the Soviet Union &apos;s last president , Mikhail Gorbachev . 
But Xi has no intention of being the People &apos;s Republic &apos;s last president , and the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in the wake of Gorbachev &apos;s political reforms taught him the importance of balancing change with stability . 
For Xi , the CCP &apos;s appeal lies not so much in its ideology as in its capacity to help bolster China &apos;s prosperity . 
Indeed , China &apos;s current leaders are modernizing nationalists , not communists . 
They recognize that China &apos;s success over the last three decades is a direct result of its shift toward a more open economy and a freer society - a shift that will continue under Xi . 
Another modernizing nationalist , Narendra Modi , is likely to become India &apos;s prime minister following the elections that started this month . 
Modi &apos;s pro-business approach is a major theme of his election campaign , and ordinary Indians are hopeful that his policy program will enhance their wellbeing . 
As Chief Minister of Gujarat , Modi worked to encourage foreign investment , provide around-the-clock electricity , build roads , and engage in intelligent urban planning . 
Annual economic growth in the state averaged more than 10 % from 2006 to 2012 , when the Gujarati city of Ahmedabad was short-listed for the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize . 
But history haunts Modi &apos;s campaign - namely , the deaths of more than 1,000 people in anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002 . 
Though the Supreme Court cleared him of all personal wrongdoing , the tragedy &apos;s legacy persists , making it difficult for Modi to win Muslim votes without alienating his Hindu nationalist base . 
This has not prevented Modi from taking political risks , beginning with his assertion that India needs toilets more than temples . 
Of course , even if he wins , Modi will never be able to consolidate power to the degree that Xi has , owing to India &apos;s separation of powers and democratic constitution . 
At best , he will lead a coalition government , in which his capacity to make compromises and connect with unlikely allies will dictate his success . 
Jokowi , the governor of Jakarta , will face a similar challenge if he wins Indonesia &apos;s presidential election in July , given that his party , the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle , will not have a majority in parliament . 
Fortunately , he is a skilled politician - popular , but not populist , with tremendous persuasive powers . 
These qualities enable Jokowi to deliver results , exemplified in his success in convincing Jakarta &apos;s slum dwellers to leave their shanties to allow for urban development . 
Under his leadership , highway projects that had been blocked for 16 years have been relaunched in the city . 
Like Xi and Modi , Jokowi is focused mainly on economic development . 
In this regard , his background as a furniture manufacturer and exporter is a major asset , enabling him to bring a level of hands-on knowledge and experience that past Indonesian presidents have lacked . 
Given Jokowi &apos;s business acumen , he understands that Indonesia must improve its logistical capabilities if its economy is to engage the world . 
Perhaps most important , Xi , Modi , and Jokowi are all pragmatists . 
They know that , in order to achieve rapid economic growth and modernization - a key priority for all of them - they will need to compromise with opposition forces at home and adopt best practices from abroad . 
Their shared desire to engage the modern world suggests that their leadership will improve the lives of their countries &quot; citizens .
