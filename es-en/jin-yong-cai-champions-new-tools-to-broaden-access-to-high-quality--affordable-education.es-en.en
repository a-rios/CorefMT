Big Data for Poor Students 
WASHINGTON , DC - Countries need skilled and talented people to generate the innovations that underpin long-term economic growth . 
This is as true in developed as it is in developing economies . 
But it will not happen without investment in education and training . 
If we are to end poverty , reduce unemployment , and stem rising economic inequality , we must find new , better , and cheaper ways to teach - and on a vast scale . 
This goal may seem to be beyond even wealthier countries &quot; means ; but the intelligent collection , analysis , and use of educational data could make a big difference . 
And , fortunately , we live in an age in which information technology gives us the right tools to broaden access to high-quality , affordable education . 
Big data - high-volume , complex data sets that businesses use to analyze and predict consumer behavior - can provide teachers and companies with unprecedented amounts of information about student learning patterns , helping schools to personalize instruction in increasingly sophisticated ways . 
The World Bank Group and its private-sector lending arm , the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) , are trying to harness this potential to support national education systems . 
A recently launched initiative , called the Systems Approach for Better Education Results ( SABER ) , collects and shares comparative data on educational policies and institutions from countries around the world . 
In the private sector , the ability to collect information about teacher-student interaction , and interaction between students and learning systems , can have a profound impact . 
In Kenya , for example , Bridge International Academies is using adaptive learning on a large scale . 
An IFC client founded by three American entrepreneurs , Bridge runs 259 nursery and primary schools , with monthly tuition averaging $ 6 . 
It is a massive learning laboratory for students and educators alike . 
Bridge tests different approaches to teaching standard skills and concepts by deploying two versions of a lesson at the same time in a large number of classrooms . 
The lessons are delivered by teachers from standardized , scripted plans , via tablets that also track how long the teachers spend on each lesson . 
Exam results are recorded on the teacher &apos;s tablet , with more than 250,000 scores logged every 21 days . 
From these data , Bridge &apos;s evaluation team determines which lesson is most effective and distributes that lesson throughout the rest of the Academy &apos;s network . 
We know that a host of issues can cause a student &apos;s performance to decline - scorching summer heat in classrooms without air conditioning , problems at home , or poor-quality teachers , to name a few . 
But when one gathers results on a large scale , variables flatten out , and the important differences emerge . 
That is the great value of big data . 
Another case is SABIS , a provider of K-12 education in the United States , Europe , Asia , the Middle East , and North Africa . 
SABIS mines large data sets to ensure high standards and enhance academic performance for more than 63,000 students . 
Continuous tracking of annual student academic performance yields more than 14 million data points that are used to shape instruction , achieve learning objectives , and ensure consistency across the company &apos;s network of schools in 15 countries . 
Knewton , an adaptive learning platform that personalizes digital courses using predictive analytics , is another company at the forefront of the data revolution . 
With tailored content and instruction , even classrooms without private-school resources can provide individual learning . 
As a result , teachers spend their time in the most effective way possible - solving problems with students - instead of delivering undifferentiated lessons . 
These benefits do not come without risk . 
We are only beginning to grapple with how big data &apos;s tremendous potential for learning can be harnessed while protecting students &quot; privacy . 
In some cases , data-collection technology is outpacing our ability to decide how it should be collected , stored , and shared . 
No matter how rigorously data are secured , there is still a need for a clear licensing structure for its use . 
In many developing countries , there are no regulations for data privacy at all . 
The interface between data and education holds the promise of new educational products for improved learning , with large potential benefits , especially for the poor . 
To realize those benefits - and to do so responsibly - we must ensure that data collection is neither excessive nor inappropriate , and that it supports learning . 
The private sector , governments , and institutions such as the World Bank Group need to formulate rules for how critical information on student performance is gathered , shared , and used . 
Parents and students deserve no less .
