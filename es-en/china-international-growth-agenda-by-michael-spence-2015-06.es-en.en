China &apos;s International Growth Agenda 
MILAN - For most of the past 35 years , China &apos;s policymakers have set their focus on the domestic economy , with reforms designed to allow the market to provide efficiency and accurate price signals . 
Though they had to be increasingly aware of their country &apos;s growing impact on the global economy , they had no strategy to ensure that China &apos;s neighbors gained from its economic transformation . 
But now China does have such a strategy , or at least is rapidly developing one . 
Moreover , it extends well beyond Asia , embracing Eastern Europe and the east coast of Africa . 
A key element of China &apos;s strategy is the recently established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) , and to some extent the BRICS &quot; New Development Bank , established last year by Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa . 
Both banks are obvious alternatives - and so rivals - to the Western-dominated World Bank and International Monetary Fund . 
Also vital to the new strategy are two prospective modern-day Silk Roads : an overland route through Central Asia to the Black Sea and a &quot; Maritime Silk Road &quot; by which shipping will pass from the South China Sea , through the Strait of Malacca , across the Indian Ocean to East Africa , and from there through the Red Sea into the eastern Mediterranean . 
But it is not . 
China &apos;s goal is to create these links , and it has plenty of assets that will allow it to act as a catalyst of global growth and development . 
The most obvious asset is China &apos;s large and growing domestic market , to which other economies can gain access via trade and investment . 
China will thus be joining the ranks of the advanced countries in providing an export market ( and jobs ) for countries at earlier stages of economic development . 
In addition , because China has built up a capacity to invest that is far larger than its domestic economy can now absorb , it will inevitably seek opportunities abroad , both public and private . 
Chinese companies , in particular , will increasingly want to establish their brands internationally . 
With the involvement of the AIIB and the New Development Bank , China has developed what amounts to a multinational development strategy . 
While there are skeptics , broad support for the AIIB suggests that the benefits outweigh the risks , and that China &apos;s initiatives may help build a network that is open to everyone . 
After all , the trade and investment that will follow could not possibly all flow through China . 
Meanwhile , by virtue of more than 30 swap arrangements with other central banks ( the first was with South Korea in December 2008 ) , China is using its foreign-exchange reserves to help its neighbors and others defend themselves against volatile international capital flows . 
This is in tandem with the authorities &quot; efforts to promote the internationalization of the renminbi , which is rapidly expanding its role in trade settlement . 
There are significant efficiency gains to be had by settling transactions in trading partners &quot; currencies , without the intermediation of , say , the US dollar . 
Of course , there is much more to the internationalization of a currency , not least large and liquid domestic financial markets and the establishment of trust and confidence . 
This takes time , but China is already applying to the IMF to have the renminbi included in the basket of currencies that determines the value of the Fund &apos;s unit of account , Special Drawing Rights , with a decision likely in late 2015 . 
Joining the US dollar , the British pound , the euro , and the Japanese yen in the SDR club would be symbolically significant . 
More important , as with China &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 , which required substantial reforms , fulfilling the conditions for joining the SDR promises to speed progress toward full capital-account liberalization - and thus toward a fully convertible renminbi . 
China &apos;s policymakers have long time horizons . 
The question is whether the strategy is worth pursuing now . 
The answer almost certainly is yes . 
The overland &quot; silk road , &quot; for example , will reduce China &apos;s reliance on sea-lanes , which can be blocked or disrupted , especially at the Strait of Malacca . 
More generally , Chinese investment will ease the constraints on the silk road economies caused partly by slow growth and investment shortfalls in advanced economies . 
Ultimately , vibrant growing economies in the region will benefit China &apos;s economy and its stature . 
Many believe that public-sector investment is a good way ( perhaps the best way ) to use the global economy &apos;s productive resources and increase its efficiency and growth potential . 
But this requires a multinational effort . 
China &apos;s leaders surely want international recognition of their country &apos;s global stature . 
The new external focus of China &apos;s growth and development strategy seems to be intended to make that vision a reality .
