Polluters Must Pay 
NEW YORK - When BP and its drilling partners caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 , the United States government demanded that BP finance the cleanup , compensate those who suffered damages , and pay criminal penalties for the violations that led to the disaster . 
BP has already committed more than $ 20 billion in remediation and penalties . 
Based on a settlement last week , BP will now pay the largest criminal penalty in US history - $ 4.5 billion . 
The same standards for environmental cleanup need to be applied to global companies operating in poorer countries , where their power has typically been so great relative to that of governments that many act with impunity , wreaking havoc on the environment with little or no accountability . 
As we enter a new era of sustainable development , impunity must turn to responsibility . 
Polluters must pay , whether in rich or poor countries . 
Major companies need to accept responsibility for their actions . 
Nigeria has been Exhibit A of corporate environmental impunity . 
For decades , major oil companies , including Shell , ExxonMobil , and Chevron , have been producing oil in the Niger Delta , an ecologically fragile environment of freshwater swamp forests , mangroves , lowland rainforests , and coastal barrier islands . 
This rich habitat supports remarkable biodiversity - or did before the oil companies got there - and more than 30 million local inhabitants , who depend on the local ecosystems for their health and livelihoods . 
Twenty years ago , the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classified the Niger Delta as a region of high biodiversity of marine and coastal flora and fauna - tree species , fish , birds , and mammals , among other forms of life - and therefore rated it as a very high priority for conservation . 
Yet it also noted that the region &apos;s biodiversity was under massive threat , with little or no protection . 
The global companies operating in the delta have spilled oil and flared natural gas for decades , without regard for the natural environment and the communities impoverished and poisoned by their actions . 
One estimate puts the cumulative spills over the past 50 years at approximately 10 million barrels - twice the size of the BP spill . 
The data are uncertain : there have been many thousands of spills during this period - often poorly documented and their magnitude hidden or simply unmeasured by either the companies or the government . 
Indeed , just as BP was being hit with new criminal penalties , ExxonMobil announced yet another pipeline leak in the Niger Delta . 
The environmental destruction of the delta is part of a larger saga : corrupt companies operating hand in hand with corrupt government officials . 
The companies routinely bribe officials to gain oil leases , lie about output , evade taxes , and dodge responsibility for the environmental damage that they cause . 
Nigerian officials have become fabulously wealthy , owing to decades of payoffs by international companies that have plundered the delta &apos;s natural wealth . 
Shell , the largest foreign operator in the Niger Delta , has been criticized repeatedly for its egregious practices and its unwillingness to be held to account . 
Meanwhile , the local population has remained impoverished and beset by diseases caused by unsafe air , poisoned drinking water , and pollution in the food chain . 
Local lawlessness has led to gang warfare and persistent illegal tapping into the pipelines to steal oil , leading to further massive oil spills and frequent explosions that kill dozens , including innocent bystanders . 
In the colonial era , it was the official purpose of imperial power to extract wealth from the administered territories . 
In the post-colonial period , the methods are better disguised . 
When oil companies misbehave in Nigeria or elsewhere , they are protected by the power of their home countries . 
Don &apos;t mess with the companies , they are told by the United States and Europe . 
Indeed , one of the largest bribes ( a reputed $ 180 million ) paid in recent times in Nigeria was by Halliburton , a company tightly intertwined with US political power . 
( Dick Cheney went from being Halliburton &apos;s CEO to the US vice presidency . ) 
Last year , the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) issued a remarkable report on Ogoniland , a major ethnic homeland in the Niger Delta that has been at the epicenter of conflict between local communities and international oil . 
The report was as scathing as it was scientifically clear . 
Despite many past promises of a cleanup , Ogoniland remains in environmental agony , impoverished and sickened by the oil industry . 
UNEP also offered clear and detailed recommendations , including emergency measures to ensure safe drinking water ; cleanup activities targeting the mangroves and soils ; public-health studies to identify and counteract the consequences of pollution ; and a new regulatory framework . 
The world &apos;s governments have recently agreed to move to a new framework for sustainable development , declaring their intention to adopt Sustainable Development Goals at the Rio + 20 Summit in June . 
The SDGs offer a critical opportunity for the world to set clear , compelling standards for government and corporate behavior . 
Many major companies , including in the oil industry , have expressed their readiness to support sustainable development goals . 
Cleaning up the Niger Delta would provide the strongest possible example of a new age of accountability . 
Shell , Chevron , ExxonMobil , and other major oil companies should step forward and help to fund the necessary cleanup , ushering in a new era of responsibility . 
The Nigerian government &apos;s own accountability is on the line as well . 
It is heartening that several Nigerian senators have recently been in the forefront of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector . 
The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria , the oil industry , and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned . 
From now on , sustainable development must not be a mere slogan , but rather an operational approach to global governance and well-being on a strained and crowded planet .
