The Caucasus Imperative 
YEREVAN - Summit season is upon us . 
Following the G-20 meetings in Seoul and the NATO summit in Portugal , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will hold its first summit in 10 years in Astana , Kazakhstan &apos;s spanking new capital city . 
This is only the fourth post-Cold War summit convened by the OSCE . 
The first was held in 1994 in Budapest , the year the group transformed itself into a new , post-d√©tente organization . 
There were two more , in Lisbon in 1996 and in Istanbul in 1999 . 
Not coincidentally , the ten-year gap between summits overlaps with Russia &apos;s re-emergence as a global player , following the trauma of the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse . 
As a result of Russia &apos;s revival , a range of disagreements has arisen within the OSCE - the only pan-European and trans-Atlantic organization that includes old Europe and the post-Soviet states . 
On challenges ranging from election monitoring to the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) Treaty , there is no common ground among the 56 member states . 
Worse , there is serious acrimony between Russia and the rest on many matters , including a new , alternative security architecture , which Russian President Dmitri Medvedev imagines could be placed under the OSCE &apos;s umbrella . 
With so much to disagree about and no significant agreements ready to be concluded in Astana , this looks like a case of summitry for summitry &apos;s sake . 
Without the usual pre-arranged outcomes , the delegations and their leaders will be searching for a success story to present to the world - whether in the OSCE &apos;s human , economic , or security dimensions . 
That search could lead to the only conflict in the OSCE in which the organization has a direct role : the dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh . 
The OSCE serves as mediator - through the Minsk Group co-chairs ( the governments of France , Russia , and the United States ) - in the most explosive of all the conflicts and security threats in the Caucasus . 
To be sure , unlike Georgia &apos;s war with Russia , the two sides in this clash are not so unequal as to draw global attention . 
Perhaps for this reason , there has been talk of a meeting in Astana between the presidents of Russia and France , the US secretary of state , and the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan . 
That prospect holds both great opportunity and serious risks . 
There is a reason that no such meeting has been held in the 20 years of the conflict . 
A meeting of presidents is , after all , the ultimate negotiating forum , and must lead to real , sustainable success . 
Otherwise , it will appear that no amount of negotiation can help set the Caucasus straight - powerfully undermining a key restraint preventing the two sides from trying again to achieve a military solution . 
Resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict peacefully requires two parallel steps : a guarantee of non-resumption of military hostilities , and a clear , mutually binding blueprint for reaching a final settlement . 
In the absence of assurances of such an outcome , a presidential-level meeting should not be tried . 
This is especially true at a time when the other main deterrent to renewed violence - the military balance between the two sides - is also being weakened . 
That , together with the more than 30 incidents occurring daily on the Line of Contact , does not bode well for peace , particularly given the absence of even a hint of agreement on a document , any document . 
An acceptable blueprint might emerge from high-level negotiations in Astana if it were to build on what succeeded in breaking previous negotiating deadlocks : the idea of a referendum in which the war-weary Karabakhis can determine their final status . 
The beauty of a referendum in these circumstances is that it recognizes the two fundamental principles at the heart of this conflict - self-determination and territorial integrity . 
But thus far , there is no agreement on the timing of a referendum . 
In just two months , South Sudan will hold a referendum on independence that was agreed to in 2005 . 
A little more than two years ago , Kosovo voted for independence from Serbia . 
If , in Astana , a high-level group reinforces the idea of a referendum and sets a mutually acceptable date , this would be a significant achievement . 
The summit will have succeeded , the OSCE will have succeeded , and Karabakh will cease to be a synonym for conflict , but a laboratory for peace .
