Economics and Its Critics 
MUNICH - There is much to criticize in economics nowadays . 
For example , the profession focuses far too little on political issues and far too much on beating students to death with mathematics . 
But much current criticism of the profession is based on misunderstanding and ignorance . 
Consider Adam Smith &apos;s concept of the &quot; invisible hand , &quot; which implies that a market equilibrium is efficient if perfect competition prevails and well-defined property rights exist . 
Contrary to what many critics suppose , mainstream economists do not assume that these ideal conditions are always present . 
On the contrary , economists tend to use these conditions as a benchmark for analyzing market failures . 
Like sniffer dogs , they search the economy for such defects and ponder how they can be corrected through intelligent state intervention . 
In this respect , economists are like doctors , who have to know what a healthy body looks like before they can diagnose disease and prescribe treatment . 
A good doctor does not intervene arbitrarily in the body &apos;s processes , but only in cases where there is objective proof of a disease and an effective treatment can be prescribed . 
Environmental regulation addresses a particularly striking example of market failure . 
Markets are generally efficient if companies &quot; revenues correctly reflect all the benefits that their output bestows on third parties , while their costs reflect all the harms . 
In this case , maximizing profit leads to maximizing social welfare . 
But if production entails environmental damage for which companies do not pay , incentives are distorted ; companies may turn a profit , but they function inefficiently in economic terms . 
So the state &quot; corrects &quot; firms &quot; incentives by levying fines or issuing bans . 
Another malady that economists sometimes diagnose might be called &quot; Keynes disease . &quot; 
If demand is too weak , it can lead to a sharp drop in employment ( because wages and prices are rigid in the short term ) . 
The disease can be cured with injections of public , debt-financed stimulus - like giving a cardiac patient doses of nitroglycerine to keep his heart going . 
Contrary to what many think , there is no fundamental bias against this medicine in mainstream economics today . 
But stimulus cannot be seen as a universal remedy . 
Many ailments that may afflict an economy are chronic , not acute , and thus call for other types of treatment . 
Trying Keynesian therapy to resolve , say , the structural problems currently affecting the countries of southern Europe would be like trying to cure a broken leg with heart medicine . 
Nitroglycerine addresses the risk of circulatory collapse . 
In economic terms , that is what was needed following the 2008 global financial crisis . 
But long-term use of such medication can be fatal . 
Here and elsewhere , ideology causes conceptual confusion . 
For example , Smith viewed competition as a basic condition of the invisible hand &apos;s operation , because monopolies and oligopolies exploit consumers and restrict production . 
But only competition among providers of similar products is beneficial . 
Competition among providers of complementary goods or services is harmful , and can be even worse than a monopoly . 
( That is why train drivers and pilots , for example , should be forced into monopoly unions that represent all of the other employees of their respective companies . ) 
The market failures that initially give rise to public-sector intervention tend to recur internationally , which means that competition between states is usually not efficient , either . 
Examples include competition between welfare states to deter economic migrants , the race to the bottom in taxation , and regulatory rivalry in the banking and insurance sectors . 
Competition , contrary to what many on the right believe , is not always good . 
Of course , ideology often overwhelms terminology on the left as well . 
Consider &quot; neoliberalism , &quot; a term of derision for many because it has come to be viewed as a doctrine of deregulation and pure laissez-faire . 
But in Europe , at least , neoliberalism has a very different meaning . 
It was coined by Alexander RÃ¼stow , who in 1932 proclaimed the end of old liberalism and called for a new liberalism featuring a strong state that lays down a solid legal framework within which firms operate . 
Homo economicus , the rationally acting egoist who populates economists &quot; models , has recently attracted criticism as well , because all too often he does not represent the real behavior of individuals . 
Behavioral experiments have shown conclusively the limited predictive value of this artificial construct . 
But homo economicus was never intended to be used for forecasting ; its real purpose is to make it easier to distinguish between market failures and mental failures . 
Economists seek to detect collective irrationality , and economic models that assume individual rationality facilitate that . 
By ensuring that policies respond to flaws in the rules of the game , not to individuals &quot; fallibility or irrationality , this &quot; methodological individualism &quot; saves us from dictatorial paternalism . 
Banks that grant risky loans on too little equity illustrate the analytical value of homo economicus particularly clearly . 
Their profits are privatized , but any losses exceeding their equity are dumped on their creditors , or , even better for them , on the taxpayers . 
This asymmetry turns banking into a casino : The house always wins . 
Banks choose particularly risky investment projects , which may be profitable but are economically damaging . 
The problem is not caused by human irrationality ; on the contrary , it arises precisely because bankers are acting rationally . 
As we know from environmental regulation , preaching common sense or ethics to bankers will not help ; but changing bankers &quot; incentives - by , say , requiring higher equity-asset ratios - would work wonders .
