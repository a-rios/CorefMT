Building a Safe Nanotechnology Future 
We are living - according to some - on the brink of a nanotechnology revolution , where matter is engineered at a scale thousands of times smaller than the eye can see , and familiar materials behave in unexpected ways . 
This revolution , if successful , will turn our world upside down . 
Nanotechnology gives us increasing control over the material world , providing opportunities to enhance existing technologies and develop new ones . 
The opportunities seem endless , from building stronger , lighter materials and manufacturing tremendously powerful yet incredibly small computers , to developing new sustainable energy sources and devising personalized cures for cancer . 
More than 500 manufacturer-identified nanotechnology consumer products are now on the market , from cosmetics to car parts to tableware . 
By 2014 an estimated $ 2.6 trillion in manufactured goods around the world ( or 15 % of total global output ) will use this technology , building on the research of scientists in some 100 nations around the world . If current projections are right , nanotechnology has the potential to have an impact on nearly every industry and virtually every aspect of our lives . 
Yet nanotechnology is also shaking up our understanding of what makes something harmful . 
At the nanometer scale ( about 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair ) , matter behaves in unusual ways : weak materials become strong , inert materials become active , and benign materials become harmful . 
In the same way that iron can be made into products as different as skillets and swords , the usefulness or harmfulness of nanotechnology products depends on how they are crafted at the nanometer scale . 
As a result , we can no longer rely on conventional ways of managing risk that are based on the raw materials alone . 
As the number of products using nanotechnology continues to grow , we need new scientific information on the risks that they might present . 
Experts in government , industry , academia , and elsewhere agree that a long list of questions needs to be addressed if we are to develop nanotechnology as safely as possible . 
The challenge we face is to find answers that will enable producers and regulators to make sound , science-based decisions , and to develop an oversight system that inspires consumer confidence . 
Unfortunately , the global response to this challenge has not been overwhelming . 
In 2005 , the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies looked closely at government-funded research addressing the environmental , health , and safety impact of nanotechnology . 
Investment in highly relevant research was low : in the United States , it was only an estimated 1 % of the $ 1.1 billion federal investment in nanotechnology research and development . 
More worrying was the apparent absence of any strategy behind the research being funded . 
Even the small handful of relevant studies exploring possible risks lacked a guiding focus , giving no indication that the information developed would help decision-makers ensure that nanotechnology is developed safely over the long term . 
The US has been tremendously successful in promoting research strategies that support the use of nanotechnology , and has served as a model that is being duplicated around the world . 
But the same strategies that work for developing nanotechnology applications will not help answer the growing list of questions about its possible impact that governments and industry are asking today . 
Pressing risk-related questions require deliberate action on an international scale . 
They will be answered only by matching research efforts and funding levels to the information needed to steer toward a safe future for nanotechnology applications . 
In 2006 , five research grand challenges for developing safe nanotechnology were published in the scientific journal Nature : 
· finding ways to measure the amount of nanomaterials in the air and water ; · learning how to assess how harmful nanomaterials are ; 
Some nations and regions are beginning to develop research agendas that respond to these five challenges . 
For example , the European Union has recently announced a € 3.6 billion nanotechnology research program , which includes environment , health , and safety goals that align with these challenges . 
Likewise , in March 2007 , the British government &apos;s top advisory body on science and technology warned that the country &apos;s lead in nanotechnology is fading , because the government has not invested enough in research necessary for understanding and effectively managing possible health and environmental effects . 
There is still a long way to go . 
If sustainable nanotechnology is to be built on sound science , global research strategies must be supported by innovative policies and accompanied by sufficient funds to do the job . 
In the US alone , estimates of the necessary funding levels for goal-oriented nanotechnology risk research are between $ 50 million and $ 100 million per year - five to ten times the amount invested in 2005 . 
We cannot afford to drive blind into the nanotechnology future . 
Despite a good start , many countries are developing these twenty-first century technologies within an old and blinkered mindset . 
If we do not develop the ways and means to spot and navigate around possible new risks , the outlook for this exciting new technology will be uncertain . 
We must wake up to the need for future nanotechnology applications to be based on a sound understanding of the possible impact . 
In the global race for nanotechnology leadership , the winners will be those who understand the risks and support the research necessary to minimize them .
