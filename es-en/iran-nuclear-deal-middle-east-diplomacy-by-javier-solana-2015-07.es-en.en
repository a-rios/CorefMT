Diplomacy &apos;s Long-Distance Race 
MADRID â€’ The successful outcome of the negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program provides a splendid validation for those who put their faith in diplomacy . 
The agreement - concluded after more than a decade of talks - highlights the value of persistence in addressing impasses that seem insurmountable , and provides hope for the many other initiatives that will be needed to bring lasting peace to the Middle East . 
The European Union , which initiated the talks , should be proud of its effort . 
And the United States &quot; role was remarkable , from Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s incessant work , even on crutches , to end the 35-year standoff between his country and Iran , to President Barack Obama &apos;s critical push to complete the negotiations . 
Likewise , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani should be commended for his determination to complete the undertaking he began more than a decade ago , when he served as Secretary of Iran &apos;s Supreme National Security Council . 
Rouhani and I met in 2003 , sitting across from each other at the first nuclear talks , when our negotiating team was made up of only Europeans . 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s election as President of Iran in 2005 derailed those talks and ultimately led to the imposition of sanctions . 
And , indeed , when Rouhani succeeded Ahmadinejad in 2013 , a door opened . 
Rouhani invited me to his inauguration in August 2013 . 
During that visit , I was able to attend meetings with him and other top Iranian leaders , including Mohammad Zarif , Iran &apos;s foreign minister and , later , its chief negotiator in the negotiations in Vienna . 
I quickly saw that with these men at Iran &apos;s helm , an agreement would be possible . 
The agreement - known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) - limits Iran &apos;s nuclear program to peaceful purposes in exchange for lifting all international sanctions on the country . 
For the next 15 years , Iran will not be permitted to enrich uranium to more than 3.67 % ( to build a nuclear bomb requires uranium enriched to at least 85 % ) . 
Enrichment will be permitted only at the nuclear facility at Natanz - not at the subterranean Fordow installation . 
And Iran will have to keep its stock of 3.67 % -enriched uranium to below 300 kilograms . 
Moreover , the JCPOA will oblige Iran to reduce its number of centrifuges , which are used in the enrichment process , progressively for the next ten years . 
Likewise , the heavy-water reactor at Arak will have to be redesigned to produce only radioisotopes for medicinal and industrial purposes , or for research into other peaceful uses of nuclear energy , with the spent fuel it produces shipped out of the country . 
Most important , Iran has committed itself to apply the Additional Protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency , providing the organization with round-the-clock access to all components of its nuclear program for 15 years . 
The IAEA will also monitor the production of centrifuges for 20 years . 
The agreement was made possible by the fact that Iran &apos;s interlocutors - the permanent members of the UN Security Council , Germany , and the EU ( E3 / EU + 3 ) - were able to maintain a common position during a process that played out for more than ten years . 
This was true even during the negotiating push , when a debate over the sanctions against Iran &apos;s trade in conventional arms and ballistic missiles threatened to open a breach between the partners . 
While Russia and China asserted that signing an agreement would render any kind of sanction legally unjustifiable , the US sought to allay the fears of Iran &apos;s neighbors as much as possible . 
The consensus among the negotiating partners - one of the few points of agreement regarding the Middle East among the Security Council &apos;s permanent membership - was crucial in convincing Iran to take the negotiations seriously . 
And , at a time of persistent tension between Russia and the US and Europe , which has resulted in chronic political gridlock in the Security Council , the parties &quot; ability to remain united justifies greater optimism about the future . 
Indeed , it is worth considering whether cooperation between the permanent members of the Security Council and the EU might be useful for moving forward on other matters . 
The West and Russia share an interest in stability in the Middle East , as does China , which is particularly concerned with the security of its energy supplies . 
What is most needed - and most difficult to achieve - is a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia . 
Many of the conflicts in the Middle East have their roots in the tension between Sunni and Shia Islam . 
Cooperation between Sunnis and Shias will be vital to defeat the extremism of the Islamic State , as well as to bridge gaps between combatants in Syria , Iraq , Yemen , and Lebanon . 
Iran must demonstrate that it is a responsible player in the region - not simply a backer of Shia power . 
The reestablishment of ties between the US and Iran will , no doubt , have repercussions in Israel and Palestine . 
Although the agreement with Iran objectively makes Israel safer , Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu considers it a historic error . 
To assuage its traditional ally &apos;s sense of abandonment , the US , may - mistakenly - withhold support for the initiatives recognizing the State of Palestine in the coming months . 
But it is essential that the EU , which finances and maintains Palestine &apos;s provisional institutions , not relent in its determination to make them permanent . 
The historic agreement with Iran is just one of many that will be required to bring peace and stability to the Middle East . 
The first hurdle has been overcome . 
We must now run the rest of the race .
