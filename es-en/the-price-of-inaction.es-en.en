The Price of Inaction 
BERKELEY - Are the world &apos;s governments capable of keeping the world economy out of a deep and long depression ? 
Three months ago , I would have said yes , without question . 
Now , I am not so certain . 
The problem is not that governments are unsure about what to do . 
The standard checklist of what to do in a financial crisis to avoid a deep and prolonged depression has been gradually worked out over two centuries : by Bank of England Governor Cornelius Buller in 1825 ; by the Victorian-era editor of The Economist , Walter Bagehot ; and by the economists Irving Fisher , John Maynard Keynes , Milton Friedman , among many others . 
The key problem in times like these is that investor demand for safe , secure , and liquid assets - and thus their value - is too high , while demand for assets that underpin and finance the economy &apos;s productive capital is too low . 
The obvious solution is for governments to create more cash to satisfy the demand for safe , secure , liquid assets . 
As Keynes liked to say : &quot; Unemployment develops ... because people want the moon &quot; - safe , secure , and liquid assets . 
The solution is &quot; to persuade the public that green cheese &#91; i.e. , the notes printed by the central bank &#93; is practically the same thing and to have a green cheese factory &#91; i.e. a central bank &#93; under public control ... &quot; 
By buying government bonds for cash , a central bank can satisfy demand and push down the price of cash . 
When there is no excess demand for cash , there will be no excess supply of the bonds and stocks that underpin and finance the economy &apos;s productive capital . 
Thus , expansionary monetary policy via standard open-market operations by a central bank is the first item on the checklist of what to do in a financial crisis . 
Three months ago , I argued that all but a tiny and unbalanced fringe of economists approve of expansionary open-market operations to keep total nominal spending constant in a downturn , and I was right . 
I was also right to say that all but a tiny and unbalanced fringe of economists approve of central-bank guarantees of system stability , in order to prevent the risk of a collapse of the payments system from becoming a first-order consideration boosting the demand for cash to unnatural levels . 
The problem comes when expansionary monetary policy via standard open-market operations and central-bank guarantees of orderly markets prove insufficient . 
Economists disagree about when , under what circumstances , and in what order governments should move beyond these first two items on the checklist . 
Should governments try to increase monetary velocity by selling bonds , thereby boosting short-term interest rates ? 
Should they employ unemployed workers directly , or indirectly , by bringing forward expenditures or expanding the scale of government programs ? 
Should they explicitly guarantee large financial institutions &quot; liabilities and / or classes of assets ? 
Should they buy up assets at what they believe is a discount from their long-run values , or buy up assets that private investors are unwilling to trade , even at a premium above their likely long-run values ? 
Should governments recapitalize or nationalize banks ? 
Should they keep printing money even after exhausting their ability to inject extra liquidity into the economy via conventional open-market operations , which is now the case in the United States and elsewhere ? 
Three months ago , I said that there was considerable disagreement about these issues , but that two things were certain . 
First , we do not know enough about when , under what circumstances , and in what order governments should resort to these checklist items . 
Second , trying a combination of these items - even a confused and haphazard combination - was better than doing nothing . 
All five of the world &apos;s major economies implemented their own confused and haphazard combinations of monetary , fiscal , and banking stimulus policies during the Great Depression , and the sooner they did - the sooner each began its own New Deal - the better . 
Japan and Britain began their New Deals in 1931 . 
Germany and the US began theirs in 1933 . 
France waited until 1936 . 
Japan and Britain recovered first and fastest from the Great Depression , Germany and the US followed well behind , and France brought up the rear . 
The conclusion that I draw from this is that we should try a combination of all checklist measures - quantitative monetary easing ; bank guarantees , purchases , recapitalizations , and nationalizations ; direct fiscal spending and debt issues - while ensuring that we can do so fast enough and on a large enough scale to do the job . 
Yet I am told that the chances of getting more money in the US for an extra round of fiscal stimulus this year is zero , as is the chance of getting more money this year to intervene in the banking system on an even larger scale than America &apos;s Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) . 
There is an 80 % chance that waiting until 2010 and seeing what policies look appropriate then would not be disastrous . 
But that means that there is a 20 % chance that it would be . 
And the US , it should be noted , is the most aggressive and best behaved of all major governments .
