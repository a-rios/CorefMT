The Enigma of European Defense 
PARIS - While Europe &apos;s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy , most European leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one - including at last month &apos;s European Council meeting . 
What accounts for this paradox ? 
One possible explanation is that financially strained European governments lack the means to fulfill their citizens &quot; expectations . 
But that is unconvincing , given that the issue was framed in almost identical terms three decades ago , when budgetary constraints were not a problem . 
In fact , it could be argued that such constraints should spur , not impede , the creation of a European defense structure . 
After all , member countries would then be able to pool their resources , harmonize programs , and rationalize costs , thereby reducing individual governments &quot; financial burden . 
Another , far more credible explanation is that Europeans &quot; interpretations of &quot; a more active and stronger security policy &quot; differ widely . 
Indeed , current discussions in Europe concerning the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives , championed by France , the United Kingdom , and Germany . 
France , which has once again intervened in Africa - this time to restore order in the Central African Republic - is the only European Union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust European security structures . 
The French consider Europe to be a kind of superpower - a status that implies a corresponding military capacity . 
While this view probably stems from France &apos;s historical political and military prowess , it also reflects the country &apos;s current interests . 
As Europe &apos;s greatest military power ( despite the UK &apos;s larger defense budget ) , France would play a key role in any wide-ranging European military operation . 
The UK , for its part , shares France &apos;s belief that military power is a prerequisite to strategic effectiveness . 
But , given that no other EU country has seriously considered excluding NATO , this argument seems to be little more than an excuse . 
The truth is that the only kind of defense the British accept is that conducted by a coalition of European states acting under their national flags , as occurred in Libya . 
In the UK &apos;s view , &quot; European &quot; operations should be limited to humanitarian and peacekeeping objectives . 
While it supported the fight against piracy off the Horn of Africa , that was more a policing operation than a military one , and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade routes from the Middle East and Asia . 
Germany &apos;s vision of European defense is very different from the French and British perspectives . 
Unlike the UK , Germany supports a European security and defense policy , proudly highlighting its consistent military budget and major presence in European missions ( larger than that of the overstretched French ) . 
And , though Germany shares the UK &apos;s belief that NATO bears primary responsibility for protecting Europe , its view of European engagement is even more restrictive . 
In Germany &apos;s view , European military intervention should be limited to the continent , and should not include combat operations . 
In fact , a majority of Europe &apos;s citizens prefer that European forces be deployed only for non-combat missions . 
And , so far , virtually all European military operations have been aimed at evacuating European nationals , delivering humanitarian aid , or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict . These differing views explain the uncertainty surrounding France &apos;s recent interventions in Africa . 
The French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic - exemplified by Germany &apos;s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations . 
But , given the urgency of the situations in Libya , Mali , and the Central African Republic , this lack of support has not undermined France &apos;s efforts as much as prior consultation with European leaders would have done . 
Had the Germans been consulted , they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway . 
This conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliberation explains why the EU &apos;s much-discussed &quot; battlegroups &quot; are unlikely ever to be deployed . 
The fact that most Europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of Europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely . 
A pessimist would say that Europeans are unable - or at least unwilling - to rethink their defense policy , because the US ultimately ensures their security through NATO . 
According to this view , France &apos;s efforts to encourage both transatlantic integration and autonomous political action are insufficient to change most Europeans &quot; minds . 
A more optimistic interpretation is that Europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states - not just for that of the EU . 
From this perspective , Europe does have a significant military presence , whether in Afghanistan and Libya or Mali and the Central African Republic . 
That is a start .
