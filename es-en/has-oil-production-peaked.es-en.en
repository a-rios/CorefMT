Has Oil Production Peaked ? 
OXFORD - Throughout the history of the oil industry , fear and concern about the imminent exhaustion of oil reserves has been a recurring theme . 
Such sentiments often spread and capture the public imagination at times of rapidly rising oil demand , sharp spikes in energy prices , and geo-political uncertainty . 
So today &apos;s talk of oil scarcity , which began at the turn of the last century , should come as no surprise . 
Believers in oil scarcity point to the sustained annual average increase of oil prices from 2002 to 2008 , declining output in many areas of the world , and the absence ( until recently off the coast of Brazil ) of large-scale oil discoveries in the last few decades . 
All these factors lend credence to the view that oil production has peaked . 
In the face of relentless demand-side pressure , driven mainly by high-growth countries like China and India , some predict stratospheric energy prices , supply shortages , economic and social hardship , and even resource wars . 
Given that oil is a non-renewable resource , in a sense the world is always running out of it . 
Unless global demand collapses , at some point in the future oil production will peak and eventually be exhausted . 
But this prediction is close to a tautology . 
For it to be useful , believers in scarce oil must be able to predict such things as the timing of the oil peak , the state of demand when oil production reaches it , and the pattern of decline . 
But the track record of &quot; peak oil &quot; theorists on such matters has not been impressive : their predictions have steadily moved forward the date that global oil production will peak . 
Worse still , they have made no serious attempt to identify why their earlier predictions have had to be revised . 
A major problem is that such predictions often confuse resources with reserves . 
Resources are the available volumes of hydrocarbon without reference to constraints as to their accessibility and / or cost . 
Resources impose an upper bound on what ultimately can be produced ; thus , it is the relevant concept for determining the likely dates of peak production and ultimate exhaustion . 
If the volume of oil resources were known with certainty , and if we could accurately predict the growth of oil consumption , calculating the imminence of exhaustion would be simple . 
But these are big &quot; ifs &quot; - especially given the high level of uncertainty regarding the ultimate volume of oil resources . 
While peak oil theorists have strong views about that , they do not allow for all the current and future technological possibilities that might increase resources . 
Indeed , given the difficulty in estimating the total size of resources , many consider peak oil theories irrelevant . 
Fortunately , the focus of the debate is on reserves and not resources . 
Reserves are defined as the quantities of petroleum that are expected to be commercially recoverable from known fields . 
The concept of reserves is technical and economic , not geological . 
It is also a non-static concept , as estimates of reserves will generally be revised upwards or downwards as additional geologic or engineering data become available , as technology improves , and / or as economic conditions ( such as oil prices and production costs ) change . 
In fact , the bulk of recent growth in world reserves is due not to new discoveries , but mainly to reserve growth and improved recovery rates . 
Moreover , despite what many believe , crude oil is far from being a homogenous product . 
There is a fossil carbon continuum ranging from easy , conventional oil , to deep and ultra-deep offshore oil , to extra-heavy crude oil . 
With technological progress and rising oil prices , most of these reserves will become conventional , helping to push back peak oil for years . 
The failure to distinguish clearly between resources and reserves - and to recognize the importance of prices , costs , and technology in transforming resources into reserves - results in bad predictions about an imminent peak in oil production and misinformation that has had a negative impact on policymaking . 
Rather than focusing on the major short- and long-term challenges facing the oil industry , the debate about peak oil diverts attention to the wrong problems . 
In the short term , there are concerns that oil production will peak soon , owing not to the unavailability of reserves , but to obstacles to investment - for example , access to reserves , sanctions , and policy uncertainty . 
Some who believe in the imminence of peak oil consider these barriers essentially irrelevant , arguing that their removal would merely delay the peak for a few years . 
But , in the long term , the challenge is how to make the transition to a new and sustainable energy path , and to evaluate the political , economic , social and climate costs associated with this transition . 
Unfortunately , that debate has not yet started . 
The current tone surrounding the peak oil debate is reminiscent of that surrounding the global war on terror , with the phrase &quot; you &apos;re either with us or against us &quot; recycled to polarize observers and analysts . 
But as in any other debate , once extreme positions dominate , the real problems are trivialized and marginalized .
