Rushdie a la Russe 
June will be a cruel month in Russia &apos;s courts . 
On June 16th , the rebellious oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his comrade-in-arms Platon Lebedev finally began to face the judges of the Meshchansky district court . 
No doubt , this case will attract the Russian and international press . 
Hearings began just the day before Khodorkovsky &apos;s trial opened in another case that is no less significant . 
In January 2003 , a gang of Russian Orthodox activists destroyed an exhibition in the Sakharov Museum and Public Center called &quot; Caution ! 
Religion . &quot; 
The organizers of the exhibition stated that they wanted to attract attention to the new role of religious institutions in Russian life . 
Last December , prosecutors charged two Sakharov Museum officials and three of the exhibition &apos;s organizers with inciting religious hatred . 
They now face prison terms of up to five years . 
The vandals , meanwhile , were hailed by church officials as heroes . 
All charges against them were dismissed . 
The vandals had influential protectors . 
All of them were members of the congregation of St. Nicholas in Pyzhi , whose archpriest , Alexander Shargunov , is a well-known radical fundamentalist . 
In 1997 , he established a movement called the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland . 
In 2001 , the committee &apos;s Web site carried instructions on how to vandalize &quot; immoral &quot; billboards by splashing paint on them . 
Followers promptly destroyed 150 billboards in Moscow . 
A group of well-known nationalist intellectuals , including film director Nikita Mikhalkov , artist Ilya Glazunov , and writers Valentin Rasputin and Vasily Belov , weighed in with a petition calling the exhibition a &quot; new stage of conscious Satanism . &quot; 
They wrote that Russia &apos;s enemies were bent on humiliating the powerless &quot; Russian people , their objects of worship , and their historic values . &quot; 
Who , precisely , were these powerful enemies ? 
The intellectuals didn &apos;t identify them , but the fascist political party Pamyat ( Memory ) did not hesitate . 
The appeal posted on its Web site called on Orthodox Christians to protect &quot; our Lord Jesus Christ &quot; from &quot; Yid-degenerates , &quot; using the most derogatory Russian term for Jews . 
These alarming events in the art world have taken place against a background of rising nationalism and Orthodox assertiveness in Russia . 
The Orthodox Church has acquired enormous political clout in recent years , and few politicians risk offending it . 
The Sakharov Museum exhibition was subjected to a vituperative media campaign , and the matter was almost immediately taken up in the Duma , where nationalist deputies vied with each other to denounce the artists and laud the vandals . 
In February 2003 , the Duma passed a decree stating that the Sakharov museum exhibition &apos;s purpose was to incite religious hatred and to insult believers and the Orthodox Church . 
The state prosecutor was ordered to take action against the organizers , with 265 of 267 deputies approving the measure . 
In April 2003 , the Duma voted to toughen the law against inciting religious hatred by adding prison terms of up to five years for offenders . 
In December 2003 , Sakharov Museum director Yuri Samodurov was charged with actions &quot; leading to the provocation of hatred and enmity . &quot; 
If found guilty , he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison . 
Church officials are not calling for that harsh a penalty . 
In March 2004 , the Moscow Patriarchy &apos;s External Relations Department issued a statement that surprised everyone . 
It asserted , in effect , that the Sakharov Museum exhibition organizers had committed an administrative rather than a criminal offense . 
The difference is that administrative offenses are punished with fines , at most , not prison terms . 
Such a softening of the church &apos;s position was probably the result of the public outcry in Russia &apos;s liberal press . 
Yet the pogrom at the Sakharov museum provoked a chain reaction of similar attacks on contemporary art by Orthodox fundamentalists whom the church has been unable to control . 
Anna Alchuk , an artist who participated in the exhibition in the Sakaharov Center and was later charged , said she had read all 14 volumes of evidence collected by the prosecutor , and that 11 volumes consisted entirely of letters from &quot; working people &quot; expressing outrage at the show and demanding that the artists be punished . 
Almost none of the writers had seen the exhibition - most had signed form letters . 
&quot; The events around the exhibition discredit the Russian Orthodox Church , just as the fatwah condemning Salman Rushdie to death discredited Islam , &quot; said Elena Bonner , Andrei Sakharov &apos;s widow . 
The outcome of the court hearings is difficult to predict , but it will answer the question of whether Russians have lost the freedom artistic self-expression that they gained after communism &apos;s fall . 
Disillusion with &quot; democracy Boris Yeltsin-style &quot; has pushed President Vladimir Putin to search for an ideology based on nationalism and the glorification of the state . 
Putin calls it &quot; managed pluralism . &quot; 
As we can now see , the Social Committee For the Moral Revival of the Fatherland wants to be among the managers .
