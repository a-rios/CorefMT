The Crimes of Ratko Mladić 
NEW YORK - Ratko Mladić is an easy man to hate . 
In his prime , he not only talked and behaved like a thug , but he also looked like one - the kind of bull-necked , pale-eyed , snarling psychopath who would gladly pull out your fingernails just for fun . 
Apart from many other cruelties , the Butcher of Bosnia was responsible , in the summer of 1995 , for the killing of around 8,000 unarmed Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the woods around Srebrenica . 
So it will give most of us a feeling of warm satisfaction that he has finally been arrested in the Serbian village of Lazarevo . 
Serbia has gained respect by arresting Mladić , which should speed up its membership in the European Union . 
The former victims of Mladić &quot; s Bosnian Serb forces will feel that some justice is being done at last . 
Yet the forthcoming trial of Ratko Mladić raises certain uncomfortable questions . 
Why , in the first place , can &apos;t he be put on trial in Belgrade , instead of The Hague ? 
And is it really wise to charge him with genocide , as well as crimes against humanity and war crimes ? 
Both questions reveal how much we still live in the shadow of the Nuremberg Tribunal , where the Nazi leaders were tried by an international judicial panel . 
It was believed , perhaps correctly , that the Germans would be incapable of trying their own former leaders . 
And the Nazi crimes had been so horrendous in scale and intent that new laws - &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; - had to be created to try those who had been formally responsible for them . 
States , too , should be held accountable for their deeds - hence , in 1948 , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . 
The Holocaust was not the main issue at stake in the Nuremberg Trials . 
Nevertheless , the allies thought that the Nazi project of exterminating an entire people called for an entirely new legal approach , to ensure that such an atrocity would never happen again . 
The problem with genocide , as a legal concept , is that it is vague . 
It refers to &quot; acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial , or religious group . &quot; 
The emphasis is on &quot; intent , &quot; not on the numbers of people whose lives are destroyed . 
Mao Zedong murdered up to 40 million Chinese , but did he intend to destroy them as a group ? 
Surely not . 
We know that Hitler did intend to destroy every last Jewish man , woman , and child . 
Even though mass killings are not rare in history , Hitler &apos;s extermination plan was , if not unique , certainly highly unusual . 
However , the laudable effort to prevent such a thing from recurring has had unfortunate consequences . 
For , in our zeal to learn lessons from history , we often learn the wrong ones , or distort history towards dubious ends . 
In a way , the killings at Srebrenica also were affected by the memories of World War II . 
The United Nations &quot; Dutch battalion promised to protect the Muslims there , even though it was in no position to do so . 
It was a promise that partly reflected the feeling of guilt that still haunts the Dutch for looking the other way as the Germans rounded up and deported two-thirds of their country &apos;s Jewish population to death camps . 
This time , it would be different . 
This time , they would act . 
Alas , outnumbered and outgunned by Mladić &quot; s forces , the Dutch surrendered Srebrenica to its fate . 
Because of the trauma of Hitler &apos;s intention to murder all of the Jews , genocide has become the one compelling reason for military action , including armed invasion of other countries . 
But what constitutes genocide ? 
Bernard Kouchner , the founder of Doctors Without Borders , wanted the world to intervene in Nigeria in 1970 , because he saw the killing of Ibos by Nigerian troops as a genocidal echo of Auschwitz . 
Others saw a brutal civil war , and cautioned that intervention would make things worse . 
For some , we are forever living in 1938 , or rather , 1942 , when the Nazis approved what Hitler called &quot; the final solution of the Jewish question . &quot; 
President George W. Bush and his cheerleaders , invoking the Munich Agreement at every opportunity , regarded the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , as a call to arms . 
Saddam Hussein was Hitler , so we had to send in the troops . 
We should stop Sudan &apos;s Omar al-Bashir &apos;s genocide in Darfur . 
We must stop Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from committing mass murder in Benghazi . 
And so on . 
Sometimes intervention might save lives . 
But wars often beget more wars , or longer ones . 
Military action can cause more violence , and more civilian deaths . 
This is especially true of intervention in civil wars , where the sides cannot easily be divided into victims and aggressors , good and evil . 
Of course , the world becomes much simpler if we choose to see it in black and white . 
And the Mladić trial will , no doubt , encourage this perception . 
He will be tried for genocide , because the UN &apos;s tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice decided that the Bosnian Serbs were genocidal . 
Since his subordinate , Radislav Krstić , was already sentenced for his complicity in the genocide at Srebrenica , Mladić will presumably be convicted . 
We need not feel sorry for Mladić . 
There is no doubt that he is guilty of serious war crimes . 
And a trial , however unsatisfactory , is in most cases still to be preferred to an assassination . 
But trying him for genocide , even though it will be hard to prove that he ever intended to exterminate Bosnian Muslims as a group , just because they were Muslims , will further muddy the term &apos;s already vague definition . 
Mladić was engaged in ethnic cleansing , which , though reprehensible , is not the same as genocide . 
Loose definitions will encourage more military interventions , thus more wars . 
By invoking Hitler &apos;s ghost too often , we trivialize the enormity of what he actually did .
