Big Banks &quot; Tall Tales 
WASHINGTON , DC - There are two competing narratives about recent financial-reform efforts and the dangers that very large banks now pose around the world . 
One narrative is wrong ; the other is scary . 
At the center of the first narrative , preferred by financial-sector executives , is the view that all necessary reforms have already been adopted ( or soon will be ) . 
Banks have less debt relative to their equity levels than they had in 2007 . 
New rules limiting the scope of bank activities are in place in the United States , and soon will become law in the United Kingdom - and continental Europe could follow suit . 
Proponents of this view also claim that the megabanks are managing risk better than they did before the global financial crisis erupted in 2008 . 
In the second narrative , the world &apos;s largest banks remain too big to manage and have strong incentives to engage in precisely the kind of excessive risk-taking that can bring down economies . 
Last year &apos;s &quot; London Whale &quot; trading losses at JPMorgan Chase are a case in point . 
And , according to this narrative &apos;s advocates , almost all big banks display symptoms of chronic mismanagement . 
While the debate over megabanks sometimes sounds technical , in fact it is quite simple . 
Ask this question : If a humongous financial institution gets into trouble , is this a big deal for economic growth , unemployment , and the like ? 
Or , more bluntly , could Citigroup or a similar-size European firm get into trouble and stumble again toward failure without attracting some form of government and central bank support ( whether transparent or somewhat disguised ) ? 
The US took a step in the right direction with Title II of the Dodd-Frank reform legislation in 2010 , which strengthened the resolution powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . 
And the FDIC has developed some plausible plans specifically for dealing with domestic financial firms . 
( I serve on the FDIC &apos;s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee ; all views stated here are my own . ) 
But a great myth lurks at the heart of the financial industry &apos;s argument that all is well . 
The FDIC &apos;s resolution powers will not work for large , complex cross-border financial enterprises . 
The reason is simple : US law can create a resolution authority that works only within national boundaries . 
Addressing potential failure at a firm like Citigroup would require a cross-border agreement between governments and all responsible agencies . 
On the fringes of the International Monetary Fund &apos;s just-completed spring meetings in Washington , DC , I had the opportunity to talk with senior officials and their advisers from various countries , including from Europe . 
I asked all of them the same question : When will we have a binding framework for cross-border resolution ? 
The answers typically ranged from &quot; not in our lifetimes &quot; to &quot; never . &quot; 
Again , the reason is simple : countries do not want to compromise their sovereignty or tie their hands in any way . 
Governments want the ability to decide how best to protect their countries &quot; perceived national interests when a crisis strikes . 
No one is willing to sign a treaty or otherwise pre-commit in a binding way ( least of all a majority of the US Senate , which must ratify such a treaty ) . 
As Bill Dudley , the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , put it recently , using the delicate language of central bankers , &quot; The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled . 
This is necessary to eliminate the so-called &quot; too big to fail &quot; problem . &quot; 
Translation : Orderly resolution of global megabanks is an illusion . As long as we allow cross-border banks at or close to their current scale , our political leaders will be unable to tolerate their failure . 
And , because these large financial institutions are by any meaningful definition &quot; too big to fail , &quot; they can borrow more cheaply than would otherwise be the case . 
Worse , they have both motive and opportunity to grow even larger . This form of government support amounts to a large implicit subsidy for big banks . It is a bizarre form of subsidy , to be sure , but that does not make it any less damaging to the public interest . 
After all , more debt ( relative to equity ) means a higher payoff when things go well . 
And , when things go badly , it becomes the taxpayers &quot; problem ( or the problem of some foreign government and their taxpayers ) . 
What other part of the corporate world has the ability to drive the global economy into recession , as banks did in the fall of 2008 ? 
And who else has an incentive to maximize the amount of debt that they issue ? 
What the two narratives about financial reform have in common is that neither has a happy ending . 
Either we put a meaningful cap on the size of our largest financial firms , or we must brace ourselves for the debt-fueled economic explosion to come .
