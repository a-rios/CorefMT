Soccer Lessons for Europe &apos;s Economy 
PRINCETON - Though a solution to the euro crisis continues to elude European leaders , the foundations of one are not difficult to discern . 
In fact , Europe &apos;s recent soccer experience - specifically , in the EURO 2012 tournament and this year &apos;s World Cup - provides insight into how to revive Europe &apos;s economy and address its deeper identity problem . 
On June 28 , 2012 , as European political leaders met in Brussels , amid growing uncertainty about the eurozone &apos;s survival , to negotiate the design of the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , Germany was playing Italy in a semifinal match in Warsaw . 
Two goals by Mario Balotelli cinched the win for Italy - and propelled Balotelli to superstar status . 
At such a politically sensitive moment , a German victory could have sparked a bitter nationalist reaction in southern Europe . 
Instead , encouraged by his country &apos;s victory , Italy &apos;s new technocratic prime minister , Mario Monti , in alliance with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy , pressed German Chancellor Angela Merkel for easier access to ESM support - and scored another major victory for his country . 
For a brief moment , Monti joined Balotelli in becoming a national hero . 
The Italian media eagerly linked the two &quot; Super Marios , &quot; with photomontages showing the prime minister with the soccer player &apos;s idiosyncratic mohawk hairstyle . 
The message from both the soccer field and the negotiating room was that there was a quick and easy route to victory , complex issues could be solved by a brilliant argument , and individual superstars were the key to success . 
The World Cup championship in Brazil was another matter altogether . 
This time , the Germans won , with a spectacular display of power in a 7-1 semifinal erasure of the host country , Brazil , and a 1-0 triumph over Argentina in the final . 
The disappointed supporters of the defeated teams viewed the games in terms of personalities . 
Brazil and Argentina had long histories of superstars : Pelé , Garrincha , Ronaldo , Alfredo di Stéfano , and Diego Maradona . 
In the semifinal , Brazil appeared to be paralyzed without its hero , Neymar , who wore the same number as Pelé but had been badly injured in the previous match . 
In the final , Argentineans believed that the world &apos;s best player , Lionel Messi , would surely carry the national team to victory . 
Of course , the German team had plenty of good players . 
Germany &apos;s World Cup performance was a brilliant demonstration of the importance of deep , long-term reforms . 
In the early 2000s , German soccer was boring . 
Germany &apos;s heroes were from the distant past . 
It was easy to draw an analogy between ineffective and mundane performance in the stadium and the general state of the country . 
At the time , Germany was regarded as the sick man of Europe , with a proclivity for highly protected labor markets . 
Something needed to be shaken up . 
In 2004 , the German national team &apos;s new trainer , Jürgen Klinsmann , did just that . 
Beyond more aggressive tactics , his radical new strategy entailed a fundamental revolution in sports education and training , with programs that identified and propelled promising young players through the teams in Germany &apos;s domestic league . 
In other words , it was a long-term strategy . 
Fortunately , the team &apos;s management understood this and persevered , despite the lack of a short-term payoff . 
Klinsmann &apos;s assistant trainer , Joachim Löw , succeeded him , and became the architect of the 2014 championship bid . 
Germany &apos;s soccer revolution was mirrored in the economy . 
Beginning in 2003 , Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , a Social Democrat , launched a series of reforms aimed at increasing labor-market flexibility and , more generally , laying the foundations for long-term prosperity . 
But this future-oriented approach had serious short-term political consequences , with Schröder losing the next election and his party &apos;s popularity diminishing considerably . 
Neither Schröder nor Klinsmann attained superstar status , but they carried out the reforms that mattered . 
There are other lessons that Germans and Europeans can derive from these experiences . 
One concerns the integration of foreigners . 
All of the major European teams , including Germany &apos;s , depend on players of foreign descent . 
In the Brazil game , Miroslav Klose , whose family hails from Poland , became the highest-scoring player in World Cup history . 
The half-Ghanaian Jérôme Boateng was a pillar of the German defense . 
Even Balotelli , Italy &apos;s EURO 2012 superstar , is the son of Ghanaian immigrants . 
But the most important lesson is that there are no quick fixes or magic bullets . 
An exceptional performance by a superstar soccer player can be beautiful - even inspiring - just as rescue mechanisms and stimulus packages can rally markets and raise hopes . 
Consistent , reliable , long-term success requires forward-thinking measures that focus on building strong fundamentals . 
Europe needs such an approach , one that includes microeconomic adjustments and programs that encourage mobility , flexibility , and innovation . 
If other Europeans emulated the German model , Europe would begin to look - and play - like a championship team .
