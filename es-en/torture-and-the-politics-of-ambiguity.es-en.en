Torture and the Politics of Ambiguity 
Each new revelation of physical abuse , maltreatment , and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners by American and British soldiers shocks international public opinion , leaving officials to scramble desperately to contain the damage . 
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld warns that more documentary evidence of wrongdoing at Abu Ghraib prison lies in store , evidently in the preemptive hope that the outrages stopped there . 
As a former US military intelligence interrogator , I am convinced that the images from Abu Ghraib are just the beginning . 
The wanton cruelty there is all too clearly symptomatic of a systemic failure . 
But what system failed ? 
Was it a failure of discipline and training - the result of sending inexperienced and unworldly reservists into poor conditions , abruptly extending their deployments , and then leaving them understaffed in the face of a growing influx of captured insurgents ? 
Or did the pattern of abuse amount to so many orders from superiors to &quot; soften up &quot; prisoners for interrogation ? 
The answer is most likely both and neither . 
Ultimately , what gives rise to abuses such as occurred at Abu Ghraib is a policy of deliberate ambiguity concerning how to handle detainees . 
The pressure in a war setting to get information that could save lives is immense . 
But , just as understandably , senior political and military officials - particularly in democracies - prefer to avoid any association with torture . 
Ambiguity is thus a political strategy that encourages the spread of implicit , informal rules of behavior , thereby shifting accountability onto the lowest ranking , least powerful , and most expendable soldiers . 
I completed the US Army &apos;s three-month basic interrogation course in the late 1980 &apos;s , after studying Russian at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey , California . 
The course was rigorous - only seven of 33 students finished it - as it required mastering the technical minutiae of collecting , crosschecking , standardizing , and reporting enormous masses of information . 
But the curriculum was much less meticulous concerning interrogation techniques . 
An interrogation , we were instructed , should begin with polite , direct questioning , because a certain number of detainees simply want to unburden themselves . 
If more persuasion was needed , we could offer rewards for cooperation - anything from cigarettes to political asylum . 
Beyond this , we were taught that we could &quot; apply pressure . &quot; 
The term was never defined in any formal setting , but the concept was not difficult to decipher . 
As US Army General Antonio Taguba &apos;s report on the abuses at Abu Ghraib puts it , the &quot; guard force &quot; was &quot; actively engaged in setting the conditions for successful exploitation of the internees . &quot; 
This obvious violation of the Army &apos;s rule prohibiting participation by military police in interrogation sessions does not surprise me . 
I was never taught that military police came under a separate chain of command . 
On the contrary , between classes , during breaks in field training , and in other informal settings , some of our instructors - typically older , more experienced interrogators - let it be known through insinuation and innuendo that we could have the guards beat uncooperative subjects . 
This was never said in the classroom , but even there , it was made clear that the role of military police was to serve the interrogators . 
After all , an interrogator &apos;s effectiveness depends on convincing the detainee of his omnipotence . 
If an interrogator promises better food or an extra blanket , the guards must provide it ; if an interrogator wants the detainee &apos;s cell to remain brightly lit all night , that must happen , too . 
The detainee simply must believe that his fate is entirely in the interrogator &apos;s hands . 
The hidden rules of the game came closest to being officially acknowledged during two uninterrupted weeks of simulated interrogations towards the end of the training course . 
These sessions involved only a student interrogator , an instructor in the role of the detainee , and a video camera . 
When , during a simulation , I asked an imaginary guard to take away the detainee &apos;s chair , the instructor feigned being removed violently . 
When I told the non-existent guard to hit the detainee , the instructor played along . 
All of us knew that a failed interrogation could mean being dropped from the course . 
I was not dropped ; 
For those who benefit from the politics of ambiguity , international law is an indispensable prop . 
In his recent US Senate testimony , Rumsfeld claimed that the military police at Abu Ghraib were instructed to abide by the Geneva conventions . 
So was I. Throughout my training as an interrogator , the admonition to follow the Geneva conventions accompanied virtually every discussion of &quot; applying pressure . &quot; 
Unfortunately , like &quot; applying pressure , &quot; the Geneva conventions were never defined . 
We never studied them , nor were we given a copy to read , much less tested on their contents . 
For many of us - teenagers or only slightly older - the Geneva conventions were at best a dimly remembered clich√© from war movies that meant , &quot; Don &apos;t do bad stuff . &quot; 
Again , the tacit rules said otherwise . 
One instructor joked that although the Geneva conventions barred firing a 50-caliber machine gun at an enemy soldier - an act defined as &quot; excessive force &quot; - we could aim at his helmet or backpack , since these were &quot; equipment . &quot; 
Others shared anecdotes about torturing detainees . 
Whether such talk was true is irrelevant . 
We were being conditioned to believe that the official rules set no clear limits , and that we could therefore set the limits wherever we liked . 
In the end , the politics of ambiguity may fail Rumsfeld ; all those high-resolution photographs from Abu Ghraib are anything but ambiguous . 
If similarly shameful disclosures multiply , as I believe they will , let us at least hope that official apologies and condemnations may finally give way to wider , more genuine accountability and reform .
