The Politics of Cosmic Catastrophe 
WASHINGTON , DC - One weighty decision that the world will need to make in 2010 is whether to support an idea raised by Anatoly Perminov , the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos , to launch an unmanned mission to redirect a large asteroid that might collide with Earth after 2030 . 
At more than 360 meters in diameter , the asteroid , Apophis , is a dozen times larger than the Tunguska space object ( presumably a meteorite or comet ) that devastated a large part of eastern Siberia a century ago . 
As far as can be determined , that object detonated on June 30 , 1908 , with the power of a nuclear weapon , felling 80 million trees over a 2,000-square-kilometer area . 
According to NASA , if Apophis hit the Earth , it could release more than 100,000 times the energy of the Tunguska event . 
Thousands of square kilometers could vaporize in the blast , but the whole Earth would suffer from the loss of sunlight and other effects of the dust released into the atmosphere . 
This danger explains why a Russian analyst has called Apophis a &quot; space terrorist . &quot; 
Current projections are that Apophis , which was discovered in 2004 , will orbit near the earth several times between 2029 and 2036 . 
In October 2009 , near-Earth object ( NEO ) trackers Steve Chesley and Paul Chodas of NASA &apos;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , placed the odds of Apophis striking Earth in 2036 at about one in 233,000 , lower than previous estimates . 
But their forecast that it would come within 30,000 kilometers of our planet in 2029 ( closer than some geostationary communications satellites , as well as the Moon ) is more likely to please astronomers than international security experts . 
Some unknown comet or other space object could fly near enough to the asteroid in the next few decades to change its predicted path , perhaps in a way that redirected it toward Earth . 
According to Perminov , the proposals that Roscosmos is considering do not envision trying to destroy the asteroid , but rather to use the laws of physics to change its path . 
He says that if Roscosmos &apos;s management decided to act , it would work with experts from Europe , the United States , China , and other space powers to decide how best to proceed . 
Scientists have proposed various ways to deflect an asteroid away from the Earth . 
Some have suggested placing a large object nearby to change its trajectory through mutual gravitational attraction . 
Another method is to use mirrors , light , or painted colors to change the way the asteroid absorbs heat , which could also shift its direction . 
Attaching &quot; solar sails &quot; to the asteroid could cause the Sun &apos;s particles to steer it along a different course . 
Others have suggested ramming a spacecraft or other object into the asteroid to alter its momentum . 
A few scientists , and many science-fiction writers , have also speculated about using nuclear weapons to destroy or damage an asteroid , comet , meteor , or alien spacecraft heading toward the earth . 
The Outer Space Treaty bans placing nuclear weapons in orbit , on celestial bodies , or stationing &quot; such weapons in outer space in any other manner , &quot; but may be interpreted to permit their one-time use . 
It also could be amended , or the states &quot; attacking &quot; the asteroid could withdraw from the agreement by giving one year &apos;s notice . 
The more practical problem is that even a nuclear explosion might not prove sufficiently powerful . 
Even if the nuclear warhead broke the asteroid into many small pieces , they could have time to re-combine into another large object . 
In addition , the space vehicle carrying the weapon might malfunction , and the nuclear warhead could land ( and perhaps detonate ) somewhere on Earth . 
The safest approach might be to test several techniques on nearby asteroids before using them against Apophis when it approaches Earth . 
Unfortunately , it is estimated that &quot; attacking &quot; an asteroid would cost billions of dollars , especially since multiple space launches would likely be needed to ensure that the required number of probes could complete the mission . 
This raises the issue of who should pay for such a mission and , more fundamentally , who can authorize it . 
These global governance questions also apply to other worldwide threats , such as climate change , that threaten humanity &apos;s survival . 
In 2008 , a report by space experts called for the United Nations Security Council to make the final decision about how to counter potential threats from near-Earth objects . 
The Security Council normally votes on issues that threaten international peace and security , but this method would allow only a small number of governments to decide Earth &apos;s fate . 
Perminov similarly seemed to suggest that only countries with large existing space programs could participate in the Apophis decision . 
Since an asteroid collision could , like global climate change , affect all of humanity , should not everyone have some say in the decision ? 
Perhaps every country should vote in the UN General Assembly on how to proceed ; the option receiving the most votes - with a possible mandatory minimum requirement , such as requiring an alternative to win a majority or some higher number of votes - would prevail . 
Another option would be to allow every adult to vote directly in a global referendum for his or her preferred option . 
An interesting issue would arise if some countries wanted to act , but others did not . 
Would Russia or a coalition of willing countries have the right to attempt to alter Apophis &quot; orbit without the approval of other states ? 
What are the rights and duties of scientists and governments who consider the risks to be graver than their counterparts in other countries do ? 
Are they precluded from acting without unanimity ? 
Perminov &apos;s proposal has raised important questions - both scientific and political . 
Whatever the danger posed by Apophis , we would do well to begin addressing them .
