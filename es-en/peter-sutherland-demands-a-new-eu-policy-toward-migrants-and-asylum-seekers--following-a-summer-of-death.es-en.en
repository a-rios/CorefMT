Dying for Europe 
LONDON - This summer , a gruesome tragedy unfolded aboard a ship in the Mediterranean Sea . 
Twenty-nine men , women , and children fleeing crisis-torn countries succumbed to engine fumes in the vessel &apos;s hold . 
As 60 others scrambled to escape , the human traffickers carrying them to Europe stabbed them and threw them into the sea off the coast of Lampedusa . 
Eventually , a Danish petrol tanker rescued 569 survivors . 
More recently , some 500 migrants died off the coast of Malta , when a group of human traffickers responded to the passengers &quot; refusal to move onto smaller vessels by deliberately ramming the boat that had carried them from Egypt . 
Less than a week later , dozens of asylum-seekers perished when their boat capsized near the Libyan coast . 
Such large numbers of deaths in and around Europe should do more than briefly seize headlines . 
But Europeans seem inured to the plight of asylum-seekers and migrants , almost 3,000 of whom have died in the Mediterranean this year . 
This situation is untenable , both morally and politically . 
Of course , Europe cannot help all of those fleeing violence and destitution . 
But , as the world &apos;s wealthiest continent , it can certainly do more , especially if it adopts a unified approach . 
At a time when the number of displaced people is at an historic high , the European Union - which accounts for 29 % of global wealth - hosts just 9 % of refugees , leaving far poorer countries to carry most of the burden . 
For example , tiny Lebanon shelters more than one million of the three million Syrians who are displaced , whereas the EU - 100 times larger - has taken in only about 100,000 . 
The EU is hardly powerless to address the tragic situation in and around the Mediterranean . 
The new European Commission , Council , and Parliament should be able to uphold the EU &apos;s humanitarian obligations by reducing the number of deaths at sea , thereby setting the stage for a more reasonable public debate about migration , while improving strained relations with Africa . 
This will demand , first and foremost , that EU leaders overcome the forces that have so far impeded action . 
One obstacle is anti-migrant populism , which has intensified owing to the serious economic challenges that Europeans have faced . 
With far-right political parties nipping at their heels , most mainstream politicians have avoided taking a stance on migration that might make them seem &quot; soft . &quot; 
Equally paralyzing is the way that the tragic episodes in the Mediterranean are portrayed : as sudden crises , rather than as part of a long-term trend . 
As such , they often provoke fiery rhetoric and defensiveness , instead of thoughtful debate . 
For example , when the Arab Spring rebellions erupted in 2011 , many Europeans immediately feared that millions of North Africans would descend on their shores . 
In the three years since then , just 30,000 have arrived . 
Worse , this portrayal implies that little can be done to mitigate , or even prevent , such occurrences . 
But the longer-term trends driving such tragedies - including demographic shifts , inadequate legal routes to Europe , poor governance and economic prospects in origin countries , and skewed public perceptions of refugees and migrants - can , to various degrees , be addressed . 
For starters , European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker , European Council President Donald Tusk , and the European Parliament should work to ensure that the public debate about refugees and migrants is anchored in fact . 
As it stands , misconceptions are rampant , with residents of many EU countries believing , for example , that they host three times as many foreigners as they actually do . 
By debunking such myths , EU leaders can create space for action , while undercutting the credibility of populists . 
Second , in designing asylum and migration policies , the European Commission should involve member states &quot; foreign , employment , and development ministers , instead of just their interior ministers . 
The European Council also should deepen its engagement on these issues . 
Third , the EU should craft asylum , migration , and border systems that equitably distribute financial , political , and other costs . 
The so-called Common European Asylum System that prevails today is perceived as unfair by many member states , and violates the rights of many asylum seekers . 
Fourth , the EU should increase the number of refugees that it accepts , and give more people the option of applying for asylum without having to reach Europe &apos;s borders . 
This would result in fewer asylum-seekers making life-threatening voyages that leave their families deeply indebted - human traffickers charge as much as â‚¬ 15,000 ( $ 19,700 ) to cross the Mediterranean - only to be turned away . 
Finally , in order to help prevent the crises that lead to displacement , the EU should work to strengthen its relationships with African countries , especially those bordering the Mediterranean . 
Talk of an African Marshall Plan - with loans issued to local businesses , which would repay them to their national governments to use for infrastructure development - proliferated after the Arab Spring , but led nowhere . 
But such investment in Africa &apos;s development , together with a regular , structured dialogue , could help to ease many Africans &quot; plight . 
This would reduce their incentive to migrate and , in cases where people still aspire to reach Europe , facilitate a more orderly process . 
The EU &apos;s new leaders have an important opportunity to fashion a fresh approach to asylum and migration - one that recognizes that safe , orderly migration can bring major benefits to countries of origin and destination alike . 
Given Europeans &quot; tendency toward generosity and reason - qualities that their political leaders often underestimate - such an initiative would likely even bring political gains . 
In short , there is no compelling reason not to extend the principled policy approach on which Europe prides itself to those who would risk their lives to reach its shores .
