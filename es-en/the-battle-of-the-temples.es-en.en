The Battle of the Temples 
BANGKOK - The military skirmishes between Thailand and Cambodia that have claimed more than two dozen lives , caused scores of injuries , and displaced tens of thousands of people since February are primarily attributable to domestic politics in both countries . 
Rooted in ancient enmities and the legacy of the colonial era , the fighting is damaging the entire region . 
So virulent is the dispute that even a short-term settlement will require third-party mediation . 
A secure peace will depend mainly on how the endgame to Thailand &apos;s domestic political crisis plays out in the coming months - and on Cambodia &apos;s willingness to stay out of this process . 
At issue in the conflict is 4.6 square kilometers that adjoin a millennium-old Hindu temple known as &quot; Preah Vihear &quot; to Cambodians and &quot; Phra Viharn &quot; to Thais . 
Cambodia insists that the disputed land has been under its territorial sovereignty since a landmark case decided by the International Court of Justice in 1962 . 
In its 9-to-3 verdict , the ICJ ruled that Cambodia &apos;s map , drawn up by French surveyors in 1904-1907 , put the temple area in Cambodia , and that Thailand ( known as Siam until 1939 ) had not objected previously . 
During the hearings , Cambodia asked the ICJ to rule on the adjoining land , but the judges confined their decision only to the temple , as Cambodia originally requested . 
The French-made map became the core of the dispute , because it manipulated natural geographic divisions . 
Thailand rejects the map , which contravenes a Franco-Siamese agreement in 1904 stipulating a demarcation along a watershed line separating the two countries . 
Moreover , the French mapping effort took place just a decade after Siam ceded a clutch of territories - much of today &apos;s western Cambodia - to France , which was then perched above Indochina as the colonial master At that time , a vulnerable Siam was compelled to sign a host of unequal treaties with European powers in exchange for maintaining its independence . 
Until recently , the overlapping claims on the 4.6 square kilometers were not a serious issue . 
Villagers and merchants from both sides conducted a brisk business and border trade unfettered by the authorities . 
Bilateral tensions flared when Thai politics heated up after the September 2006 military coup that overthrew the democratically elected prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , on charges of corruption and disloyalty to the monarchy . 
In 2008 , after the self-exiled Thaksin &apos;s proxy force , the People &apos;s Power Party , took power following an election victory , the Thai government signed a joint communiqué agreeing to Cambodia &apos;s listing of Preah Vihear Temple as a UNESCO World Heritage site . 
The communiqué became a lightning rod for Thaksin &apos;s opponents at home , spearheaded by the People &apos;s Alliance for Democracy . 
The PAD depicted the UNESCO registration of Preah Vihear as a treasonous sell-out of Thai sovereignty , and used it to destabilize the pro-Thaksin government . 
When the PAD seized control of Government House and Bangkok &apos;s two airports , its protest leaders hectored Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and likened him to a hooligan . 
Exacerbating matters , the PAD progenitor of that insult became Thailand &apos;s foreign minister after Thaksin &apos;s opponents regained power in December 2008 , led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and reinforced by the army . 
At that point , tensions with Cambodia became inevitable . 
Hun Sen had scores to settle with the anti-Thaksin coalition of the Democrat Party , the PAD , and the army . 
In 2009 , Hun Sen appointed Thaksin as economic adviser to the Cambodian government and invited him to deliver a high-profile public address in Phnom Penh . 
The bilateral relationship has been rocky ever since , alternating between periods of friction and conciliation . 
The spate of armed clashes along the border this year stems from PAD provocations . 
Although some of its members entered the cabinet under Abhisit , PAD leaders felt betrayed and abandoned by Abhisit and some of his powerful backers . 
The PAD &apos;s yellow-clad supporters returned to the streets , this time under the banner of ultra-nationalism over Preah Vihear and a domestic anti-corruption campaign . 
The PAD has openly called for a military coup to clean up Thai politics . 
The PAD initially found little traction . 
The Thai army stayed out of the Preah Vihear controversy , and Abhisit &apos;s government shrugged off the PAD &apos;s machinations . 
But , as the anti-establishment , pro-Thaksin &quot; red shirts &quot; staged huge protests of their own against the army &apos;s suppression of their fellow demonstrators in April-May of last year , the men in uniform became agitated . 
A major tipping point may have been the red-shirt leaders &quot; allusion to the conspicuous royal silence in response to the army &apos;s violent suppression , which heightened the army &apos;s fear of a clear and present danger to the monarchy . 
The Thai army abandoned its neutral posture and became increasingly belligerent . 
It unilaterally ruled out the presence of regional observers on the Thai-Cambodian border , a deal mediated by Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa in February . 
The Abhisit government , congenitally beholden to the army , took its cue and effectively reneged on the Indonesia-brokered peace drive . 
It was a blow not only to Indonesia as the chair of Association of Southeast Asian Nations this year , but also to ASEAN itself , particularly given the organization &apos;s quest to become an ASEAN Community by 2015 . 
If ASEAN is not allowed a mediating role , the Thai-Cambodian spat may wind its way back to the United Nations Security Council , which earlier delegated the issue to ASEAN amidst heavy lobbying by Cambodia and Thailand . 
Cambodia wants to multilateralize the border conflict as much as Thailand tries to limit it to bilateral negotiations . 
Though the Thai-Cambodian border battles have involved tanks and heavy artillery , they are unlikely to degenerate into open , large-scale warfare . 
The ASEAN framework acts as a safety net and mutual commercial interests should ultimately prevail . 
But sporadic shooting and verbal antagonism between the two sides will continue , as Thailand &apos;s powers-that-be close ranks in a right-wing turn towards the symbols and institutions of royalism , entangling Hun Sen , who should have stayed on the sidelines , in the endgame unfolding in Bangkok .
