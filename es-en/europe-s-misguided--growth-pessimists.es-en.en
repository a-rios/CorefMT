Europe &apos;s Misguided &quot; Growth Pessimists &quot; 
Such is the deep pessimism in Europe about the economy that the better the economy does today , the worse people think it will do tomorrow . 
This year has been an excellent one for Europe &apos;s economic growth . 
Yet instead of thinking that the momentum building in 2006 will carry forward and make 2007 an even better year , Europe &apos;s gloomy experts are predicting a significant slowdown . 
For them , it seems out of the question that Europe can have two good years in a row . 
Of course , every year has its growth challenges , and 2007 will be no exception . 
What motivates - or frightens - the growth pessimists , in particular , are ( 1 ) higher European interest rates , ( 2 ) the slowing US economy , and ( 3 ) the increase in the German value-added tax ( VAT ) from 16 % to 19 % set for the beginning of the year . 
But they are wrong to be frightened by these factors . 
Fear over the growth effects of the European Central Bank &apos;s 2006 rate increases is based on confusion between real and nominal interest rates . 
By the end of the year , European interest rates will have been raised 150 basis points ( to 3.5 % , from 2 % in January ) . 
But European inflation is growing at approximately the same rate . 
This means that real interest rates - interest rates measured in terms of goods and services - have stayed the same . 
And it is the real interest rate - not the money rate - that counts for economic growth . 
Europe must ask itself : how can interest rates induce a slowdown in 2007 when real interest rates have hardly budged despite an economically healthy 2006 ? 
Moreover , because profits are high in Europe , likely future increases in real interest rates needed to ensure price stability easily can be financed out of profits without economic disruption . 
The truth of the matter is that interest rates - both nominal and real - are too low in Europe , not too high . 
As for the United States , plummeting gas prices - an extraordinary 25 % decline in roughly one month - have increased consumer confidence and spending at a time when consumers were supposed to be in full retreat because of the housing market decline . 
Moreover , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says the housing market correction is already almost over . 
Pessimistic Europeans are behind the curve . 
They are bracing for a 2007 US growth slowdown that already has taken place with little consequence for both the US and European economies . 
Of course , falling gas prices are occurring in Europe as well , and this will help take the sting out of the controversial VAT increase engineered by German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
The German Chancellor has been lucky . 
The falling gas price and Germany &apos;s high profits will &quot; finance &quot; the tax increase , which should prove little more than a speed bump for the German economy , at least if lower gas prices hold into the coming year . 
Indeed , the German government is slowly coming to realize that its pessimism about the economy has been misplaced , which is reflected in continuous &quot; upward revisions &quot; of growth forecasts throughout 2006 . 
Recently , the government raised its growth forecasts for this year and next , from 1.6 % to 2.3 % for 2006 , and from 1 % to 1.4 % for 2007 . 
Expect further upward revisions as the government continues to be surprised by the economy &apos;s ongoing strength . 
An important by-product of Europe &apos;s good growth is that it is making the need for structural reform an urgent matter . 
The lack of structural reform of Europe &apos;s labor markets , competitive practices , and so on means that European potential economic growth - its growth ceiling - is lower than it should be . 
With a low growth ceiling , strong economic performance generates inflationary pressures at a relatively early stage in the growth process . 
This makes it hard for Europe to enjoy an extended period of high growth without inflation . 
Premature inflationary pressures are a prime reason that both ECB presidents , the late Wim Duisenberg and now Jean-Claude Trichet , have consistently pressed for structural reform in their press conferences and speeches . 
It is the ECB , after all , that must fight the inflation caused by Europe &apos;s lack of structural reform . 
Growth pessimists have a point if they are wary about Europe &apos;s prospects for structural reform to raise the growth ceiling . 
Europe &apos;s politicians simply refuse to take the lead on this all-important issue . 
They are wrong , however , about Europe &apos;s prospects for achieving its restricted growth potential . 
Europe &apos;s actual economic growth has been quite good and - thanks to low gas prices , low real interest rates , solid profits , and strong growth momentum - promises to get better before the ceiling is hit and inflationary pressures set in . 
Call me a &quot; growth optimist , &quot; but Europe looks poised for another good growth year in 2007 .
