The American Anti-Intellectual Threat 
NEW YORK - In recent years , the United States has been more a source of global instability than a source of global problem-solving . 
Examples include the war in Iraq , launched by the US on false premises , obstructionism on efforts to curb climate change , meager development assistance , and the violation of international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions . 
While many factors contributed to America &apos;s destabilizing actions , a powerful one is anti-intellectualism , exemplified recently by Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin &apos;s surging popularity . 
By anti-intellectualism , I mean especially an aggressively anti-scientific perspective , backed by disdain for those who adhere to science and evidence . 
The challenges faced by a major power like the US require rigorous analysis of information according to the best scientific principles . 
Climate change , for example , poses dire threats to the planet that must be assessed according to prevailing scientific norms and the evolving capacity of climate science . 
The Nobel Prize-winning global scientific process called the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) has set the gold standard for scientific rigor in analyzing the threats of human-induced climate change . 
We need scientifically literate politicians adept at evidence-based critical thinking to translate these findings and recommendations into policy and international agreements . 
In the US , however , the attitudes of President Bush , leading Republicans , and now Sarah Palin , have been the opposite of scientific . 
The White House did all it could for eight years to hide the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are contributing to climate change . 
It tried to prevent government scientists from speaking honestly to the public . 
The Wall Street Journal has similarly peddled anti-science and pseudo-science to oppose policies to fight human-induced climate change . 
These anti-scientific approaches affected not only climate policy , but also foreign policy . 
The US went to war in Iraq on the basis of Bush &apos;s gut instincts and religious convictions , not rigorous evidence . 
Likewise , Palin has called the Iraq War &quot; a task from God . &quot; 
These are not isolated albeit powerful individuals out of touch with reality . 
They reflect the fact that a significant portion of American society , which currently votes mainly Republican , rejects or is simply unaware of basic scientific evidence regarding climate change , biological evolution , human health , and other fields . 
These voters generally do not reject the benefits of technologies that result from modern science , but they do reject the evidence and advice of scientists regarding public policies . 
Recent survey data by the Pew Foundation found that while 58 % of Democrats believe that human beings are causing global warming , only 28 % of Republicans do . 
Similarly , a 2005 survey found that 59 % of self-professed conservative Republicans rejected any theory of evolution , while 67 % of liberal Democrats accepted some version of evolutionary theory . 
To be sure , some of these deniers are simply scientifically ignorant , having been failed by the poor quality of science education in America . 
They reject geological evidence of climate change because they reject the science of geology itself . 
The issue here is not religion versus science . 
All of the great religions have traditions of fruitful interchange with - and , indeed , support for - scientific inquiry . 
The Golden Age of Islam a millennium ago was also the age in which Islamic science led the world . 
Pope John Paul II declared his support for the basic science of evolution , and Roman Catholic bishops are strongly in favor of limiting human-induced climate change , based on the scientific evidence . 
Several leading scientists , including one of the world &apos;s greatest biologists , E.O. Wilson , have reached out to religious communities to support the fight against human-induced climate change and the fight for biological conservation , and those religious communities have reached back in harmony with science . 
The problem is an aggressive fundamentalism that denies modern science , and an aggressive anti-intellectualism that views experts and scientists as the enemy . 
It is those views that could end up getting us all killed . 
After all , that kind of extremism can even lead to war , based on perverted views that a particular war is God &apos;s will rather than a failure of politics and cooperation . 
In many statements , Palin seems intent on invoking God in her judgments about war , an ominous sign for the future if she is elected . 
She would certainly stoke many enemies who will look to their own brands of fundamentalism to strike back at the US . 
Extremists on both sides end up putting at risk the vast majority of humans who are neither extremists nor anti-science fundamentalists . 
It is difficult to know for sure what is giving rise to fundamentalism in so many parts of the world . 
What is happening in the US , for example , is not happening in Europe , but it is of course characteristic of some parts of the Middle East and Central Asia . 
Fundamentalism seems to emerge in times of far-reaching change , when traditional social arrangements come under threat . The surge of modern American fundamentalism in politics dates to the civil rights era of the 1960 &quot; s , and at least partly reflects a backlash among whites against the growing political and economic strength of non-white and immigrant minority groups in US society . 
Humanity &apos;s only hope is that the vicious circle of extremism can be replaced by a shared global understanding of the massive challenges of climate change , food supplies , sustainable energy , water scarcity , and poverty . 
Global scientific processes like the IPCC are critical , because they offer our best hope of forging a consensus based on the scientific evidence . 
The US must return to the global consensus based on shared science rather than anti-intellectualism . 
That is the urgent challenge at the heart of American society today .
