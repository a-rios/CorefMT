The Plight of the Roma 
NEW YORK - The Roma have been persecuted across Europe for centuries . 
Now they face a form of discrimination unseen in Europe since World War II : group evictions and expulsions from several European democracies of men , women , and children on the grounds that they pose a threat to public order . 
Last week , France began to carry out plans to expel all non-French Roma , implicating them as a group in criminal activity , without any legal process to determine whether individuals have committed any crime or pose a threat to public order . 
These French actions follow Italy &apos;s &quot; security package &quot; of 2008 , which described so-called &quot; nomads &quot; as a threat to national security and imposed emergency legislation leading to expulsions of non-Italian Roma . 
Stopping criminal activity is a legitimate government concern . 
Indeed , it is a firmly established legal principle that crime should be addressed by a determination of individual guilt before a court of law . 
Moreover , convicted criminals are not routinely deported if they are citizens of another EU member state . 
Of course , European societies should not tolerate criminality and anti-social behavior . 
Since WWII , Europeans have found it unacceptable to subject any group to collective punishment or mass expulsion on the basis of ethnicity , so , in casting aside fundamental rights in the name of security , rounding up Roma sets a worrying precedent . 
By contrast , the French government is right to call for measures to improve employment and development opportunities for Roma in their countries of origin ( primarily Bulgaria and Romania in this case ) , which would reduce the incentives and pressure for them to move to other countries . 
In response to France &apos;s position , the Swedish government also called for concerted EU action to foster Roma inclusion . 
Roma want to and can integrate if they are given the opportunity , as my foundation &apos;s programs have shown . 
Most Roma share the aspirations of the majority populations : a home with adequate services , a decent education for their children , jobs that enable them to provide for their families , and to interact with the majority in their society . 
It is because they face appalling discrimination and deprivation at home that they continue to migrate across Europe . 
The EU must recognize that the pan-European nature of this problem demands a comprehensive and effective strategy for Roma inclusion . 
Primary responsibility for safeguarding the rights and well-being of all citizens lies with EU member states . 
Policies and programs to promote inclusion in employment , education , health care , and housing must be implemented at the local and national levels . 
In 2009 , the EU endorsed the principle of &quot; explicit but not exclusive targeting &quot; for Roma , and the European Commission allowed structural funds to be used to cover housing interventions in favour of marginalized communities , with a particular focus on Roma . 
This is a welcome step and &quot; explicit but not exclusive targeting &quot; should be extended to education , health care , and employment . 
Most importantly , the rules guiding how structural funds are spent should be changed to allow their use for health and education from early childhood , rather than only for job training . 
Structural poverty in Roma communities is intimately linked to poor education and unemployment . 
The Commission &apos;s Europe 2020 initiative sets specific targets for raising school completion rates and employment levels for all EU citizens . 
In both of these areas , Roma fall so far behind their fellow citizens that targeted measures to close the gap should be an integral part of the Europe 2020 plan . 
The greatest divide between the Roma and majority populations is not one of culture or lifestyle - as is so often portrayed by the media - but poverty and inequality . 
The divide is physical , not just mental . 
Segregated schooling is a barrier to integration and produces prejudice and failure . 
Segregated housing has led to huge shantytowns and settlements lacking sanitation and other basic conditions essential to a life with dignity . 
The plight of so many millions of Roma in the twenty-first century makes a mockery of European values and stains Europe &apos;s conscience . 
The plight of the Roma is not just a short-term security problem that can be addressed by draconian measures to move people forcibly from one member state to another . 
Not only does this undermine European values and legal principles , but it fails to address the root causes of the problem . 
As Europe &apos;s largest ethnic minority , Roma inside the EU comprise the youngest and fastest-growing demographic segment of the population . 
By 2020 , for example , young Roma will make up one-third of the new entrants to the workforce in Hungary . 
Europe cannot afford another lost generation . 
This is a matter of human rights and basic values , and it is vital to peace and cohesion in societies across Europe .
