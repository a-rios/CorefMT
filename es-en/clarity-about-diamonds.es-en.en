Clarity about Diamonds 
PRINCETON - Diamonds have an image of purity and light . 
They are given as a pledge of love and worn as a symbol of commitment . 
Yet diamonds have led to gruesome murders , as well as widespread rapes and amputations . 
Charles Taylor , a former president of Liberia currently facing war crimes charges at a special court in The Hague , is alleged to have used diamonds to fund rebels in Sierra Leone &apos;s civil war . The case against Taylor represents only one of several examples in which diamonds have facilitated widespread human rights violations . 
When diamonds &quot; role in fueling violent conflict in Africa gained worldwide attention , the diamond industry established the Kimberley Process in order to keep &quot; blood diamonds &quot; out of international trade . 
The initiative has met with some success , although it has not completely halted trade in diamonds from conflict-torn countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo . 
Recently , however , concern has been expressed - from within the diamond trade - that the scope of the Kimberley Process is too limited , and that consumers have thus been lulled into believing that there are no longer any ethical problems with diamonds . 
That is far from the truth . 
The Marange diamond field , discovered in 2006 , is one of the richest ever found . 
According to Diamonds and Clubs , a recent report from Partnership Africa Canada , soldiers have press-ganged peasant farmers into working in mining syndicates at Marange . 
The soldiers then take half the proceeds . 
There have also been extensive beatings and arbitrary detentions . 
When Farai Maguwu , a Zimbabwean human rights activist , disseminated information about the abuses , he was arrested ( he has since been released ) . 
Zimbabwean authorities claim that the violent human rights abuses have stopped , but the ethical problem with Marange diamonds goes much deeper . 
Soon after the field was discovered , the Zimbabwean military took control of the area . 
According to the Zimbabwean finance minister , Tendai Biti , four years after the military took over the diamond fields , the national treasury has received not one penny of royalties from the sale of Marange diamonds . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s military and political elite has appropriated the diamond field &apos;s immense wealth for itself , with no benefits for the millions of desperately poor Zimbabweans who need the kind of services that the country has the resources to provide . 
This is not , of course , the first time that the discovery of resources in an undeveloped country has led to riches for a few rather than greater prosperity for all . 
Teodoro Obiang , the dictator of tiny , oil-rich Equatorial Guinea , has an official salary of $ 60,000 , but owns six private jets and a $ 35 million house in Malibu , as well as other houses in Maryland and Capetown and a fleet of Lamborghinis , Ferraris , and Bentleys . 
Most of the people over whom Obiang rules live in extreme poverty , with an average life expectancy of 49 years and an infant mortality rate of 87 per 1,000 live births ( in other words , more than one child in twelve dies before its first birthday ) . 
Nigeria and Angola are other glaring examples of countries that have failed to use their oil wealth for the benefit of their people . 
Paradoxically , resource-rich developing countries are often worse off than comparable countries that lack those resources . 
One reason for this is that large resource endowments provide a huge financial incentive for attempts to overthrow the government and seize power . 
Rebels know that if they succeed , they will gain immense personal wealth , be able to reward those who backed their coup , and have enough arms to keep themselves in power , no matter how badly they rule . 
Thus , the resources that should benefit developing countries instead become a curse that brings corruption , coups , and civil wars . 
If we use goods made from raw materials that are obtained from a poor country without the proceeds being used to benefit the people of that country , we become complicit in a particularly iniquitous form of grand larceny . 
It is therefore encouraging that concerns about Zimbabwean diamonds are being raised within the diamond trade itself . 
The Rapaport Group , an international network of companies providing services to the diamond industry , refuses to list Marange diamonds on its diamond-trading platform , RapNet . 
Martin Rapaport , chairman of the group , has called for free access to the diamond fields by non-governmental organizations and industry representatives to monitor the human rights situation . 
More significantly , in a speech in Mumbai earlier this year , he laid out requirements for legitimizing Marange diamonds that included some assurance that &quot; the revenues from the diamond sales are distributed legally and in a way that reasonably and fairly benefits the people of Zimbabwe . &quot; 
There is a need for higher standards than those set by the Kimberley Process . 
If consumers insist on buying only ethical diamonds , traders might be able to push the demand back to their sources .
