The Asian Crisis Ten Years After 
This July marks the tenth anniversary of East Asia &apos;s financial crisis . 
In July 1997 , the Thai Baht plummeted . 
Soon after , financial panic spread to Indonesia and Korea , then to Malaysia . 
In a little more than a year , the Asian financial crisis became a global financial crisis , with the crash of Russia &apos;s ruble and Brazil &apos;s real . 
In the midst of a crisis , no one knows how far an economy will drop or for how long . 
But capitalism , since its beginning , has been marked by crises ; each time , the economy recovers , but each crisis carries its own lessons . 
So ten years after Asia &apos;s crisis , it is natural to ask : what were the lessons , and has the world learned them ? 
Could such a crisis recur ? 
Is another crisis imminent ? 
Some similarities exist between the situation then and today : before the 1997 crisis , there had been rapid increases in capital flows from developed to developing countries - a six-fold increase in six years . 
Afterward , capital flows to developing countries stagnated . 
Before the crisis , some thought risk premia for developing countries were irrationally low . 
These observers proved right : the crisis was marked by soaring risk premia . 
Today , the global surfeit of liquidity has once again resulted in comparably low risk premia and a resurgence of capital flows , despite a broad consensus that the world faces enormous risks ( including the risks posed by a return of risk premia to more normal levels . ) 
In 1997 , the IMF and the United States Treasury blamed the crisis on a lack of transparency in financial markets . 
But when developing countries pointed their fingers at secret bank accounts and hedge funds , IMF and US enthusiasm for greater transparency diminished . 
Since then , hedge funds have grown in importance , and secret bank accounts have flourished . 
But there are some big differences between then and now . 
Most developing countries have accumulated massive foreign currency reserves . 
They learned the hard way what happens to countries otherwise , as the IMF and US Treasury marched in , took away economic sovereignty and demanded policies intended to enhance repayment to Western creditors , which plunged their economies into deep recessions and depressions . 
Reserves are costly , for the money could have been spent on development projects that would enhance growth . 
Nevertheless , the benefits in reducing the likelihood of another crisis and another loss of economic independence far outweigh the costs . 
This growth in reserves , while providing insurance to developing countries , created a new source of global volatility . 
Especially as the dollar lost its sacred place as a store of value under the Bush administration , rebalancing these multi-trillion dollar portfolios entails selling off dollar holdings , contributing to the dollar &apos;s weakening . 
Developing countries have also increasingly borrowed in their own currencies during the last few years , thus reducing their foreign exchange exposure . 
For those developing countries that remain heavily indebted abroad , an increase in risk premia would almost certainly bring economic turmoil , if not crisis . 
But the fact that so many countries hold large reserves means that the likelihood of the problem spreading into a global financial crisis is greatly reduced . 
In the midst of the 1997 crisis , a consensus developed that there was a need for a change in the global financial architecture : the world needed to do better in preventing crises and dealing with them when they occur . 
But the US Treasury and the IMF realized that the likely reforms , as desirable as they were for the world , were not in their interest . 
They did what they could to ensure that no meaningful reforms occurred during the crisis , with the knowledge that after the crisis , momentum for reform would dissipate . 
They were more right than they knew . 
Who , after all , could have anticipated that Bill Clinton would be followed by a US president committed to undermining the multilateral system in all its manifestations ? 
For example , when the IMF correctly suggested , after Argentina &apos;s crisis , that there needed to be a better way of restructuring debt ( an international bankruptcy procedure ) , the US vetoed the initiative . 
When the OECD proposed an agreement to restrict bank secrecy , the Bush administration vetoed that initiative , too . 
Indeed , the two most important lessons of the crisis have not been absorbed . 
The first is that capital market liberalization - opening up developing countries &quot; financial markets to surges in short-term &quot; hot &quot; money - is dangerous . 
It was not an accident that the only two major developing countries to be spared a crisis were India and China . 
Both had resisted capital market liberalization . 
Yet today , both are under pressure to liberalize . 
The second lesson is that in a highly integrated world , there is a need for a credible international financial institution to design the rules of the road in ways that enhance global stability and promote economic growth in developing countries . 
With the IMF so dominated by the US ( it is the only country with a veto ) and Europe ( which , by custom , appoints its head ) , the Fund was long seen as representing the interests of international creditors . 
Its failures in the 1997 crisis further undermined its credibility , and its failure to do anything about the massive global financial imbalances that represent the main threat to global financial stability today , have underscored its limitations . 
Reforms are still needed - including an overhaul of the global reserve system . 
We may not be facing a repeat of the global financial crisis of 1997 , but make no mistake , imperfections in the global financial system can still be costly , both in terms of global prosperity and stability .
