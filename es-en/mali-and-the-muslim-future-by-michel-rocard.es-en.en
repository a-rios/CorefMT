Mali and the Islamic Reformation 
PARIS - Mali is a landlocked West African country of 15 million people , covering 1,240,000 square kilometers ( 478,800 square miles ) , three-quarters of it desert . 
In the fourteenth century , the powerful Mali Empire included parts of modern-day Senegal , Guinea , and Niger . 
Defeated and divided , it became a French colony in the nineteenth century , regaining independence in 1960 . 
Mali &apos;s population is diverse : desert nomads , notably Tuaregs , in the north , and a majority of sedentary black populations in the south . 
Many languages are spoken , but Islam , to which almost 95 % of the population adheres , is a unifying factor . 
Agriculture is the main economic activity , notably in the vast internal delta of the Niger River , home to many tribes , including the Dogon , a people remarkable for their sculpture and architecture . 
Long a military dictatorship , Mali became an African democratic success story from 1991 to 2012 , before a coup crippled its rudimentary public institutions . 
In the north , Tuaregs traveling to Mauritania , Algeria and Niger , were particularly weakened by persistent drought and the collapse of the caravan economy . 
Many have turned to weapons , slave , or gold trafficking ; some are demanding independence . 
In the wake of the ferocious religious war that tore Algeria apart in the 1990 &quot; s , a great number of Muslim fundamentalist Arabs fled south to the vast Sahara that covers part of Mali . 
Then , in 2011 , Western-backed regime change in Libya toppled Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi and drove more fundamentalists to flee into the desert - but not before they had gotten their hands on a significant part of Qaddafi &apos;s heavy weaponry , as well as many vehicles . 
These fundamentalists , becoming bandits of sorts , came to terms with the nomadic traffickers . 
In January 2013 , these groups formed a convoy of several hundred pick-ups and ATVs , armed with heavy machineguns . 
The desert cities of Gao , Kidal , and Timbuktu quickly fell to them . 
Islamic monuments , including some of Timbuktu &apos;s glories , were destroyed . 
The convoys even threatened Bamako , the capital , composed mostly of black Africans . 
In a panic , acting President Dioncounda Traoré , a colonel from the south , called upon the French authorities to enforce a bilateral defense agreement , though he had contributed to the coup that drove the legally elected former president , Amadou Toumani Touré , into exile , causing the state to collapse and straining relations with France . 
France has no interest in Mali other than the protection of its citizens and the stability of the Sahel region . 
Indeed , France withdrew all of its permanently based military forces from Mali years ago . 
And , with fewer than a thousand French citizens still living in Mali , even its pragmatic interest is relatively slight . 
Although isolated , French President François Hollande courageously decided to respond firmly to Traoré &quot; s call for help . 
Few suggest that French military intervention was a means to recapture its colonial empire . 
And the United States - indifferent to the integrity of the Malian state and the welfare of its citizens in normal circumstances - was aware of the possibility that Mali &apos;s vast territory could fall under fundamentalist / terrorist control . 
For similar reasons , Great Britain , though allergic to any common European defense policy , offered two planes . 
As for Europe , it did nothing - which was foreseeable . 
France performed marvelously . 
In just a few days , it managed to send in nearly 3,000 men , heavily armed and efficiently motorized . 
Gao , Kidal , and Timbuktu were recaptured ; 
The fundamentalists , having lost most of their vehicles and arms to French aerial bombing , fled headlong into the desert . 
French troops are now set to return home . 
But , with thousands of fundamentalist killers in the desert , now poorly motorized but still armed , should they do so ? 
Mali , of course , is not the only country facing a fundamentalist insurrection . 
The learned , cultured , and radiant traditions of earlier centuries seem to have vanished . 
Having missed their economic takeoff , many Muslim-majority countries appear open to the call of Islamist fundamentalism . 
These countries now require painful , far-reaching reforms to attain economic prosperity , a goal that presupposes cultural change as well . 
In Christianity , the Reformation was essential to forging democracy and capitalism . 
But , in contemporary Islam , the powerful have always managed to eliminate would-be reformers . 
Oil benefits a handful of princes . 
Despite their travails , only a few thousand of the world &apos;s 1.5 billion Muslims have embraced the extremist project of killing infidels and moderates . 
But , amid the resulting political and religious confusion - and , because religious authorities remain silent in the face of Islamist rhetoric - no Muslim state can solve its problems domestically . 
Mali was the first to ask for it , with local religious authorities supporting the government &apos;s request for military assistance from France . 
Now Mali &apos;s army must be reconstituted , its police trained , and its government restructured . 
But , as in Mali , the task of assisting reform in Muslim states is not for France alone . 
It is the responsibility of the West as a whole .
