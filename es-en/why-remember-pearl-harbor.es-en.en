Why Remember Pearl Harbor ? 
NEW YORK - December 7 marks the 67th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . 
Over the years , &quot; the day of infamy &quot; has become a classic reference point for galvanizing patriotic sentiment in America . 
In the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attack , for example , analogies to Pearl Harbor were made frequently . 
Why did Japan initiate such a seemingly self-destructive war in the first place ? 
Aside from lessons that Japan must learn from its momentous decision , is there something to be learned by the United States as well ? 
The decision to attack Pearl Harbor was reached after five months of deliberations that included numerous official conferences . 
It was a gradual process in which more sympathetic , albeit firm , US engagement might have helped sway Japan in a different direction . 
In fact , Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end . 
Many in the Japanese Army initially regarded the Soviet Union as the main threat facing the country . 
Others saw the US as the primary enemy . 
Some were concerned with more abstract , ideological enemies , such as Communism and &quot; Americanism , &quot; while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the &quot; white race &quot; ( including Japan &apos;s allies , Germany and Italy ) against the &quot; yellow race . &quot; 
Then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all , particularly the US , whose long-term war-making power , the government knew , far surpassed Japan &apos;s own . 
The tactical mastermind of the Pearl Harbor operation , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , was one of them . 
Over the course of the summer of 1941 , events slowly tilted Japan towards the possibility of war with the West . 
Germany &apos;s attack on the Soviet Union compelled Japan in July 1941 to prepare a plan of attack . 
Although it made clear Japan &apos;s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia , the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan &apos;s true enemy . 
Japan &apos;s military thrust into Southeast Asia led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt &apos;s administration to impose sanctions . 
The US froze Japanese assets , an example followed by Britain and the Dutch East Indies . 
When Japan responded by taking over southern French Indochina , the US retaliated by imposing an embargo on oil exports to Japan . 
Rather than telling Japan that the US was determined to search for a diplomatic solution , America &apos;s categorical reaction confirmed it to the Japanese as an arrogant and conceited enemy . 
Moreover , by transferring its Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor , the US encouraged the Japanese understanding that the US fully anticipated war with Japan . 
World War II in the Pacific finally came about for many different reasons . 
Feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the US , including an overture to hold direct talks with Roosevelt , Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned on October 16 , making hard-line Army Minister Hideki Tōjō his successor . 
The high-handed tone of the Hull Note of November 26 , demanding Japan &apos;s withdrawal of all its troops from China , was a final blow to the moderates in Japan &apos;s government , who still hoped for diplomatic negotiations . 
By this time , many policymakers were convinced that the US was not ready to hear them out . 
It was ultimately in the name of saving Asia for all Asians from what was regarded as Western arrogance that the government united to wage war . 
On December 1 , it was decided that the war would commence in six days . 
There were legitimate historical reasons for Japan to feel humiliated on the eve of war . 
The gunboat diplomacy that resulted in the opening of Japan and unequal treaties in the mid-19th century was but a beginning . 
More immediately , the Great Depression and the subsequent compartmentalization of the world into economic blocs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful . 
Coupled with the economic hardship of the interwar years were instances of racial prejudice in the US that aimed at preventing Japanese immigration . 
United by this long-simmering and humiliating sense of exclusion , Japanese policymakers , whatever their differences , stumbled toward the December 1 decision to go to war . 
With almost 70 years of hindsight , Pearl Harbor should offer some lessons for US foreign policy today . 
Despite obvious differences between Pearl Harbor and recent Islamist terrorist tactics , they show the common desire of self-proclaimed Davids to topple their Goliaths in a clearly lop-sided battle . 
These Davids depend on Western technologies to overcome imbalances of power , and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humiliation . 
But no matter how strong and historically justified such grievances may be those who resort to murderous tactics must be condemned . 
However , high-handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response , for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated , and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice . 
Diplomacy no longer works with terrorism , but it can help to prevent it by dealing carefully with potentially hostile states . 
With global expectations mounting for a fresh start in US foreign policy , it is vital not just to remember , but to understand the attack on Pearl Harbor .
