What Good Is an Arab Military Alliance ? 
LONDON - The framework nuclear agreement that Iran and the P-5 ( China , Britain , France , Russia , and the United States ) plus Germany recently reached represents progress on one major security challenge in the Middle East . 
But , as some Arab countries move to establish a joint military force , another security question is emerging : Will such an alliance leave the region better or worse off , particularly given today &apos;s growing Sunni-Shia divide ? 
A nine-country Saudi-led coalition , which includes Egypt , the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , and Jordan , is already carrying out airstrikes against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen - an effort that Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei recently declared will end with the Saudis &quot; &quot; noses &#91; being &#93; rubbed to the soil . &quot; 
Yet Egypt &apos;s president , General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , has indicated that the coalition &apos;s mandate may be extended beyond Yemen . 
But what is that mandate ? 
A few objectives can be excluded from the start . 
For example , post-conflict democratization cannot be the goal , given that Arab regimes lack the credentials or knowhow to craft democracies , and their militaries are neither willing nor able to assist in the process . 
Similarly , humanitarian intervention can be ruled out , owing not only to most Arab regimes &quot; lack of experience and inglorious human-rights records , but also because none of the official statements related to the founding of the joint force have remotely suggested that upholding human rights was ever a concern . 
Stabilization might be an objective , but only if the relevant governments can agree on shared threats and how to address them . 
They could , for example , take the classic &quot; balance of power / terror &quot; approach , by intervening to undermine the more powerful actor in a conflict , force it to the negotiating table , and dictate the terms of any compromise , thereby ensuring that they benefit from the newly created status quo . 
But the rise of Arab military coalitions raises serious concerns , not least because the history of Arab-led military interventions - unlike those carried out by the West in places like Bosnia , Kosovo , and even Libya - does not contain any promising precedent . 
Such interventions were usually aimed at empowering a proxy political force over its military and political rivals , instead of averting humanitarian disaster or institutionalizing a non-violent conflict-resolution mechanism following a war . 
Egypt &apos;s military intervention in Yemen in the 1960s is a case in point . 
By late 1965 , Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser had sent 70,000 troops in Yemen to support a republican coup against royalist forces . 
Despite using prohibited chemical weapons against Yemeni guerillas from 1963 to 1967 - a first in an intra-Arab conflict - Egypt failed to achieve its objectives . 
On top of its military humiliation , Egypt &apos;s international reputation suffered , with the United Nations General Assembly condemning the Egyptian forces &quot; use of banned chemical weapons against villages that supported the monarchy . 
The adventure also took a heavy economic toll ; by 1965 , Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $ 3 billion , forcing it to add a &quot; defense tax &quot; to finance the Yemen war . 
The Syria-dominated &quot; Arab Deterrent Force &quot; did not fare much better when it intervened in Lebanon &apos;s civil war in the 1980s , failing either to end the brutal fighting or to secure vulnerable Palestinian refugees . 
After 1982 , when the Lebanese government failed to extend the ADF &apos;s mandate , it turned into a purely Syrian military force - one that ended up committing some of the worst atrocities against Palestinian factions and refugees in the so-called &quot; War of the Camps &quot; in 1985 . 
Brief and less complex interventions were also unsuccessful in ending violent crises - and in some cases even exacerbated them . 
A clear example is the recent Egyptian airstrikes in Libya , which have not only undermined the UN-led peace process in a deeply divided country , but have also empowered the most extreme elements . 
Of course , history is not a definitive guide to the future ; an Arab-led intervention today could turn out very differently . 
But there is little to indicate that it will ; indeed , despite hundreds of Saudi airstrikes on Houthi-controlled military bases and seaports , the rebels continue to advance . 
If emerging Arab military coalitions are to avoid the mistakes of past interventions , their members must reconsider their approach , including the structural deficiencies that contributed to past failures . 
Many factors affect the outcome of a military intervention in a civil war , especially if it involves a ground offensive . 
In particular , Arab leaders should focus on revising the processes by which national-security policy is formulated , improving civil-military relations , providing the relevant training in peacekeeping and peace-building , reforming the political culture , and addressing socio-psychological complexes . 
If Arab leaders fail to overcome these deficiencies , the latest Arab force could become the Middle East &apos;s newest source of anti-democratic , sectarian-based instability , potentially intensifying the Sunni-Shia conflict . 
That is the last thing the region needs .
