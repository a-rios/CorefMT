Global Capital Rules 
CAMBRIDGE - It &apos;s official . 
The International Monetary Fund has put its stamp of approval on capital controls , thereby legitimizing the use of taxes and other restrictions on cross-border financial flows . 
Not long ago , the IMF pushed hard for countries - rich or poor - to open up to foreign finance . 
Now it has acknowledged the reality that financial globalization can be disruptive - inducing financial crises and economically adverse currency movements . 
So here we are with yet another twist in the never-ending saga of our love / hate relationship with capital controls . 
Under the classical Gold Standard that prevailed until 1914 , free capital mobility had been sacrosanct . 
But the turbulence of the interwar period convinced many - most famously John Maynard Keynes - that an open capital account is incompatible with macroeconomic stability . 
The new consensus was reflected in the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944 , which enshrined capital controls in the IMF &apos;s Articles of Agreement . 
As Keynes said at the time , &quot; what used to be heresy is now endorsed as orthodoxy . &quot; 
By the late 1980 &quot; s , however , policymakers had become re-enamored with capital mobility . 
The European Union made capital controls illegal in 1992 , and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development enforced free finance on its new members , paving the way for financial crises in Mexico and South Korea in 1994 and 1997 , respectively . 
The IMF adopted the agenda wholeheartedly , and its leadership sought ( unsuccessfully ) to amend the Articles of Agreement to give the Fund formal powers over capital-account policies in its member states . 
As long as it was developing countries that were whipsawed by global finance , it was fashionable to blame the victim . 
The IMF and Western economists argued that governments in Mexico , South Korea , Brazil , Turkey , and elsewhere had not adopted the policies - prudential regulations , fiscal restraint , and monetary controls - needed to take advantage of capital flows and prevent crises . 
The problem was with domestic policies , not with financial globalization , so the solution lay not in controls on cross-border financial flows , but in domestic reforms . 
Once the advanced countries became victims of financial globalization , in 2008 , it became harder to sustain this line of argument . 
It became clearer that the problem lay with instability in the global financial system itself - the bouts of euphoria and bubbles , followed by the sudden stops and sharp reversals that are endemic to unsupervised and unregulated financial markets . 
The IMF &apos;s recognition that it is appropriate for countries to try to insulate themselves from these patterns is therefore welcome - and comes none too soon . 
But we should not exaggerate the extent of the IMF &apos;s change of heart . 
The Fund still regards free capital mobility as an ideal toward which all countries will eventually converge . 
This requires only that countries achieve the threshold conditions of adequate &quot; financial and institutional development . &quot; 
The IMF treats capital controls as a last resort , to be deployed under a rather narrow set of circumstances - when other macro , financial , or prudential measures fail to stem the tide of inflows , the exchange rate is decidedly overvalued , the economy is overheating , and foreign reserves are already adequate . 
So , while the Fund lays out an &quot; integrated approach to capital flow liberalization , &quot; and specifies a detailed sequence of reforms , there is nothing remotely comparable on capital controls and how to render them more effective . 
This reflects over-optimism on two fronts : first , about how well policy can be fine-tuned to target directly the underlying failures that make global finance unsafe ; and , second , about the extent to which convergence in domestic financial regulations will attenuate the need for cross-border management of flows . 
The first point can be best seen using an analogy with gun controls . 
Guns , like capital flows , have their legitimate uses , but they can also produce catastrophic consequences when used accidentally or placed in the wrong hands . 
The IMF &apos;s reluctant endorsement of capital controls resembles the attitude of gun-control opponents : policymakers should target the harmful behavior rather than bluntly restrict individual freedoms . 
As America &apos;s gun lobby puts it , &quot; Guns don &apos;t kill people ; people kill people . &quot; 
The implication is that we should punish offenders rather than restrict gun circulation . 
Similarly , policymakers should ensure that financial-market participants fully internalize the risks that they assume , rather than tax or restrict certain types of transactions . 
But , as Princeton economist Avinash Dixit likes to say , the world is always second-best at best . 
An approach that presumes that we can identify and directly regulate problematic behavior is unrealistic . 
Most societies control guns directly because we cannot monitor and discipline behavior perfectly , and the social costs of failure are high . 
Similarly , caution dictates direct regulation of cross-border flows . 
In both cases , regulating or prohibiting certain transactions is a second-best strategy in a world where the ideal may be unattainable . 
The second complication is that , rather than converging , domestic models of financial regulation are multiplying , even among advanced countries with well-developed institutions . 
Along the efficiency frontier of financial regulation , one needs to consider the tradeoff between financial innovation and financial stability . 
The more of one we want , the less of the other we can have . 
Some countries will opt for greater stability , imposing tough capital and liquidity requirements on their banks , while others may favor greater innovation and adopt a lighter regulatory touch . 
Free capital mobility poses a severe difficulty here . 
Borrowers and lenders can resort to cross-border financial flows to evade domestic controls and erode the integrity of regulatory standards at home . 
To prevent such regulatory arbitrage , domestic regulators may be forced to take measures against financial transactions originating from jurisdictions with more lax regulations . 
A world in which different sovereigns regulate finance in diverse ways requires traffic rules to manage the intersection of separate national policies . 
The assumption that all countries will converge on the ideal of free capital mobility diverts us from the hard work of formulating those rules .
