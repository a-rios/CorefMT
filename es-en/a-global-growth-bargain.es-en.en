A Global Growth Bargain 
LONDON - US President Barack Obama caught the imagination of the world when he talked recently of a new &quot; Sputnik moment . &quot; 
He outlined a bold plan for improving education , infrastructure , and technology , and vividly compared the resolve required to put a man on the moon to the determination needed to restore growth to the US economy . 
Obama is right to say that the West faces not only great challenges , but also great opportunities . In the last decade , the global economy was transformed by one billion Asian workers entering the ranks of industrial producers . In 2011 , for the first time in two centuries , Europe and America face being out-produced , out-exported , and out-invested by China and the rest of the world . 
Yet Asia &apos;s growth also gives the West unprecedented economic hope . 
In this decade , the world will be transformed yet again by the rise of the Asian consumer . By 2020 , Asia &apos;s domestic markets will be twice the size of America &apos;s . 
The world &apos;s middle class will have swelled from one billion consumers to three billion . 
The opportunities for growth in Europe and the US from this additional global demand are enormous . 
The countries and companies that will flourish in Asia &apos;s new markets will be those that can provide the technology-driven , custom-built , high value-added goods and services needed to serve Asia &apos;s two billion consumers . 
But neither Europe nor the US is in a strong enough position to take best advantage of these new markets . 
The West must again begin to out-invent , out-innovate , and out-skill the rest of the world if it is to seize the opportunities that Asia presents . Indeed , unless the West significantly expands its capital investment in engineering , science , and new technologies , it will be marginalized by countries whose governments back their innovators with hard cash . 
Obama &apos;s investment plan could be the foundation stone for a formal global agreement that delivers higher levels of growth to all corners of the world and creates millions of new jobs . 
Under such an agreement , Europe would join the US in raising levels of investment - complementing America &apos;s &quot; moonshot &quot; initiative with a program of structural reform aimed at building a digital , green , energy-efficient , and competitive economy - while China would play its part by increasing its consumption . 
I believe that such an agreement could boost the world economy by around 3 % by 2014 - and lift 100 million people out of poverty . 
I presented this plan when I chaired the G-20 in London in 2009 . 
I wanted East and West to commit to a formal strategy to deliver more enduring results than those promised by the rescue packages that we were putting together at the time . 
Our attention was focused on preventing recession from turning into depression . 
I argued that this was also the moment to pioneer a more lasting framework of growth . 
In the end , no agreement was possible on a shared growth objective , and there has not yet been enough political will for the coordinated action to achieve it . 
Since then , Europe and America have grown well below their capacity ( despite huge unmet demand throughout the world ) and unemployment has climbed to around 10 % on both continents ( with youth unemployment reaching an alarming 20 % ) . 
The global growth agreement that evaded us in 2009 remains the unfinished work of the G-20 . 
Front-loaded public investment could be funded through an enhanced European Investment Bank . 
China has already laid the foundation for playing its part : its policy of xiaokang ( reducing poverty and expanding the middle class ) should create a market for billions of dollars of Western goods and services . 
The West should propose that if China &apos;s consumption increases by 2-4 percentage points of its GDP over the next three years ( entirely possible as it improves its social safety net , cuts taxes , and puts homeownership within reach of ordinary citizens ) , America and Europe will expand their public investment by similar amounts . 
If other Asian countries do likewise , and agree to create a level playing field for exporters , we could create around 50 million additional jobs . 
Of course , in the West , an investment plan invites criticism from those who prefer that we do nothing but talk about growth strategies . 
Indeed , critics argue that raising public investment conflicts with the drive to reduce deficits , and warn of higher interest rates on the back of further spending . 
But critics are wrong about the impact on the deficit of focused investment . 
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund produced unequivocal evidence that we can actually maintain deficit-reduction plans while benefiting from the additional capital investment that the US and European economies need . 
My extrapolation of the IMF model shows that Western countries can boost their long-term GDP growth significantly by increasing their levels of capital investment over a three-year period . 
An annual stimulus equivalent to just 0.3 % of GDP yields a return in the US of 0.8 % in economic growth at its peak in 2013 , and 0.4 % in Europe . 
This approach , which secures growth and cuts unemployment without raising the deficit , is needed to energize the private sector and mobilize some of the capital that has accumulated on corporate balance sheets in recent years . 
It also underscores the importance of the G-20 and the IMF in seeking global consensus now . 
The West is well placed to play its part in global renewal . 
Its extraordinary workforces produce world-class goods and services . 
That would be a human tragedy , not just an economic disaster .
