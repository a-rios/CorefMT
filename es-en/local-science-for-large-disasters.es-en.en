Local Science for Large Disasters 
The earth produces a reliable stream of disasters . 
Some , like AIDS , are chronic ; others , like earthquakes or hurricane Katrina , are sudden displays of natural force . 
In each case , it is expected that a well-financed relief effort will descend from a wealthier region . 
But importing assistance may not only be less effective ; it might actually cause more damage in the long run . 
When a tsunami hits , the first impulse is to bring in First-World experts . 
Rescue is the initial priority , followed by ensuring food , shelter , and medical aid . 
It is just a matter of getting things done , and it must be done the most effective way , so the operations occur according to the institutional philosophies of donor countries . 
But siphoning the habits of one culture into another during a rebuilding process can trigger societal changes that are almost as damaging as the disaster itself , as happened in a small fishing villages in the Philippines in the late 1970 &quot; s . 
In 1978 , Typhoon Rita wiped out the fleet of handmade wooden fishing boats in a group of sea-dependant Philippine communities . 
Relief was fast and effective , consisting first of subsistence aid , followed by &quot; restoration &quot; of the fishing fleet . 
The old boats , which rotted every few years , were replaced by modern fiberglass versions with small gasoline engines . 
At the time , this was touted as a textbook case of doing things right . 
The fishing economy rebounded and flourished - but only for about ten years . 
After that , the entire society collapsed . 
Over thousands of years , the culture had come to depend on the central role of boat builders . 
They were the anchor of society , acting in effect as priests , teachers , and judges . 
Subsistence flowed according to their goodwill and was supported by conventions of sharing and trust . 
After the relief effort , this complex human balance was replaced by a cash economy , and the power brokers became those who could dole out the rare , precious petrol . 
An entire culture was effectively destroyed by efficient relief . 
This scenario has been repeated over and over in diverse contexts . 
The first impulse is to solve problems in the most established manner . 
But , lacking sensitivity to local dynamics , the outcome is severely compromised . 
The solution seems simple : create and subsidize small science centers in regions at risk of disaster . 
The primary objective of these centers would be &quot; normal &quot; science , with missions and profiles that feed from their local context . 
At-risk regions would develop culturally appropriate ways to deal with the catastrophes most likely to affect them . 
In addition , local talent would be nurtured in its home context . 
This philosophy would benefit places like New Orleans as much as Phuket in Thailand . 
Indeed , while it might seem as though there would be no problem of cultural transposition in the case of Hurricane Katrina , an examination of the tragedy reveals otherwise . 
It has been overwhelmingly observed that the worst-hit people in New Orleans were poor African-Americans living in the city &apos;s low-lying districts . 
To be sure , many of these inner-city residents simply lacked the resources to evacuate easily . 
But it is beginning to emerge that many also preferred to stay in a social environment that they trusted rather than fleeing to safer , but foreign , surroundings . 
Critics also cite the diversion of infrastructure funds and Louisiana National Guard troops to Iraq as contributing causes to the emergency . 
These factors clearly played a role , but , overall , if a body of scientifically inclined people from the inner city had been involved in flood control and evacuation planning , the consequences of hurricane Katrina would certainly have been managed more effectively . 
By contrast , the inappropriateness of transplanting troops from Iraq into an emergency rescue operation is obvious . 
The fight against AIDS - a battle that depends heavily on social modification - highlights in perhaps the clearest way the problems that always occur when local culture is ignored . 
Societal mechanisms simply cannot be adjusted without a crisp , practiced understanding of a culture . 
And this cannot be merely intuitive . 
It must be scientific , that is , based on the best methods and models . 
For this reason , there should be two points of contact during a catastrophe . 
Groups of critical thinkers - the &quot; experts &quot; - should be on hand to advise on how to avoid second-order disasters . 
Even though many of them might not have studied the local culture , they can nonetheless provide guidance that has been informed by the world &apos;s most expensive infrastructure . 
At the same time , relief efforts should be managed by a local science center that is known and trusted by those in danger . 
The implications of this approach extend far beyond disaster relief . 
A robust scientific establishment is the root of any economy , and there will be no real development in the Third World without it . 
An investment in local science is therefore a direct infusion into a community &apos;s growth potential , one that eventually will reward investors with new breakthroughs . 
After all , nothing is better for innovation than a scientist working outside conventional institutions , solving a problem that will save his or her family .
