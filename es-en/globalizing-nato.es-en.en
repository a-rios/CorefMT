Globalizing NATO 
PRINCETON - Next week , NATO &apos;s 28 members will meet in Chicago for their annual summit . 
Sixty-two years after the North Atlantic Treaty was signed , binding the United States , Canada , and ten European states to consider an attack on one an attack on all , NATO is transforming itself into a twenty-first-century global security organization . 
The result will be a safer world . 
In 1949 , the world was rapidly dividing into two principle political-military blocs , East and West , alongside a large &quot; non-aligned movement . &quot; 
NATO faced off against the Warsaw Pact , created by the Soviet Union and its allies in 1955 . 
Within both blocs , smaller powers clustered around the superpower . 
No flexibility existed within either bloc for smaller groups of members to deploy alliance assets . 
Today , NATO is becoming , in the words of its secretary-general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , &quot; a hub of a network of security partnerships and a center for consultation on global security issues . &quot; 
It is a &quot; globally connected institution , &quot; with more than 40 individual country partners and growing ties to other international organizations . 
Indeed , the country partners include all of Europe &apos;s non-NATO countries , such as Austria , Switzerland , Finland , and Sweden , and aspiring and possible NATO members such as Bosnia , Serbia , Macedonia , Ukraine , Belarus , and even Russia . 
Virtually all of the Central Asian countries - from Turkmenistan to Kazakhstan , as well as Armenia , Azerbaijan , Afghanistan , and Pakistan - are partners , as is the entire Maghreb , from Morocco to Egypt , as well as Israel , Jordan , Iraq , Bahrain , Qatar , Kuwait , and the United Arab Emirates . 
Finally , Pacific partners include Japan , South Korea , Australia , New Zealand , and Mongolia . 
On the organizational side , NATO describes itself as having developed &quot; close working relations &quot; with the United Nations , the European Union , and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . 
It also collaborates regularly with the African Union , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Organization for Migration , the World Bank , the International Civil Aviation Organization , and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons . 
If one draws links radiating outward from NATO to all of these different countries and organizations , the result is a security network that has multiple hubs and clusters - much like a map of the Internet or of planets and galaxies . 
This world is no longer unipolar , bipolar , or even multipolar , because the actors that matter are not single states but groups of states that are more or less densely connected . 
It is a multi-hub security network , in which the hubs are regional organizations of different sizes and strengths . 
This structural shift has enormous practical significance . 
For starters , it means that not only NATO &apos;s military resources , but also its human capital and practical knowledge in combating many different kinds of threats are available globally . 
NATO has created a Comprehensive Crisis and Operations Management Center that brings together civilian and military expertise on crisis identification , planning , operations , reconstruction , and stabilization capabilities in ways that are explicitly designed to connect NATO headquarters in Europe to &quot; the networked world . &quot; 
Second , NATO &apos;s own identity is becoming that of an alliance that exists to empower - to offer assistance and partnership - as much as to overpower . 
NATO is no longer just a hammer ; it is an entire toolbox of security options . 
These options include developing counter-networks to meet networked security threats such as terrorism and proliferation of nuclear , chemical , or biological materials , as well as highly decentralized threats such as piracy . 
As a result , when a crisis like the war in East Timor in 1999 or last year &apos;s political stalemate in Côte d &apos;Ivoire arises , NATO can backstop whichever country or group of countries chooses to take the lead in carrying out a UN mandate . 
NATO members themselves also have much more flexibility to draw on NATO &apos;s collective assets . 
Even skeptics of NATO expansion and operations like the intervention in Libya now recognize that joint operations by member countries , operating under a UN mandate and in conjunction with regional partners , is likely to be a model for the future . 
As General Brent Scowcroft , National Security Adviser for President George H.W. Bush , observed recently , the UN Charter originally envisioned a standing military force to enforce Security Council resolutions - a vision that the NATO partner model might ultimately realize . 
Power in a network flows from connectedness , or what network theorists call &quot; centrality . &quot; 
The most powerful member of a network is the node that has the most connections to others , which means that a node can increase its power not only by adding connections directly , but also by increasing the connectedness of nearby nodes . 
In other words , the US can increase its own power both by connecting to other NATO members ( and then ensuring that NATO is connected to as many other countries and organizations as possible ) and by increasing the connectedness of those other countries and organizations . 
If NATO connects with the African Union , for example , and increases the AU &apos;s connectedness , then both NATO and the AU become more central to the network and hence more powerful in terms of their ability to exercise influence and marshal resources . 
The logic of centrality as a source of power creates a virtuous circle , in which members of a network gain advantage by bringing more members into the network and connecting more densely to them . 
That is exactly the logic behind NATO &apos;s transformation . 
The immediate topic on the agenda in Chicago next week will be getting NATO forces out of Afghanistan .
