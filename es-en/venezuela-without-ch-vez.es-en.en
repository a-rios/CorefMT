Venezuela without Chávez ? 
SANTA MARTA , COLOMBIA - Like all cancer patients , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez faces three scenarios : a quick cure , prolonged treatment , or an early death . 
Whichever way it goes - even if Chávez really is recovering as quickly as he would have us believe - talk in Venezuela about the post-Chávez era has already begun . 
Chávez manages information about his illness and treatment as part of a political strategy . 
After his surgery , invoking God , Fidel Castro , the spirits of the savannah , and medical science , he responded to rumors about his illness and made his return from treatment in Havana a double celebration of Venezuela &apos;s bicentennial and of his triumph over cancer . 
Chávez is a master at manipulating the media : after the failed coup against him in 2002 , he brandished a crucifix to pardon his adversaries and be pardoned by them . 
After his first chemotherapy session , Chávez exclaimed : &quot; I am radically changing my life . &quot; 
Thus far , changes are noticeable in his appearance and slogans , and a certain self-criticism has crept into his public persona . 
On his 57th birthday , he wore yellow instead of red , and substituted &quot; Socialist homeland or death &quot; with &quot; We will live and we will win . &quot; 
He told his movement : &quot; Those people who dress in red down to their underwear are suspect , and the same goes for the word &quot; socialism . &quot; 
We have to reflect and introduce changes into our discourse and our actions . &quot; 
And he admitted to Venezuelan television that a &quot; lack of efficiency in everyday routine ... has endangered the government &apos;s policies many times . &quot; 
But neither his tweets , his image as a sportsman , his government &apos;s televised ministerial meetings , nor the articles in which he lashes out at the opposition have been able to stem a growing perception that his illness has launched an uncertain transition . 
Some of his supporters speak of postponing the forthcoming elections . 
Others say that the vote in 2012 could be seen as Chávez &apos;s last re-election , which would allow him to ensure the transition . 
Chancellor Nicolás Maduro and Minister of Energy Rafael Ramírez have been mentioned as possible successors , but their scant leadership abilities don &apos;t point to an electoral triumph next year . 
In the meantime , Chávez is striving to minimize the uncertainty . 
From Cuba and in Caracas , he makes a show of governing , and he puts the transition in context : &quot; The only transition here , one that we must accelerate and consolidate , is the transition to the socialist model . &quot; 
At the same time , he trivializes the leadership question , &quot; I said that I would leave in 2021 . 
Maybe I &apos;ll go in 2031 when I &apos;m 77 . &quot; 
To his older brother Adán , he said sarcastically : &quot; I see you &apos;re preparing for the succession . &quot; 
But faithful Adán , the governor of Barinas and a former education minister and ambassador to Cuba , is popular with neither Chávez supporters nor the opposition , owing to his inefficiency and corruption . 
In the wake of his illness , Chávez is trying to strengthen his movement . 
He called on the military to &quot; prevent enemy intrigue &quot; from disrupting its unity . 
He has tried to win back the support of those who have abandoned his United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) or have stopped voting for it , and to win over those who are neither with him nor against him . 
Today , Chávez is the only one capable of controlling the government , the armed forces , the militias , the PSUV , and even the opposition . 
He has become the stable axis of the unstable Venezuela that he has helped to create . 
He can radicalize the &quot; revolution , &quot; as he has done in earlier crises , or he can lay down the rules and conditions for the succession in order to prevent the prediction , attributed to the long-time Chávista Diosdado Cabello , from coming true : &quot; Without Chávez , there will be absolutely nothing left . &quot; 
A prompt cure and subsequent humanization of Chávez are seen - both within and outside of Venezuela - as the best scenario . 
If his treatment is prolonged , he might try governing with rotating vice-presidents , and , if a prompt cure or prolonged treatment are not possible and elections are postponed , an uncertain transition would be hastened . 
Nothing will be easy , given growing problems of security , governability , institutional stability , and economic performance , with the prospect of renewed global recession threatening oil revenues . 
Confronted with the possibility of an unscheduled transition , the Venezuelan armed forces &quot; role will be difficult , owing to its politicization under Chávez , as well as its internal divisions and corruption . 
The military can choose to uphold the elected government , regardless of which party wins , or prevent the eventual triumph of the opposition Mesa de Unidad . 
Top-ranking officers of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces have backed the latter scenario in order to show their unconditional respect for Chávez , their Commander-in-Chief . 
The presence of so many armed civilians in Chávez &apos;s beloved militias will raise the stakes even higher . 
A report from the National Assembly Defense Commission indicates that 50 % of the population possesses arms legally or illegally . 
This context , combined with increasing social polarization , could give rise to chaos and violence . 
Adán Chávez called on the PSUV not to forget &quot; the armed fight for power . &quot; 
In the middle of a religious healing rite , however , Hugo Chávez was more pacific - and forgot about the PSUV altogether : &quot; Let us place ourselves in God &apos;s hands in order to avoid violence in Venezuela . &quot;
