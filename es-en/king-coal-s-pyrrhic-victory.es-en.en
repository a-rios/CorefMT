King Coal &apos;s Pyrrhic Victory 
BRUSSELS - Sometimes the most important news is what is not happening . 
This summer has given us one such example : the climate-change bill , for which President Barack Obama had pushed so hard , will not even be presented to the United States Senate , because it stands no chance of passage . 
This means that the US is about to repeat its &quot; Kyoto experience . &quot; 
Twenty years ago , in 1990 , the US participated ( at least initially ) in the first global talks aimed at achieving a global accord to reduce CO2 emissions . 
At the time , the European Union and the US were by far the greatest emitters , so it seemed appropriate to exempt the world &apos;s emerging economies from any commitment . 
Over time , it became apparent that the US would not live up to its commitment , owing , as now , to opposition in the Senate . 
The EU then went ahead on its own , introducing its path-breaking European Emission Trading System in the hope that Europe could lead by example . 
Without the American climate-change package , the promises made by the US administration only seven months ago at the Copenhagen summit have become worthless . 
The European strategy is in tatters - and not only on the transatlantic front . 
China &apos;s commitment to increase the CO2 efficiency of its economy by about 3 % per year is of no help , because annual GDP growth rates of close to 10 % mean that the country &apos;s emissions will soar during this decade . 
Indeed , by 2020 , Chinese emissions could be more than triple those of Europe and even surpass those of the US and Europe combined . 
Exempting emerging markets from any commitments , as the Kyoto Protocol sought to do , no longer makes sense . 
Why has every attempt to set prices for global carbon emissions failed ? 
The answer can be found in one word : &quot; coal &quot; - or , rather , the fact that coal is cheap and abundant . 
Burning hydrocarbons ( natural gas and petrol ) yields both water and CO2 . 
By contrast , burning coal yields only C02 . 
Moreover , compared to natural gas and crude oil , coal is much cheaper per ton of CO2 released . 
Owners of coal mines and their clients are thus strongly opposed to any tax on carbon . 
They constitute a small but well organized group that wields immense lobbying power to block efforts to limit CO2 emissions by putting a price on them , as the planned US cap-and-trade system would have done . 
In Europe , indigenous coal production no longer plays an important economic role . 
It is thus not surprising that Europe could enact a cap-and-trade system that imposes a carbon price on a large part of its industry . 
Indeed , the tax seems to fall mostly on foreign suppliers of coal ( and to a lesser extend on foreign suppliers of hydrocarbons in the Middle East and Russia ) . 
By contrast , opposition by US states whose economies rely significantly on coal production proved decisive for the fate of Obama &apos;s climate-change bill . 
The US experience has wider implications . 
If it proved impossible to introduce a moderate carbon tax in a rich economy , it is certain that no commitment will be forthcoming for the next generation from China , which remains much poorer and depends even more on indigenous coal than the US . 
Without any significant commitment from the US , the Copenhagen Accord , so laboriously achieved last year , has become meaningless . 
Business will now continue as usual , both in terms of climate-change diplomacy , with its wandering circus of big international meetings , and in terms of rapidly increasing emissions . 
The meetings are aimed at creating the impression that the world &apos;s leaders are still working on a solution to the problem . 
This will make it exceedingly difficult to reverse the trend in the future . 
A planet composed of nation-states that in turn are dominated by special interest groups does not seem capable of solving this problem . 
Unfortunately , there is enough cheap coal around to power ever-higher emissions for at least another century . 
The world will thus certainly become much warmer . 
The only uncertainty is how much warmer that will be . 
Determined action at the global level will become possible only when climate change is no longer some scientific prediction , but a reality that people feel . 
A world incapable of preventing climate change will have to live with it .
