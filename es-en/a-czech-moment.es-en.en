A Czech Moment 
PRAGUE - As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union , I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain &apos;s infamous description of Czechoslovakia as &quot; a faraway country of which we know little . &quot; 
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld &apos;s misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between &quot; new and old &quot; Europe contributed to the re-emergence of that disdainful attitude . 
The reality is that there is no such thing as &quot; old and new &quot; Europe , and there never was . 
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old . 
We Czechs are 100 % European , and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe . 
Indeed , our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union , like our freedom , is so comparatively new . 
So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union . 
On the contrary , events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity - true union - will be needed . 
The primary , and most pressing , of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU . 
Unfortunately , conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve . 
The type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread , because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe &apos;s young people , who are seeking jobs at a time when hard-pressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few . 
It will fall to the Union , once again , to help transform despair into hope . 
We Czechs know something about this , as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990 &quot; s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness . 
To contain today &apos;s financial and economic crisis , Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point . 
The very existence of our Union , and particularly of the euro , has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the 1930 &quot; s - the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn . 
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check . 
For now , EU governments &quot; coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals . 
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate . 
Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times , its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro . 
These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth , and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen . 
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia . 
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PCA ) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated . 
Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year , but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold . 
Now those talks have resumed , but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically . 
Russia &apos;s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members . 
The collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia &apos;s budget , and lack of investment in the country &apos;s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted . 
Until now , Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU , because two-thirds of Russia &apos;s exports to the Union comprise natural resources , which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides . 
Given the stark changes in economic conditions , however , it is now in Russia &apos;s national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business , for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal . 
Moreover , without a new PCA , individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia . 
Indeed , many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia &apos;s closest friend in the Union . 
But the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members , and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole . Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia . 
Europe &apos;s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rules-based multilateralism , important as that undoubtedly is , but its unity . 
When the Georgia crisis erupted , Europe united around a single position on Russia &apos;s withdrawal . 
It is the Czech Republic &apos;s task , and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own , to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward . 
During the 1990 &quot; s , the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect . It would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms . 
We , like all EU presidencies , will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate .
