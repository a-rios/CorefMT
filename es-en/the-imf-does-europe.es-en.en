The IMF Does Europe 
CAMBRIDGE - With the International Monetary Fund playing a central role in the eurozone &apos;s blueprint for a bailout of Greece , the multilateral lender has come full circle . In its early days after World War II , the IMF &apos;s central task was to help Europe emerge from the ravages of the war . 
Once upon a time , the Fund had scores of programs across the Continent ( as Rong Qian , Carmen Reinhart , and I illustrate in new research on &quot; graduation &quot; from sovereign debt crises . ) 
But , until the financial crisis , most Europeans assumed they were now far too wealthy to ever face the humiliation of asking the IMF for financial assistance . 
Welcome to the new era . 
Europe has become ground zero for the biggest expansion of IMF lending and influence in years . 
Several large Eastern European countries , including Hungary , Romania , and Ukraine , already have substantial IMF loan programs . 
Now , the eurozone countries have agreed that the Fund can come into Greece and , presumably , Portugal , Spain , Italy , and Ireland , if needed . 
The IMF &apos;s resurgence over the past year is breathtaking . 
Castrated by populist rhetoric during the Asian debt crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s , the Fund had been struggling to re-anchor its policies and rebuild its image . 
When France &apos;s Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over the helm in the fall of 2007 , even poor African countries were shunning the IMF like a leper , preferring to make deals with non-traditional lenders such as China . 
Absent new business and new revenues , the Fund was facing dire cutbacks to ensure its own survival . 
What a difference a crisis makes . 
Now the IMF has ascended Mount Olympus . 
In April 2009 , G20 leaders approved a quadrupling of the Fund &apos;s lending capacity . 
The increase was perhaps exaggerated in the heat of the moment , but a good chunk of the money actually appears to have materialized . 
And for Europe , the help has come none too soon . 
Does the IMF &apos;s arrival in Europe signal the beginning of the end of the region &apos;s staggering debt woes ? 
Hardly . 
The Fund does not bestow gifts ; it only offers bridge loans to give bankrupt countries time to solve their budget problems . 
Although countries occasionally can grow their way out of debt problems , as China did with its 1990 &quot; s banking crisis , bankrupt countries usually face painful budget arithmetic . 
Short of default and inflation , most countries are forced to accept big tax hikes and spending cuts , often triggering or deepening a recession . 
To be fair , the Fund &apos;s reputation for imposing austerity is mostly an illusion . 
Countries usually call in the IMF only when they have been jilted by international capital markets , and are faced with desperate tightening measures no matter where they turn . 
Countries turn to the Fund for help because it is typically a far softer touch than private markets . 
But gentleness is relative . 
It will be very tough - not only for Greece , but for all the other overextended countries of Europe - to tighten fiscal policy in the midst of recession without risking a deepening spiral . 
Simply put , no one wants to be the next major IMF supplicant . 
Nor does the IMF &apos;s arrival mean that bond holders are off the hook . 
As Qian , Reinhart , and I document , there have been numerous instances in which countries enter IMF programs but end up defaulting anyway . 
The most famous case is Argentina in 2002 , but other recent examples include Indonesia , Uruguay , and the Dominican Republic . 
The endgame could be the same for many European countries . 
Ukraine is already struggling . 
But , for the most part , the sovereign default process is slow-motion Kabuki theater . 
Why should a country choose to default as long as there are rich benefactors willing to lend money to preserve an illusion of normalcy ? 
Bond markets are easily lulled . 
The stakes for the IMF in Europe are huge . 
It is not going to be an easy balancing act . If the Fund attaches tough &quot; German-style &quot; conditions to its loans , it risks provoking immediate confrontation and default . 
This is the last thing that it wants to do . 
So far , it has been pretty soft in Eastern Europe , endorsing programs that depend on optimistic projections of both future budget cuts and economic growth . 
The problem with being &quot; Mr. Nice Guy &quot; for too long is that , even with its vast new resources , the IMF cannot let clients hang on forever . 
If it does , it might not have sufficient funds for the next crisis , which will inevitably come , possibly from an unexpected quarter such as Japan or China . 
Moreover , if the Fund loses all credibility for catalyzing budget reform , its magnanimous bailouts will only serve to exacerbate the larger global sovereign-debt crisis that is brewing not just in Europe , but in the United States , Japan , and elsewhere . 
Slow growth , aging populations , and soaring deficits are a dangerous mix . 
The question for the IMF in Europe is not whether it has a plan viable for getting in . 
It has landed in force . 
The question is whether it has a plausible exit strategy .
