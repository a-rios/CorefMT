America , China , and the Productivity Paradox 
NEW HAVEN - In the late 1980s , there was intense debate about the so-called productivity paradox - when massive investments in information technology ( IT ) were not delivering measureable productivity improvements . 
That paradox is now back , posing a problem for both the United States and China - one that may well come up in their annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue . 
Back in 1987 , Nobel laureate Robert Solow famously quipped , &quot; You can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics . &quot; 
The productivity paradox seemed to be resolved in the 1990s , when America experienced a spectacular productivity renaissance . 
Average annual productivity growth in the country &apos;s nonfarm business sector accelerated to 2.5 % from 1991 to 2007 , from the 1.5 % trend in the preceding 15 years . 
The benefits of the Internet Age had finally materialized . 
Concern about the paradox all but vanished . 
But the celebration appears to have been premature . 
Despite another technological revolution , productivity growth is slumping again . 
Over the past five years , from 2010 to 2014 , annual US productivity growth has fallen to an average of 0.9 % . 
It actually fell at a 2.6 % annual rate in the two most recent quarters ( in late 2014 and early 2015 ) . 
Barring a major data revision , America &apos;s productivity renaissance seems to have run into serious trouble . 
China is witnessing a similar pattern . 
Although the government does not publish regular productivity statistics , there is no mistaking the problem : Overall urban employment growth has been steady , at around 13.2 million workers per year since 2013 - well in excess of the government &apos;s targeted growth rate of ten million . 
Moreover , hiring seems to be holding at that brisk pace in early 2015 . 
At the same time , output growth has slowed from the 10 % trend of the 33 years ending in 2011 to around 7 % today . 
That downshift , in the face of sustained rapid job creation , implies an unmistakable deceleration of productivity . 
Therein lies the latest paradox . 
With revolutionary technologies now driving the creation of new markets ( digital media and computerized wearables ) , services ( energy management and DNA sequencing ) , products ( smartphones and robotics ) , and technology companies ( Alibaba and Apple ) , surely productivity growth must be surging . 
As a modern-day Solow might say , the &quot; Internet of Everything &quot; is everywhere except in the productivity statistics . 
But is there really a paradox ? 
Northwestern University &apos;s Robert Gordon has argued that IT- and Internet-led innovations like automated high-speed data processing and e-commerce pale in comparison to the breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution , including the steam engine , electricity , and indoor plumbing . 
He maintains that , although these innovations led to dramatic transformations of the major advanced economies - such as higher female labor-force participation , increased transportation speed , urbanization , and normalized temperature control - these changes will be extremely hard to replicate . 
Indeed , as taken with today &apos;s revolutionary technologies as we are - I say this staring at my sleek new Apple Watch - I am sympathetic to Gordon &apos;s argument . 
If US productivity figures are to be taken at anything close to face value - a persistently sluggish trend interrupted by a 16-year spurt that now appears to have faded - it is possible that all America has accomplished are transitional efficiency improvements associated with the IT-enabled shift from one technology platform to another . 
Optimists maintain that the official statistics fail to capture marked quality-of-life improvements , which may be true , especially in the light of promising advances in biotechnology and online education . 
In the US , the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the length of the average workweek has held steady at about 34 hours since the advent of the Internet two decades ago . 
Yet nothing could be further from the truth : knowledge workers continually toil outside the traditional office , checking their email , updating spreadsheets , writing reports , and engaging in collective brainstorming . 
Indeed , white-collar knowledge workers - that is , most workers in advanced economies - are now tethered to their workplaces essentially 24 hours a day , seven days a week , a reality that is not reflected in the official statistics . 
Productivity growth is not about working longer ; it is about generating more output per unit of labor input . 
Any undercounting of output pales in comparison with the IT-assisted undercounting of working hours . 
China &apos;s productivity slowdown is probably more benign . 
It is an outgrowth of the Chinese economy &apos;s nascent structural transformation from capital-intensive manufacturing to labor-intensive services . 
Indeed , it was only in 2013 that services supplanted manufacturing and construction as the economy &apos;s largest sector . 
Now the gap is widening , and that is likely to continue . 
With Chinese services requiring about 30 % more workers per unit of output than manufacturing and construction , combined , the economy &apos;s structural rebalancing is now shifting growth to China &apos;s lower-productivity services sector . 
China has time before this becomes a problem . 
As Gordon notes , there have been long-lasting productivity dividends associated with urbanization - a trend that could continue for at least another decade in China . 
At that point , China will face the same productivity challenges that confront America and others . 
Chinese policymakers &quot; new focus on innovation-led growth seems to recognize this risk . 
Without powerful innovations , sustaining productivity growth will be an uphill battle . 
China &apos;s recent shift to a slower-productivity trajectory is an early warning of what may well be one of its most daunting economic challenges . 
There is no escaping the key role that productivity growth plays in any country &apos;s economic performance . 
Yet , for advanced economies , periods of sustained rapid productivity growth have been the exception , not the rule . 
Recent signs of slowing productivity growth in both the US and China underscore this reality . 
For a world flirting with secular stagnation , that is disturbing news , to say the least .
