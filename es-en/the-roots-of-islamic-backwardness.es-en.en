The Roots of Islamic Backwardness The war in Iraq is over . 
But the battle to transform the economies of the Middle East - the only hope of preventing fanaticism from claiming a generation of young unemployed Arabs and Iranians - is only beginning . 
That struggle goes beyond development strategies and touches the roots of Islam . 
&quot; The people of Iran , &quot; the late Ayatollah Khomeini is reported to have liked to say , &quot; did not make the Islamic Revolution to lower the price of watermelons . &quot; 
By that logic , capitalism and Islam are incompatible . 
Are they ? 
History may provide some guidance here . 
The Industrial Revolution started in the English midlands and Belgian forests - regions endowed with coal , canals ( along which barges could carry the coal ) , and skilled metalworkers ( who could build coal-burning steam engines ) . 
Coal , canals , and metalworkers were the foundation for building , installing , and using the automatic spinning machines , power looms , and railway locomotives that were the first modern machine industries . 
Steam power , factories , markets , and industry quickly spread throughout northwest Europe and its settler colonies . 
By the end of the 19 th century , Turin , Vienna , Prague , Wroclaw , Essen , Paris , Lille , Liege , Lyons , and Barcelona in continental Europe , much of Britain and the United States , parts of Canada and Ireland , and Melbourne , Buenos Aires , and Johannesburg ( plus , of course , Tokyo ) were centers of modern industry . 
Beyond these limits , however , the fires of the Industrial Revolution barely smoldered , if they burned at all . 
For two centuries , far-sighted Ottoman viziers had argued for the need to spur Turkey &apos;s economic and technological development : back in 1453 , Sultan Mehmet II &apos;s armies had conquered Constantinople , because Mehmet had built the most technologically advanced and powerful artillery in the world . 
In the early 19 
Today &apos;s 70 million Egyptians live much better than their heavily taxed cotton- and grain-growing predecessors of Mehemet Ali &apos;s time . 
But the gap between the economies of the Arab Middle East and Western Europe - in ( non-oil sector ) productivity , technological capability , and standards of living - is wider than it was a century ago , and vastly greater than at the start of the Industrial Age . 
In many respects , the slow pace of the Islamic world &apos;s economic development has been a matter of choice . 
The Prophet Muhammad was a merchant , and the Quraysh ( Mecca &apos;s ruling tribe at the time of the Prophet ) lived by guiding caravans from Arabia to the Fertile Crescent . 
But the affinity between Islamic attitudes , rulers , merchants , and craftsmen that made Cairo , Damascus , Baghdad , and Samarkand jewels of High Medieval urban civilization vanished long ago . 
Industrialization means novelty and change . 
If those who hold power fear that change may bring unpleasant consequences , they will systematically obstruct it , which rulers in the Middle East proceeded to do for centuries . 
But slow and distorted development in the Islamic world is the result of blocked opportunities as well . 
Wouldn &apos;t Pakistan be much better off if it exported more of its textiles to the rich industrial world ? 
Wouldn &apos;t waiving Pakistan &apos;s quota under the Multi-Fiber Agreement have been a very good and important step for the US government to take in reciprocation of the Pakistani government &apos;s help as US-led forces attacked Al Qaeda bases in Afghanistan ? 
No doubt it would have been . 
Wouldn &apos;t prospects for economic development in Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia be much more promising if European governments would let EU citizens buy more North African oranges ? 
Of course . 
But other key reasons for the slow pace of economic development in the Islamic world reflect the standard dilemmas of poor governance . 
&quot; Protect property rights and enforce contracts , &quot; say Western economists . 
But property rights and contracts are threatened at many levels . 
They are threatened by roving bandits , by local notables , and , most of all , by government functionaries who use their offices to extort extra income . 
Simply put , a weak state cannot enforce contracts and property rights , while a state that is strong enough to enforce them must control its own bureaucrats . 
However , the most important reasons that the Islamic world has done worse than Latin America or Southeast Asia seem to be focused around education . 
There can be little hope for sustained economic development where the educational system is at least one generation - and possibly three generations - behind other regions in terms of its commitment to universal literacy , and where higher education largely ignores the skills and subjects needed to enable people to master technology . 
After all , blocked export opportunities , weak government institutions , and high levels of corruption are worldwide problems . 
Even political and religious leaders hostile to change and industrialization are not uncommon . 
But as we compare patterns of development throughout the world , more and more evidence is piling up that universal literacy and a large class of people with industrial-technical skills are key resources that determine whether countries are able to break free from the grip of backwardness and poverty .
