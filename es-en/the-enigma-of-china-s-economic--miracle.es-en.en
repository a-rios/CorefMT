The Enigma of China \ u0027s Economic \ 
The People &apos;s Republic of China is a country in precarious transition from one political / economic system to another . 
Monumental contradictions abound . 
Indeed , probably no nation of global significance has more unresolved issues concerning its ruling principles and structures . 
But what really makes forecasting China &apos;s future so difficult is not only that recent developments have so often defied prediction , but that virtually opposite , if logical , scenarios are plausible . 
China emerged over the past decade and a half as a paradigm of economic energy , determination , and progress . 
Few other areas in the world have been deemed an &quot; economic miracle &quot; for so long . 
Through thick and thin , China has managed to maintain impressively high economic growth rates . 
In 1989 , China rose from the ashes of the Tiananmen Square Massacre . 
In the early 1990 &apos;s , it weathered the implosion of the Japanese economic miracle , and maintained a steady course through the Asian economic crisis later in the decade . 
In 2003 , it came through the SARS epidemic with banners flying . 
Now it seems to have repelled US efforts to force it into revaluing its currency . 
Anyone who has visited China &apos;s large cities over the past few years must be impressed by the energy , pace , and scale of development . 
The sheer number of projects - from highways , ports , railroads , and airports to skyscrapers , housing developments , telecom infrastructure , and industrial parks - leaves even skeptics gasping in awe . 
But behind the dazzling skylines and impressive statistics , another reality exists , one replete with unresolved problems and daunting numbers that suggests a far darker scenario . 
Consider the following : 
China must create some 12-15 million new jobs annually just to keep up with population growth ; 
The government must deal with an estimated 270 million unemployed or underemployed people ; 
A &quot; floating population &quot; ( dispossessed rural workers who have moved to the cities to find work ) of between 100-150 million is growing by almost 5 % annually , representing the largest migration in human history . 
These migrants exist with no job security , no long-term housing , and no health care ; 
800 million rural peasants have been largely left out of China &apos;s latest boom , creating rising , but frustrated , expectations ; 
China has no functioning pension system , and the cost of creating one is estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars ; 
New stock markets are all too often little more than elite-manipulated casinos , leaving China without the capacity to form the kind of indigenous pools of investment capital needed to power its own development ; 
State banks must provide 98 % of all financing for local companies . 
But , having been used to keep state-owned enterprises afloat for too long , the banks are essentially insolvent . 
Standard and Poor &apos;s estimates that it would cost around $ 518 billion ( 40 % of GDP ) to clean up their non-performing loans . 
Environmental degradation from rapid industrialization , overpopulation , and uncontrolled resource exploitation is extreme and , given the pressure to maintain high growth rates , very difficult to remedy ; 
Since 1998 , the Chinese government has become increasingly reliant on ever larger bond issues for fiscal stimulus , pushing debt onto the next generation ; 
Estimates of the government &apos;s growing aggregate liabilities ( bank debt , un-funded pension plans , bonded indebtedness for infrastructural projects , etc . ) range from 70 % to over 150 % of GDP . 
The government &apos;s ability to collect tax revenue remains weak , yielding less than the equivalent of 15 % of GDP . 
Fears of an investment bubble caused by uncontrolled , indiscriminate , and excessively exuberant investment and growth have led many experts to worry about a meltdown akin to that experienced by Silicon Valley in the late 1990 &apos;s . 
These fears are compounded by the fact that China &apos;s Leninist one-party government , now almost completely dependent on its &quot; economic miracle &quot; for legitimacy , has shown few signs of implementing political reforms to complement economic reform . 
So China &apos;s entire system is in a state of perilously balanced transition . 
And since every economy is cyclical in nature , even some of China &apos;s most ardent boosters are left to wonder what resources the Party and government will have to draw on , should growth rates drop , even to a respectable 3-4 % . 
What would the government rely on for legitimacy if unemployed workers begin agitating ; if angry peasants begin to besiege local government office in large numbers ; if factionalism incites a crisis in leadership ; conflict erupts in the Taiwan Straits ; or the global economy remains sluggish ? 
China may have seemed a &quot; miracle &quot; over the past decade . 
But good economic times rarely test a political system . 
The real test is a political system &apos;s ability to survive the inevitable cyclical downturns , political shocks or social upheavals that almost inevitably challenge a country , particularly developing ones . 
Economists and political observers who are skeptical about the durability of China &apos;s &quot; economic miracle &quot;  - and there are many of them - point to the country &apos;s sclerotic political system , its precarious economic institutions , the hazardous balance of hundreds of millions of marginal Chinese , and the economy &apos;s reliance on outside capital . 
They are right to wonder whether the &quot; miracle &quot; can continue to survive the kind of shocks that have rocked almost every other part of Asia to its foundations at one time or another over the last decade . 
China has weathered much , but its big test has yet to come .
