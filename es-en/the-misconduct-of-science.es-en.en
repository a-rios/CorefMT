The Misconduct of Science ? 
WOLLERAU , SWITZERLAND - Scientific fraud , plagiarism , and ghost writing are increasingly being reported in the news media , creating the impression that misconduct has become a widespread and omnipresent evil in scientific research . 
But these reports are more an example of sensationalist media latching on to a hot topic than a true account of the deterioration of scientific values . 
Far from being the norm in scientific research , fraud and cheating are rare exceptions , and are usually quickly identified by other scientists . 
And the public seems to understand this . 
Indeed , trust and confidence in scientific research have not been seriously undermined by reports of misconduct . 
Nor have these rare incidents curtailed scientific progress , which is so valuable to humankind . 
To be sure , even a few cases of scientific misconduct are too many . 
Scientists are expected to be beacons of hope in the search for knowledge - and clever enough not to try to get away with cheating . 
Preventive mechanisms are in place to hold responsible the few who take the gamble . 
But , while the scientific community - including academic and professional institutions , agency heads , managers , and editors - is often reluctant to handle cases of misconduct rigorously , the reputation of science as a whole is at stake , not just that of a person , institution , journal , or national science entity . 
Ironically , those who are caught often blame their misconduct on competition , pressure to publish , and recognition and prizes - the very practices and incentives that the scientific community introduced and fostered . 
Indeed , while the menace of misconduct has been exaggerated , we have to rethink how we conduct science - its values , virtues , and shortcomings . 
Scientists must follow a path that is not scientifically predefined , and that requires decisions at every step . 
Whether they are right or wrong becomes clear in retrospect , which is why errors are unavoidable ( though they should not be left uncorrected for long ) . 
Science means constantly walking a tightrope between blind faith and curiosity ; between expertise and creativity ; between bias and openness ; between experience and epiphany ; between ambition and passion ; and between arrogance and conviction - in short , between an old today and a new tomorrow . 
But , nowadays , research increasingly is misdirected toward lucrative prizes , professional recognition , and financial gains - rewards that are suffocating the creativity and passion that scientific progress demands . 
As T.S. Eliot put it , &quot; Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge ? 
Where is the knowledge we have lost in information ? &quot; 
In the &quot; hard &quot; sciences , such as mathematics and physics , the truth can be established more transparently , making these fields less prone to scientific misconduct . 
But branches like medicine , humanities , philosophy , economics , and other social sciences , which rely more heavily on openness and imagination , can be manipulated more easily to suit the goals of bureaucrats . 
Indeed , today , too many areas that are being called &quot; science &quot; - for example , collecting biased statistics in order to make a politician &apos;s ( or corporation &apos;s ) point , or publishing a variation of existing knowledge - fall far short of scientific standards of originality and the quest for basic insight . 
And yet , while bureaucratization of science has fueled concerns about its attractiveness to talented thinkers , we should not be overly pessimistic . 
To be sure , many people have lamented the loss of brilliant minds to the financial sector over the past few decades . 
But perhaps we should consider it a stroke of luck that these geniuses created their mess somewhere else . 
Moreover , we underestimate the younger generation of scientists . 
Like the previous generation , many gifted young researchers know that they must work hard to meet monumental challenges and make valuable contributions to society . 
But we must be careful not to corrupt their work with the questionable practices that the scientific community has adopted in recent years . 
The new generation of researchers must be given the skills and values - not just scientific ideals , but also awareness of human weaknesses - that will enable it to correct its forebears &quot; mistakes .
