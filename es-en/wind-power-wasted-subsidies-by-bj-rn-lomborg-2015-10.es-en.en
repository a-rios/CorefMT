Blowing It On the Wind 
BERLIN - When considering climate change , most people think wind turbines and solar panels are a big part of the solution . 
But , over the next 25 years , the contribution of solar and wind power to resolving the problem will be trivial - and the cost will be enormous . 
The International Energy Agency estimates that about 0.4 % of global energy now comes from solar and wind . 
Even in 2040 , with all governments implementing all of their green promises , solar and wind will make up just 2.2 % of global energy . 
This is partly because wind and solar help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions only from electricity generation , which account for 42 % of the total , but not from the energy used in industry , transport , buildings , and agriculture . 
But the main reason why wind and solar power cannot be a major solution to climate change stems from an almost insurmountable obstacle : we need power when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing . 
This has major implications for claims about costs . 
For example , wind power , we are repeatedly told , is just about to be cheaper than fossil fuels - or even , as a recent global news story claimed , that it is now cheaper than fossil fuels in Germany and the United Kingdom . 
This is mostly a mirage - large-scale wind power will not work anytime soon without subsidies . 
As Warren Buffet says : &quot; &#91; W &#93; e get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms . 
That &apos;s the only reason to build them . 
They don &apos;t make sense without the tax credit . &quot; 
The IEA estimates that the annual bill for global wind subsidies will increase over the next 25 years , not decrease or fall to zero . 
One reason is that cheaper wind in Germany and the UK is true only for new construction . 
Most existing coal and gas suppliers cost about half or less than wind and could run for decades ; instead , we half-close them to accommodate wind . 
Whereas the new , cheap German wind-energy producers cost $ 80 per MWh ( $ 0.08 per kWh ) , the average German spot price in 2014 was just $ 33 per MWh . 
More important , wind is cheaper only when the wind blows . 
When the wind is not blowing , wind-generated electricity is the most expensive electricity of all , because it cannot be bought at any price . 
Installing more wind generators makes the electricity they produce less valuable . 
The first wind turbine brings a slightly above-average price per kWh . 
But with 30 % market share , since all wind producers sell electricity at the same time ( when the wind blows ) , the electricity is worth only 70 % of the average electricity price . 
Solar prices drop even faster at similar market shares . 
So wind and solar generators have to be much cheaper than the average price to be competitive . 
Moreover , wind and solar make fossil-fuel-generated electricity more expensive . 
Some people may think that is a good thing ; but , if our societies are to continue functioning in cloudy , windless weather , that means relying on some fossil fuels . 
The IEA estimates that 56 % of electricity will come from fossil fuels in 2040 , with nuclear and hydro accounting for another 28 % . 
Significant wind and solar usage reduces the number of hours gas and coal generation operates ; with large fixed costs , this makes every kWh more expensive . 
In a real electricity market , this would result in much higher electricity costs on windless evenings . 
But this is politically problematic , which is why markets are often constructed to spike much less . 
In Spain , gas plants were used 66 % of the time in 2004 , but only 19 % of the time now , largely because of more wind use . 
Because the plants must be kept running 57 % of the time to avoid losses , many are likely to close . 
Across Europe , possibly 60 % of all gas-fired generation is at risk . 
Keeping the lights on means either accepting much higher prices or emulating what many European governments are beginning to do - namely , subsidize fossil-fuel plants . 
For example , in 2018 alone , the UK will pay nearly £ 1 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) , mostly to fossil-fuel-based generators , to keep backup capacity available for peak power usage . 
Building more wind and solar generating capacity with subsidies means societies end up paying three times for power - once for the power , once for subsidies to inefficient renewables , and once more to subsidize our now-inefficient fossil fuels . 
Many will say , &quot; But at least we cut CO2 . &quot; 
That is true , although the reduction is perhaps only half of what is often touted , because the back-up power needed to smooth intermittent wind and solar is often more CO ₂ -heavy . 
Moreover , we pay dearly for these cuts . 
In 2013 , the world produced 635 TWh of wind electricity and paid at least $ 28 billion in subsidies , or $ 76 per avoided ton of CO ₂ , and likely twice or more than that . 
When the estimated damage costs of CO2 are about $ 5 per ton , and a ton of CO2 can be cut in the European Union for about $ 10 , we are paying a dollar to do less than 7-13 cents of good for the climate . 
And its positive impact on the climate is negligible . 
Consider two worlds : in the first , all governments implement all their green promises , as indicated by the IEA , and increase solar and wind energy more than seven-fold by 2040 ; in the second , not one new solar panel or wind turbine is purchased over the next 25 years . 
The difference in subsidy spending between the two worlds is more than $ 2.5 trillion . 
Yet the difference in temperature increase by the end of the century , run on the United Nations climate panel &apos;s own model , would be a mere 0.0175 ° C ( 0.03 ° F ) . 
One day , when the wind price has fallen much further and solar is almost as cheap as wind , significant investments in wind and solar could be a great idea . 
But even after decades of capital reallocation , these sources might account for a bit less than a quarter of our electricity . 
In short , a world powered by solar and wind - one that has resolved the climate challenge - is very unlikely anytime soon .
