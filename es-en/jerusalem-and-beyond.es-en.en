Jerusalem and Beyond 
TEL AVIV - The policy of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s government on Jerusalem is ill conceived . 
This was amply demonstrated by the announcement of the construction of 1,600 new apartments in the occupied eastern part of the city during what was supposed to be a charm visit by US Vice-President Joe Biden , Israel &apos;s best friend in President Barack Obama &apos;s administration . 
And yet , while Netanyahu might not be a great peacemaker , the Obama administration , by portraying the announcement as a deliberate attempt to frustrate the upcoming indirect talks with the Palestinians , exaggerated the incident for its own purposes . 
However unconvincing Netanyahu might sound to his critics , he is interested in negotiations . 
That does not mean that he is capable of taking the necessary decisions on the core issues , without which it will be impossible to conclude an agreement . 
But , in addition to peacemaking , Netanyahu is also - and perhaps primarily - engaged in a survival exercise , an impossible attempt to please too many actors with disparate expectations . 
Negotiations with the Palestinians are a way to please Obama , whose backing Netanyahu will badly need if and when a green light for an assault on Iran &apos;s nuclear installations is 
required . 
Netanyahu also has promoted his idea of an &quot; economic peace , &quot; with the hope that an agreement on the core issues of the conflict would be deferred . 
In pursuing this policy , Netanyahu has done considerably more than many of his predecessors to improve living conditions in the West Bank . 
And , while doing this , he has had to make certain that his peace gestures are not too generous for his right-wing coalition to digest . 
If successful in squaring these circles , Netanyahu might be entitled to a Nobel Prize - not for peace , but in physics . 
By building new neighborhoods in East Jerusalem , Netanyahu caters to his coalition &apos;s expectations , but puts at risk a central achievement of Ehud Barak &apos;s government a decade ago - the agreement with President Bill Clinton that recognized East Jerusalem &apos;s then existing Jewish neighborhoods as part of Israel &apos;s capital . 
If neutralizing Iran is an Israeli objective , then Netanyahu &apos;s Jerusalem policy is a strategic folly , for it offers Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an ideal platform to rally the Muslim world against Israel and its American allies . 
It also poses a serious problem to the Arab moderate camp , which seeks to ratify the Arab peace initiative at the forthcoming Arab summit in Tripoli . 
Jerusalem , a convenient rallying cry for Muslims throughout the world , is a powder keg with too many candidates ready to light a match . 
Obama &apos;s administration would definitely like to see an end to Iran &apos;s nuclear project , but it does not share Israel &apos;s determination to pursue crippling sanctions against Tehran , let alone to consider seriously , as the Israelis do , a military option . 
The diluted sanctions now being considered by the Americans , and their persistent advice to the Israelis to refrain from attacking Iran , reflect a yawning disparity in the two allies &quot; approaches . 
To Netanyahu , stopping the Iranian bomb is an existential priority . 
Obama &apos;s priorities lie in Baghdad , Kabul , and America &apos;s reconciliation with the Muslim world . 
His administration is clearly signaling that it can live with a nuclear Iran . 
Obama &apos;s main objectives in pursuing an Israeli-Palestinian peace are ensuring American soldiers &quot; safety on the battlefields of the wider Middle East and improving America &apos;s standing in the Arab world . 
This was made clear by the recent testimony of General David Petraeus , the head of America &apos;s Central Command , responsible for military affairs in the Middle East . 
Petraeus defined the question of Palestine as the root cause of instability in the region , saying that a perception of US favoritism for Israel foments anti-American sentiments . 
Netanyahu would do well to assume that an Israeli-Palestinian peace is related to the Iran question , not because it would help create the conditions for a military assault , but because it would help to dissolve the Iran-led regional coalition , which includes Syria , Hamas and Hezbollah . 
In fact , Iran &apos;s defiance of the international community over its nuclear program plays a crucial role in holding this coalition together and maintaining Iranian leadership of the anti-American camp in the region . 
Defeat of Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions would humble the Islamic Republic and undermine its regional alliances . 
Netanyahu &apos;s Jerusalem policy is dangerous , but so is the Palestinian Authority &apos;s game over their sacred mosques - Al Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock - on the Temple Mount . 
Although the Palestinians would be right to oppose Israel &apos;s policy of limiting their living space in the city , at no moment since the 1967 occupation of East Jerusalem has an Israeli government questioned the Palestinians &quot; authority over these shrines . 
The call by Palestinian leaders like Mohammed Dahlan for Arab Israelis and East Jerusalem residents &quot; to protect the Haram ( holy site ) from the Jews &quot; might end in unintended violence . 
The Palestinian Authority &apos;s game in the Holy City , like Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s unyielding challenge to the status quo there , both convey an unequivocal message : Jerusalem is too central to the prospects of an Arab-Israeli reconciliation and to the task of attenuating the dangerous mass hysteria throughout the region to be left as an open wound .
