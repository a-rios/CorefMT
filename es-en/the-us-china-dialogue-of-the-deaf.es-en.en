The US-China Dialogue of the Deaf 
NEW YORK - The visit on January 19 of China &apos;s president , Hu Jintao , is coming at a time when economic conflict between the United States and China has become one of the most worrying global developments . 
Throughout last year , the US pressed China to revalue the renminbi , while China blamed the US Federal Reserve policy of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; for currency-market turmoil . 
The two sides are talking past each other , though both are making valid points . 
The global imbalances that were at the root at the Crash of 2008 have not been corrected - indeed , some have grown larger . 
The US still consumes more than it produces , running a chronic trade deficit . 
Consumption remains too high , at nearly 70 % of GDP , compared to an unsustainably low 35.6 % of GDP in China . 
Households are over-indebted and must save more . 
The US economy needs higher productivity , but US corporations , which are operating very profitably , are accumulating cash instead of investing it - with quantitative easing aimed at heading off deflation . 
In China , by contrast , bank lending needs to be reigned in , but regulatory efforts have been hindered by off-balance-sheet financing and the development of an informal quasi-banking sector . 
The economy is showing signs of over-heating . 
These imbalances could be reduced by the US using fiscal rather than monetary stimulus , and China allowing the renminbi to appreciate in an orderly manner . 
But domestic politics in both countries stand in the way . 
In the US , the Republicans , who won the mid-term elections , were determined to extend the Bush tax cuts in their entirety . 
This leaves little room for fiscal stimulus , while the tax cut is more likely to be saved than invested . 
That is why the Fed had to resort to quantitative easing , even though it tends to stimulate asset bubbles rather than productive investments . 
China interprets quantitative easing as a plot to devalue the dollar and force a revaluation of the renminbi . 
The US , in turn , cannot understand why China should be so reluctant to allow the renminbi to appreciate , as doing so would help to dampen inflationary pressures . 
Maintaining a two-tier currency system and an undervalued currency has been the key to China &apos;s success . 
It is much more efficient than taxation as a means of skimming a significant share of payments for Chinese exports , which accrue as currency reserves and can be used at the central government &apos;s discretion . 
This has made the central government very powerful , attracting the best brains into its service . 
China would prefer to improve the trade balance through removal of trade barriers rather than exchange-rate adjustment , because it is reluctant to put additional strain on its export industries and eager to gain access to American technology . 
The US maintains restrictions on high-tech exports to China because of the latter &apos;s lack of respect for intellectual property rights . 
The US prefers higher Chinese import prices to help relieve deflationary pressures - which would also eliminate the need for quantitative easing , removing a source of Chinese complaints . 
As things stand now , each country is pursuing policies that do not help the other and are suboptimal for their own economies . 
The entire global economy would benefit if both sides listened to each other and coordinated their economic policies . 
But the opposite is happening . 
The conflict in economic policy is spreading to the geopolitical sphere . 
First , China asserted a &quot; core interest &quot; in the South China Sea , effectively claiming its 200-mile &quot; special economic zone &quot; throughout the region as territorial waters . 
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton countered that America also has &quot; interests &quot; in this area , bringing the two countries to loggerheads over a vast and critically important maritime region in Asia . 
Then China became embroiled with Japan in a dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku Islands . 
Few Westerners appreciate how seriously China takes this issue . 
Geologically , the islands are connected to Taiwan , and Japan gained control over them by taking possession of Taiwan in 1895 . 
This elevates these uninhabited rocks to the same level of importance as Taiwan or Tibet for the official &quot; one China doctrine . &quot; 
China greatly resented it when the US endorsed the Japanese position . 
China &apos;s rapid rise , and America &apos;s equally rapid loss of power and influence , has created a dangerous situation . 
With the exception of the peaceful transition of world leadership from Britain to the US after World War I , such global power shifts have always involved armed conflict . 
The deterioration in US-China relations is particularly troubling because it takes place against a background of global imbalances and serious internal political divisions , which drive both countries to take intransigent positions . 
The global imbalances could be cured , and conflicts avoided , only by greater international cooperation . 
But macroeconomic policy is not the only area that would benefit from better understanding between the two countries . 
Consider Afghanistan . 
The country is rich in mineral resources that China needs , but it is the US that spends $ 10 billion a month occupying a country whose annual GDP is only $ 15 billion . 
As things stand , the US is likely to reduce its presence before Afghanistan is pacified and the mineral resources developed . 
Since China is the obvious market for these minerals , it would make sense for China to encourage continued American engagement by making a significant contribution to the cost of training the Afghan army . 
China was farsighted when it adopted the doctrine of harmonious development , but recently it has veered from it . 
Apparently , the rate of change has been too rapid for Chinese leaders to adjust to it . 
The leadership is preoccupied with taking care of the needs of its own people , many of whom still live in poverty . 
But China has become a great power , with all the obligations for maintaining world order that go with it , whether or not the leadership acknowledges it . 
When US President Barack Obama visited China in November 2009 , he acknowledged China &apos;s rapid rise and offered a partnership in maintaining and improving the world order . 
But the Chinese leadership declined the offer , explaining that China is a developing country that can hardly meet its own people &apos;s needs . 
That rift is unfortunate , because improvement in Chinese living standards ought to go hand-in-hand with Chinese participation in building a better world order . 
Only if China pays closer attention to how it is perceived and accepted by the rest of the world can it continue to rise in a peaceful manner . 
China &apos;s leadership knows that it must fulfill its own people &apos;s minimum expectations in order to maintain internal peace and stability ; now it must learn to make itself acceptable to the rest of the world in order to preserve external peace and stability . 
That means becoming a more open society and playing a more active role in maintaining a peaceful and stable world order . 
China ought to regard this not as a burdensome necessity , but as an inspiration to greatness . 
The best periods in Chinese history were those in which the country was most open both internally and towards the outside world . 
By contrast , when it comes to military might , China will not be a match for the US for some time to come . 
If current trends continue , China is bound to devote an increasing proportion of its resources to the military at the expense of the general population , whose expectations the leadership will find increasingly difficult to meet . 
In that case , today &apos;s prosperity is likely to prove transient . 
Worried neighbors are likely to seek protection under the wings of the American eagle , reinforcing the US military budget , which is already oversized . 
Unless a deliberate effort is made by both sides to reach a better understanding , the world faces a turbulent time in 2011 and beyond .
