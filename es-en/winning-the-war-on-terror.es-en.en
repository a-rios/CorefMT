Winning the War on Terror 
Last month , we observed the third anniversary of the day that awakened America to a new world , when extremists killed thousands of innocent people on American soil . 
Last week marked the third anniversary of the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom , the day America resolved to take the battle to the extremists themselves - and we attacked al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan . 
Three years into the global war on terror , some ask whether America is safer , and if the world is better off . 
These are fair questions . 
But , first , some historical perspective . 
It has been said that this global war against extremism will be the task of a generation , a war that could go on for years , much like the Cold War , which lasted for decades . 
We look back now at the Cold War as a great victory for freedom . 
But nothing was certain or preordained . 
The fifty-year span of the epic battle between the free world and the Soviet empire was filled with division , uncertainty , self-doubt , setbacks , and failures . 
Even with our closest allies , there were disputes over diplomatic policy , weapons deployment , and military strategies . 
In the 1960 &apos;s , France pulled out of NATO &apos;s military organization altogether . 
In America , columnists and editorialists questioned and doubted US policies . 
There were even instances where American citizens saw their own government challenged as being warmongers or aggressors . 
But the United States - under leaders of both political parties - and our allies showed perseverance and resolve , year after year . 
The strategies varied - from coexistence to containment to detente to confrontation . 
Our leaders continued to stand up to what many thought an unbeatable foe , and eventually the Soviet regime collapsed . 
That lesson has had to be relearned throughout the ages : the lesson that weakness is provocative , that a refusal to confront gathering dangers can increase , not reduce , future peril , and that victory ultimately comes only to those who are purposeful and steadfast . 
From the outset of this conflict , it was clear that our Coalition had to go on the offensive against an enemy without country or conscience . 
A little over three years ago , al-Qaeda was already a growing danger . 
Its leader , Osama bin Laden , was safe and sheltered in Afghanistan . 
His network was dispersed throughout the world and had been attacking American interests for years . 
Three years later , more than three-quarters of al-Qaeda &apos;s key members and associates have been detained or killed . 
Osama bin Laden is on the run , many of his key associates are behind bars or dead , and his financial lines of support have been reduced . 
Afghanistan , once controlled by extremists , today is led by Hamid Karzai , who is at the forefront of the world &apos;s efforts in support of moderates versus extremists . 
Soccer stadiums once used for public executions under the Taliban are today used , once again , for soccer . 
Over 10 million Afghans , 41 % of them women , were registered to vote in the country &apos;s first national election . 
Libya has gone from being a nation that sponsored terrorists , and secretly sought nuclear capability , to one that renounced its illegal weapons programs , and now says it is ready to re-enter the community of civilized nations . 
Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan &apos;s nuclear-proliferation network - which provided lethal assistance to nations such as Libya and North Korea - has been exposed and dismantled . 
Indeed , Pakistan , once sympathetic to al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime , has under President Pervez Musharraf cast its lot with the civilized world and is a stalwart ally against terrorism . 
NATO is now leading the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and is helping to train Iraqi Security forces - an important new &quot; out of area &quot; responsibility . 
The UN is helping set-up free elections in both Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Over 60 countries are working together to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . 
Three years ago , in Iraq , Saddam Hussein and his sons brutally ruled a nation in the heart of the Middle East . 
Saddam was attempting regularly to kill American and British aircrews enforcing the no-fly zones . 
He ignored 17 UN Security Council Resolutions . 
He was paying $ 25,000 awards to the families of suicide bombers . 
Three years later , Saddam is a prisoner , awaiting trial . 
His sons are dead . 
Most of his associates are in custody . 
Iraq has an interim Constitution that includes a Bill of Rights and an independent Judiciary . 
There are municipal councils in nearly every major city and in most towns and villages . 
Iraqis now are among those allowed to say , write , watch , and listen to whatever they want , whenever they want . 
Have there been setbacks in Afghanistan and Iraq ? 
Of course . 
But the enemy cannot win militarily . 
Their weapons are terror and chaos . 
They attack any sort of hope or progress to try to undermine morale . 
They know that if they can win the battle of perception , we will lose our will and leave . 
These are difficult times . 
From the heart of Manhattan and Washington DC , to Baghdad , Kabul , Madrid , Bali , and the Philippines , a call to arms has been sounded , and the outcome of this struggle will determine the nature of our world for decades to come . 
Today , as before , the hard work of history falls to America , to our Coalition , to our people . 
We can do it knowing that the great sweep of human history is for freedom - and that it is on our side .
