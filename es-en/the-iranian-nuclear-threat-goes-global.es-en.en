The Iranian Nuclear Threat Goes Global 
TEL AVIV - The current drive to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal reflects two important , and interrelated , changes . 
From Israel &apos;s perspective , these changes are to be welcomed , though its government must remain cautious about the country &apos;s own role . 
The first change is the escalation of efforts by the United States and its Western allies to abort the Iranian regime &apos;s nuclear quest . 
This was instigated in part by the International Atomic Energy Agency &apos;s finding in November 2011 that Iran is indeed developing a nuclear weapon , and that it is getting perilously close to crossing the &quot; red line &quot; - the point beyond which its progress could no longer be stopped . 
Moreover , the US and its allies understand that failure to take serious action might prompt Israel to launch its own unilateral military offensive . 
The second change is the perception that Iran &apos;s nuclear capacity would threaten not only Israel . 
In a speech to the Union for Reform Judaism in December , US President Barack Obama stated that &quot; another threat to the security of Israel , the US , and the world is Iran &apos;s nuclear program . &quot; 
But , by this February , Obama was saying of Iran that &quot; my number-one priority continues to be the security of the US , but also the security of Israel , and we continue to work in lockstep as we proceed to try to solve this ... &quot; 
That choice of words was no accident ; rather , it was a sign that the US is changing tack when it comes to Iran . 
For more than a decade , the question &quot; Whose issue is it ? &quot; has been part of the policy debate about Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Israel &apos;s former prime minister , Ariel Sharon , used to caution his colleagues against &quot; rushing to the head of the line &quot; on Iran . 
He argued that if Israel were to take the lead in sounding the alarm on Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions , the issue would be perceived as yet another &quot; Israeli problem . &quot; 
Indeed , Israel &apos;s critics were already arguing that this was another case of the tail wagging the dog - that Israel and its American lobby were trying to push the US into serving Israel &apos;s interests rather than its own . 
The most egregious examples of this view were statements made by the political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt . 
In a paper published prior to the release of their much-debated book The Israel Lobby , they argued : 
... &quot; Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions do not pose an existential threat to the US . 
If Washington could live with a nuclear Soviet Union , a nuclear China , and even a nuclear North Korea , then it can live with a nuclear Iran . 
And that is why the &#91; Israel &#93; Lobby must keep constant pressure on US politicians to confront Tehran . &quot; 
Israel &apos;s current prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , has been less worried than Sharon was about Israel &apos;s perceived role . 
He is too busy being directly engaged in the attempt to eliminate the deadly threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the Jewish state . 
Prior to the 2009 election that brought him to power , Netanyahu campaigned on the Iranian danger , and his government made the issue its cardinal concern . 
Together with his defense minister , Ehud Barak , Netanyahu succeeded in persuading Obama and the rest of the world that Israel was preparing a military attack as a last resort , should the US and its allies fail to stop the Iranian program in time . 
That policy has been effective , but it has also drawn attention to Israel &apos;s influence on the Iran question . 
Curiously , this has not been held against Israel , at least not so far , partly because Obama and other leaders now regard Iran as a more serious threat , and therefore feel the need to take appropriate action . 
The international community must underscore that its members are acting in the service of their national interests , and not simply for Israel &apos;s sake . 
But their willingness to engage could wane , particularly if sanctions exact a high financial price or military action causes a large number of casualties . 
Israel would therefore be wise to remember Sharon &apos;s cautionary words , and reinforce its pressure on the US administration with a broader diplomatic campaign . 
Like it or not , Israel must urge the world to remember that Iran is everyone &apos;s problem .
