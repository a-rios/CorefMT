Europe &apos;s Nobel Wake-Up Call 
MADRID - In a decision criticized and praised in equal measure , the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded this year &apos;s Peace Prize to the European Union in recognition of its contributions &quot; to the advancement of peace and reconciliation , democracy and human rights in Europe &quot; over the past six decades . 
But , to what extent is Europe preoccupied with &quot; perpetual peace &quot; at the expense of its current , vastly different ailments ? 
Is this award a swan song -confirmation of the moribund state of the European project , as the 2001 Nobel Prize was for the United Nations ? 
In announcing the prize , the committee explained how &quot; the work of the EU represents fraternity between nations . &quot; 
While it acknowledged that &quot; the EU is currently undergoing grave economic difficulties and considerable social unrest , &quot; it highlighted the EU &apos;s role as a beacon of hope - a democratic anchor , particularly meaningful for peoples who have lived through the horrors of dictatorships . 
But it is precisely the mismatch between the EU &apos;s past achievements and its current distress that has fueled anger and led to its rejection by many Europeans . 
The decision to establish the EU was an ingenious response to the biggest challenge of the day - war and conflict . 
And , of course , the resurgence of nationalism and extremism of all kinds around the world is a potent reminder , as if any were needed , that peace is not to be taken for granted . 
But the prospect of war in Europe now seems like a remote threat , and the varnish of the EU &apos;s past success seems to have faded , even to those who have not forgotten the bloodstains beneath . 
Instead , it is Europe &apos;s lack of a vision and narrative for the future - with which it could address issues like chronic unemployment , capital flight , and the ever-tightening grip of austerity - that keeps people awake at night , and that fosters populism , dismay , and internal disarray . 
The EU &apos;s ability to capitalize on - or even justify - the award hinges on its prospects for overcoming the sovereign-debt crisis and reestablishing trust among its member countries . 
But , more important , the EU needs to restore its allure , an integral part of which has always been economic prosperity . Aside from the eurozone &apos;s design flaws , the pressing items on Europe &apos;s agenda concern competitiveness , jobs , innovation , and technology . 
Europe &apos;s first order of business should be to accept reality : the emerging economies are catching up in terms of innovation while the EU is losing traction , with China on the cusp of surpassing Europe as the second-largest hub for venture capital globally , behind only the United States . 
In fact , a 2012 study by Ernst 
Young reveals that one US hub ( Silicon Valley ) alone boasts almost $ 12.6 billion in cumulative venture capital , while the United Kingdom , first among European countries , accounts for roughly $ 1.75 billion and Germany for $ 665 million . 
A similar study , conducted in 2012 by Javier Santiso , a professor at the ESADE business school in Barcelona and a managing director at Telef√≥nica , found that Europe &apos;s per capita investment in venture capital in 2011 was a meager $ 7 , compared to $ 142 in Israel and $ 72 in the US . 
An equally telling statistic is that only one company in the eurozone , Spain &apos;s Inditex ( ZARA ) , has made it to the FT Global 500 since 1996 . 
Research and development offers little consolation . 
Although European research has given rise to many new technologies used in industries worldwide , its recent record is wobbly at best , owing mainly to the difficulty in translating basic science into industrial advantage . 
Europe is losing its technological edge , whether in telecoms , technology , or the Internet , with its companies being displaced by those from emerging markets , while the US remains dominant . 
The NASDAQ index confirms this disturbing trend : only 15 European companies are listed , compared to 498 for the US , 43 for China , and 23 for Israel . 
Looking to the future , Europe should take note of the potential consequences revealed by the latest Program for International Student Assessment , a worldwide comparison of student performance . 
In mathematics and science , PISA &apos;s latest report card puts Asia at the head of the class , with China , Singapore , and South Korea on top . 
Meanwhile , with some exceptions - most notably Finland - Europe has slipped into riding in the peloton . 
The EU is , at last , beginning to understand that betting its future on services will not be enough to safeguard the European socioeconomic model . 
Member states &quot; governments and the European Commission &apos;s last communication , &quot; A Stronger European Industry for Growth and Economic Recovery , &quot; display an awareness of the need to revive Europe &apos;s industrial policy . 
Such efforts should promptly translate into legislative changes in areas ranging from insolvency to patents , from CO2 emission-reduction schemes to &quot; smart &quot; electricity grids . 
Europe urgently needs to devote its energy to revitalizing the building blocks of its economy - industry , human capital , and a policy framework that enables healthy growth and future prosperity . 
One hopes that this year &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize provides a boost in pride that allows Europeans to look beyond their immediate financial problems , consolidate the Union &apos;s strengths , and establish a coherent vision of the future . 
Otherwise , the EU &apos;s finest achievements will remain in the past .
