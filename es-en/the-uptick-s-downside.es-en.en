The Uptick &apos;s Downside 
RIO DE JANEIRO - Since late last year , a series of positive developments has boosted investor confidence and led to a sharp rally in risky assets , starting with global equities and commodities . 
Macroeconomic data from the United States improved ; blue-chip companies in advanced economies remained highly profitable ; 
China and emerging markets slowed only moderately ; and the risk of a disorderly default and / or exit by some members of the eurozone declined . 
Moreover , under its new president , Mario Draghi , the European Central Bank appears willing to do anything necessary to reduce stress on the eurozone &apos;s banking system and governments , as well as to lower interest rates . 
Central banks in both advanced and emerging economies have provided massive injections of liquidity . 
Volatility is down , confidence is up , and risk aversion is much lower - for now . 
But at least four downside risks are likely to materialize this year , undermining global growth and eventually negatively affecting investor confidence and market valuations of risky assets . 
First , the eurozone is in deep recession , especially in the periphery , but now also in the core economies , as the latest data show an output contraction in Germany and France . 
The credit crunch in the banking system is becoming more severe as banks deleverage by selling assets and rationing credit , exacerbating the downturn . 
Meanwhile , not only is fiscal austerity pushing the eurozone periphery into economic free-fall , but the loss of competitiveness there will persist as relief at the waning prospect of disorderly defaults strengthens the euro &apos;s value . 
To restore competitiveness and growth in these countries , the euro needs to fall towards parity with the US dollar . 
Second , there is now evidence of weakening performance in China and the rest of Asia . 
In China , the economic slowdown underway is unmistakable . 
Export growth is down sharply , turning negative vis-Ã -vis the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
Import growth , a sign of future exports , has also fallen . 
Similarly , Chinese residential investment and commercial real-estate activity are slowing sharply as home prices start to fall . 
Infrastructure investment is down as well , with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales . 
Elsewhere in Asia , Singapore &apos;s economy shrank for the second time in three quarters at the end of 2011 . 
India &apos;s government predicts 6.9 % annual GDP growth in 2012 , which would be the lowest rate since 2009 . 
Taiwan &apos;s economy fell into a technical recession in the fourth quarter of 2011 . 
South Korea &apos;s economy grew at a mere 0.4 % in the same period - the slowest pace in two years - while Japan &apos;s GDP contracted at a larger-than-expected 2.3 % , as the yen &apos;s strength weighed down exports . 
Third , while US data have been surprisingly encouraging , America &apos;s growth momentum appears to be peaking . 
Fiscal tightening will escalate in 2012 and 2013 , contributing to a slowdown , as will the expiration of tax benefits that boosted capital spending in 2011 . 
Moreover , given continuing malaise in credit and housing markets , private consumption will remain subdued ; indeed , two percentage points of the 2.8 % expansion in the last quarter of 2011 reflected rising inventories rather than final sales . 
And , as for external demand , the generally strong dollar , together with the global and eurozone slowdown , will weaken US exports , while still-elevated oil prices will increase the energy import bill , further impeding growth . 
Finally , geopolitical risks in the Middle East are rising , owing to the possibility of an Israeli military response to Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
While the risk of armed conflict remains low , the current war of words is escalating , as is the covert war in which Israel and the US are engaged with Iran ; and now Iran is lashing back with terrorist attacks against Israeli diplomats . 
The Islamic Republic , with its back to the wall as sanctions bite , could also react by sinking a few ships to block the Strait of Hormuz , or by unleashing its proxies in the region - the pro-Iranian Shia in Iraq , Bahrain , Kuwait , and Saudi Arabia , as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza . 
Moreover , there are broader geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that will not ease - and that might intensify . 
The Arab Spring has produced a relatively favorable outcome in Tunisia , where it started , but developments in Egypt , Libya , and Yemen remain far more uncertain , while Syria is on the brink of civil war . 
In addition , there are substantial concerns about political stability in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia &apos;s oil-rich Eastern Province , and potentially even in Kuwait and Jordan - all areas with substantial Shia or other restless populations . 
Beyond the countries affected by the Arab Spring , rising tensions between Shia , Kurdish , and Sunni factions in Iraq since the US withdrawal do not bode well for a boost in oil production . 
There is also the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians , as well as strains between Israel and Turkey . 
In other words , there are many things that could go wrong in the Middle East , any combination of which might stoke fear in markets and lead to much higher oil prices . 
Despite weak economic growth in advanced economies and a slowdown in many emerging markets , oil is already at around $ 100 per barrel . 
But the fear premium could push it significantly higher , with predictably negative effects on the global economy . 
With so many risks in so many places , investors , not surprisingly , will eventually prize liquidity in their portfolios , while shunning riskier fixed assets again when these tail risks materialize . 
That is yet another reason to believe that the global economy remains far from achieving a balanced and sustainable recovery .
