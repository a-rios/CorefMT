The Fed &apos;s Culture War 
CAMBRIDGE - At a closed-door conference attended by senior bankers , regulators , and some academics , Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo and Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley used their bully pulpit to do something unexpected . 
Instead of focusing on how to bolster bank stability - channeling more capital toward the largest institutions , curbing their riskiest activities , and determining how to manage a failing bank without bailing it out - the officials discussed the bankers themselves . 
Tarullo focused on managerial misbehavior , arguing that managers who do not comply fully and willingly with regulations should face tougher sanctions than they do now . 
Instead of blaming &quot; a few bad apples &quot; for wrongdoing , he insisted , institutions should implement controls that prevent &quot; bad apples &quot; from poisoning the organization . 
To this end , organizations should embed respect for law , regulation , and the public trust in internal compensation systems . 
Moreover , Tarullo cited criminal prosecution and imprisonment of individuals as the most effective way to deter illegal conduct , such as breaches of antitrust law . 
Of course , as he acknowledged , prosecuting an individual for such violations is difficult , because regulators lack criminal enforcement powers , evidentiary hurdles are high , and the circumstances are often uncertain . 
But regulators have not taken enough advantage of the authority that they do have to punish errant managers : they can ban these individuals from working in finance . 
According to Tarullo , a few well-chosen &quot; bans from banking &quot; could change the financial industry for the better . 
He urged bank boards and senior executives to preempt such bans by firing highly problematic managers publicly , rather than sending them quietly out the back door . 
Public executions would deter the rest of the organization from bad behavior . 
Dudley also placed the onus for change on senior bank managers . 
In discussing bank culture - a major topic of interest for him and the New York Fed - he encouraged senior bankers to align their organizations &quot; cultures with the public interest and regulatory parameters . 
Instead of viewing the law as a problem to manage and , if possible , evade , bankers should recognize and respect its vital importance ( a point that Tarullo also made ) . 
In this sense , Dudley said , the banking industry &quot; is not close to where it needs to be . &quot; 
Like Tarullo , Dudley stressed that violations should not be treated as isolated actions by deviant employees , but as evidence of failure by senior managers - from the boardroom to the executive suite - to orient bank culture properly . 
Violations should thus catalyze a concerted effort by senior managers to bring so-called rogue bankers under control and to infuse their organizations with an ethos of compliance and integrity . 
If they are unable to do so , Dudley argued , a reasonable conclusion would be that the organization is too big to manage . 
For at least a few listeners , this statement probably evoked memories of the trader known as the &quot; London Whale , &quot; who lost at least $ 6 billion at JP Morgan Chase - America &apos;s largest bank - in 2012 . 
The bank &apos;s risk-management team , reputedly the best in the world , failed to identify a rogue trader in their midst until it was too late . 
The focus on individuals &quot; responsibility within banks represents a notable change in regulators &quot; approach , and it was reinforced by a third initiative , which other speakers emphasized : using deferred debt-based compensation to tie managers &quot; pay to bank safety and soundness . 
Catalyzing a shift in bank culture will not be easy . 
Bankers know that assuming substantial amounts of low-probability , high-impact risk often benefits bank shareholders and bolsters their own bonuses . 
But , when things go wrong , the government picks up much of the bill - and the real economy suffers . 
Complicating matters further is that risk-taking by banks - even at extreme levels - is not always unethical , rogue , or fraudulent . 
It often appears responsible and innovative . 
The problem with innovation is that no one can predict the precise impact it will have . 
In fact , the 2008-2009 financial crisis was more a consequence of error and misdirection than fraud and explicit misconduct by bankers . 
Nonetheless , the kind of cultural and behavioral initiatives that Tarullo and Dudley proposed are worth pursuing . 
Indeed , aligning the financial interests of managers and senior bankers with regulators &quot; efforts to boost capital , reduce risk , and make bank failure a real possibility would go a long way toward making banks safer . 
But there is one critical caveat : Regulators &quot; core organizational objectives must have priority over soft , culture-related goals , with the latter supporting - not displacing - the former . 
Tarullo and Dudley understand this - but other , less adept officials may not . 
If people-focused efforts begin to eclipse regulators &quot; core responsibilities , much of the progress that has been made in recent years toward bolstering banking safety will be lost . 
That could turn out to be the riskiest move of all .
