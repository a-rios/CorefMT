Hard Turkey 
JERUSALEM - The recent surge in Turkey &apos;s military actions against the Kurds in northern Iraq is an indication that , somewhat surprisingly - but not entirely unpredictably - Turkish foreign policy has undergone a 180-degree turn in less than two years . 
The Turkish offensive is also an indication that these changes go beyond the current tensions between Turkey and Israel , which are just one facet of much deeper trends . 
Just a couple of years ago , after the European Union slammed the door in Turkey &apos;s face ( despite some significant military and penal reforms by the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) government ) , Turkey re-oriented its policy away from Europe towards its immediate region . 
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu &apos;s &quot; zero conflicts with neighbors &quot; approach gave this re-orientation its strategic and theoretical foundation . 
Opening an impressive new page , Turkey reached out to Armenia ; softened its position on Cyprus ; tried to draw Iran into a positive dialogue with the West ; convinced Syria to settle the two countries &quot; simmering border dispute ; and , as a crowning achievement , launched peace talks between Syria and Israel under Turkish mediation . 
Yet these good-neighborhood policies did not work out as intended . 
Rapprochement with Armenia stalled ; no significant progress was made on Cyprus , especially after a less-accommodating leader was elected in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ( an entity that only Turkey recognizes ) ; the opening to Iran did not soften the mullahs &quot; position on nuclear development ( and strained relations with the United States ) ; the Syria-Israel talks failed ; and Turkey &apos;s participation in the 2010 flotilla to Gaza , and Israel &apos;s brutal response to it , signaled an end to decades of close Israeli-Turkish cooperation . 
To top it all off , Syria &apos;s President Bashar al-Assad , ostensibly Turkey &apos;s closest new ally , emerged as the most oppressive and bloody regional tyrant . 
Assad has now spent the better part of 2011 killing his own people as they demonstrate for liberalization and reform . 
Notwithstanding these failures , Turkey &apos;s strategic stature did not suffer , partly because the diminution of US engagement under President Barack Obama enabled Turkey to fill the ensuing regional power vacuum . 
The Arab Spring , despite its still-inconclusive outcome , greatly weakened Egypt &apos;s role in regional politics and made it possible for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to position Turkey - and himself - as the leader of a Muslim bloc and a model of co-existence between Islam and democracy . 
Last but not least , the AKP &apos;s victory in recent parliamentary elections has encouraged Erdoğan to embrace Putinesque ambitions . 
All of this exposed the built-in ambivalence in Davutoğlu &apos;s &quot; zero conflict &quot; policy . 
While initially viewed as pacific and moderate , it was underpinned by an overarching view of Turkey as the hegemonic regional power - as an arbiter of conflicts , but ultimately also as an enforcer of its own views on lesser players . 
It may be incorrect to call Turkey &apos;s behavior &quot; neo-Ottoman , &quot; but some neighboring countries , after expecting a mediator and facilitator , may now feel faced by a possible bully . 
Erdoğan &apos;s policy re-orientation vis-à-vis Israel can be understood as an attempt not only to overcome traditional Arab suspicion of Turkey , given its imperial past , but also to present a more moderate Islamic alternative to theocratic Iran and its unpredictable president . 
But Erdoğan &apos;s threat to consider using the Turkish navy as a military escort for further flotillas to Gaza already borders on saber rattling , as does his declared willingness to use force to prevent the Republic of Cyprus from exploring for gas in its continental shelf . 
Indeed , Erdoğan &apos;s has warned of a diplomatic rupture with the EU if Cyprus accedes to the Union &apos;s rotating presidency in 2012 . 
At the same time , renewed violent incursions into northern Iraq in pursuit of alleged guerillas suggest a reversion to hardline anti-Kurdish policies . 
The withdrawal of US forces from Iraq only seems to have encouraged Turkey &apos;s will to create a cordon sanitaire on the Iraqi side of the border - and possibly to establish a counterweight to Iran &apos;s influence on a Shia-led government in Baghdad . 
And , while Turkey &apos;s agreement to host NATO anti-missile radar facilities , and its recent seizure of a Syrian-registered arms ship , may please the West , here , too , its policies are focused on &quot; hard &quot; military power . 
Similarly , Erdoğan &apos;s recent visit to Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia brings out the ambivalence of Turkey &apos;s new claim to regional hegemony . 
While Egypt &apos;s shaky military junta welcomed Erdoğan , many Egyptians were not happy about his hectoring them - and other Arabs - to follow Turkish policies and to regard Turkey as their Muslim leader . 
A new sultanate ? 
Erdoğan as the new Saladin ? 
Turkey has an enormously important role to play in the region . 
It could be a bridge between the West and the East , between Islam and modernity , and between Israel and the Arabs . 
But it runs the danger of succumbing to the arrogance of power , which has corrupted and sidelined many strong states in the past .
