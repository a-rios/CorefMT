The Revolution Betrayed 
KYIV - From snowy Kyiv , I have watched the successful revolutions in Cairo and Tunis with joy and admiration . 
Egyptians and Tunisians are right to be proud of their desire to peacefully overthrow despotic governments . 
But , as someone who led a peaceful revolution , I hope that pride is tempered by pragmatism , because a change of regime is only the first step in establishing a democracy backed by the rule of law . 
Indeed , as my country , Ukraine , is now demonstrating , after revolutionary euphoria fades and normality returns , democratic revolutions can be betrayed and reversed . 
The first of Ukraine &apos;s lessons for Egyptian and Tunisian democrats is that elections do not a democracy make . 
After all , what if the enemies of freedom use elections to entrench their anti-democratic agendas ? 
What if elements of the old regime , or the cadres of militant minorities , only pretend to embrace democratic norms in order to hijack the new democracy ? 
In Ukraine today , these are not abstract questions . 
Six years after our Orange Revolution , not only is my country &apos;s democracy under threat , but the rule of law is being systematically perverted and our national independence bartered away . 
Indeed , the hybrid presidential / parliamentary system that Ukraine established as part of the settlement which brought a peaceful end to our revolution is being hollowed out in order to concentrate all political power in the hands of a supposedly democratically elected president . 
Of course , Ukraine &apos;s plight does not mean that the people of Egypt and Tunisia should spurn the call for free elections . 
Determining the will of the people does require expression through the ballot box . 
But elections alone cannot solve the fundamental political problems confronting Egypt and Tunisia . 
In particular , they cannot create a liberal order and open society . 
To be effective , elections must be preceded by an extensive debate , in which political arguments are made , attacked , defended , and , ultimately , embodied in ideologically coherent party organizations . 
Democratic consent can truly be given only when voters know what they are consenting to . 
Whoever refuses to make a public case for what he or she intends to do when in power , or lies about it - as Ukraine &apos;s current president , Viktor Yanukovych , did during his campaign against me last year - is no supporter of the democracy that citizens risked their lives to establish . 
Moreover , democracy must be rooted in the rule of law . 
There must be accepted rules that are binding on everyone in politics , so that whoever does not accept or obey them is disqualified . 
Yanukovych &apos;s naked attempt to hijack the election that precipitated the Orange Revolution should have caused him to be banned from running in future elections . 
Yet he was not . 
Now , as president , Yanukovych &apos;s crude instinct is to treat the law and constitution as Karl Marx thought of them : as a mixture of sentimentality , superstition , and the unconscious rationalization of private interests . 
Stealing elections , suppressing the vote , and behaving in contempt of the rule of law are negations of democracy . 
Those who engage in them must be seen as democracy &apos;s enemies and treated as such . 
A second lesson follows from this . 
The fact that a government has been democratically elected does not mean that the cause of freedom has prevailed . 
The rest of the world must not turn a blind eye to authoritarian backsliding . 
Yet today , not only are many of Ukraine &apos;s neighbors silent about Yanukovych &apos;s strangulation of Ukraine &apos;s democracy , but some openly celebrate the supposed &quot; stability &quot; that his regime has imposed . 
For decades , Egyptians and Tunisians paid a high a price in freedom for the stability of others . 
They must never be asked , or forced , to pay it again . 
One way to help prevent a democratic revolution from being betrayed from within is by building a genuine civil society . 
We in Ukraine learned this truth from harsh experience in the communist era . 
Although communism could , every now and then , coexist with private property , and sometimes with private enterprise , it could never coexist with civil society . 
The most fateful attack to accompany the installation of any dictatorship is an attack on civil society . 
In Ukraine , freedom of speech was , on communism &apos;s fall , restored overnight . 
But reviving civil society - the many mutually complementary ways in which citizens participate in public life - is a complicated task , as the peoples of Egypt and Tunisia will soon find out . 
The reason is self-evident : civil society is an intricate , fragile , even mysterious entity that evolves over decades , if not centuries . 
Its pillars - private , voluntary associations , decentralization of the state , and delegation of political power to independent bodies - must be nurtured patiently and from below . 
Where civil society remains underdeveloped , every problem filters up to the &quot; Big Man &quot; squatting at the top . 
So the more power is concentrated at the center , the more it becomes possible for anti-democratic forces to gain - or regain - control over a country . 
As people around the world encourage the prospect of democracy coming to Egypt and Tunisia , let us not be beguiled by its formal trappings . 
Let us celebrate the arrival in North Africa of the spirit of liberty and of solidarity , which brought Ukraine its liberty once and will do so again . 
And let us pledge that our solidarity does not end at the borders of our nations . 
Freedom - true freedom - is indivisible .
