The Two Faces of Vladimir Putin 
Russia &apos;s split personality - symbolized by its Tsarist coat of arms , a two-headed eagle - has been on open display recently . 
One minute , President Vladimir Putin &apos;s regime is on a charm offensive , desiring a settlement to its six-decade-old territorial dispute with Japan over the Kurile Islands and reassuring investors following the conviction of oil billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
The next moment Putin balks at removing Russia &apos;s military garrison from Moldova &apos;s secessionist Transdniester region while prosecutors talk ominously of putting more oligarchs in the dock . 
Perhaps the greatest display of this political schizophrenia took place last month in Red Square , where a witch &apos;s brew of Red &quot; Victory &quot; flags , tri-color &quot; Imperial &quot; flags , Stalin portraits , and Orthodox icons marched side by side during the 60th anniversary celebration marking WWII &apos;s end . 
Putin took that occasion to repeat his political mantra - &quot; Russia is developing it &apos;s own brand of democracy &quot; - while spurning requests from the Baltic countries that Russia come clean about its deal with Hitler to devour them on WWII &apos;s eve . 
This bizarre brew appears to have been concocted in an effort to reconcile the irreconcilable : the current yearning for democracy with Russia &apos;s despotic past . 
But , like any muddle , it is succeeding only in confusing Russians about themselves and their country . 
Strangely , Putin seems as trapped by this muddle as everybody else . 
At times , Putin truly sees himself as a &quot; modernizer &quot; seeking to root Russia in the West . 
At other times , like Stalin , he believes that Russia &apos;s power requires a strong hand - what he calls his &quot; dictatorship of law . &quot; 
The problem , as Khodorkovsky &apos;s conviction demonstrated , is that dictatorship usually seems to be trumping law . 
Historically , attempts at modernization in Russia , even when they look real , as with Stalin &apos;s industrialization or Yeltsin &apos;s market reforms , ultimately result in a Potemkin village-like state of affairs , because Russian society cannot change fast enough or with the patience necessary to see the changes through . 
So , when Yeltsin &apos;s American-style democratization of the 1990 &quot; s failed to bring &quot; orderly &quot; capitalism instantly , Putin on his accession imposed a restoration of state &quot; order , &quot; as if a stable political or economic system demanded a fusing of the Soviet past with the Orthodox Church and Mother Russia imagery . 
Indeed , Putin &apos;s signature characteristic is to be all men for all Russia &apos;s people . 
By blending the Soviet past with the Tsarist past and a few shards of Yeltsin-era democracy , Putin seems to think that he can neutralize the extremes of Russian history . 
Instead , the extremes seem to be squeezing out the desire for modernization . 
High oil prices now seem to be the only factor allowing Putin to keep the reform charade going . 
The nineteenth-century czar Alexander III once said : &quot; Russia has only two true allies - its army and its navy . &quot; 
Oil is Putin &apos;s army and navy , allowing him to build and maintain the image of a strong , but also an internationalist , state . 
Alexander &apos;s formula is also popular today with Putin &apos;s nationalists in Moscow and St. Petersburg . 
In his pro-imperial Russia film &quot; The Barber of Siberia , &quot; the Oscar-winning director Nikita Mikhalkov - whose father composed the Stalin-era national anthem that Putin recently revived - used the coronation of Alexander III as the symbolic centerpiece of Russia &apos;s greatness , inviting Russian leaders to walk in his footsteps . 
This strong-willed monarch , while ruling the Russian empire autocratically , managed to bring stability and prosperity , allowing capitalism to take root . 
He worked to strengthen and modernize Russia &apos;s armed forces while avoiding armed conflict . 
He became known as &quot; The Peasants &quot; Tsar , &quot; though he didn &apos;t tolerate any opposition thinking contrary to his own . 
Putin sees his own crusade to save Russia from disintegration and separatism as similar to Alexander &apos;s . 
But how forward-looking is it to model a twenty-first-century country on the absolutist example of the past ? 
Stalin is yet another cherished role model . 
Here , too , Putin tries to walk on both sides of the street , calling Koba a tyrant to sooth the wounded feelings the Baltic leaders , yet instantly qualifying his remarks by saying that Stalin was no Hitler . 
Can we really compare the degree of evil of these two men ? 
Despite his insistence on rubbing shoulders with world leaders and portraying himself as a modernizer , Putin , like his predecessors , is in fact a ruler who believes that only authoritarian rule can protect his country from anarchy and disintegration . 
But the old ideas , the mimicry and symbols Putin employs to achieve his goals , no longer correspond to today &apos;s realities or Russia &apos;s present capabilities . 
Previously , it was Russia &apos;s Western mission that was pure Potemkin village . 
Now Russianness itself seems to lack a secure foundation , for it is but a hollow shell of discarded state symbols . 
Like a bad driver , a nation that looks left and right but never ahead is bound to crash .
