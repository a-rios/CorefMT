Europe &apos;s Way Out 
CAMBRIDGE - It seems that austerity is out of fashion in the eurozone - at least for the moment . 
The European Commission has given Spain , France , and the Netherlands more time to comply with the European Union &apos;s 3 % -of-GDP deficit ceiling . 
Even German government officials now concede that something more than fiscal belt-tightening is needed to revive the economies of the eurozone periphery . 
According to the Commission , that &quot; something more &quot; is structural reform : easing of firing restrictions and other labor-markets regulations , liberalization of closed professions , and removal of controls on markets for goods and services . 
But this is merely old wine in a new bottle . 
From the outset of the eurozone crisis , the &quot; troika &quot; ( the Commission , the International Monetary Fund , and the European Central Bank ) insisted on such structural reforms as part of any financial-assistance package . 
Greece , Spain , and the others were told all along that these reforms were needed to spur productivity and competitiveness and help revive growth . 
After three years , Greece &apos;s experience is telling . 
As a new IMF report acknowledges , structural reforms there have failed to produce the intended effects , partly because they ran up against political and implementation difficulties , and partly because their potential to increase growth in the short run was overstated . 
Nor have Spain &apos;s labor-market reforms worked as expected . 
None of this should come as a surprise . 
Structural reform increases productivity in practice through two complementary channels . 
First , low-productivity sectors shed labor . 
Second , high-productivity sectors expand and hire more labor . 
Both processes are needed if the reforms are to increase economy-wide productivity . 
But , when aggregate demand is depressed - as it is in Europe &apos;s periphery - the second mechanism operates weakly , if at all . 
It is easy to see why : making it easier to fire labor or start new businesses has little effect on hiring when firms already have excess capacity and have difficulty finding consumers . 
So all we get is the first effect , and thus an increase in unemployment . 
There is little new in the European Commission &apos;s approach , and few reasons to be optimistic that its &quot; new &quot; strategy will work better than the old one . 
Structural reform - however desirable it may be for the longer term - simply is not a remedy for these countries &quot; short-term growth conundrum . 
The eurozone periphery suffers from both a stock problem and a flow problem . 
It has too large a debt stock , and too little competitiveness to achieve external balance without significant domestic deflation and unemployment . 
What is required is a two-pronged approach that targets both problems simultaneously . 
The prevailing approach - targeting debt through fiscal austerity and competitiveness through structural reform - has produced unemployment levels that threaten social and political stability . 
So , what can be done differently ? 
The most direct way to address the debt problem is a write-down , coupled with recapitalization of those banks that will suffer large losses as a result . 
This may seem extreme , but it simply recognizes the reality that much of the existing debt will not be paid back without new flows of official financing . 
As the IMF now acknowledges , it might have been better to restructure Greek debts from the outset than to engage in a &quot; holding operation . &quot; 
Debt reduction by itself clears the way for growth , but does not directly trigger it . 
Policies that directly target expenditure rebalancing within the eurozone and expenditure switching within the peripheral economies are also needed . 
These include : policies to boost eurozone-wide demand and stimulate greater spending in creditor countries , especially Germany ; policies that aim to reduce non-tradable prices ; income policies to reduce the peripheral economies &quot; private-sector wages in a coordinated fashion ; and a higher ECB inflation target to allow room for movement in the real exchange rate via nominal changes . 
These policies would require Germany to accept higher inflation and explicit bank losses , which assumes that Germans can embrace a different narrative about the nature of the crisis . 
And that means that German leaders must portray the crisis not as a morality play pitting lazy , profligate southerners against hard-working , frugal northerners , but as a crisis of interdependence in an economic ( and nascent political ) union . 
Germans must play as big a role in resolving the crisis as they did in instigating it . 
France will most likely play a critical role as well . 
France is big enough that if it threw its support fully behind the peripheral countries , Germany would be isolated and would need to respond . 
But , so far , France remains eager to separate itself from the southern countries , in order to avoid being dragged down with them in financial markets . 
Ultimately , a workable European economic union does require greater structural homogeneity and institutional convergence ( especially in labor markets ) among its members . 
So the German argument contains a kernel of validity : In the long run , EU countries need to look more like one another if they want to inhabit the same house . 
But the eurozone faces a short-term problem that is much more Keynesian in nature , and for which longer-term structural remedies are ineffective at best and harmful at worst . 
Too much focus on structural problems , at the expense of Keynesian policies , will make the long run unachievable - and hence irrelevant .
