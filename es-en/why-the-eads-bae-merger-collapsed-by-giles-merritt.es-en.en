Europe &apos;s Non-Deal of the Century 
BRUSSELS - As Europe picks over the ruins of the mega-merger that would have created a world-beating new aerospace and defense giant , questions are being asked about the inglorious role that the European Union played in the fiasco . 
The European Commission &apos;s failure to champion the $ 50 billion merger of the Franco-German European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company ( EADS ) , owner of Airbus , and the United Kingdom &apos;s BAE Systems is being seen as a crucial factor in the deal &apos;s collapse . 
The integration of the two high-tech aviation and avionics leaders had looked like an EU-inspired blueprint for industrial success . 
For several years , EU leaders have been urging the consolidation of Europe &apos;s defense industries , so the proposed deal - which originated in the corporate boardrooms of EADS and BAE Systems - looked like an answer to their calls . 
Yet both the Commission and the European Parliament kept silent and withheld the political support that might have ensured that the deal went through . 
A timely reminder by EU leaders of the strategic importance of the aerospace sector would have helped allay many of the misgivings in Berlin , and to a lesser degree in London , that ultimately sank the deal . 
Aviation , like defense , is the sharpest of the R D cutting edges available to advanced countries , and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs . 
Nationalist squabbles over the details of the merger would surely have been attenuated by a statesmanlike intervention from the Commission in Brussels . 
It was therefore a bizarre coincidence that the merger &apos;s collapse came on the day that the Commission unveiled its new industrial strategy for regaining Europe &apos;s competitive edge in the face of Asian and North American competition . 
One of the most powerful arguments for the EADS-BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market , while also creating a powerful new defense industry . 
That scenario now looks all the more likely . 
Why , then , did the European Commission remain silent ? 
The answer appears to be that it feared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the merger talks , and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public rebuff . 
The persistent rumor circulating among defense company executives is that soon after news of the proposed merger leaked , the weekly commissioners &quot; meeting chaired by Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso was enjoined to keep silent on the matter in order to avoid any potential dangers . 
Whether true or not , the important point is that the merger transcended national considerations , and the European Commission had a duty to involve itself . 
The EU &apos;s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind Europe &apos;s efforts to revive laggard industries and fight to reverse the long-term economic decline that the eurozone crisis appears to presage . 
Nobody is arguing that the Commission is responsible for the deal &apos;s unhappy end - only that it should have rallied support for it . 
The significance of the merger &apos;s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across Europe , especially in Germany , where the media have been extremely critical of how &quot; negative politics &quot; sealed the proposed merger &apos;s fate . 
With the EU in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign-debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision-making architecture , the collapse of the EADS-BAE merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books . 
But it may be said to mark the point when the European Commission openly acknowledged that it has become little more than a secretariat to EU governments . 
That is a far cry from the political powerhouse that some Europeans fear - and for which others still hope .
