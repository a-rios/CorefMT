To the Brink and Back with Iran 
GENEVA - The trouble with brinkmanship of the type now being played out over Iran &apos;s nuclear program is that it is so easy to fall over the cliff . 
At the first two rounds of new talks between Iran and the P5 + 1 ( the five permanent United Nations Security Council members plus Germany ) , in Istanbul in April and Baghdad in May , both sides still at least stumbled along the edge of the precipice . 
Now , after the third round in Moscow , they are holding on by not much more than their fingernails . 
Neither side has been prepared to compromise on any substantive issue . 
They did agree - barely ­ - to hold a low-level experts meeting in early July , but no one expects this to lead to a breakthrough . 
By then , new European and American sanctions on Iranian oil exports will be in force , and the United States Congress is pushing to apply more , with influential voices there arguing that the negotiation game is over . 
War talk is still close to the surface in Israel , and anxiety is mounting that , in the highly charged political climate of a US election year , escalation might not be containable . 
Although the two sides &quot; negotiating positions throughout the current series of talks have not been as far apart as in the past , their core demands have so far proved irreconcilable . 
The six world powers are currently insisting on three things . 
First , Iran must halt all enrichment of uranium to 20 % purity ( a level required for research reactors , but only a short step away , in practical terms , from weapons-grade uranium ) . 
Second , Iran must swap its existing 20 % stockpile for fuel capable of use only in the Tehran Research Reactor or for some other manifestly peaceful purpose . 
The final demand is that Iran shut down its highly-protected underground enrichment facility at Fordow , near Qom . 
In return for all of this , no new sanctions would be imposed , and access to aircraft spare parts would be eased . 
But Iran wants more : at a minimum , formal recognition of its &quot; inalienable right to enrich &quot; uranium , no shutdown of any existing facility , and the removal , in significant part , of the many sanctions that have been imposed upon it ( for refusing to comply with Security Council resolutions requiring it to suspend all enrichment activity ) . 
There are several sub-texts underlying the current stand-off , superbly analyzed in a report this month from the International Crisis Group . 
On the P5 + 1 side , certainly in the minds of US officials and their European partners , there has been a perception that Iran is reeling under the sanctions - unable to cope with more and desperate for relief - and deeply fearful of an imminent Israeli military strike . 
But Iran sees the West - in the context of the economic turmoil in Europe , and President Barack Obama &apos;s effort to win re-election - as desperate to avoid a conflict that would send oil prices rocketing . 
Its leaders feel their own bargaining position strengthened by the country &apos;s new facilities and stockpiles , and , while hurt by sanctions , too much pride is at stake ever to surrender in the face of them . 
The reality is that each side is exaggerating its own strengths and the other &apos;s weaknesses . 
In particular , the global powers are underestimating Iran &apos;s resilience , and Iran is overestimating the ability of the US , in an election year , to curb possible Israeli military adventurism . 
Some modification of their respective positions is necessary . 
There is no doubt that Iran - with its long history of secrecy and dissimulation - deserves the intense hostility and distrust that its nuclear program continues to engender . 
But the most common view of security and intelligence experts worldwide is that , while Iran may want the technical breakout capability to build a nuclear weapon that Japan now has , it is still a long way from building a usable atomic weapon , and has made no decision to do so . 
Indeed , Iran &apos;s leaders , weighing the costs and benefits , have plenty of good reasons not to cross that red line . 
But those assessments will prove to be naïve unless Iran , at the very least , verifiably suspends any enrichment beyond 5 % , renders its 20 % stockpile incapable of military application , and meets the concern about Fordow by modifying its role and opening it to intrusive monitoring . 
In return , the P5 + 1 must be prepared to modify significantly its own current bottom-line demands , regardless of the political difficulties that this will entail , not least for Obama in an election year . 
The global powers should openly acknowledge that - whether one likes it or not , and whether it is good policy or not - the legally correct position under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is that Iran does have a right to enrich uranium for purely civilian purposes . 
And , even more important , the P5 + 1 must be prepared not only to disavow new sanctions , but to wind back existing ones as Iran takes each of the reasonable steps required of it . 
That way lies not accommodation with the devil , but recognition that the current situation is unsustainable ; inflammatory confrontation is closer than we think ; and catastrophe can be averted only by cool , level-headed diplomacy of the kind that , until now , has been in unhappily short supply .
