The Long March from the Third Plenum 
BEIJING - Though China &apos;s leadership succession was completed earlier this year , the policy agenda for the coming decade has only just been revealed . 
Following Chinese political tradition , the country &apos;s new leadership had to wait for the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s 18th Central Committee - held 3-4 quarters after the First Plenum , where the succession was sealed - to unveil its economic-policy priorities . 
Third Plenums - and perhaps only Third Plenums - can bring about radical transformation . 
Indeed , it was at the Third Plenum of the CCP &apos;s 11th Central Committee that Deng Xiaoping launched the reforms that opened up the Chinese economy and triggered more than three decades of rapid economic growth . 
The Third Plenums of the CCP &apos;s 14th and 16th Central Committees - held in 1993 and 2003 , respectively - also stand out . 
At both meetings , CCP leaders put forward comprehensive plans for the creation and perfection of the so-called &quot; socialist market economy &quot; in China . 
The 60-point &quot; resolution &quot; produced at the most recent Third Plenum covers six areas : the economy , the political system , the environment , culture , society , and Party capacity-building . 
This represents a significant departure from the agendas produced at previous Third Plenums , which focused exclusively on economic reform . 
But , when it comes to economic-reform objectives , the resolution is not overwhelmingly innovative . 
Indeed , most of the goals that it includes - like reform of state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , development of private enterprise , reduction of government intervention , protection of property rights , and creation of a modern market system - can be found in the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CCP &apos;s 16th Central Committee . 
Even the decision to redefine the market &apos;s role in resource allocation as &quot; decisive &quot; was not the breakthrough that many observers have claimed . 
After all , the 2003 resolution had already defined the market as &quot; fundamental &quot; to resource allocation . 
Given this , the latest resolution &apos;s most important implication is that it has dispelled any doubt about the new leadership &apos;s commitment to the market-oriented reform that Deng initiated in 1978 . 
In line with tradition , the Third Plenum &apos;s resolution did not discuss problems concerning growth and development , which one hopes the government will address in greater detail in the near future . 
That said , some of the resolution &apos;s specific provisions for economic reform represent much-needed progress . 
· SOEs will be required to deliver 30 % of their profits to the state , instead of keeping most - or even all - of their profits , as they have done for the last two decades . 
· Farmers will be granted more property rights , allowing them , for example , to transfer and mortgage land-use rights , though the government understandably continues to exercise caution about rural-land privatization . 
· A real-estate property tax will be introduced , in order to suppress skyrocketing housing prices and reduce the vacancy rate - a controversial but perhaps necessary move . 
· The one-child policy will be eased , allowing a couple to have two children if one parent is an only child . 
( Whether this change will be enough to reverse problematic demographic trends remains a topic of heated debate . ) 
· The government will &quot; accelerate the reform of the household registration system , &quot; in an effort to facilitate urbanization . 
But emphasis seems to have shifted to encourage coordinated development between urban and rural areas . 
While rural migrant workers will be encouraged to settle in small and medium-size cities , migration to metropolises will remain tightly controlled - or even be more strictly regulated . 
But the resolution &apos;s genuinely groundbreaking objectives lie in other areas . 
For starters , the resolution includes two potentially game-changing legal reforms . 
First , it emphasizes the government &apos;s commitment to &quot; respect and protect human rights , &quot; prohibiting law-enforcement authorities from extracting confessions &quot; by torture , corporal punishment , or abuse &quot; and abolishing widely criticized programs for &quot; re-education through the labor system . &quot; 
Second , in order to strengthen judicial independence , the resolution includes a call &quot; to explore the establishment of judicial jurisdiction systems that are suitably separated from administrative areas . &quot; 
In other words , the courts should be able to make decisions independently of the local governments that finance them . 
In the political realm , the resolution includes measures to strengthen China &apos;s so-called &quot; consultative democracy . &quot; 
While the concept of enhancing the role of non-CCP forces in Chinese politics is not new , its prominence in the resolution reflects the Party &apos;s willingness to adopt a more democratic political system - as long as it retains its dominant position , of course . 
In a one-party system , meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance , which in turn plays a central role in maintaining social stability . 
Unfortunately , meritocracy has been eroded by a political culture of sycophancy and cynicism . 
Designing a screening mechanism to minimize adverse selection in choosing bureaucrats and party officials has become one of the biggest challenges that China &apos;s ruling elites confront . 
Although the resolution &apos;s general message is encouraging , a shopping list of reform objectives is not a strategic analysis of the contradictions that are undermining China &apos;s development , let alone an action plan for responding to these contradictions . 
Indeed , for China &apos;s new leadership , the successful completion of the Third Plenum is only the first step in a new long march toward a more stable , prosperous future .
