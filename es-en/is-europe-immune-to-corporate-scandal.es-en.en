Is Europe Immune to Corporate Scandal ? 
The recent $ 1.4bn settlement between Wall Street &apos;s top investment houses and the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) epitomizes the distorted incentives and regulatory failures that underlay the string of spectacular corporate failures seen in America in recent years . 
The admission that securities analysts deliberately skewed their research to attract investment-banking customers shows how easily the proper functioning of checks and balances in corporate governance can break down-even in the most advanced system-leaving minority shareholders at risk . 
Managers , after all , are imperialists by nature , inclined to undertake massive investment projects , mergers , and acquisitions . 
So investment banks are only too willing to play along . 
Rising share prices facilitate managerial empire-building and imply a massive windfall for insiders with stock options . 
So managers are quick to embrace &quot; aggressive &quot; or &quot; creative &quot; accounting methods that flatters earnings projections , conceals risks , and portrays a smooth record of profit growth . 
Finally , managers , not distant shareholders , control access to well-paid appointments and lucrative consulting jobs . 
So internal and external auditors are often co-opted . 
To be sure , the US corporate and securities scandals exposed regulatory gaps-insufficient enforcement of disclosure requirements , for example , or excessive reliance on peer review for auditors and on so-called &quot; Chinese Walls &quot; to keep brokerage and investment-banking activities separate . 
Moreover , US accounting standards have been unable to cope with bookkeeping &apos;s uncharted frontiers of off-balance sheet transactions , structured financing methods , and Byzantine contract valuations . 
The deeper question is whether these problems are limited to the US , and whether they reflect America &apos;s characteristic diffuse structure of corporate ownership . 
Diffuse ownership , with a large number of relatively small shareholders entrusting day-to-day company operations to independent managers , prevails in the US and the UK . 
Concentrated ownership , with one or more controlling shareholders , prevails in continental Europe ( and , indeed , in the rest of the world ) . 
In the past decade , it became fashionable to extol the superiority of the Anglo-Saxon model , with its supposed virtuous circle of diffuse ownership and strong protection for distant shareholders . 
But it was the US economy &apos;s rapid growth and booming stock market that made American-style ownership look so good in the 1990 &apos;s , just as impressive growth once had everyone cooing over the German and Japanese models of corporate ownership and governance . 
Some of the few European corporate failures similar to those in the US have occurred in American-style companies-Vivendi in France or Marconi in Britain-with no controlling shareholder to monitor the company . 
Of course , European-style concentrated ownership carries its own costs for investors . 
Control enables the majority shareholder to extract revenues and wealth from the company at the expense of minority owners . 
Even leaving aside perks and privileges , majority shareholders can appropriate private benefits through transactions with other companies that they own , such as transfer pricing and privileged credit relations . 
Moreover , concentrated corporate ownership impedes the growth of equity markets , making it difficult for smaller shareholders to sell . 
But the ownership structure prevailing in a country depends largely on factors other than the legal regime of investor protection : it may be endogenous to the country &apos;s industrial structure . 
More importantly , there is no single optimal corporate ownership model that lawmakers and regulators should strive to achieve . 
Convergence on a particular model of corporate ownership and governance is a myth . 
Instead , lawmakers and regulators should focus on providing better protection to minority investors , whether the threat comes primarily from managers , as in diffuse ownership systems , or from controlling shareholders , as in concentrated ownership systems . 
The reaction to the wave of corporate scandals in the US-and hence to the blatant failure of self-regulation-has been admirably swift . 
Within a few months , the US Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , the most comprehensive securities legislation since the SEC &apos;s establishment in 1934 . 
Moreover , the SEC itself has been redrafting and updating its regulations , while equities markets have revisited their listing rules . 
Regardless of whether the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other initiatives prevent new types of financial excess , they will almost certainly strengthen shareholder protection and set higher standards for other jurisdictions . 
Where concentrated ownership prevails , as in Europe , regulators should pay particular attention to companies &apos; transactions with related parties , ensuring full disclosure and setting stringent limits on controllers &apos; insider dealings . 
Similarly , when there is a controlling shareholder , a certain number of seats on boards and audit committees should be explicitly reserved for directors representing minority shareholders . 
On the other hand , before the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation , European regulation was ahead of the US in some areas . 
The principles enshrined in the International Accounting Standards-to be adopted by all EU listed companies by 2005-being more general , with substance prevailing over form , are more easily adaptable to financial innovation than US accounting standards . 
In some European jurisdictions , regulators supervise and sanction internal and external auditors , and disclosure of price-sensitive information is mandated as a general principle rather than as a response to specific events . 
There have even been efforts to regulate analysts &apos; reports . 
The corporate failures of recent years provide a sobering lesson for all-a brutal public reminder of problems that political leaders forgot or conveniently ignored . 
Renewed awareness that even seemingly strong protections for minority shareholders can be illusory has created a window of opportunity for undertaking necessary reforms . 
To accomplish this , in Europe no less than in the US , our focus must remain squarely on maintaining the confidence of minority investors .
