Innocent Bystanders 
SANTIAGO - Take a taxi in São Paulo nowadays and you will experience the maddening traffic and untidy streets of an emerging-country metropolis . 
But when the time comes to pay for the ride , you may feel like you are in Boston , Luxemburg , or Zurich : the value of the Brazilian real , like the currencies of many emerging-market countries , is high - and could go higher . 
Strong currencies make strong countries , a senior United States policymaker used to say . 
Many emerging-country exporters , struggling to retain customers in the wobbly US and European markets , feel otherwise . 
For decades , developing countries dreamed of a nirvana of sky-high commodity prices and rock-bottom international interest rates . 
But perhaps finance ministers in Lima , Bogota , Pretoria , or Jakarta should have been more careful about what they wished for . 
The problem ? 
An invasion of short-term capital flows fleeing the slow-growth , low-interest-rate advanced countries . 
Meeting in Calgary last month , the Inter-American Development Bank reported that $ 266 billion entered Latin America &apos;s seven largest economies in 2010 , compared to less than $ 50 billion a year , on average , between 2000 and 2005 . 
And while only 37 % of inflows in 2006 were &quot; hot money &quot; that can leave at a moment &apos;s notice , last year such inflows accounted for 69 % of the total . 
So , what is going on ? 
Emerging countries in Latin America , East Asia , Eastern Europe , and Africa are innocent bystanders in the tussle between the US and China over currencies and trade imbalances . 
And the bystanders are absorbing some of the hardest blows . 
For a decade now , the world economy has suffered from tremendous global imbalances : massive external surpluses in countries like China , Japan , Germany , Switzerland , and the oil producers , matched by equally large external deficits in the US , the United Kingdom , Spain , and others . 
The imbalances were reduced temporarily as the global financial crisis caused private demand to drop in the US , the UK , and elsewhere . 
But , starting in 2010 , the imbalances returned , and , according to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s recently released World Economic Outlook , they will not shrink between now and 2016 . 
G-20 communiqués have repeatedly pledged to secure &quot; adjustment &quot; and &quot; rebalancing &quot; in the world economy , but those promises have come to nothing . 
Still-troubled financial systems and huge fiscal deficits are keeping the West &apos;s deficit countries ( especially the US ) from expanding domestic demand . 
And an unwillingness to trade away export-led growth is having the same effect on the East &apos;s surplus countries ( especially China ) . 
As a result , emerging countries , according to the IMF , have been pressed to carry &quot; a disproportionate burden of demand rebalancing since the crisis . &quot; 
Countries running surpluses accumulate massive stocks of foreign assets , and those resources have to be invested somewhere . 
Before the crisis , a substantial amount of that money was invested in US , Spanish , or Irish real estate . 
Today , that market is dead and the money must go elsewhere . 
Europe , gripped by a tremendous banking and debt crisis , is not an attractive destination , and loose monetary policy in the US has produced ultra-low bond yields there . 
As a result , many emerging countries , with their higher interest rates and promising growth prospects , have become irresistibly attractive to investors . 
After recent events in Tunisia , Egypt , and Libya , Wall Street analysts are waxing somewhat less optimistically about political stability in emerging countries . 
And a flat 2011 performance in some Latin American and Asian equity markets - following tremendous runs in 2010 - has taken a bit of sheen off the emerging-market investment fad . 
But the money keeps coming . 
This dollar invasion is making macroeconomic management in emerging countries even more challenging than usual . 
If high commodity prices are expected to persist , then some strengthening of currencies is both desirable and inevitable . 
But a thin line separates orderly adjustment to changed conditions from market over-reaction . 
Loss of export competitiveness as a result of excessively strong currencies is not the only problem . 
Massive capital inflows caused real-estate and stock-market bubbles in the US and parts of Europe . 
Today , some policymakers in Latin America , worried that the same thing could happen to their countries , are casting about for policy tools to prevent it . 
As a result , the US Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of so-called &quot; quantitative easing &quot; is going south , where it takes the form of foreign-exchange intervention . 
If rich-country central banks can buy long term bonds , then emerging-country central banks can buy dollar-denominated bonds . 
Even countries that practice inflation targeting and have otherwise vowed to let their exchange rates float - Brazil , Colombia , Peru , and Chile , for example - have done it , and in large quantities . 
Expect macroprudential policies to go south , too - and to be redefined in the process . 
If buying dollars is not sufficient to stem the appreciation tide , regulators in emerging economies will erect an array of other barriers to keep money out . 
None of these policies is without costs . 
They are second-best local-policy responses to an ineffective mechanism for international adjustment ( or non-adjustment ) . 
A better system to rebalance the world economy is as necessary as it is unlikely . 
All we can look forward to is the next G-20 communiqué .
