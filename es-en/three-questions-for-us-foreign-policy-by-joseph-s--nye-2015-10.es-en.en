Which Way for US Foreign Policy ? 
BANGALORE - When US President Barack Obama recently spoke at the United Nations about countering the Islamic State , many of his critics complained that he put too much emphasis on diplomacy and not enough on the use of force . 
Comparisons were made with Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s military intervention in Syria &apos;s civil war ; and , with the US presidential election campaign shifting into high gear , some Republican candidates accused Obama of isolationism . 
But such charges are partisan political rhetoric , with little basis in rigorous policy analysis . 
It is more accurate to see the current mood as a swing of the US foreign policy pendulum between what Columbia University &apos;s Stephen Sestanovich has called &quot; maximalist &quot; policies and &quot; retrenchment &quot; policies . 
Retrenchment is not isolationism ; it is an adjustment of strategic goals and means . 
Presidents who followed policies of retrenchment since the end of World War II have included Dwight Eisenhower , Richard Nixon , Jimmy Carter , and now Obama . 
No objective historian would call any of these men isolationists . 
Eisenhower ran for president in 1952 because he opposed the isolationism of Robert Taft , the leading Republican candidate . 
While Nixon believed the US was in decline , the others did not . 
All of them were strong internationalists when compared to the true isolationists of the 1930s , who bitterly opposed coming to the aid of Britain in WWII . 
Historians can make a credible case that periods of maximalist over-commitment have done more damage to America &apos;s place in the world than periods of retrenchment . 
Domestic political reaction to Woodrow Wilson &apos;s global idealism produced the intense isolationism that delayed America &apos;s response to Hitler . 
The escalation of the war in Vietnam under Presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson produced the inward-looking turn of the 1970s . 
If that mood is to become an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign , as early campaign rhetoric suggests , Americans should drop the false debate about isolationism and instead address three fundamental questions about the future of the country &apos;s foreign policy : How much ? 
How interventionist ? 
The first question is how much the US should spend on defense and foreign policy . 
Although some argue that America has no choice but to curtail its outlays in these areas , this is not the case . 
As a share of GDP , the US is spending less than half of what it did at the peak of the Cold War , when the century of American leadership was being consolidated . 
The problem is not guns vs. butter , but guns vs. butter vs. taxes . 
Without a willingness to raise revenues , defense expenditure is locked in a zero-sum tradeoff with important investments such as education , infrastructure , and research and development - all of which are crucial to America &apos;s domestic strength and global position . 
The second question concerns how and in what ways the US should become involved in other countries &quot; internal affairs . 
Obama has said that America should use military force , unilaterally if necessary , when its security or that of its allies is threatened . 
When not , but conscience urges the country to act - against , say , a dictator killing a large number of his citizens - the US should not intervene alone and should use force only if there is a good prospect of success . 
These are reasonable principles , but what are the thresholds ? 
The problem is not new . 
Nearly two centuries ago , John Quincy Adams , America &apos;s sixth president , was wrestling with domestic demands for intervention in the Greek war for independence when he famously said that the US &quot; goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy . &quot; 
The US should stay out of the business of invasion and occupation . 
In an age of nationalism and socially mobilized populations , foreign occupation , as Eisenhower wisely concluded in the 1950s , is bound to breed resentment . 
But what takes its place ? 
Particularly in the Middle East , where revolutions are likely to last for a generation , a smart combination of hard and soft power will be difficult to achieve . 
Recent speeches by the US presidential candidates show that debate about the first two questions has already begun . 
How can America bolster institutions , create networks , and establish policies for managing transnational issues ? 
Leadership by the most powerful country is important for the production of global public goods . 
Unfortunately , America &apos;s domestic political gridlock often blocks this . 
For example , the US Senate has failed to ratify the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , despite its being in America &apos;s national interest - indeed , the US needs the convention to support its position on how to resolve competing territorial claims in the South China Sea . 
Similarly , Congress failed to fulfill an American commitment to support the reallocation of voting power within the International Monetary Fund to emerging-market countries , though doing so would cost very little . 
This paved the way for China to launch its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( which the US then mistakenly tried to block , at considerable cost to its reputation . ) 
And there is strong Congressional resistance to setting limits on carbon emissions in the run-up to the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in December . 
How much to spend on foreign affairs and how to intervene in distant crises are important questions . 
How can the US maintain global leadership if other countries see Congress constantly blocking international cooperation ? 
That debate has yet to begin .
