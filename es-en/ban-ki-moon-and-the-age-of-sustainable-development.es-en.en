Ban Ki-moon and the Age of Sustainable Development 
NEW YORK - The world can breathe easier with the reelection this month of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to a second term in office . 
In a fractious world , global unity is especially vital . 
During the past five years , Ban Ki-moon has embodied that unity , both in his unique personal diplomacy and in his role as head of this indispensable global organization . 
Winning re-election to lead the UN is no straightforward matter . 
As head of an organization of 192 member states , the Secretary-General inevitably feels the powerful crosscurrents of global divisions . 
On almost any issue , the Secretary-General is likely to find himself between contending groups of countries . 
Yet Ban has inspired global confidence in his leadership to the point of securing an uncontested and unanimous second mandate . 
The consensus in favor of Ban &apos;s re-election is all the more striking because it includes the so-called P-5 , the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the United States , the United Kingdom , China , France , and Russia . 
These five powerful countries owe their UN pre-eminence to the post-World War II settlement , when they were allies in victory . 
Under the UN Charter , all five must endorse the election of every Secretary-General . 
Ban Ki-moon has maintained the strong backing of all five permanent members . 
I have the honor to serve as the Secretary-General &apos;s Special Adviser on the Millennium Development Goals . 
In that capacity , I see the Secretary-General in action in all parts of the world . 
It is a rewarding experience , one that gives me great hope for ultimate success in resolving global problems such as poverty , environmental threats , and violent conflict . 
The world &apos;s many problems make their way to the Secretary-General &apos;s office day and night . 
Whether the issues are war and peace ; revolutions and coups ; natural disasters ; epidemics ; disputed elections ; or the grinding challenges of hunger , poverty , climate change , and mass migration , the crises inevitably demand the Secretary-General &apos;s attention . 
It is a workload that boggles the mind , and demands the round-the-clock commitment of the Secretary-General and his team . 
During a recent trip with Ban to Egypt and Tunisia , I watched in awe as he deftly backed the democratic changes underway in those two countries while simultaneously dealing with many other upheavals in the region . 
Ban generously and inspiringly offered his support to the brave youth leaders in both countries who are at the forefront of the political changes set in motion this year . 
From his first days in office , Ban emphasized that many or most of the world &apos;s greatest challenges come down to a simple yet stark reality : we are now a crowded , interconnected , global society , with seven billion people struggling to find a foothold on a highly vulnerable planet . 
The challenges of feeding the world , keeping it safe from epidemic diseases such as malaria and AIDS , and combining economic progress with local and global environmental safety are the defining challenges of our time . 
War and violence often have as underlying causes hunger , poverty , and environmental degradation , such as human-induced climate change . 
We are , in short , in a new global era , which may be defined as the Age of Sustainable Development , in which our security , even our survival , will depend on the world forging a triple commitment : to end extreme poverty ; to ensure human rights for all ; and to protect the natural environment from human-induced crises of climate change , destruction of biodiversity , and depletion of fresh-water reserves and other vital resources . 
Ban has tirelessly emphasized the need to put sustainable development at the center of our thinking . 
The challenges of poverty , resource depletion , climate change , and human rights will dominate Ban &apos;s second term , and the work of those who will follow him as Secretary-General . 
In 2012 , world governments will reunite in Rio de Janeiro , 20 years after the historic conference at which they signed the first comprehensive treaty to fight human-induced climate change . 
Far too little has been accomplished since , and , behind the scenes , Ban is working relentlessly to clear the bottlenecks and avert climate disaster . 
At the start of the third millennium , Ban &apos;s predecessor , Kofi Annan , brought the world &apos;s leaders together to adopt the Millennium Development Goals , which established ambitious targets to be achieved in the fight against poverty , hunger , and disease by 2015 . 
Ban has been a tireless champion of the MDGs , and has initiated several highly creative campaigns to enlarge worldwide engagement with them . 
This past year , for example , Ban launched a bold new global initiative , &quot; Every Mother , Every Child , &quot; to improve health care for women and children . 
He has championed the fight against HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria , bringing many global leaders and public figures to the cause . 
Under Ban &apos;s leadership , remarkable progress is being made , though as he emphasizes , even faster progress is both possible and needed . 
In 2015 , the Secretary-General will help guide the world towards even bolder commitments in the fight to end extreme poverty and deprivation in the coming two decades . 
There is a great personal satisfaction in Ban &apos;s own story , one that gives hope for all . 
When Ban travels to Africa &apos;s impoverished regions , he mingles with villagers and recounts his own upbringing amid the poverty and deprivation of Korea in the 1950 &quot; s - and how , by committing itself to hard work , education , modern science , and shared values , South Korea became one of the world &apos;s richest and most successful countries . 
Ban &apos;s rise from poverty to global leadership parallels his country &apos;s trajectory . 
It is a story of decency , commitment , and generosity that has won global confidence , and that can help to guide the world at a time of unprecedented risks and unique opportunities .
