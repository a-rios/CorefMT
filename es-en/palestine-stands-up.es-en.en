Palestine Stands Up 
JERUSALEM - Although the crisis over Israel &apos;s naval interventions to defend its blockade of Gaza is gaining all the headlines around the world , something of far more historic importance is taking place in the Middle East . 
The Palestine National Authority is preparing to issue a unilateral declaration of independence , and it is taking concrete steps on the ground to make any such declaration viable . 
When US President Barack Obama appointed former Senator George Mitchell as his special envoy for Middle East peace negotiations , Mitchell &apos;s mandate was to achieve within two years not only an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians , but also overall peace between the Jewish state and the whole Arab world . 
But , after 15 months on the job , and innumerable visits to the region , all Mitchell has to show for his efforts is an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority to start indirect &quot; proximity talks &quot; - which it is hoped will lead to direct talks in due course . 
When one bears in mind that both sides have been negotiating directly for 15 years , Mitchell &apos;s achievement appears even more minuscule . 
Under such circumstances , calling Mitchell &apos;s work up to now a failure is the only polite - and realistic - thing to do . 
It is as easy to blame Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s intransigence - his enforcement of the Gaza blockade , for example - as it is to point out that the Palestinian Authority does not control Hamas-ruled Gaza , with its 1.2 million inhabitants , leaving it in no position to speak authoritatively for Palestinians . 
As a result , one thing that both Israelis and Palestinians agree on is that the proximity talks will most likely lead nowhere , so both sides are currently busy ensuring that the other side will be blamed for the failure . 
On too many issues - borders , settlements , refugees , Jerusalem - the gaps between the two sides are too deep to be easily bridged . 
In these circumstances , an idea recently raised - tentatively but courageously - by Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad should be eagerly welcomed . 
It may or may not fly , but it is arrestingly novel : if negotiations fail - so Fayyad says - sometime in 2011 the Palestinians should declare independence unilaterally . 
This may be a real game changer . 
Obviously , it would not resolve the conflict ; it might not even immediately change the situation on the ground . 
Indeed , it could even precipitate some unforeseen Israeli countermeasures . 
But it would certainly mean a paradigm shift for a conflict in which everyone has been treading water for almost two decades . 
If the Palestinians declared independence unilaterally , and if , as is expected , some sort of recognition by at least some states followed , the contours of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would change dramatically . 
Indeed , the conflict would become , if one can use the expression , more &quot; normal &quot; - no longer between an occupying power and an occupied people , but between two countries , two states , that disagree about a lot of issues , including borders , mutual relations , and control over populations . 
In a way , a unilateral declaration of independence would make the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a bit more like the Israeli-Syrian conflict - an inter-state conflict . 
It might even force Israel to make decisions that until now it found easier to avoid . 
Such a declaration would also be an enormous act of self-empowerment for the Palestinians . 
Until now , they have failed abysmally in institutional nation-building , a necessary requirement for any successful national movement . 
Palestinian nationalism is deeply ingrained in the consciousness of most Palestinians - yet , since 1948 , when the United Nations proposed partitioning British Palestine into two states , a Jewish and an Arab one , it has failed to move from ideology towards reality . 
Neither violence nor terrorism nor relying on outside powers ( the UN , the Arab League , the Soviet Union , the US , the European Union ) succeeded in delivering statehood , which a people can achieve only by its own agency - what Zionist ideology calls &quot; auto-emancipation . &quot; 
Fayyad is the first Palestinian leader who did not emerge from the Fatah movement , and he may thus understand what other Palestinian leaders failed to comprehend , mired as they were in a toxic combination of self-righteous ideology and violence . 
It may just be that the Palestinians are on the verge of a new chapter in their history - and in the history of Israel and the whole region as well .
