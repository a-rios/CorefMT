Truth , Lies , and Venezuela 
CAMBRIDGE - Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has a problem with me again . 
The government-controlled national television station recently broadcast an illegally taped private phone conversation in which I proposed a study to explore how to rescue the Venezuelan economy by leveraging the support of the international community . 
The government unsuccessfully edited the recording to make what was said sound nefarious , lied about the conversation &apos;s meaning and about me , and plans to prosecute me . 
This got me thinking about the eternal problem of evil . 
Is it entirely relative , or are there objective grounds to characterize a behavior or act as evil ? 
Do all confrontations occur between legitimate parties - with , say , one person &apos;s terrorist being another &apos;s freedom fighter - or can we say that some fights really are between good and evil ? 
As the son of Holocaust survivors , I have always had an intuitive aversion to moral relativism . 
But what objective grounds are there to say that the Nazis were evil ? 
As Hannah Arendt famously pointed out , people like Adolf Eichmann were plentiful and &quot; neither perverted nor sadistic &quot; ; rather , &quot; they were , and still are , terribly and terrifyingly normal . &quot; 
A similar normality emerges from Thomas Harding &apos;s portrait of Rudolf Höss , the commandant of Auschwitz , a man proud of having excelled at his assigned task . 
So what do we mean by evil in the first place ? 
Moral philosophy has taken two very different approaches to this question . 
For some , the goal is to find universal principles from which to derive moral judgments : Kant &apos;s categorical imperative , Bentham &apos;s utilitarian principle , and John Rawls &apos;s veil of ignorance are some of the best-known examples . 
For others , the key is to understand why we have moral sentiments in the first place . 
Why have our brains evolved to generate feelings of empathy , disgust , indignation , solidarity , and pity ? 
David Hume and Adam Smith pioneered this way of thinking , which eventually spawned the fields of evolutionary and moral psychology . 
According to this latter view , moral sentiments evolved to sustain human cooperation . 
We are programmed by our genes to feel concern for babies and empathy for people in pain . 
We seek others &quot; recognition and avoid their rejection . 
We feel better about ourselves when we do good and worse when we do bad . 
These are the underpinnings of our unconscious moral sense . 
As a consequence , I doubt that any modern society has ever broadly supported what they saw as evil . 
Events like the Holocaust or the genocides in Ukraine ( 1932-1933 ) , Cambodia ( 1975-1979 ) , or Rwanda ( 1994 ) have been based either on secrecy or on the dissemination of a distorted worldview designed to make evil appear good . 
Nazi propaganda blamed Jews for everything : Germany &apos;s defeat in World War I , universal moral values that prevented the Aryan race from exerting its superiority , and both communism and capitalism . 
Ukrainians were accused of being Polish spies , kulaks , Trotskyites , and whatever else Stalin could invent . 
The spread of evil requires lies , because lies form the basis of the worldview that makes evil seem good . 
But the dependence of big evil on big lies gives us a chance to fight back . 
The biologist Martin Nowak has argued that the only way humans have been able to sustain cooperation is by developing cheap ways to punish misbehavior . 
To discourage A from hurting B , the reaction of C can be important , because if A knows that C will punish him for what he does to B , he might think twice before hurting B. 
But if punishment is risky or costly for C , she may not do much to A , making A feel unconstrained . 
But if C can punish A in a cheap and even enjoyable way , the threat to A may be more substantial . 
According to this view , the need to solve this conundrum is the evolutionary basis of gossip and reputation . 
Humans love to gossip , and gossip can harm our reputation , which in turn affects how others treat us . 
So punishment through gossip is both cheap and pleasant - and A &apos;s fear of becoming the subject of gossip by C may be enough to deter bad behavior toward B. 
This opens an important avenue for the control of evil . 
As US Senator and Harvard professor Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it , &quot; Everyone is entitled to his own opinions , but not to his own facts . &quot; 
So one way to contain evil is by attacking the lies on which it is based and condemning those who propound them . 
In the US , there is a natural tendency to punish political candidates when they lie , but mostly about their personal peccadillos . 
It would be great , for example , if Donald Trump &apos;s calumnies about Mexicans made him unelectable . 
If a country &apos;s political culture is such that all agree on condemning intentional lies and liars , especially when their goal is to promote hatred , a country may avoid big evil . 
But this is not the case in Venezuela . 
Its government has run the country &apos;s economy and society into the ground , overseeing the world &apos;s steepest decline in output , highest inflation rate , and second highest murder rate , not to mention shortages beyond compare . 
And now it is systematically lying about the causes of the mess it created and inventing scapegoats . 
Maduro &apos;s government blames its economic collapse on an &quot; economic war &quot; led by the US , the oligarchy , and international financial Zionism , of which I am supposedly an agent . 
The problem is that the government has paid almost no cost for its systematic lies , even when these involve scapegoating poor Colombians for Venezuela &apos;s shortages , and illegally expelling hundreds of them , and destroying their homes . 
While Latin American former presidents have spoken out against this outrage , important leaders such as President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil and President Michelle Bachelet of Chile have remained quiet . 
They should heed Albert Einstein &apos;s warning : &quot; The world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it . &quot;
