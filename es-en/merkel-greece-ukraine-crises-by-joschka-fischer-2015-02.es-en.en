Angela Merkel &apos;s Moment of Truth 
BERLIN - In the last two weeks , the two crises confronting Europe - in Ukraine and Greece - both escalated . 
In each case , Germany and its chancellor , Angela Merkel , were at the heart of efforts to achieve a diplomatic resolution . 
This is a new role for Germany , and the country is not yet accustomed to it . 
The latest attempt to halt the war in eastern Ukraine by diplomatic means had an even shorter shelf life than the first attempt last September . 
The new accord - concluded , like the previous one , in Minsk - de facto recognized that Ukraine has been split by military means . 
But just where the dividing line is remains unclear , because Russian President Vladimir Putin may yet attempt to capture the strategic port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov , thereby enabling the Kremlin to create a land bridge between Russia and the Crimea peninsula . 
Moreover , capturing Mariupol would keep open the option of conquering southern Ukraine , including Odessa , and extending Russian control all the way to Transnistria , Russia &apos;s illegal enclave in Moldova . 
Through the continued use of military force , Putin has achieved the main aim of Russia &apos;s policy : control over eastern Ukraine and ongoing destabilization of the country as a whole . 
Indeed , Minsk II is merely a reflection of facts on the ground . 
The question remains , however , whether it would have been smarter to let the one power that Putin takes seriously - the United States - conduct the negotiations . 
Given Putin &apos;s low regard for Europe , this will most likely become unavoidable , sooner or later . 
Still , despite the risks involved , it is important that Germany and France , in coordination with the European Union and the US , undertook this diplomatic effort . 
Though the Minsk II initiative exposed Europe &apos;s meager political clout , it also confirmed the indispensability of Franco-German cooperation , as well as Germany &apos;s changed role within the EU . 
Merkel herself reflects this changed role . 
Her ten years in power were largely characterized by a new German Biedermeier era . 
The sun was shining on Germany and its economy , and Merkel regarded it as her highest duty to maintain citizens &apos; sense of wellbeing by not disturbing them with politics . 
But Germany &apos;s new significance in Europe has put a brutal end to Merkel &apos;s neo-Biedermeier era . 
She no longer defines her policies in terms of &quot; small steps &quot; ; now she takes strategic threats seriously and confronts them head-on . 
This is also true of the Greek crisis , in which Merkel - despite her public image in southern Europe - was not aligned with the hawks in her party and administration . 
Indeed , Merkel seems to be well aware of the unmanageable risks of a Greek exit from the euro - although it remains to be seen whether she can muster the determination to revise the failed austerity policy imposed on Greece . 
Without such a revision aimed at boosting growth , Europe will remain alarmingly weak both internally and externally . 
Given Russia &apos;s attack on Ukraine , this is a dismal prospect , because internal weakness and external threats are directly linked . 
Greece has also shown that the euro crisis is less a financial crisis than a sovereignty crisis . 
With the recent election of the anti-austerity Syriza party , Greek voters stood up against external control over their country by the &quot; troika &quot; ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) , Germany , or anyone else . 
Yet if Greece is to be saved from bankruptcy , it will have only foreign taxpayers &apos; money to thank for it . 
And it will be nearly impossible to convince European taxpayers and governments to provide further billions of euros without verifiable guarantees and the necessary reforms . 
The Greek conflict shows that Europe &apos;s monetary union is not working because one country &apos;s democratically legitimized sovereignty has run up against other countries &apos; democratically legitimized sovereignty . 
Nation-states and a monetary union do not sit well together . 
But it is not hard to understand that , should &quot; Grexit &quot; occur , the only geopolitical winner would be Russia , whereas in Europe , everyone stands to lose . 
Though the geopolitical risks have , so far , barely figured in the German debate , they greatly outweigh any domestic policy risks of finally coming clean with the German public . 
Greece , Germans should be told , will remain a eurozone member , and preserving the euro will require further steps toward integration , up to and including transfers and debt mutualization , provided that the appropriate institutions for this are established . 
Such a step will require courage , but the alternatives - continuation of the eurozone crisis or a return to a system of nation-states - are far less attractive . 
( Germany has a new national-conservative party whose leaders &apos; declared aim is to pursue a pre-1914 foreign policy . ) 
In view of the dramatic global changes and the direct military threat to Europe posed by Putin &apos;s Russia , these alternatives are no alternative at all , and the Greek &quot; problem &quot; looks insignificant . 
Merkel and French President Fran√ßois Hollande should seize the initiative once again and finally put the eurozone on a sound footing . 
Germany will have to loosen its beloved purse strings , and France will have to surrender some of its precious political sovereignty . 
The alternative is to stand by idly and watch Europe &apos;s nationalists become stronger , while the European integration project , despite six decades of success , staggers ever closer to the abyss .
