Chile &apos;s Uncertain Future 
CAMBRIDGE - When I was in Chile earlier this month , I was impressed by the contrast between the palpable success of its long-standing free-market policies and the current agenda of its leftist president , Michelle Bachelet . 
How this contrast is resolved will be important not only to the country &apos;s more than 17 million people , but also to everyone who regards Chile as a model of what sound economic policies have been able to achieve . 
Chile &apos;s economic performance has been the strongest in South America . 
Its per capita GDP exceeds $ 22,000 in purchasing-power-parity terms , making its income higher than that of Argentina , Brazil , and Mexico . 
It &apos;s no surprise that Chile is considered a developed country - the only South American member of the OECD . 
Copper is Chile &apos;s major product and accounts for half of its exports . 
Although the government owns Codelco , the world &apos;s largest copper producer , it is Chile &apos;s only publicly owned company . 
The company &apos;s revenue varies with the global price of copper , yielding higher government revenues in some years and declines - for example , this year - when the global price is down . 
The government follows a wise fiscal strategy that involves budget surpluses in years when copper revenue is high , with the additional funds channeled to a national stabilization fund . 
But even with the currently depressed copper price , Chile &apos;s budget deficit is only 2 % of GDP . 
As a result of Chile &apos;s cautious fiscal strategy , the country has a national debt that amounts to only 16 % of GDP - and a sovereign debt rating that is the highest in South America . 
Taxes and other government revenues are less than 20 % of GDP . 
Half of tax revenue is collected with a value-added tax , which is essentially a tax on consumption . 
Although there is a tax on corporate income , it is integrated with personal taxes in a way that reduces its adverse effect on investment and production . 
Chile is well known for an investment-based pension system . 
Employees are required to contribute 10 % of their wages to a private pension company of their choice and can then select one of the investment strategies offered by that company . 
The government mandates the range of investment strategies , which vary in terms of the share of equities and fixed income that companies may offer . 
For those who have worked and contributed during their entire adult life , this produces benefits that are more than 50 % of pre-retirement income . 
Meanwhile , sound monetary policy , guided by a series of talented central bankers ( whose independence is enshrined in Chile &apos;s constitution ) , has prevented inflation and kept long-term rates relatively low . 
Chile &apos;s inflation target is 3 % with an acceptable range of plus or minus 1 % . 
Inflation this year is expected to be 3.9 % , and the ten-year bond rate is just 4.4 % . 
And , by protecting the floating exchange-rate regime , the central bank ensures that Chile does not confront the kind of foreign-debt crisis that has hit other Latin American countries . 
Chile is also a devoted free trader . 
The economy has also benefited from its openness to foreign investment , with the stock of foreign direct investment in Chile topping 80 % of GDP . 
There is also universal literacy , with 98 % of the adult population able to read and write . 
On average , young people spend an average of 15 years in school from primary through tertiary education . 
Chile &apos;s excellent economic performance has been the result of the free-market policies introduced during the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet but confirmed and strengthened by democratically elected governments over the 25 years since he left office . 
So , given the success and popularity of these policies , it is surprising that Chile &apos;s voters have elected a president and a parliament that many Chileans now fear could put this approach at risk . 
Bachelet &apos;s policy agenda emphasizes three major changes . 
A key element would be universal free university education , modeled on European systems . 
And labor laws would be revised to strengthen the role of unions . 
Critics of Bachelet claim that this agenda is already depressing business investment and is responsible for relatively slow economic growth . 
And they worry that foreign and domestic investors will be discouraged by the new labor rules . 
Fortunately , the Chilean public shows no inclination to follow the mistakes of several other South American countries , especially Venezuela , Ecuador , Brazil , and Argentina . 
Even Bachelet &apos;s critics agree that Chile &apos;s basic macroeconomic policies will not change : an independent central bank committed to price stability , a free-trade regime with a floating currency , and a fiscal policy that will keep deficits and public debt low . 
Bachelet &apos;s term in office will end in 2017 . 
Under Chile &apos;s constitution , she cannot serve another consecutive term .
