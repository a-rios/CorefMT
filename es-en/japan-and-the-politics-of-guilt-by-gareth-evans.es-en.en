Japan and the Politics of Guilt 
CANBERRA - Japan is again alienating its neighbors and driving its friends to despair over the issue of accepting responsibility for its wartime aggression and atrocities . 
With the election of the new government , the voices of denial are heard again at the highest levels , and are resonating with the public , including the young , in ways that would be unthinkable , by contrast , in modern Germany . 
All of this is fueling nationalist sentiment in China and South Korea , and making even more dangerous the already volatile territorial disputes in the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan . 
It may be , as some Japanese colleagues tell me , that newly elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , despite his deeply conservative nationalist background and instincts , is ultimately a realist who will do what it takes - no doubt with the help of pressure from the United States - to defuse these tensions . 
The first is the long-running saga of an appropriate apology for Japan &apos;s initiation and conduct of aggressive war the years before and during World War II . 
For many years , the affected countries sought a comprehensive and unequivocal apology ; as Australia &apos;s foreign minister from the late 1980 &quot; s , I pushed hard for it in Tokyo , as a form of closure that was morally right and in Japan &apos;s own interests . 
Eventually , on the 50th anniversary of Japan &apos;s defeat in 1995 , Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama responded with personal language of both &quot; deep remorse &quot; and &quot; heartfelt apology . &quot; 
Most subsequent leaders have repeated these sentiments in various degrees - albeit never to the complete satisfaction of China or South Korea . 
The second issue is that of a specific apology to the &quot; comfort women &quot; - from many countries , including my own , but especially South Korea - who were sexually enslaved in army brothels . 
Then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono broke the ice in 1993 , expressing &quot; sincere apologies and remorse &quot; to all those who had &quot; suffered immeasurable pain . &quot; 
But Abe and several of his colleagues have gone on the record over the years - including during Abe &apos;s first term as Prime Minister in 2006-2007 - denying that coercion was involved . 
In 2007 , his national security adviser told a colleague of mine , &quot; All of this is the work of Korean leftists : there &apos;s nothing to it . &quot; 
Now , in January 2013 , Abe &apos;s chief cabinet secretary , Yoshihide Suga , has said that experts would be invited to study the basis of Kono &apos;s statement . 
Finally , there is the issue of the Yasukuni Shrine to Japanese war dead , which records in its &quot; Book of Souls &quot; 14 A-class war criminals , and contains a museum that glorifies Japan &apos;s conquests as &quot; just wars fought for survival and self-defense &quot; or for the &quot; liberation of Asia . &quot; 
Abe has been a regular visitor to Yasukuni . 
He visited it again last October , after being elected LDP leader , and expressed &quot; bitter grief &quot; during the election campaign that he had not done so during his previous term as Prime Minister . 
It has been reliably reported that he wants to visit the shrine while in office this time . 
Fourteen of his 19 cabinet members are reported to belong to a group promoting pilgrimage tours to the site . 
Compounding these concerns is evidence that Japanese public opinion is sympathetic toward the positions that Abe has taken or seems to favor . 
In a Jiji Press opinion poll conducted in January , 56.7 % of those surveyed believed that Abe should visit Yasukuni now - up significantly from 2006 , when 43 % took a similar position . 
There are , of course , always two sides to these stories . 
It is possible to argue - as many Japanese do - that much of the negative reaction by Japan &apos;s neighbors has been driven by cynical nationalist considerations . 
Campaigners for South Korean comfort women , for example , have often failed to acknowledge the number and intensity of the statements that have been made on this issue over the last two decades , and the amount of compensation on offer . 
Likewise , China may have set the bar too high concerning the language that it has demanded in any general apology . 
But , even before Abe &apos;s latest wavering , there is much more that Japan could have done long ago - and which it should still do - to put its position beyond reasonable criticism . 
The benchmark 1995 Murayama apology remains a personal one , because the Japanese Diet , then and since , would not agree to anything as strong : a &quot; deep feeling of remorse &quot; was as much as they could muster , and even then 241 members abstained . 
Moreover , Murayama &apos;s statement referred vaguely to &quot; a certain period in the not-too-distant past , &quot; rather than to specific war years , and others have since resisted phrases - for example , &quot; war of aggression &quot; or &quot; colonial rule &quot; - that Japan &apos;s neighbors have not unreasonably sought . 
The more fundamental problem is that Japan seems unable , as a nation , to manage the kind of collective psychological shift that has transformed Germany , with which it is inevitably compared . 
Apologizing sincerely for the sins and omissions of earlier generations is never easy . 
Australia had a long national debate before we could say that we were sorry for the horrible past mistreatment of our Aboriginal people , particularly the &quot; stolen generations &quot; of Aboriginal children who were regularly taken from their parents by governments until the 1970 &quot; s . 
But statesmen , if they are to deserve the name , sometimes must take the politically uncomfortable high ground - and then bring their publics along . 
Leadership of that quality has been a long time coming in Japan .
