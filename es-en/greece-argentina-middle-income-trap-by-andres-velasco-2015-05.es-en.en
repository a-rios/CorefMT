Greece , Argentina , and the Middle-Income Trap 
SANTIAGO - Aside from an established tradition of bad macroeconomics , what do Greece and Argentina have in common ? 
One answer is that they were the world &apos;s longest-held captives of the so-called middle-income trap - and remain within its reach to this day . 
With countries in Asia , Eastern Europe , and Latin American fearing that , having reached the international middle class , they could be stuck there , Greece and Argentina shed light on how that might happen . 
A recent paper by economists from Bard College and the Asian Development Bank categorizes the world economy according to four groups - with the top two categories occupied by upper-middle-income and high-income countries - and tracks countries &quot; movements in and out of these groups . 
Which countries were stuck for the longest period in the upper-middle-income category before moving to high income ? 
You guessed it : Greece and Argentina . 
Correcting for variations in the cost of living across countries , the paper concludes that $ 10,750 of purchasing power in the year 1990 is the threshold for per capita income beyond which a country is high income , while $ 7,250 makes it upper-middle income . 
( These thresholds may sound low , but the World Bank uses similar cutoffs . ) 
By these criteria , Argentina became an upper-middle-income country all the way back in 1970 , and then spent 40 years stuck in that category before reaching high-income status in 2010 . 
Greece joined the international upper middle class in 1972 , and then took 28 years to reach the top income group , in 2000 . 
No other country that became upper middle income after 1950 , and then made the transition , took nearly as long . 
In fact , the average length of that transition was 14 years , with economies such as South Korea , Taiwan , and Hong Kong taking as little as seven years . 
Data in the paper stop at 2010 , but the story may well be worse today . 
According to IMF figures , Greece &apos;s never-ending crisis has cut per capita GDP ( in terms of purchasing power parity ) by 10 % since 2010 , and by 18 % since 2007 . 
Indeed , Greece may have dropped out of the high-income category in recent years . 
Argentina &apos;s per capita income has risen , albeit slowly , during this period , but the country was never far from a full-blown macroeconomic crisis that could reduce household incomes sharply . 
So it seems fair to conclude that both countries are still caught in the middle-income trap . 
What kind of trap is it ? 
In Greece and Argentina , it is both political and economic . 
Start with the politics . 
In their book Why Nations Fail , Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that societies with political arrangements that concentrate power in the hands of a few seldom excel at innovation and growth , because innovators have no guarantee they will keep the fruits of their labors . 
And , to the extent that outsiders cannot generate wealth , they have few resources with which to challenge the power of insiders ; as a result , exclusionary political arrangements are mostly self-sustaining . 
That is a useful account of why there is a poverty trap - which is the question the book seeks to answer - but it does not clarify why there is a middle-income trap . 
Greece and Argentina are , after all , democracies , however imperfect , and so are most of the countries in Latin America or East Asia that worry about being stuck at middle-income level . 
The Acemoglu-Robinson account of a single small elite pulling all the strings needs to be replaced by a different narrative , in which an array of politically powerful groups exercise veto power over decisions that affect their economic interests . 
Think of powerful business groups vetoing moves to improve tax collection or strengthen competition policy . 
This helps explain why the Greek and Argentine governments are perennially in deficit ( until borrowing options dry up and adjustment is inevitable ) , or why prices - and profits - are high in sectors ( for example , transportation and telecoms ) that provide would-be entrepreneurs with crucial ( but often unaffordable ) inputs . 
Or think of public-sector unions vetoing changes in benefits for their members . 
That goes a long way toward explaining ( add a bit of ideology to the mix ) why the current Greek government has gone to the brink of default before agreeing to restrain public-sector pensions , as its European Union partners demand . 
It also helps explain why both Greece and Argentina have sizeable governments ( public spending accounts for 46 % and 39 % of GDP , respectively ) but puny public investment and outdated infrastructure . 
This is not a case of too much democracy , as conservative commentators sometimes claim , but of too little . 
Underdeveloped democratic institutions allow for decisions that are individually rational but collectively shortsighted and harmful . 
And bad politics makes for bad economics . 
To go from middle-income to high-income status , countries have to redeploy resources to high-productivity , knowledge- and skill-intensive sectors . 
That is a transition that Greece and Argentina , with their financial instability , poor infrastructure , and weak education systems , have never made . 
Greece exports refined petroleum products , olive oil , raw cotton , and dried fruit . 
Argentina exports corn , soybeans , fruits , and wine - as well as cars and auto parts to the rest of the regional Mercosur trade bloc , where it enjoys ample tariff protection against third-country competition . 
According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity , developed by Ricardo Hausmann and colleagues at Harvard University , the 2008 gap between Greece &apos;s income and the knowledge content of its exports was the largest in a sample of 128 countries . 
By 2013 , Greece ranked 48th in the Atlas &apos;s index of complexity of exports - by far the lowest of any developed country in Europe - while Argentina ranked 67th . 
Sluggish exports mean slow growth , which in turn places limits on social mobility and the expansion of an entrepreneurial middle class . 
That helps preserve the political power of entrenched veto-wielding players , closing the trap . 
Perhaps a weighty tome entitled Why Middle-Income Nations Fail will tell the story in full . 
Societies will then understand why high-income status eludes them - and what they might do differently .
