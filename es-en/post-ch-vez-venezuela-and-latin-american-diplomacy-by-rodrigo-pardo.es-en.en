Latin America Without Chávez 
BOGOTÁ - Venezuela is poised to vote on a new president to replace the recently deceased Hugo Chávez . 
In the 14 years of his administration , Chávez was one of the major leaders in promoting changes in relations among Latin American countries and between them and the United States . 
So , what will the post-Chávez era in Venezuela mean for diplomacy within the hemisphere ? 
A significant group of Latin American countries with leftist governments have created new mechanisms for integration among themselves , as well as more autonomous relations with the US . 
Traditional bodies such as the Organization of American States and the Andean Community of Nations - in which US influence is a defining feature - have weakened , making way for Chávez &apos;s Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ( ALBA ) , the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) , and the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) . 
Chávez transformed Venezuela according to a program that he called &quot; twenty-first century socialism . &quot; 
With his populist style , demagogic language , and authoritarian behavior , he replaced the country &apos;s former elite , demolished traditional power structures , and sharply increased spending on anti-poverty programs and social inclusion . 
Chávez &apos;s &quot; Bolivarian Revolution &quot; needed external support , and , to assure it , he implemented a high-profile foreign policy , sustained by the country &apos;s oil wealth . 
Above all , the US was to be considered an imperialist threat and treated as such . 
This orientation led directly to closer ties with anti-American regimes around the world ( including Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s Libya , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s Iran , and China ) , as well as cultivation of ideological allies within the region , including Bolivia , Ecuador , and Nicaragua . 
Chávez &apos;s successor may have little choice but to maintain Venezuela &apos;s role in Latin American and global affairs . 
Whoever becomes president - whether Nicolás Maduro , the designated Chávista heir , or Henrique Capriles , the opposition candidate - will be heard in the international community . 
Indeed , Chávez was not the first Venezuelan head of state to use oil as an instrument of active foreign policy and personal visibility ; one could cite Carlos Andrés Pérez , for example , in pre-Chávista Venezuela . 
And if , as predicted , Maduro wins the election , he will assume office after six years by Chávez &apos;s side as Foreign Minister - and determined to follow in his mentor &apos;s footsteps . 
Maduro would , for example , maintain Venezuela &apos;s support and participation in the negotiations between Colombia &apos;s government and the FARC guerrillas ; but so would Capriles , because doing so serves Venezuela &apos;s national interest well . 
In other areas , diplomacy would be quieter and less ideological with Capriles as president , but it would be no less ambitious . 
At the same time , other factors may well oblige Venezuela &apos;s next president to alter the country &apos;s foreign policy in some ways . 
Maduro may be the anointed successor , but he is not Chávez . 
Even if he turns out to be an outstanding student , he lacks his mentor &apos;s oratorical skill and charisma ; at the very least , he has yet to demonstrate a similar talent for politics . 
Indeed , regardless of whether Maduro or Capriles wins , the new president will have to devote all , or nearly all , of his attention during his first months ( if not years ) in office to consolidating his power . 
That will require focusing on serious domestic problems : an economy afflicted by a fiscal crisis , a historically weak currency , high unemployment , and galloping inflation ; rampant street crime ; and dangerous levels of political and social polarization . 
Venezuela &apos;s next president will have neither the time nor the resources to make foreign policy a priority . 
In addition , most of Latin America is no longer receptive to radical foreign policies . 
Even progressive governments feel more comfortable today with pragmatic alternatives and less ideological agendas . 
Brazil &apos;s cautious tone has become more attractive than fiery anti-imperialist rhetoric . 
While the recent redefinition of relations with the US is widely welcome in the region , hardly anyone is willing to risk a confrontation . 
For example , Ecuador , under a Chávez-allied government led by President Rafael Correa , has not adopted Venezuela &apos;s openly confrontational model of relations with the US . 
And , even in the &quot; anti-Yanqui &quot; heartland , with Chávez gone , there are credible rumors of mutual interest in improved US-Venezuela relations . 
In sum , foreign-policy continuity seems to be the most likely outcome - both for Venezuela and for the region - especially if Maduro wins . 
But , even if he does , as seems likely , Chávismo without Chávez implies a more subdued role for Venezuela in Latin America and the world - and perhaps a thaw in relations with the comandante &apos;s imperialist bogeyman .
