A Way Out for Ukraine and Russia 
LONDON - The leaders of Russia and Ukraine will meet in Astana , Kazakstan , on January 15 to discuss , once again , an end to the fighting that has roiled eastern Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region since last spring . 
Hopes for a viable agreement are not high . 
One reason why the crisis in Ukraine has proved so difficult to overcome is that its roots stretch far outside the country &apos;s borders . 
Finding a genuine solution will require the resolution of a dispute between Russia and the West that dates back to the 1990s , before Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power . 
At its heart , the conflict in Ukraine is about a disagreement over NATO &apos;s expansion into what Russia regards as its &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
Fortunately , a solution is possible - but it will require a reworking of Europe &apos;s security architecture . 
Both sides are deeply committed to their positions . 
In November , Putin &apos;s spokesperson , Dmitry Peskov , told the BBC that Russia required a &quot; 100 % guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO . &quot; 
That is a promise that Western countries will be unable to provide . 
For them , what is at stake is the principle that sovereign countries have the right to chart their own course , rather than be entangled in a larger power &apos;s sphere of influence . 
Indeed , it was this principle that , once invoked to justify NATO enlargement in the 1990s , put the two sides on a collision course . 
With Russia &apos;s neighbors free to join the alliance , the natural result could only be a new dividing line , one pressing up against the Russian Federation &apos;s western and southern borders . 
This outcome was foreseen by the veteran American diplomat George F. Kennan . 
In an interview he gave to the New York Times in May 1998 , he predicted that NATO enlargement would lead to a new Cold War . 
Now that Kennan &apos;s prediction has all but come to pass , the parties to the conflict would be wise to take a lesson from the diplomatic efforts that helped bring the original Cold War to an end - in particular , the 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe ( CFE ) . 
NATO enlargement may have rendered the treaty &apos;s detailed provisions obsolete , but its underlying approach - a transparent inspections regime that enforces limitations on the overall quantity and , crucially , the regional concentrations of ground forces - remains applicable today . 
For the West , a revamped CFE Treaty would help mitigate worries about military threats in the area that Russia has traditionally considered its sphere of influence . 
Violations of the treaty would be easily detectable and allow time for the West to deploy countermeasures . 
In addition , there would be no formal prohibition of NATO membership for Ukraine - or for any other country in the Russian periphery . 
For Russia , a new treaty would allow it to live with the hitherto nightmare scenario of Ukrainian accession to NATO ; as long as the pact remained in force , Ukraine &apos;s membership would have no military consequences . 
NATO , at least in the Russian hinterland , would become first and foremost a political organization . 
Above all , a new treaty would allow both Russia and the West to secure their interests in a balanced and binding agreement . 
For Russia , this would mean a significant improvement on what it has been offered since the end of the Cold War . 
Though invitations by the West to join organizations such as the NATO-Russia Council or the G-8 may have been symbolically important and thus politically valuable , these venues provide only forums for discussion ; they do not produce binding agreements . 
A new treaty would do more than anything else to bring peace to Ukraine . 
It would eliminate the primary motive behind Russia &apos;s support for separatism in the country &apos;s southeast : ensuring that Ukraine remains ineligible for NATO membership . 
The dispute over the fate of Crimea would continue ; but an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the issue could be made a precondition of the treaty &apos;s entry into full effect . 
There are two other obvious objections to this proposal . 
The first is that Putin would reject a treaty with NATO . 
That should not stop the West from making the offer . 
With the Russian economy in serious trouble , Putin may be looking for a way out of his corner . 
The second objection is that the West would be best served by simply standing back and watching while sanctions and plunging oil prices bring down Russia &apos;s economy - and ultimately Putin himself . 
After all , economic and political breakdown in Russia would have profound adverse consequences well beyond Russia &apos;s borders - particularly for Ukraine .
