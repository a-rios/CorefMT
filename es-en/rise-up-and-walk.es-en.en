Rise Up and Walk 
In July 2005 , millions of people filled stadiums for the Live 8 concerts in support of Africa &apos;s people . 
It was also for ordinary citizens that African leaders traveled to Scotland to meet the G-8 heads of state that summer . 
It was for these same people that the Jubilee 2000 campaign for debt relief was carried out by many individuals and organizations all over the world . 
And in St. Petersberg in July 2006 , the G-8 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the ambitious goals they had set the year before , although they did not go further . 
Nearly a year and a half on , there are signs of progress toward fulfilling the commitments to Africa &apos;s development made by world leaders and committed campaigners . 
But it is fair to ask when a sustainable solution to Africa &apos;s dehumanizing poverty will be found , not only by the G8 and the organizers of Live 8 , but also by Africa &apos;s leaders and people . 
Africa is a paradox . 
It is one of the richest continents on the planet , endowed with oil , precious stones , forests , water , wildlife , soil , land , agricultural products , and millions of women and men . 
Yet most of Africa &apos;s people remain impoverished . 
I continue to ask myself , &quot; Why ? &quot; 
One reason is that many Africans lack the knowledge , skills , tools , and the political will to create wealth from their resources . 
They are unable to add value to raw materials in order to sell processed goods in local and international markets and negotiate better prices and favorable trade rules . 
Another reason is that ordinary citizens suffer when debts are not cancelled , when financial assistance is not forthcoming , or when trade barriers are raised . 
I have also seen the need for ordinary Africans to embrace a set of values , like service for the common good , and commitment , persistence , and patience until a goal is realized . 
We also need Africans who love Africa so much that they want to protect their countries - their land - from environmentally destructive processes . 
The transformation of grasslands into deserts due to deforestation , encroachment into forests for subsistence farming , overgrazing , and loss of biodiversity and soil threaten the entire continent . 
Another value Africans must adopt is love and concern for young people . 
One of the most devastating experiences is to see youth wasting away because they are unemployed , even after they have completed secondary and tertiary education , or because their health has deteriorated . 
African governments should give priority to investments in technical education and HIV / AIDS prevention , treatment , care , and support programs . 
Without skills , people find themselves locked out of productive , rewarding economic activities , leaving them unable to meet their needs for housing , healthcare and nutrition . 
They get trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and , sometimes , crime . 
Africa needs to prepare for the opportunities and challenges to come by deliberately working for peace and security . 
Much of Africa &apos;s poverty is fueled by conflicts . 
In the course of my work over the past 30 years , I have observed that whether it is at the national or regional level , most conflicts are over resources . 
Who will control and utilize them ? 
Who will be included or excluded ? 
When resources are scarce , or so degraded that they can no longer sustain livelihoods , or inequitably distributed , conflict invariably ensues . 
In Africa , we need to manage our resources sustainably , accountably , and responsibly . 
And we need to share those resources equitably . 
Otherwise , we will continue to invest in wars and conflicts , or in fighting crime and domestic instability , rather than in promoting development and thereby eliminating poverty . 
African leaders should govern and serve for the benefit of the people , not themselves . 
But perhaps the most unrecognized problem in Africa , especially at the grassroots level , is the disempowerment of ordinary people . 
This is one of the main reasons why so many people are unable to take advantage of the many opportunities available in Africa . 
Africa &apos;s people must be allowed to gain confidence , dignity , and a sense of self-worth . 
They must also be empowered with knowledge , skills , and tools to take action . 
This is why debt relief is so important . 
It provides governments additional resources to invest in initiatives that can empower their people . 
Despite the many challenges that remain , there has been much recent progress in Africa . 
There are indications of good governance in many countries . 
In many others , civil society continues to grow , supported by national governments , the African Union , and the international community . 
Many countries are resolving their conflicts and working for peace and stability . 
We must appreciate and encourage those who are making bold decisions . 
But much must still be accomplished , by Africans and with Africa &apos;s many friends around the world . 
As in the Bible story , when Peter and John said to a beggar , &quot; rise up and walk , &quot; Africans are called upon to walk away from ignorance , inertia , apathy , and fatalism . 
To walk towards economic and political freedom . 
To walk to an Africa free of poverty .
