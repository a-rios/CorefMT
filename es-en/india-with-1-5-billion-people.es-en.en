India with 1.5 Billion People 
India &apos;s population is now a little over one billion ; it will almost certainly surpass 1.5 billion by mid-century , overtaking China &apos;s population along the way before it stops growing . 
Moreover , the economy is growing much faster than before . 
So will India be able to provide a comfortable home for 1.5 billion people ? 
I recently co-authored a study ( with Tim Dyson , Leela Visaria and others ) that concludes , with modest optimism , that while India can manage its population growth , it also faces a number of major difficulties . 
True , poverty fell in the 1990 &apos;s , while literacy rates and school attendance rose . 
Most of India &apos;s big poor states - Bihar , Madhya Pradesh , Orissa , Rajasthan , and Uttar Pradesh - suffer from a combination of relatively slow economic growth and rapid demographic growth . 
Only Rajasthan &apos;s economy has kept pace with the rest of the country ; the other four have not benefited much from trade and regulatory liberalization . 
Similarly , states where birth rates fell earlier , such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu , are already enjoying shrinking school-age populations , whereas school-age numbers in Bihar will still be rising until around 2025 . 
These five poor states contain 45 % of India &apos;s population , and 56 % of its poor . 
Our projections indicate that in 20 years they will account for more than half the population and 75 % of the poor . 
Unless recent trends can be reversed , the growing economic and demographic gulf between India &apos;s North and East and its South and West will pose a serious political threat . 
The environmental impact of 1.5 billion inhabitants forms the other major challenge . 
India &apos;s past population growth has been accompanied - if much too slowly and unequally - by improving health , education , and economic welfare . 
But the environment has been suffering . 
Air , soil , and water pollution has been growing , causing hundreds of thousands of deaths every year . 
The key to a clean future is clean technologies , whose costs have been falling steadily , and will continue to do so . 
Sometimes these technologies pay for themselves and will be adopted . 
In these cases , government will have to provide incentives , or regulate and tax . 
Unfortunately , however , when the main beneficiaries are the poor , corporations are powerful , and governments are weak or corrupt , good environmental practices are far from guaranteed . 
There are nonetheless some notable success stories . 
Delhi &apos;s barely breathable air has become tolerable , following a big move to compressed natural gas in public transport , retirement of old vehicles , and higher emissions standards in new ones . 
Delhi &apos;s cleaner air hasn &apos;t cost much , yet other cities have been slow to follow suit . 
The biggest problem is water pollution , with discharges into canals and rivers growing faster than treatment capacity . 
At the same time , India &apos;s growing population will make increasing demands on water supplies - mainly for agriculture , which absorbs more than 80 % of all the fresh water India consumes . 
If the population grows by 50 % , the country will need to grow 50 % more food , if it is to continue to feed itself . 
But there won &apos;t be any more water . 
In fact , there could well be less water than there is now , owing to pollution and climate change . 
So India will need huge increases in water efficiency . 
Here , too , there are examples of improvement . 
But there is also far too much populist politicking , with promises of free water for farmers . 
Doing what has to be done to ensure sustainable water supplies - controlling pollution , encouraging conservation , regulating and charging where necessary - is politically tough . 
Eventually , however , India has no choice : there are already sporadic riots over water shortage , while water tankers move under armed guard in some cities , and virulent conflicts arise between communities over water-sharing . 
In questionnaires , the poor say that an adequate water supply is their foremost need . 
Our study quotes three national water surveys . 
Each concludes that India can have a satisfactory water future . 
As with the other challenges posed by population growth , the issue is not whether the future can be managed , but whether it will be . 
India may or may not be the world &apos;s next economic wonder ; but it will have to solve its age-old problems , as well as its new ones , if it is going to be a good place to live for the vast majority of its citizens .
