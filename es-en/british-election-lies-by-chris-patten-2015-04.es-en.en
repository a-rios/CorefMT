Lies , Damn Lies , and the British Election 
LONDON - Democratic elections cannot be described as competitions aimed at revealing which candidates tell the unvarnished truth . 
Most politicians try to avoid telling outright lies ; they bob and weave like prizefighters when faced with questions that might ensnare them in outright mendacity . 
It is understandable that politicians should talk up their own vision of the future and talk down what others have to say . 
All of this is most credible if it does not go too far , and if it bears some resemblance to what the same politicians have achieved when they have been in power . 
Voters normally spot political Pinocchios and the lengthening of politicians &quot; noses a mile off . 
They are prepared to give some the benefit of the doubt ( by far the most important attribute any political leader can possess ) . 
My guess is that on polling day , Prime Minister David Cameron will emerge holding this asset . 
Voters also have a gut instinct - usually , though not always , correct - that parties of the traditional left will tax and spend more , and that those of the right will do the opposite . 
The way voters respond reflects the way they perceive recent history and what they want for themselves and their families in the future . 
I subscribe to the view that they normally get these judgments right . 
This year , however , the British electorate must navigate more than the ordinary amount of election-time dissimulation . 
As voters head to the polls on May 7 , their would-be elected officials are asking them to believe three great falsehoods , each of which is dangerous in its own way . 
The first two falsehoods - deceptions as large as I can remember witnessing during an election campaign - are being peddled by the country &apos;s two most successful populist parties : the United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) and the Scottish Nationalist Party ( SNP ) . 
UKIP &apos;s rapid rise has been built on the promise of a return to a British past that never was : mostly white , God-fearing , law-abiding , culturally insular , and narrowly focused on its own national interests . 
It is a vision that appeals mainly to those who are suspicious of modernity and hostile toward globalization . 
The danger is that UKIP &apos;s two primary policy prescriptions - an end to immigration and withdrawal from the European Union - are incompatible with economic prosperity . 
In order for Britain to continue to thrive outside the EU , it would have to open its economy even further , not only to worldwide trade and investment , but also to increased immigration flows . 
Following UKIP &apos;s suggestion to close the country off from the world would result only in greater poverty - above all for British workers . 
The SNP , too , has built its campaign around a core of dishonesty that , unfortunately , explains a good part of its success . 
In addition to appealing to an unpleasant undercurrent of Scottish Anglophobia , the SNP promises its electorate the prospect of policies that are far to the left of anything that Labour &apos;s prime ministerial candidate , Ed Miliband , could possibly deliver . 
To make matters worse , the increase in welfare spending that the SNP is promising Scotland &apos;s voters would have to be paid for primarily by taxpayers in England . 
Regardless of which party - Labour or Conservative - wins the largest number of seats in Parliament , its constituents would of course include many English voters , who would never agree to the SNP &apos;s policy priorities . 
As far as falsehoods go , this is a dangerous one ; it once again threatens the constitutional integrity of Britain , just eight months after Scotland voted to stay part of the United Kingdom by a margin of 10 % . 
But it is the last deception that is the most widespread - and probably the most dangerous of all . 
National politicians &quot; campaign rhetoric embodies the delusional belief that the UK can exercise the same degree of control over global events that might have been possible 50 years ago . 
For better or worse , that simply is not true . 
The UK no longer wields the international influence it once did ; indeed , Britons hardly seem to be bothered by their country &apos;s downgraded importance - or even very much aware of the implications . 
National sovereignty is becoming an ever more elusive concept . 
Britain &apos;s economic prospects increasingly depend on events beyond its shores , whether just across the English Channel or in China or California . 
Environmental hazards blow in on the wind . 
Swelling migration pressures threaten to overwhelm any pretense at border controls . 
Security concerns increasingly implicate foreign and domestic policies simultaneously . 
A recent political cartoon showed British bombers taking off on a mission , with one pilot saying to the others , &quot; It seems a long way to go to bomb a few young men from South London . &quot; 
Addressing the challenges that we Britons face will first require acknowledging our limited control over their root causes . 
The country is in desperate need of leadership with the courage to be candid with voters , by explaining to them clearly and soberly that the UK can no longer solve its problems alone . 
In an increasingly dangerous , ever-more interconnected world , Britain cannot afford to make its most important collective decisions based on delusions . 
The British electorate would be better served if their politicians had the courage to serve up some uncomfortable truths - or at least not to deal in dangerous deceit .
