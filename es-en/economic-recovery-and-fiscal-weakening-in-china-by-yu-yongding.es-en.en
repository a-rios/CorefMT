China &apos;s Narrowing Policy Horizons 
BEIJING - Back in the last quarter of 2011 , when the decline in China &apos;s investment growth accelerated , concerns about a hard economic landing intensified , particularly given the authorities &quot; reluctance to pursue new expansionary policies . 
By May 2012 , however , the government had changed its mind , with the National Development and Reform Commission approving ¥ 7 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) in new projects . 
That , together with two ensuing interest-rate cuts by the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) , guaranteed an end to the economic slowdown in the third quarter of 2012 . 
The Chinese economy &apos;s performance has thus maintained the cyclical pattern familiar from the past two decades : rapid investment growth , supported by expansionary policy , drives up the economic-growth rate . 
Inflation follows , so policy is tightened and growth slows . 
But inflation remains high or rising , so more tightening is imposed . 
Inflation falls at last , but growth slows more than desired , owing to the overcapacity that resulted from excessive investment in the earlier phase of the cycle . 
At this point , policy becomes expansionary again , and the cycle begins anew : led by investment growth , the economy rebounds . 
Thus , the acceleration of economic growth since the third quarter of 2012 should come as no surprise . 
With the government still having room to wield expansionary monetary and / or fiscal policy , the economic revival was only a matter of time . 
There is no reason to doubt that the Chinese economy in 2013 will follow the old growth pattern . 
But China &apos;s decision-makers should bear two things in mind . 
First , in the past , short-term macroeconomic stability was often achieved at the expense of structural adjustment and rational allocation of resources . 
To achieve sustained growth , a balance between short-term and long-term objectives must be struck . 
Striking that balance is the biggest challenge facing China . 
Second , some financial vulnerabilities are embedded in the economy . 
Unless they are defused in time , financial shocks may derail the economy from its normal growth path . 
According to preliminary reports , annual investment growth in 2012 reached roughly 14 % - significantly higher than the GDP growth rate , which accelerated in the fourth quarter as a result of a strong rebound in investment in real estate and infrastructure . 
In 2013 , it can be expected that , barring major disruptions , strong investment growth will push China &apos;s GDP more than 8 % higher year on year . 
The timing of the inevitable policy shift back to tightening depends on overall inflation , particularly house prices . 
The problem is that the investment share of China &apos;s GDP is already about 50 % , while double-digit investment growth in 2013 is expected to push that rate still higher . 
Such a growth path is simply not sustainable . 
The money supply has grown significantly faster than output for decades . 
In 2012 , the growth rate of M2 was about 14 % , relatively low by historical standards , but still significantly higher than the nominal GDP growth rate . 
As a result of this chronically rapid growth in broad money , China &apos;s M2 / GDP ratio has surpassed 180 % , the highest in the world . 
Though the full implications of this uniquely high ratio for macroeconomic stability need further investigation , it certainly implies financial fragility and a weakening of the PBOC &apos;s ability to control overall liquidity in the economy . 
Third , though China &apos;s public debt / GDP ratio is officially still under 20 % , since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 , its fiscal position has deteriorated . 
If the government &apos;s contingent liabilities are included , China &apos;s debt / GDP ratio may be closer to 50 % . 
A worrying development in this regard is the rapid rise in enterprise debt , which , according to various studies , now surpasses 120 % of GDP - much higher than the leveraging rates of nonfinancial enterprises in major developed countries . 
Even if this does not trigger a crisis , it sharply narrows the government &apos;s scope for using expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate the economy . 
In 2011 and early 2012 , there was much talk of a crash in China &apos;s housing market , and a chain-reaction of defaults in underground credit networks and local-government finance platforms . 
In 2013 , the talk has changed to the danger of a resurgent housing bubble and the collapse of the shadow banking system , which consists mainly of wealth-management firms and trust companies . 
According to market sources , total assets managed by the shadow banking system have risen exponentially since 2009 , totaling ¥ 14 trillion , or one-third of GDP , in the third quarter of 2012 . 
With relatively slow growth , corporate profitability , upon which the returns of the shadow banking system &apos;s asset pools are based , is low and falling . 
Where , then , will the high returns of the financial products provided by the shadow banking system come from ? 
If the shadow banking system collapses , the consequences for the financial system will be much graver than the problems caused by underground credit networks and local-government finance platforms , which were much discussed in 2012 . 
No wonder , then , that one influential banker regarded as a possible successor to PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has warned of the possibility of a &quot; Chinese-style subprime crisis . &quot; 
For now , the Chinese economy , having received its cyclical dose of stimulus , should be okay . 
By the end of the year , however , the costs of the structural adjustment needed to shift China &apos;s growth model away from investment demand could rise further .
