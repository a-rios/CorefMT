Market Manipulation Goes Global 
NEW HAVEN - Market manipulation has become standard operating procedure in policy circles around the world . 
All eyes are now on China &apos;s attempts to cope with the collapse of a major equity bubble . 
The leading economies of the West are doing pretty much the same thing - just dressing up their manipulation in different clothes . 
Take quantitative easing , first used in Japan in the early 2000s , then in the United States after 2008 , then in Japan again beginning in 2013 , and now in Europe . 
In all of these cases , QE essentially has been an aggressive effort to manipulate asset prices . 
It works primarily through direct central-bank purchases of long-dated sovereign securities , thereby reducing long-term interest rates , which , in turn , makes equities more attractive . 
Whether the QE strain of market manipulation has accomplished its objective - to provide stimulus to crisis-torn , asset-dependent economies - is debatable : Current recoveries in the developed world , after all , have been unusually anemic . 
In their defense , central banks make the unsubstantiated claim that things would have been much worse had they not pursued QE . 
China &apos;s efforts at market manipulation are no less blatant . 
In response to a 31 % plunge in the CSI 300 ( a composite index of shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges ) from its June 12 peak , following a 145 % surge in the preceding 12 months , Chinese regulators have moved aggressively to contain the damage . 
Official actions run the gamut , including a $ 480 billion government-supported equity-market backstop under the auspices of the China Securities Finance Corporation , a $ 19 billion pool from major domestic brokerages , and an open-ended promise by the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) to use its balance sheet to shore up equity prices . 
Moreover , trading was suspended for about 50 % of listed securities ( more than 1,400 of 2,800 stocks ) . 
Unlike the West &apos;s QE-enabled market manipulation , which works circuitously through central-bank liquidity injections , the Chinese version is targeted more directly at the market in distress - in this case , equities . 
Significantly , QE is very much a reactive approach - aimed at sparking revival in distressed markets and economies after they have collapsed . 
The more proactive Chinese approach is the policy equivalent of attempting to catch a falling knife - arresting a market in free-fall . 
There are several other noteworthy distinctions between China &apos;s market manipulation and that seen in the West . 
First , Chinese authorities appear less focused on systemic risks to the real economy . 
That makes sense , given that wealth effects are significantly smaller in China , where private consumption accounts for just 36 % of GDP - only about half the share in more wealth-dependent economies like the US . 
Moreover , much of the sharp appreciation in Chinese equity values was very short-lived . 
Nearly 90 % of the 12-month surge in the CSI 300 was concentrated in the seven months following the start of cross-border investment flows via the so-called Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect in November 2014 . 
As a result , speculators had little time to let the capital gains sink in and have a lasting impact on lifestyle expectations . 
Second , in the West , post-crisis reforms typically have been tactical , aimed at repairing flaws in established markets , rather than promoting new markets . 
In China , by contrast , post-bubble reforms have a more strategic focus , given that the equity-market distress has important implications for the government &apos;s capital-market reforms , which are viewed as crucial to its strategy of structural rebalancing . 
Long saddled with a bank-centric system of credit intermediation , the development of secure and stable equity and bond markets is a high priority in China &apos;s effort to promote a more diversified business-funding platform . 
The collapse of the equity bubble calls that effort into serious question . 
Finally , by emphasizing a regulatory fix , and thereby keeping its benchmark policy rate well above the dreaded zero bound , the PBOC is actually better positioned than other central banks to maintain control over monetary policy and not become ensnared in the open-ended provision of liquidity that is so addictive for frothy markets . 
With a large portion of China &apos;s domestic equity market still closed , it is hard to know when the correction &apos;s animal spirits have been exhausted . 
While the government has assembled considerable firepower to limit the unwinding of a spectacular bubble , the overhang of highly leveraged speculative demand is disconcerting . 
Indeed , in the 12 months ending in June , margin financing of stock purchases nearly tripled as a share of tradable domestic-equity-market capitalization . 
While Chinese equities initially bounced 14 % off their July 8 low , the 8.5 % plunge on July 27 suggests that that may have been a temporary respite . 
The likelihood of forced deleveraging of margin calls underscores the potential for a further slide once full trading resumes . 
More broadly , just as in Japan , the US , and Europe , there can be no mistaking what prompted China &apos;s manipulation : the perils of outsize asset bubbles . 
Time and again , regulators and policymakers - to say nothing of political leaders - have been asleep at the switch in condoning market excesses . 
In a globalized world where labor income is under constant pressure , the siren song of asset markets as a growth elixir is far too tempting for the body politic to resist . 
Speculative bubbles are the visible manifestation of that temptation . 
As the bubbles burst - and they always do - false prosperity is exposed and the defensive tactics of market manipulation become both urgent and seemingly logical . 
Therein lies the great irony of manipulation : The more we depend on markets , the less we trust them . 
Needless to say , that is a far cry from the &quot; invisible hand &quot; on which the efficacy of markets rests . 
We claim , as Adam Smith did , that impersonal markets ensure the most efficient allocation of scarce capital ; but what we really want are markets that operate only on our terms .
