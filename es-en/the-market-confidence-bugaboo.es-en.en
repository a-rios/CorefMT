The Market Confidence Bugaboo 
CAMBRIDGE - A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of &quot; market confidence . &quot; 
It may have been fear of communism that agitated governments when Karl Marx penned the opening line of his famous manifesto in 1848 , but today it is the dread that market sentiment will turn against them and drive up the spreads on their bonds . 
Governments all over are being forced into premature fiscal retrenchment , even though unemployment remains very high and private demand shows few signs of life . 
Many are driven to undertake structural reforms that they don &apos;t really believe in - just because it would look bad to markets to do otherwise . 
The terror spawned by market sentiment was once the bane of poor nations alone . 
During the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980 &quot; s or the Asian financial crisis of 1997 , for example , heavily indebted developing countries believed they had few options but to swallow bitter medicine Â­ - or face a stampede of capital outflows . 
Apparently , now it &apos;s the turn of Spain , France , Britain , Germany , and , many analysts argue , even the United States . 
If you want to keep borrowing money , you need to convince your lender that you can repay . 
But in times of crisis , market confidence takes on a life of its own . 
It becomes an ethereal concept devoid of much real economic content . 
It turns into what philosophers call a &quot; social construction &quot; - something that is real only because we believe it to be . 
For , if economic logic were clear-cut , governments wouldn &apos;t have to justify what they do on the basis of market confidence . 
It would be evident which policies work and which do not , and pursuing the &quot; right &quot; policies would be the surest way to restore confidence . 
The pursuit of market confidence would be superfluous . 
So , if market confidence has a meaning , it must be something that is not pinned down simply by economic fundamentals . 
In his Communist Manifesto , Marx went on to say that it is &quot; high time that Communists should openly , in the face of the whole world , publish their views , their aims , their tendencies , and meet this nursery tale of the specter of Communism with a Manifesto of the party itself . &quot; 
Similarly , it would be nice if markets would clarify what they mean by &quot; confidence &quot; so that we would all know what we are really dealing with . 
Of course , &quot; markets &quot; are unlikely to do any such thing . 
This is not just because markets comprise a multitude of investors and speculators who are unlikely ever to get together to publish a &quot; party program , &quot; but more fundamentally because markets have little clue themselves . 
A government &apos;s capacity and willingness to service its debt depend on an almost infinite number of present and future contingencies . 
They depend not just on its tax and spending plans but also on the state of the economy , the external conjuncture , and the political context . 
All of these are highly uncertain , and require many assumptions to reach some form of judgment about creditworthiness . 
Today , markets seem to think that large fiscal deficits are the greatest threat to government solvency . 
Tomorrow they may think the real problem is low growth , and rue the tight fiscal policies that helped produce it . 
Today , they worry about spineless governments unable to take the tough actions needed to deal with the crisis . 
Perhaps tomorrow they will lose sleep over the mass demonstrations and social conflicts that tough economic policies have spawned . 
Few can predict which way market sentiment will move , least of all market participants themselves . 
Even with hindsight , it is sometimes not clear why markets go one way and not the other . 
Similar policies will produce different market reactions depending on the prevailing story , or fad of the moment . 
That is why steering the economy by the dictates of market confidence is a fool &apos;s errand . 
The silver lining in all this is that , unlike economists and politicians , markets have no ideology . 
As long as they make money they do not care if they have to eat their words . They simply want whatever &quot; works &quot; - whatever will produce a stable , healthy economic environment conducive to debt repayment . 
When circumstances become dire enough , they will even condone debt restructuring - if the alternative is chaos and the prospect of a greater loss . 
This opens up some room for governments to maneuver . 
It permits self-confident political leaders to take charge of their own future . It allows them to shape the narrative that underpins market confidence , rather than play catch-up . 
But to make good use of this maneuvering room , policymakers need to articulate a coherent , consistent , and credible account of what they are doing , based on both good economics and good politics . 
They have to say : &quot; we are doing this not because the markets demand it , but because it is good for us and here is why . &quot; 
Their storyline needs to convince their electorates as well as the markets . 
If they succeed , they can pursue their own priorities and maintain market confidence at the same time . 
This is where European governments ( along with their economist advisors ) have kept missing the boat . 
Rather than face up to the challenge , leaders first procrastinated and then buckled under pressure . 
They ended by fetishizing the pronouncements of market analysts . 
In doing so , they have denied themselves economically desirable policies that have greater chance of garnering popular support . 
If the present crisis gets worse , it will be political leaders that bear primary responsibility - not because they ignored markets , but because they took them too seriously .
