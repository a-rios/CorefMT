The Middle East &apos;s Democratic F-Words 
LONDON - The Middle East continues to have the highest concentration of dictatorships in the world . 
But 2009 was the year that democracy appeared to take root in the region - and yet the future looks as bleak as ever . 
In the Palestinian territories , Gaza &apos;s democratically elected Hamas government and the democratically elected president of the Palestinian Authority are locked in a seeming death grip , which has seen Gaza fall into an economic black hole and paralyzed as it also allowed space for Israeli intransigence . 
All the while the supposed political savior , Marwan Barghouti , sits in an Israeli prison with a life sentence . 
Meanwhile , the result of Iran &apos;s presidential election was effectively hijacked , which in turn fractured the ruling elite and left the rulers more suspicious and insular than at any time since the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Next door , Afghanistan &apos;s president similarly decided not to leave his re-election bid to chance - or to the Afghan people . 
These are but the latest signs that , more often than not , the Middle East &apos;s recent democratic experiments have only increased instability . 
Sometimes the source of that instability is embedded : succession problems , electoral fraud , corruption , the absence of the rule of law , human rights violation , or official ethnic discrimination . 
Whatever the case , the region &apos;s populations are growing restless , and the gap between rulers and ruled is widening . 
The states in the Middle East can be characterized by a series of &quot; F-words : &quot; failed , frozen , flexible , flourishing , or frightening . 
For example , Yemen is now a failed state . 
Its political institutions have ceased to function , leading to civil war in its north and separatism in the country &apos;s south . 
Meanwhile , Al Qaeda is finding a safe haven in Yemen as the state disintegrates . 
Frozen states include Saudi Arabia , where &quot; democracy &quot; is omitted from official discourse , even limited partial elections have been put on hold , and the royal succession remains a secret kept from the population . 
Frozen states appear more stable in the short term , as oil revenues still buys subservience and submission of most of the subjects , but stability coincides with the possibility of increasing violence and civil unrest , owing to widespread grievances over sectarian rule . 
The region &apos;s flexible states are frightened of war . 
Most have experienced it recently and are eager for stability and economic development . 
Despite sectarian struggle , especially in Iraq and Lebanon , some flexible states hope to rebuild their stability by holding elections . 
As we saw in Lebanon and Iraq in 2009 , others probably could not . 
The small , emirates of the Gulf Cooperation Council are - with the exception of now tottering Dubai  -  flourishing states that have joined the global economy through political and economic reform . 
Managing social and political inclusion is not difficult for states blessed with an advantageous position along one of the world &apos;s major trade routes , traditions of cosmopolitanism and commerce , massive oil wealth , and small national populations . 
The frightening state in the region is the United States , which , following the terrorist attacks of September 2001 , was anxious to bring about democratic regime change - a failed policy that now appears to have left the US unable to leave . 
Two other external powers , Russia and China , have established a strategic presence in the region , but their pursuit of their interests , which are chiefly economic , is not destabilizing and has nothing to do with democracy promotion . 
The change of administration in Washington replaced America &apos;s emphasis on democratizing the Middle East with a more realistic approach in 2009 . 
But Barack Obama has also raised expectations of a transformation in US relations with the region . 
Can that happen without democratization ? 
Oil is not a reliable deterrent to democracy in the long term , owing to price volatility and the development of alternative energy sources . 
Moreover , democratic experiments in countries like Qatar , the only state on the Arabian Peninsula other than Saudi Arabia that embraces the austere Wahhabi form of Islam , provide a telling counterpoint . 
If Saudi Wahhabis accept democratic procedures , Wahhabism will be forced to change its guiding attitudes and principles . 
In Kuwait , another flourishing state , Wahabbi participation in parliament came only after permission was granted by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia , Sheikh Abdul Aziz Bin Baz , and his successor , Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s Wahhabi establishment , it seems , objects to democratic reform only at home , where the regime &apos;s power would be weakened . 
Following the turbulence and violence of Iran &apos;s presidential elections in June , the question of democracy has moved to the forefront for the region &apos;s states and populations . 
In Iran , an indigenous movement is pushing for reform , and the country &apos;s brand of Islam , which on the surface seems the most implacable , has the potential to become more moderate and more democratic , owing in part to the Shi &apos;a tradition of ijtihad , religious debate or innovation . 
But the push to democratization is connected not only to oil , Islam , and US policies ; demographic forces and the technologies of globalization are creating pressures for change as well . 
An overwhelmingly young population is being exposed to the outside world and communicating with peers in the region - through travel , satellite TV , and the Internet - as never before . 
This has increased demands for social and political rights and greater economic opportunity , placing authoritarian rule under growing strain . 
Indeed , political change in the Middle East will increasingly become an internal affair in 2010 and beyond . 
Although some democratic experiments have led to greater instability , the poorer countries have no option but to continue on that path . 
As for those who rely exclusively on oil for continued stability , delaying democratization will lead to violence in the long term . 
Unless sectarian politics are replaced by inclusiveness , all of the region &apos;s &quot; f-states &quot; types of states will remain in a condition of prolonged turbulence .
