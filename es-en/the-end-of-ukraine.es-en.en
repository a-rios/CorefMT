The End of Ukraine ? 
Ukraine &apos;s future as an independent democratic state hangs in the balance . 
President Leonid Kuchma stands accused of complicity in the murder of Georgy Gongadze , a journalist whose headless , mutilated body was identified this week , months after his disappearance . 
Revelations about Mr Kuchma &apos;s involvement in a host of crimes from murder to corruption came from a former bodyguard , who after secretly bugging the President &apos;s office , leaked tapes , which - if proved authentic - are a devastating indictment . 
Mr Kuchma has now endorsed an investigation , even suggesting that foreign experts be included . 
While a praiseworthy gesture , it cannot be converted into reality unless Mr Kuchma stands aside and allows the investigation to go forward . 
Even as he claims to support an investigation , President Kuchma , takes any available opportunity to lash out at his opponents . 
In a letter to The Financial Times , he said &quot; my main accusers are precisely the same people who have blocked Ukraine &apos;s transformation to a free economy &quot; - condemning his critics for using Mr Gongadze &apos;s death as &quot; a political weapon designed to destabilize Ukraine . &quot; 
Mr Kuchma publicly denounced the crowds of protesters against him as &quot; a herd under various flags . &quot; 
If Mr Kuchma remains recalcitrant , continues to harass political opponents and the media , and drags his feet on the investigation , he risks relegating Ukraine to the same fate as neighbouring Belarus , where a repressive regime , embraced only by Russia , silences independent voices and political opposition 
The outside world cannot stand idly by . 
Western governments are already deeply involved in Ukraine . 
Among former Soviet republics , Ukraine is the single biggest recipient of US aid and , worldwide , the fourth largest recipient of American aid . 
In the period 1991-97 , the European Union , and member states gave ECU 4.2 billion of which 1.8 billion was in grants . 
Since the early 1990s , the World Bank has approved more than $ 3 billion in loans and grants and two guarantees amounting to $ 220 million . 
This large-scale Western involvement was motivated mainly by geopolitical considerations . 
I , too , have been deeply engaged in Ukraine , but my aim has been to help Ukraine and other former Soviet countries make the transition from closed to open societies . 
I established the Ukrainian Renaissance Foundation in 1989 , two years before Ukraine became an independent country . 
Since then I have given more than $ 100 million to support Ukraine . 
I first met Mr Kuchma when he was a candidate in the 1994 presidential elections . 
President Richard Nixon had invited us to lunch . 
As fate would have it , Mr Nixon died that day so Mr Kuchma and I dined alone . 
At the time the Ukrainian politician impressed me as more energetic and dedicated than his predecessor . 
After his promising start , I watched the decline in Mr Kuchma &apos;s performance with dismay . 
I observed the increasing pressure on the independent media and the use of questionable methods during his re-election campaign . 
I cautioned the West against tolerating the President &apos;s excesses because of Ukraine &apos;s sensitive geopolitical position . 
I warned that his re-election would strengthen corrupt oligarchs , such as Oleksander Volkov , who had bankrolled his campaign . 
In February , Mr Kuchma awarded Volkov , whose money laundering was Mr Gongadze &apos;s final investigative target , Ukraine highest order of merit . 
I last saw Mr Kuchma in November . 
I was taken aback by his scathing , virulent remarks about Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and former Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko . 
I told him that earlier that day I had seen Mr Yushchenko , who professed loyalty to Mr Kuchma . 
It stood in stark contrast to the President &apos;s statements . 
I pleaded that it would be better for the future of his country if the two could work together . 
Later , I found myself in the uncomfortable position of urging Mr Yushchenko to try to accommodate the President . 
That was before the disclosure of Mr Kuchma &apos;s possible role in Gongadze &apos;s assassination . 
Now , Ukrainian public opinion is demanding an independent investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Gongadze &apos;s death . 
Demonstrators turn out for protests , which are growing in strength , to call for an investigation and increasingly , for Mr Kuchma &apos;s resignation . 
If Mr. Kuchma cares about Ukraine &apos;s survival as an independent democratic state , he must take responsibility for his actions and step aside , pending the results of the investigation . 
The West must now take a clear position , denouncing Mr Kuchma &apos;s behavior and actions . 
The international community to cannot continue to do business with Mr Kuchma until an impartial investigation has been completed and those responsible are held accountable . 
The population needs to know that the West stands with them , opposing any attempt by Mr Kuchma to evade responsibility - and ultimately , the law . 
I remain committed to helping the development of open society in Ukraine . 
I urge other donors to maintain their support for civil society there . 
It would be tragic if Mr Kuchma &apos;s failings were to compel the international community to abandon Ukraine &apos;s civil society in these most difficult times .
