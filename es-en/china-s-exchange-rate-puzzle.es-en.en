China &apos;s Exchange-Rate Puzzle 
China &apos;s abrupt decision to raise the value of the renminbi ( yuan ) by 2.1 % and to end its peg to the dollar comes after months of pressure from the US . 
Indeed , the economist Robert Mundell , whose work on optimal monetary zones is credited with laying the theoretical groundwork for the euro , insists that China should maintain its fixed exchange rate as a necessary part of its current phase of economic development . 
But , owing to China &apos;s skewed economic structure , its exchange-rate regime presents much more challenging problems than those encountered by Japan and other East Asian economies . 
Pegged exchange rates clearly have been essential to East Asia &apos;s economic takeoff , for they work well with the region &apos;s export-oriented development model . 
But the effectiveness of a fixed exchange rate is determined by how developments in the export sector influence domestic industries and the national economy as a whole . 
If growth in the trade sector boosts that of domestic non-trade sectors , then a fixed exchange rate will not put pressure on the external balance of payments as demand for imports rises . 
Under these circumstances , revaluation of the exchange rate will not have a severe impact on an economy &apos;s development . 
For example , Japanese economists argue that the Plaza Agreement , which called for &quot; orderly appreciation &quot; of non-dollar currencies against the dollar , was a natural outgrowth of high national income . 
This was one of the major reasons for Japan &apos;s acceptance of the change . 
But China &apos;s current situation is vastly different . 
Pressure for revaluation comes at a stage when per capita national income is merely $ 1,000 , not $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 , so China still needs a rather long period of rapid economic growth to reach anything like the stage that Japan had achieved when it allowed the yen to be revalued . 
Equally important , unlike other East Asian economies during their early take-off stages , the expansion of China &apos;s export sector in the last decade has not been closely linked to the development of its domestic non-trade sector , because the expansion has been fueled mainly by foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . 
Most of China 460,000 foreign-owned enterprises are concentrated in manufacturing and assembling , increasing the import-intensiveness of exports and de-linking the external-trade sector from domestic industries . 
This helps to widen regional disparities , especially between eastern and western China , with the wealthiest regions being those that have benefited from high concentrations of FDI . 
No one should realistically expect the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate to be determined solely by the income level of the relatively prosperous eastern coastal regions . 
To be sure , China has accumulated an enormous balance-of-payments surplus , which indicates that the renminbi is greatly undervalued . 
But the surplus merely masks the structural problems of China &apos;s domestic economic sectors and poorer regions . 
Indeed , if foreign-owned enterprises exports are deducted from the total trade volume , the surplus vanishes , because both the overall balance of merchandise trade and the balance of trade in services normally run deficits . 
In short , the isolation of the export sector from the rest of China &apos;s economy , caused by the dominance of FDI , accounts for the illusion of an undervalued renminbi . 
Although the expansion of exports has been dramatic , now accounting for 70 % of China &apos;s GDP , it has exerted no pull on other economic sectors , because it has been confined to foreign-owned manufacturing and assembling enterprises . 
With its huge domestic economy , China would never have been able to accumulate such an enormous external surplus if its growth had not been confined to such enterprises . 
Pressure for revaluation stems , therefore , not from the real needs of China economy , but from large imbalances in the United States , particularly its long-standing trade deficit , which exceeds 5 % of GDP . 
However , dollar supremacy means that the US can sustain a much wider balance-of-payments deficit than other countries . 
As long as Asia holds its foreign reserves in dollars China &apos;s desire to maintain a stable value for the reminbi will continue to offer tremendous advantages for trade and economic development .
