India \ u0027s Divide and Misrule 
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind . 
So said Mahatma Gandhi , the apostle of non-violence . 
Today communal violence ravages his home state Gujarat . 
Were Gandhi alive to witness today &apos;s communal violence between Hindus and Muslims in Gujarat , he would sink into despair . 
The current spate of violence began on February 27 th , when a train carrying many Hindu devotees was set ablaze by some Muslims at Godhra , Gujarat . 
Retaliation against Muslims came swift - the next day - and has smouldered since , leaving hundreds dead , orphaned , and homeless . 
The tension boils on thanks , in part , to the refusal of Gujarat &apos;s government to pursue and prosecute the perpetrators of the crime . 
That such bloodshed occurred in today &apos;s Gujarat is surprising , for the state is no economic backwater but is , instead , one of India &apos;s most dynamic states . 
Moreover , it has been noted for tolerance : not only Muslims , but of Parsees ( a minority community from Persia who practice Zorastrianism ) . 
So why did such a state suddenly explode ? 
The politics of division that bedevils Indian national politics is in ugly display in Gujarat . 
True raj dharma ( good governance ) creates the conditions for social trust and tolerance to flourish . 
But instead of seeking to encourage these civic ( and economic ) virtues , the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) use threats of communal violence to boost its electoral ends . 
But playing with fire brought only momentary advantages . 
After the Gujarat violence the national BJP government faced a &quot; censure motion &quot; vote in parliament . 
It survived , but was none the less discomforted by it . 
Voters , indeed , increasingly see through such cynical toying with ethnic and religious divisions , for it is clear that prompt arrest and prosecution of those who instigated the Godhra incident would have brought independent voters flocking to the BJP . 
The party has squandered that opportunity . 
Of course , the BJP is not alone in seeking to exploit India &apos;s religious and caste divisions . 
Even the venerable Congress party - which led India &apos;s struggle for independence - manipulates religious , communal and caste rivalries so as to boost its chances of forming government . 
Thankfully , many small parties , who are the key to coalition politics , are pressing the big parties to behave more responsibly . 
For example , some of the 15 or so centrist parties who support the BJP-led coalition national government are demanding real action in Gujarat , including removal of its Chief Minister . 
They still support Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee , but their demands for accountability have laid down boundaries beyond which the BJP and Congress will now stray only at the risk of paying a high political cost . 
The BJP can &apos;t take such risks because it fears holding early elections . 
Although BJP members trumpet the party &apos;s fundamentalist Hindu agenda , it won power nationally on its promise to deliver good government after the seeming corruption and chaos of the Congress party &apos;s previous term in power . 
&quot; Good government &quot; remains the public &apos;s biggest concern , and the BJP knows that murderous riots will undermine its claim to be delivering such . 
The Congress , however , is keen to push for elections because it scents blood . 
Its performance in local and state elections has improved markedly since Congress &apos;s popularity collapsed in the early 1990s and it now rules 14 of the 29 states ( including government of the national capital region Delhi ) . 
Should an election take place , Congress is likely to increase its strength in parliament . 
But until Congress forges an attractive political program , and acquires charisma beyond that inherited from the Nehru family , it seems condemned to opposition . 
Of course , the Nehru family name still commands loyalty among India &apos;s masses , but that is a shallow political foundation in a democracy . 
Moreover , reliance on the Nehru / Gandhi name prevents the party from addressing its malaise because many party leaders still think that they can rely on the old magic to win . 
Good governments must emphasise real development , which means removing what the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen calls the unfreedoms of illiteracy , ill-health and social deprivation . 
The smouldering fires of Gujarat provide India &apos;s politician with a moment to do as Sen suggests . 
It calls for speedy and impartial rehabilitation to the victims and bringing to trial in a transparent manner the perpetrators of these crimes . 
Only such decisive actions can break India &apos;s cycle of divide and misrule . 
&quot; Into that heaven of freedom , my Father , let my country awake , &quot; wrote the Nobel laureate Rabindra Nath Tagore in Gitanjali in 1912 . 
His sentiments remain relevant for today &apos;s India . 
Wake up Gujarat ! 
Wake up India !
