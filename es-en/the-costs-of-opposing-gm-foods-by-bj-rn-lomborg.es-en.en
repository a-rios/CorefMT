A Golden Rice Opportunity 
S√ÉO PAULO - Finally , after 12 years of delay caused by opponents of genetically modified ( GM ) foods , so-called &quot; golden rice &quot; with vitamin A will be grown in the Philippines . 
Over those 12 years , about eight million children worldwide died from vitamin A deficiency . 
Are anti-GM advocates not partly responsible ? 
Golden rice is the most prominent example in the global controversy over GM foods , which pits a technology with some risks but incredible potential against the resistance of feel-good campaigning . 
Three billion people depend on rice as their staple food , with 10 % at risk for vitamin A deficiency , which , according to the World Health Organization , causes 250,000-500,000 children to go blind each year . 
Of these , half die within a year . 
A study from the British medical journal The Lancet estimates that , in total , vitamin A deficiency kills 668,000 children under the age of five each year . 
Yet , despite the cost in human lives , anti-GM campaigners - from Greenpeace to Naomi Klein - have derided efforts to use golden rice to avoid vitamin A deficiency . 
In India , Vandana Shiva , an environmental activist and adviser to the government , called golden rice &quot; a hoax &quot; that is &quot; creating hunger and malnutrition , not solving it . &quot; 
The New York Times Magazinereported in 2001 that one would need to &quot; eat 15 pounds of cooked golden rice a day &quot; to get enough vitamin A. What was an exaggeration then is demonstrably wrong now . 
Two recent studies in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition show that just 50 grams ( roughly two ounces ) of golden rice can provide 60 % of the recommended daily intake of vitamin A. They show that golden rice is even better than spinach in providing vitamin A to children . 
Opponents maintain that there are better ways to deal with vitamin A deficiency . 
In its latest statement , Greenpeace says that golden rice is &quot; neither needed nor necessary , &quot; and calls instead for supplementation and fortification , which are described as &quot; cost-effective . &quot; 
To be sure , handing out vitamin pills or adding vitamin A to staple products can make a difference . 
But it is not a sustainable solution to vitamin A deficiency . 
And , while it is cost-effective , recent published estimates indicate that golden rice is much more so . 
Supplementation programs costs $ 4,300 for every life they save in India , whereas fortification programs cost about $ 2,700 for each life saved . 
Both are great deals . 
But golden rice would cost just $ 100 for every life saved from vitamin A deficiency . 
Similarly , it is argued that golden rice will not be adopted , because most Asians eschew brown rice . 
But brown rice is substantially different in taste and spoils easily in hot climates . 
Moreover , many Asian dishes are already colored yellow with saffron , annatto , achiote , and turmeric . 
The people , not Greenpeace , should decide whether they will adopt vitamin A-rich rice for themselves and their children . 
Most ironic is the self-fulfilling critique that many activists now use . 
Greenpeace calls golden rice a &quot; failure , &quot; because it &quot; has been in development for almost 20 years and has still not made any impact on the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency . &quot; 
But , as Ingo Potrykus , the scientist who developed golden rice , has made clear , that failure is due almost entirely to relentless opposition to GM foods - often by rich , well-meaning Westerners far removed from the risks of actual vitamin A deficiency . 
Regulation of goods and services for public health clearly is a good idea ; but it must always be balanced against potential costs - in this case , the cost of not providing more vitamin A to eight million children over the past 12 years . 
As an illustration , current regulations for GM foods , if applied to non-GM products , would bar the sale of potatoes and tomatoes , which can contain poisonous glycoalkaloids ; celery , which contains carcinogenic psoralens ; rhubarb and spinach ( oxalic acid ) ; and cassava , which feeds about half a billion people , but contains toxic cyanogenic alkaloids . 
Foodstuffs like soy , wheat , milk , eggs , mollusks , crustaceans , fish , sesame , nuts , peanuts , and kiwi would likewise be banned , because they can cause food allergies . 
Here it is worth noting that there have been no documented human health effects from GM foods . 
But many campaigners have claimed other effects . 
A common story , still repeated by Shiva , is that GM corn with Bt toxin kills Monarch butterflies . 
Several peer-reviewed studies , however , have effectively established that &quot; the impact of Bt corn pollen from current commercial hybrids on monarch butterfly populations is negligible . &quot; 
Greenpeace and many others claim that GM foods merely enable big companies like Monsanto to wield near-monopoly power . 
But that puts the cart before the horse : The predominance of big companies partly reflects anti-GM activism , which has made the approval process so long and costly that only rich companies catering to first-world farmers can afford to see it through . 
Finally , it is often claimed that GM crops simply mean costlier seeds and less money for farmers . 
But farmers have a choice . 
More than five million cotton farmers in India have flocked to GM cotton , because it yields higher net incomes . 
Yes , the seeds are more expensive , but the rise in production offsets the additional cost . 
Of course , no technology is without flaws , so regulatory oversight is useful . 
But it is worth maintaining some perspective . 
In 2010 , the European Commission , after considering 25 years of GM-organisms ( GMOs ) research , concluded that &quot; there is , as of today , no scientific evidence associating GMOs with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms . &quot; 
Now , finally , golden rice will come to the Philippines ; after that , it is expected in Bangladesh and Indonesia . 
But , for eight million kids , the wait was too long . 
True to form , Greenpeace is already protesting that &quot; the next &quot; golden rice &quot; guinea pigs might be Filipino children . &quot; 
The 4.4 million Filipino kids with vitamin A deficiency might not mind so much .
