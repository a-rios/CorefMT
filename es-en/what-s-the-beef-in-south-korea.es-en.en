What &apos;s the Beef in South Korea ? 
NEW YORK - At the outset of the ongoing violent protests in South Korea over imported beef from the United States , the entire cabinet of South Korean President Lee Myung-bak offered to resign . Last week , President Lee fired three of them . 
But beef , it turns out , represents just the tip of the iceberg of grievances against President Lee . 
Only four months in office , his approval rating is down to single digits . 
Lee won the December 2007 election with 48.7 % of the vote , having run on the &quot; 747 &quot; platform , promising 7 % annual GDP growth , per capita income of $ 40,000 , and to make Korea the world &apos;s seventh largest economy ( up from 13th currently ) . 
During his inauguration speech , he vowed to revive the economy , strengthen relations with the US , and deal with North Korea . 
So what went wrong ? 
The economy is slowing - the Bank of Korea cut its growth forecast for this year to 4.7 % , while the OECD expects only 4.3 % growth - inflation is rising , and some are concerned that Lee &apos;s policies are too geared toward foreign investors and big business . 
Lee also must confront factors beyond his control , such as soaring oil prices and the global credit crunch . 
Beyond the economy , Lee has been faced with charges of appointing officials with questionable ethics and of heavy-handed leadership ( his nickname is &quot; Bulldozer &quot; ) , which is reflected in efforts to push through a controversial cross-country canal system and an unpopular proposal to privatize the healthcare system . 
Furthermore , Lee &apos;s hard-line approach to North Korea - very different from that of his predecessors - has resulted in a popular backlash . 
To be sure , as North Korea seemingly snubbed the international community in recent years , there was considerable popular discontent with the previous two administrations &quot; &quot; sunshine &quot; policy , which emphasized peaceful cooperation prior to eventual Korean unification . 
But now , with the North &apos;s destruction of key elements of its nuclear program , international negotiations appear to be bearing fruit , and Lee &apos;s tougher stance has gained less approval than might have been anticipated when he came to office . 
The combined effect of these developments has been to erode Lee &apos;s reputation precipitously . 
Now , on top of everything , comes the beef controversy . 
In April , on his first foreign trip following his inauguration , Lee traveled to the US . 
On the eve of the visit , his government agreed to lift the five-year-old ban on US beef imports as part of efforts to improve bilateral ties following years of up-and-down relations during former President Roh Moo-hyun &apos;s administration . 
While most in the West applauded Lee &apos;s visit , the reaction in Korea was significantly more negative . 
Many in Korea viewed the beef decision as having been hastily taken , and without appropriate consultation of all relevant parties . 
In addition , significant segments of the population saw the agreement as Lee selling out or kowtowing to the Americans . 
The public reaction began with a demonstration in Seoul on May 2 in which hundreds of teenagers held a candlelight vigil . 
Soon , tens of thousands of Koreans joined the protests . 
Lee seems to have misjudged the strength of his election victory and the currents of opinion in several important ways . 
Given the nationalist sentiments motivating the beef protesters , the strength of opposition forces , and widespread hostility to opening and privatizing the South Korean economy further , Lee , whose authoritarian style of management reminds many of the era of military rule , will now need to move forward carefully . 
Lee must reach out to the opposition , both within his party and outside it , to build agreement or negotiate compromise on the contentious issues that his administration faces . 
He must reach out to the people of Korea and demonstrate that he is willing to listen to their concerns and act accordingly . 
Finally , he must act on his campaign promises to build a more prosperous and confident Korea . 
The upside of all this political turmoil is that it demonstrates the vigor of Korean democracy . 
Lee &apos;s task now is to discover how best to take advantage of this new political activism . 
He has faced political adversity before , and he will again . 
And , with approval ratings in the single digits , there &apos;s nowhere to go but up .
