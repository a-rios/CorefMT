Free Trade or Freebies for the Powerful ? 
As the United States Congress begins to debate the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement ( DR-CAFTA ) , a titanic struggle between the forces of free trade and protectionism promises to unfold . 
But that debate should not be allowed to mask the truth behind this treaty : the DR-CAFTA is more a pleading of special interests than a free-trade deal . 
It manages simultaneously to fleece the people of six poor countries and to put US workers in harm &apos;s way . 
To be sure , expanded trade holds great promise for promoting development and democracy . 
But the trade rules inscribed in DR-CAFTA promote profits for a few at the expense of the well being of the many . 
Ironically , the pact even limits market competition to protect powerful special interests , undercutting the core principles of free trade . 
Consider pharmaceuticals . 
For Central Americans , the cost of drugs will soar , straining budgets and gutting health care . 
The result may be a death sentence for many . 
In agriculture , small farmers would be placed on a collision course with US agro-business and their heavily subsidized farm exports . 
The US exported paddy rice , for example , at a price almost 20 % lower than the cost of production in 2003 , making it impossible for Central Americans to compete . 
As for labor rights , the agreement makes a devil &apos;s bargain : it opens trade while locking in a status quo that is appalling . 
Workers face everything from rampant discrimination against older people ( those over 35 ) to physical abuse , lack of bathroom breaks , no overtime pay , and poverty wages . 
In principle , workers can seek remedies by joining a union and bargaining collectively . 
In Guatemala , the largest economy , less than 3 % of workers are unionized and their unions are marginal . 
The DR-CAFTA pays lip service to international labor standards as enshrined in the International Labor Organization &apos;s core labor rights , but promptly throws them overboard . 
Instead , countries are committed only to enforcing their own labor laws , which often seem designed to prevent workers from joining a union . 
Moreover , enforcement of the rights that do exist is trapped somewhere between ineptitude and corruption . 
As if this were not bad enough , the agreement jettisons everything we &apos;ve learned over the last 30 years or so about international pressure and labor law reform . 
The stronger provisions of previous trade agreements , such as the Generalized System of Preferences ( GSP ) and the Caribbean Basin Initiative ( CBI ) , have been dumped . 
Although trade with Central America represents only about 1.5 % of total US trade , the outcome of the debate on DR-CAFTA will shape US trade policy - which sets the tone for other rich countries &quot; stance in trade talks - for years to come . 
A trade agreement such as this puts US and Central American workers in the same labor market . 
If the whip is cracked in Tegucigalpa today , workers in Charlotte will feel it tomorrow . 
If Salvadorans &quot; wages are squeezed , they won &apos;t be buying many products made in Los Angeles - unless , of course , they wind up moving there . 
The anemic labor standards enshrined in this agreement encourage firms to compete by taking the low road , a route that puts them on a collision course with China &apos;s rock-bottom wages . 
They could just as easily take the high road : much evidence indicates that workers who are rewarded rather than victimized can contribute to greater competitiveness for firms in the long run . 
It is hypocritical to promote democracy and then sign a trade agreement that denies workers the basic democratic right to organize and join unions . 
Without this right , elections may not add up to democracy . 
The checks and balances that unions provide are essential in the workplace , but they are even more important in sustaining fledgling democratic regimes . 
The issue is not free trade versus protectionism , but &quot; smart trade &quot; versus &quot; polarizing trade . &quot; 
Smart trade creates balanced development , while polarizing trade rewards a small circle of winners at the expense of the many . 
Smart trade requires two key provisions : core labor rights , backed up by tough enforcement , and a development fund targeting infrastructure and education to boost competitiveness . 
DR-CAFTA does neither . 
Instead , it condemns Central America to carry its dismal past far into the future . 
Rejecting it opens the possibility for freer markets and faster income growth in Central America , as well as healthier democracies .
