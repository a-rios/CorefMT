Governments Without Opposition 
America &apos;s mid-term elections provide the latest example of an expanding phenomenon : democratic governments that face no effective challenge by an opposition . 
More precisely , this phenomenon entails the growing number of democratically elected political leaders who do not confront alternative leaders able to gather the disaffected into a viable opposition . 
The phenomenon is by no means confined to what once was the political right . 
Britain is nowadays experiencing what can almost be called the self-destruction of the opposition Conservative Party . 
For the third time in seven years the Tories are devouring their own leader , without any viable alternative leader for the party anywhere in sight . 
In Germany , Gerhard Schröder &apos;s narrow victory is made secure by the intense soul-searching now underway among the defeated Christian Democrat opposition , as well as because of the moral collapse of the CDU &apos;s junior partner , the Free Democrats . 
Even more starkly unbalanced political landscapes can be found in France and Italy , where neither President Chirac nor Prime Minister Berlusconi need fear their challengers ; indeed neither has a challenger to speak of . 
Moreover , this situation is not confined to Europe . 
The self-destruction of the Congress Party has left India &apos;s government unworried by any political threat from outside its own ranks . 
In Russia , President Putin bestrides his country &apos;s elected Duma like Gulliver over the Lilliputians . 
How and why has this happened ? 
How , in particular , can this situation be explained in view of the fact that today &apos;s unchallenged heads of government are ( at least for the most part ) not towering leaders whose charisma shields them from opposition ? 
One reason is the ongoing personalisation of politics that is taking place everywhere in the world . 
Whether someone is charismatic or not , voters want a figurehead , and preferably one with celebrity value . 
This &apos; celebrity &apos; may be based on personality , as with Blair and Berlusconi , or on circumstance , as with Bush and Schröder and Putin , but it is part and parcel of the new politics of media appeal . 
Behind this , however , lies a deeper change to democracy . 
The end of ideology has been invoked so often that one hesitates to repeat the phrase . 
Still , it is a fact that in all cases of governments without effective opposition it is not easy to formulate an electorally viable alternative policy to challenge the leaders . 
Mr Putin is perhaps the most exteme in this regard , but Blair and Berlusconi are not far behind in possessing this &quot; policy immunity . &quot; 
They could form coalitions with anyone , not least with each other , whatever their traditional political affiliations may be . 
It is difficult to trip them up by offering alternative policies in any field . 
However , this condition may not last . 
In at least two respects , alternative policy options are beginning to emerge , and these may one day dominate public debate . 
Domestically , there is an obvious difference between advocates of a &quot; European model &quot; of social and moral capitalism and others who adhere to the neoliberal &quot; Washington consensus &quot; that Europeans associate with America &apos;s economic model . 
Internationally , the clash between unilateralists and multilateralists is not confined to the United States . 
Some see it , in present circumstances , as a clash between peace by negotiation and active , even pre-emptive intervention . 
Then there are the great unspoken issues . 
Law and order is on the agenda of most governments , but many voters feel that it still does not have proper prominence . 
In the EU , European integration is taken for granted by most political parties in the older member states of the Union , but a sizeable portion of these electorates have doubts about it , and in the EU &apos;s candidate countries , the doubts run even stronger . 
Thus , despite today &apos;s political quiet , major cleavage between apparently unchallenged leaders and shifting popular moods may be gaining strength below the surface . 
This disquiet is expressed in several ways . 
One is through voter apathy . 
Most of the leaders mentioned earlier command a strong loyalty from only a small minority of their total electorates , so their legitimacy is dubious . 
Another takes the form of &quot; opposition by media . &quot; 
This has become an issue in a number of countries , and it has led some governments ( as President Putin &apos;s did recently ) to try and curb freedom of expression . 
Then there is the tell-tale emergence and disappearance of protest parties like the Dutch groups gathered by the murdered Pim Fortuyn . 
The tale they tell is one of the failure of democratic institutions as they now stand . 
This tale is further underlined by the growing role of &quot; the street , &quot; of demonstrations of public irritation focusing on particular issues but really directed against unchallenged governments . 
The result is a worrying combination of creeping authoritarianism among those who rule with a growing unrest of the ruled . 
As so often the case , there is no patent medicine against this syndrome . 
However , the crying need for an effective institutional , usually parliamentary , opposition is evident . 
Governments without opposition pose a threat to democracy itself . 
To defend our liberty we need domestic democracy at least as much as a readiness to attack whatever &quot; forces of evil &quot; may exist elsewhere in the world .
