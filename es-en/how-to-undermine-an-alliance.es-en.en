How to Undermine an Alliance 
TOKYO - 2010 marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Japan-United States Security Treaty . 
But , instead of celebrating an agreement that has helped stabilize East Asia for a half-century , the treaty is now at serious risk , as much from indecision as from kneejerk anti-Americanism . 
In August 2009 , Japan &apos;s people voted for &quot; change . &quot; 
The Liberal Democratic Party , which had ruled Japan for most of the post-war decades , lost parliamentary elections to the Democratic Party of Japan . 
The key reason for the DPJ &apos;s victory was that voters were fed up with the LDP . 
That feeling had been growing in the country for some time . 
In the election of 2005 , the LDP retained power only because Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi positioned the LDP as an agent of change . 
But after Koizumi left office , Japan &apos;s prime ministers - Shinzo Abe , Yasuo Fukuda , and Taro Aso - came and went so swiftly that our country &apos;s leadership came to seem like a &quot; soup du jour . &quot; 
With so little respect being shown for the LDP &apos;s leaders , it is no surprise that Japanese voters lost what little patience they had left for the party and its antiquated practices . 
So the DPJ took power , and formed a coalition government with two smaller parties , the Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) , and the People &apos;s New Party ( PNP ) . 
The DPJ &apos;s only reason for being , however , is its anti-LDP stance , while the SDP has long opposed the Japan-US Security Treaty , and the PNP strongly opposes the privatizations of the Koizumi era . 
That does not amount to a coherent government program , and Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama &apos;s administration quickly revealed the DPJ &apos;s fundamental hollowness . 
But the biggest problem with Hatoyama &apos;s government is that the DPJ took power without a coherent national security policy . 
The DPJ was established in 1998 as a &quot; jambalaya &quot; party , consisting of people who had abandoned the LDP , including Hatoyama himself , and the former Socialist Party . 
One of the DPJ &apos;s major campaign pledges was &quot; change , &quot; which , at its core , meant anything but the LDP . 
But should opposing the LDP really mean undoing 50 years of work on national security ? 
Although that now seems to be the case , the DPJ gave only a few lines to national security in its election manifesto , thereby avoiding infighting between the party &apos;s left-wingers , who oppose the Japan-US Security Treaty , and its right-wingers , who support it . 
Quite a few members of Hatoyama &apos;s cabinet are as much &quot; anti-Japan &quot; as they are anti-US . 
For example , Yoshito Sengoku , Minister of State for Government Revitalization , was once a member of Shaseidou , a left-wing youth group that is reflexively anti-American , as was Hirotaka Akamatsu , Minister of Agriculture , Forestry , and Fisheries . 
As a result , Hatoyama &apos;s administration seems to be trying to emulate South Korea &apos;s former Roh Moo-hyun administration , which foolishly sought to distance that country from its main defensive partner , the US . 
Indeed , many in the DPJ cabinet are baby boomers influenced by the radical student groups that opposed the Japan-US Security Treaty 50 years ago . 
But , as these would-be radicals play politics with Japan &apos;s national security , serious tensions are mounting in our region . 
China continues its military build-up , and North Korea remorselessly pursues nuclear weapons while refusing to resolve or even explain its abduction of dozens of Japanese citizens over the years . 
Instead of dealing with these concrete threats to Japan , Hatoyama continues to act like an opposition politician by attacking the LDP and undermining one of the proudest achievements of LDP rule , the deep and trusting alliance with the US . 
Of course , disagreements do arise in the Japan-US relationship . 
A realignment of US military forces in Japan is needed , with priority given to relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base on Okinawa , which houses half of the 47,000 US troops in Japan . 
It makes no sense to have that base located in the middle of a densely populated town , making it one of the most visible and tempting targets in the world . 
Hatoyama &apos;s administration , however , is attempting to reverse the current plan , which the LDP administration and the US had agreed upon after long and intense discussions . 
The problem is that Hatoyama , in backing away from the agreed plan , has no viable alternative to offer . 
One day Hatoyama suggests relocating the base outside of Japan , perhaps to Guam , and then next he suggests only moving it outside Okinawa , giving an impression to the world of a feckless national security strategy . 
In November , when US President Barack Obama visited Japan , Hatoyama uttered the words &quot; trust me &quot; in an attempt to settle the issue . 
The next day , he said things that completely contradicted what he had just told Obama - stunning the US government and ordinary Japanese alike . 
Since then , his administration &apos;s approval rating has dropped from 80 % to 50 % . 
People are discovering that Hatoyama is incapable of making - and sticking with - a decision . 
To be sure , finding an alternative location for the US base is extremely difficult , as Japanese are as prone to NIMBY ( not in my backyard ) reactions as anyone else . 
Moving the base to the lightly populated Henoko District in the northern part of Okinawa - a solution agreed by both governments - is the only realistic choice . 
Yet Hatoyama dithers , undermining the most important pillar of peace and security in the Pacific , the Japan-US alliance . 
This is not a favorable situation for Japan , the US , or , indeed , the entire world .
