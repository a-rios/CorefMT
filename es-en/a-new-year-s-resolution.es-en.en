A New Year \ u0027s Resolution 
It is time for New Year &apos;s resolutions , and this year &apos;s are obvious . 
When the millennium opened , world leaders pledged to seek peace , the end of poverty , and a cleaner environment . 
Since then , the world has seen countless acts of violence , terrorism , famine , and environmental degradation . 
In 2005 , we can begin to change direction . 
Knowledge , scientific advance , travel , and global communications give us many opportunities to find solutions for the world &apos;s great problems . 
When a new disease called SARS hit China last year , the World Health Organization coordinated the actions of dozens of governments , and the crisis was quickly brought under control , at least for now . 
When Bill Gates donated $ 1 billion to bring vaccines to poor children , he made it possible to protect tens of millions of young people from preventable diseases . 
When an agricultural research unit called the World Agroforestry Center discovered that a certain tree could help African farmers grow more food , they introduced a new and valuable approach to overcoming Africa &apos;s chronic food crisis . 
Unfortunately , such examples of international cooperation are as rare as they are impressive . 
With our knowledge , science , and technology , the horrendous living conditions of the world &apos;s poorest people could be dramatically improved . 
Millions of people could be spared malaria , HIV / AIDS , hunger , and life in slums . 
The problem is not that we lack good solutions . 
The problem is that we fail to cooperate globally to put those solutions into practice . 
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has honored me by making me his Special Adviser on the Millennium Development Goals and asking me to lead a group of scholars and development experts in identifying practical steps to reach the goals by the target date in 2015 . 
This effort , known as the UN Millennium Project , will issue its report to Secretary-General Annan on January 17 , 2005 . 
Our study , Investing in Development : A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals , will be available for free around the world at www.unmillenniumproject.org . 
What we learned is easily summarized . 
For every major problem - hunger , illiteracy , malnutrition , malaria , AIDS , drought , and so forth - there are practical solutions that are proven and affordable . 
These investments , in turn , would strengthen the private sector and economic growth . 
Yet they require global partnership between the rich and poor countries of the world . 
Most importantly , the world &apos;s richest countries need to do much more to help the poorest countries make use of modern science and technology to solve these great problems . 
The US , for example , currently spends around $ 450 billion each year on its military , but less than $ 15 billion to help the world &apos;s poorest countries fight disease , educate their children , and protect the environment . 
This is a mistake , because military approaches alone cannot make America safe . 
Only shared prosperity can truly make the planet secure . 
The US should be investing much more in peaceful economic development . 
Germany , Japan , and several other rich countries are also doing much less than they should - and much less than they promised the poor countries that they would do . 
In 2002 , all donor countries committed to &quot; make concrete efforts &quot; to reach 0.7 % of national income in development aid to poor countries . 
Germany , Japan , and the US , among others , remain far below this commitment . 
The year 2005 will offer many opportunities for citizens around the world to insist that their leaders keep their Millennium promises . 
After our report is issued in January , Secretary-General Kofi Annan will issue a report to the world in the spring , identifying the practical steps that should be taken this year . 
Around the same time , an important commission on Africa will issue a report to United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair . 
Then , in July , the UK will host the annual G-8 Summit of the rich countries . 
Blair has promised that he will make the fight against poverty and long-term climate change the two priorities of the summit . 
In September , the world &apos;s leaders will reconvene at the UN to decide on their actions during the coming decade . 
The rich and powerful nations often declare their leadership in the world . 
The US claims that it helps the world fight poverty , but instead spends its money on weapons . 
Germany and Japan say that they want a permanent seat on the UN Security Council , but neither has yet followed through on its own pledges to help the world &apos;s poorest people . 
The world &apos;s poorest countries will ask themselves why they should vote for Germany and Japan to have permanent seats on the Security Council if they can &apos;t keep their promises . 
Nothing would be wiser for the world &apos;s rich countries than to fulfill their pledges to the world &apos;s poor , hungry and disease-ridden peoples . 
Therein lies the path to sustained peace . 
2005 is the year that words can become reality , and that the world can begin to fulfill its hopes for our new millennium . 
Let us make our leaders aware that we aspire to shared peace and prosperity . 
Let us pledge that the rich and powerful should take real actions to help the poor , the weak , and the suffering .
