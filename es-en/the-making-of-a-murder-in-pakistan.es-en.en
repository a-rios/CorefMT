The Making of a Murder in Pakistan 
The assassination of Benazir Bhutto , the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country , is a serious blow to Pakistan &apos;s prospects for democracy and , indeed , its viability as a state . 
As chaos and confusion set in , we should not lose sight of President Pervez Musharraf &apos;s partial responsibility for this turn of events . 
At the very least , he cannot be absolved from his government &apos;s failure to provide Bhutto with adequate security . 
Instead , Bhutto had to pay with her life for courageously challenging extremists of all stripes - from Al-Qaeda and Taliban to the country &apos;s religious political parties and military hardliners . 
As heir to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , the legendary democratic leader who was hanged by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq &apos;s government in 1979 , Benazir emerged as a symbol of resistance at a young age - but languished in jails and exile in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Z. A. Bhutto &apos;s legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people &apos;s rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule . 
Rather than bowing to the military junta , he embraced the gallows . 
Hours before his hanging , Benazir was allowed to see her father for the last time , writing in her autobiography : &quot; I told him on my oath in his death cell , I would carry on his work . &quot; 
Her first stint as prime minister ( 1988-90 ) was brief and disorganized . 
Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul , the former Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) chief , confirmed that he sponsored an alliance of right-wing political parties to stop her from getting a parliamentary majority . 
Information about Pakistan &apos;s nuclear program and ISI operations in Afghanistan were out of her domain . 
Her second term in office ( 1993-96 ) was longer and better , but her government again fell early , owing to charges of mismanagement and corruption . 
In reality , machinations by the intelligence agencies also played a part . 
The military had developed an entrenched distrust of her , given her position as a popularly supported pro-Western leader who wanted peace with India . 
After almost a decade in self-imposed exile , Bhutoo &apos;s return to Pakistan in October gave her a fresh political start . 
Pakistan had changed , as military dictatorship and religious extremism in the north played havoc with the fabric of society . 
A tentative arrangement with Musharraf , together with Western support - particularly from the United Kingdom and the United States - eased her return , which hundreds of thousands of people welcomed , though terrorists greeted her with a string of suicide bombings . 
Bhutto &apos;s contacts with Mushararf &apos;s military government drew criticism , but she remained adamant that a return to democracy was possible only through a transition in which Musharraf would give up his military post , become a civilian head of state , and conduct free and fair elections . 
To the dismay of some democratic forces , Bhutto stayed the course even after Musharraf imposed emergency rule on November 3 and removed the country &apos;s top judges to ensure his re-election . 
Indeed , she even persuaded other important political leaders to participate in the planned January 8 election , which she viewed as an opportunity to challenge religious extremist forces in the public square . 
She seized that opportunity by bravely traveling throughout the country , despite serious threats to her life , arguing for a democratic and pluralistic Pakistan . 
One can understand why religious extremists like Al-Qaeda and Taliban would target her , and the government claims that it is impossible to defend against a suicide attack . 
But Bhutto was reportedly killed by a sharp shooter before the terrorist blew himself up . 
So , in the eyes of Pakistan &apos;s people , and especially of Bhutto &apos;s supporters , the intelligence services , either alone or in collaboration with extremists , finally decided to eliminate her . 
Whether or not the government was involved , the fact remains that Pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader . 
With Pakistan &apos;s future in the balance , the West &apos;s help and support will be crucial , but that means recognizing that Musharraf is not the only leader who can resolve Pakistan &apos;s myriad problems and manage the war on terror . 
On the contrary , by nurturing the current environment of instability and uncertainty , Musharraf himself must be regarded as one of Pakistan &apos;s biggest problems .
