Middle East Modesty 
&quot; Ripeness is all , &quot; concludes Edgar in King Lear . 
I will leave it to Shakespeare scholars to decipher what he had in mind . 
But for diplomats and historians , understanding the concept of ripeness is central to their jobs : it refers to how ready a negotiation or conflict is to be resolved . 
This may sound academic , but it is anything but . 
The United States and the three other members of the Quartet - the European Union , Russia , and the United Nations - are planning to convene many of the parties to the Israeli-Arab conflict at a meeting near Washington in November . 
The problem is that the conflict is not even close to being ripe for resolution . 
Ignoring this reality will lead to failure , if not catastrophe . 
Ripeness has several elements : there must be a formula for the parties involved to adopt , a diplomatic process to get them to that point , and protagonists who are able and willing to make a deal . 
It is not clear that any of these conditions exist in today &apos;s Middle East . 
Much has been said or written about what &quot; final status &quot; or peace between Israel and the Palestinians would look like , but important differences remain regarding borders , the status of Jerusalem and its holy places , the rights of refugees , the future of Israeli settlements , and security arrangements . 
There is also a question of process . 
Who should be involved in negotiations ? 
What issues should be on the agenda ? 
What sort of activities , including violence and settlement activity , are to be precluded while negotiations take place ? 
Most critical , though , is the condition of local leadership . 
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas may want to sign a peace accord with Israel , but there is little evidence that he is in a position to do so . 
He has lost all authority in Gaza , and has a tenuous hold over the West Bank . 
If Palestine were a state , it would be judged to have failed . 
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is in a stronger but still uncertain position . 
His coalition government survives mainly because many members of Israel &apos;s parliament know that they would lose their seats in an early election . 
It is an open question whether the most that Olmert would likely be able and willing to offer would meet the least that Abbas would be able to accept . 
Trying to end the Middle East conflict in such a climate would be futile . 
Worse yet , failure would strengthen those on both sides of the dispute who argue that diplomacy is a waste of time . 
So what , then , should be done ? 
First , it is important that expectations be kept modest . 
&quot; Success &quot; needs to be defined narrowly . 
Calls for an agreement on the most controversial elements of a final peace settlement are unrealistic . 
Simply agreeing to an agenda for follow-up meetings would be an accomplishment . 
Here , and elsewhere , the US will need to take the lead ; the parties cannot be expected to reach consensus by themselves . 
Second , it is essential that this meeting be the start of a serious process , not a one-time event . 
Rigid timetables that history suggests would not be met should be eschewed . 
But no one should walk away doubting the determination of the US and other members of the Quartet to see this process succeed as quickly as possible . 
Third , diplomacy cannot survive , much less thrive , amidst a deterioration of the day-to-day circumstances on the ground . 
More than anything else , Palestinians must come to associate peace and diplomacy with improvement in their living conditions . 
This requires improved security , inflows of aid and investment , and the curtailment of land expropriations that deny the promise of statehood . 
Israelis require and also deserve improved security . 
Fourth , a path must be provided for those who did not attend the meeting to join the process at a later date . 
The most critical barrier for Hamas and others should be a clear commitment to forego armed violence in the pursuit of political ends . 
Fifth , the Palestinian leadership cannot be expected to take risks for peace without political protection . 
This means that Arab governments , led by Egypt and Jordan , but including Saudi Arabia and other members of the Arab League , must publicly declare their willingness to support a peace that is based on coexistence with Israel . 
It would also help if those countries in a position to do so underscored their preparedness to make funds available to help build a Palestinian state and to resettle both refugees and those living in settlements that are vacated under any peace accord . 
For some , this approach will seem overly modest . 
But this is not yet the time for great ambition . 
The context for peace in the Middle East has deteriorated sharply in the seven years since the Clinton administration last convened the parties . 
Today &apos;s Israeli and Palestinian leaders are far weaker than their predecessors ; 
Hamas controls Gaza ; 
Iran is more influential ; additional settlements and a fence have been built ; and the US is bogged down in Iraq and has lost standing throughout the region . 
This is not an argument for drift . 
Neglect in the Middle East is rarely benign . 
But it is vital that new efforts do not cause more harm than good . 
Avoiding failure is sometimes a better objective than achieving great success . 
This is one such occasion . 
Today &apos;s diplomats could do worse than recall the warning of the great French statesman Talleyrand : &quot; Surtout , messieurs , point de z√©le . &quot; 
Above all , not too much zeal .
