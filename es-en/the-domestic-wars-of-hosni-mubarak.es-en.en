The Domestic Wars of Hosni Mubarak 
The decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s government to try two senior judges for blowing the whistle on vote rigging in last autumn &apos;s parliamentary elections has rocked the country . 
Massive crowds have gathered to support the judges - and have caught Mubarak &apos;s regime completely unaware . 
Mubarak &apos;s government now seems to be backtracking as fast as it can . 
Judge Mahmoud Mekki has been acquitted , and Judge Hisham al-Bastawisy , who suffered a heart attack the night before , has merely been reprimanded . 
Yet Cairo remains restless , and the government fears another outpouring of support for democracy , as the judges have called for renewed nationwide demonstrations . 
Egyptian judges have a long-standing tradition of discretion and propriety . 
But they feel abused by government efforts to sugarcoat the manipulation of election after election by claiming that judges supervise the voting . 
What makes their struggle loom so large for a normally quiescent Egyptian public is partly that nearly all 9,000 judges are standing fast in solidarity . 
Their representative body , the Judges &quot; Club , has long pushed for a new law to restore judicial independence . 
Now the judges are insisting on their independence by themselves . 
The Mubarak regime is adamantly opposed , and resorts to extra-judicial means , such as emergency courts and national security and military courts , which do not observe international standards . 
Contrary to his campaign promises during his run for a fifth term as President , Mubarak has requested ( and his rubber-stamp parliament has granted ) a two-year extension of the Emergency Law by which Egypt has been ruled throughout his presidency . 
It is to this law , above all , that the judges and Egypt &apos;s civil society object . 
The Emergency Law has been in force since the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in October 1981 , and Mubarak claims that he needs another extension to combat terrorism . 
But , according to a recent human rights report , despite the Emergency Law , 89 people were killed and 236 wounded in terrorist attacks in Egypt during the previous 12 months . 
In neighboring Israel , which is still in a struggle with the Palestinians , only 18 were killed and 25 wounded in similar attacks during the same period . 
Yet Israelis do not live under an emergency law . 
Consider , moreover , that at the height of the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1973 , Egypt &apos;s armed forces stood at one million troops . 
Now only 350,000 serve in the military , while the internal security police recently hit the one-million mark . 
Mubarak &apos;s first internal war was with Islamic militants during his early years in power , but he now finds himself caught in three more domestic wars . 
The battle with the judges has incited enough popular unrest to warrant Mubarak &apos;s deployment of thousands of black-uniformed central security forces in the heart of Cairo . 
This deployment , lasting three weeks so far , is already longer than the combined duration of the last two wars with Israel . 
Another domestic war , with the Egyptian Bedouins of Sinai , broke out two years ago . 
Taking their cue from their Palestinian neighbors , if not from al-Qaeda , alienated young Bedouins apparently decided to rebel against their treatment as third-class citizens . 
All around them , but especially in the ebullient resorts of southern Sinai , billions are spent on roads , airports , and beaches ; sizeable parcels of land are allocated generously to rich Egyptians from the Nile Valley and to foreigners , but not to Sinai natives . 
Indeed , Sinai Bedouins have the right of use but not ownership of land , because a lethargic , occasionally corrupt bureaucracy still deems the Sinai a military zone and its natives &quot; loyalty questionable . 
Two years ago , on the anniversary of the war of October 1973 , young Sinai militants bombed the Taba Hilton . 
Last July , on another national holiday , they hit three tourist spots not far from the Mubarak family compound in Sharm el-Sheikh . 
These symbolic as well as lethal warnings to a family that has grown Pharaonic in scale , style , and power have gone unheeded . 
The third recent domestic war , this one over Christian Coptic citizenship rights , has been brewing for years . 
Copts are the original Egyptians , and they were the majority population until the tenth century . 
In Mubarak &apos;s Egypt , citizens &quot; legal equality , while stipulated in the constitution , is not respected or observed , especially with regard to the construction and protection of Coptic churches . 
Last November , when Muslim zealots attacked a Coptic church in Alexandria , several Copts were injured . 
Six months later , a fanatic targeted three churches during Sunday services , killing a few worshippers and injuring many . 
Copts marched in the streets of Alexandria for the next three days , protesting the security authorities &quot; leniency toward the culprits , the scapegoating of their community , or even an official hand in the attacks to justify an extension of the Emergency Law . 
Hosni Mubaraks &quot; four domestic wars are fuelled by Egypt &apos;s excluded , who are increasingly in rebellion against a regime that has long outlived its legitimate mandate . 
The battle with the judges may well prove to be Mubarak &apos;s Achilles &quot; heel . 
Justice is a central value for Egyptians , and its absence is at the core of all protests . 
There can be no evidence more compelling than the unprecedented numbers of people who have rallied peacefully in solidarity with the judges .
