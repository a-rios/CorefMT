Financial Hypocrisy 
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the East Asia crisis , which began in Thailand on July 2 , 1997 , and spread to Indonesia in October and to Korea in December . 
Eventually , it became a global financial crisis , embroiling Russia and Latin American countries , such as Brazil , and unleashing forces that played out over the ensuing years : Argentina in 2001 may be counted as among its victims . 
There were many other innocent victims , including countries that had not even engaged in the international capital flows that were at the root of the crisis . 
Indeed , Laos was among the worst-affected countries . 
Though every crisis eventually ends , no one knew at the time how broad , deep , and long the ensuing recessions and depressions would be . 
It was the worst global crisis since the Great Depression . 
As the World Bank &apos;s chief economist and senior vice president , I was in the middle of the conflagration and the debates about its causes and the appropriate policy responses . 
This summer and fall , I revisited many of the affected countries , including Malaysia , Laos , Thailand , and Indonesia . 
It is heartwarming to see their recovery . 
These countries are now growing at 5 % or 6 % or more - not quite as fast as in the days of the East Asia miracle , but far more rapidly than many thought possible in the aftermath of the crisis . 
Many countries changed their policies , but in directions markedly different from the reforms that the IMF had urged . 
The poor were among those who bore the biggest burden of the crisis , as wages plummeted and unemployment soared . 
As countries emerged , many placed a new emphasis on &quot; harmony , &quot; in an effort to redress the growing divide between rich and poor , urban and rural . 
They gave greater weight to investments in people , launching innovative initiatives to bring health care and access to finance to more of their citizens , and creating social funds to help develop local communities . 
Looking back at the crisis a decade later , we can see more clearly how wrong the diagnosis , prescription , and prognosis of the IMF and United States Treasury were . 
The fundamental problem was premature capital market liberalization . 
It is therefore ironic to see the US Treasury Secretary once again pushing for capital market liberalization in India - one of the two major developing countries ( along with China ) to emerge unscathed from the 1997 crisis . 
It is no accident that these countries that had not fully liberalized their capital markets have done so well . 
Subsequent research by the IMF has confirmed what every serious study had shown : capital market liberalization brings instability , but not necessarily growth . 
( India and China have , by the same token , been the fastest-growing economies . ) 
Of course , Wall Street ( whose interests the US Treasury represents ) profits from capital market liberalization : they make money as capital flows in , as it flows out , and in the restructuring that occurs in the resulting havoc . 
In South Korea , the IMF urged the sale of the country &apos;s banks to American investors , even though Koreans had managed their own economy impressively for four decades , with higher growth , more stability , and without the systemic scandals that have marked US financial markets with such frequency . 
In some cases , US firms bought the banks , held on to them until Korea recovered , and then resold them , reaping billions in capital gains . 
In its rush to have westerners buy the banks , the IMF forgot one detail : to ensure that South Korea could recapture at least a fraction of those gains through taxation . 
Whether US investors had greater expertise in banking in emerging markets may be debatable ; that they had greater expertise in tax avoidance is not . 
The contrast between the IMF / US Treasury advice to East Asia and what has happened in the current sub-prime debacle is glaring . 
East Asian countries were told to raise their interest rates , in some cases to 25 % , 40 % , or higher , causing a rash of defaults . 
In the current crisis , the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank cut interest rates . 
Similarly , the countries caught up in the East Asia crisis were lectured on the need for greater transparency and better regulation . 
But lack of transparency played a central role in this past summer &apos;s credit crunch ; toxic mortgages were sliced and diced , spread around the world , packaged with better products , and hidden away as collateral , so no one could be sure who was holding what . 
And there is now a chorus of caution about new regulations , which supposedly might hamper financial markets ( including their exploitation of uninformed borrowers , which lay at the root of the problem . ) 
Finally , despite all the warnings about moral hazard , Western banks have been partly bailed out of their bad investments . 
Following the 1997 crisis , there was a consensus that fundamental reform of the global financial architecture were needed . 
But , while the current system may lead to unnecessary instability , and impose huge costs on developing countries , it serves some interests well . 
It is not surprising , then , that ten years later , there has been no fundamental reform .
