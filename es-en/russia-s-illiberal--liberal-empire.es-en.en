Russia &apos;s Illiberal &quot; Liberal Empire &quot; Across the West , many people are questioning whether Russia will continue using natural gas as a means of putting economic and political pressure on Ukraine , Georgia , and other countries in what the Kremlin regards as its &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
Using the &quot; energy weapon , &quot; however , is not just a tactic : it is at the heart of the prevailing doctrine guiding Russian foreign policy . 
Russia &apos;s policy toward the post-Soviet countries is based on the doctrine of a &quot; liberal empire , &quot; according to which Russia &apos;s major government-owned and private companies should assume control of key economic entities across the territories of the former Soviet republics by acquiring their assets . 
In this context , the word &quot; liberal &quot; should be understood to suggest that the empire of the &quot; new Russian dream &quot; should be built by purely economic means , excluding all forcible action against other nations . 
Naturally , the key role in this model is given to the supply of energy to the post-Soviet countries . 
In particular , the Russian utility giant Gazprom uses increases in gas prices as a means to punish &quot; disobedient &quot; neighbors . 
Ukraine was punished in this way for its eagerness to integrate with the West following the Orange Revolution . 
However , after the return of the pro-Russian Victor Yanukovych to the position of Ukrainian prime minister , the country &apos;s pro-Western orientation has been significantly weakened . 
So it should be no surprise that Ukraine under Yanukovych has faced no further problems with the supply of Russian gas . 
But Georgia remains a major Kremlin-Gazprom target . 
Russia &apos;s attempt to drag Georgia into its imperial net started in the summer of 2003 , when the Russian power monopoly United Energy System took control of 75 % of Georgia &apos;s electricity network . 
After the Rose Revolution of November 2003 , Russian companies turned out to be the most avid purchasers of Georgian enterprises and their assets . 
The first significant obstacle in the way of Russia &apos;s designs on Georgia was intervention by the US , which demanded that the Georgian government drop negotiations with Gazprom and banned Georgia from selling the gas pipeline that connects Russia and Armenia through Georgian territory . 
Russia punished Georgia almost immediately , banning the import of Georgian wines and mineral waters - both of which are key export goods . 
As Georgia &apos;s prospects of joining NATO seemed to increase , Russian actions became more illiberal . 
Ethnic Georgians living in Russia , including those who are Russian citizens , became targets of persecution . 
Russia &apos;s actions are aimed at fomenting an anti-government backlash in Georgia , thereby paving the way for pro-Russian political forces to come to power . 
But the illiberalism inherent in Russian imperialism is not limited to recent behavior , and , more disturbingly , it extends to the question of Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity , as Russian troops continue to prop up secessionist regions . 
By provoking ethnic conflicts in the territories of former Soviet republics , Moscow hopes to keep them under its control and influence . 
Ironically , the Russian troops deployed in the renegade Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been accorded the status of &quot; peacekeepers . &quot; 
Now Russia is threatening to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia if the West recognizes the Serbian province of Kosovo as an independent nation . 
To the extent that most of the residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have already been given Russian citizenship , the recognition of those two regions &quot; sovereignty would be entirely fictitious and , in fact , an interim measure on the way to their full annexation by Russia . 
To strengthen Russia &apos;s political influence over Georgia &apos;s separatist regions , Gazprom , without taking the trouble to ask for permission from Georgia &apos;s democratically elected leaders , has begun constructing a gas pipeline connecting Russia and South Ossetia directly . 
Although there was no interruption of gas supply from Tbilisi to South Ossetia , this step is necessary for the Kremlin to ensure even greater integration of this Georgian region into Russia &apos;s economic system . 
With Gazprom having already doubled gas tariffs for Georgia , the energy noose is tightening . 
But , thanks to gas supplies from neighboring Azerbaijan , Georgia has not yet been strangled . 
A revived Russian empire , whether it is constructed by force or through economic coercion , is not in anyone &apos;s interests . 
Reigning in Russia &apos;s illiberal &quot; liberal empire &quot; is the central question of European security today .
