After the Guns of August 
The Middle East is a place where the dust hardly ever settles . 
When it occasionally does , even for a short interval - as UN Resolution 1701 for cessation of hostilities in Lebanon seems to be holding - it is time to take stock of events in the hopes that a responsible debate may influence those in power . 
Let &apos;s start with the United States . 
President George W. Bush has been short on neither initiatives nor catchy slogans and acronyms . 
Recent years are littered with them : &quot; Global War on Terror &quot; ( GWOT ) , &quot; Road Map , &quot; &quot; Middle East Partnership Initiative &quot; ( MEPI ) , &quot; Broader Middle East and North Africa &quot; ( BMENA ) - originally &quot; Greater Middle East Initiative ( GMEI ) - Democracy Assisted Dialogue ( DAD ) , and so on . 
His latest reverie , envisioned in the thick of the recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah , was the New Middle East ( NME ) , with US clients Israel , Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia serving as the pillars of regional order . 
But like all his previous initiatives since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington almost five years ago now , the NME ran into trouble from the outset . 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced its birth while rejecting an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon . 
Her poor timing made the initiative appear heartless , as thousands of civilians were being uprooted , killed , or maimed by Israel &apos;s efficient but ruthless artillery and air force . 
This so embarrassed the three Arab NME partners that each raced to distance itself from the US-sponsored initiative . 
Saudi Arabia , which had remained silent for nearly two weeks , did so with a $ 500 million contribution to rebuilding devastated areas of Lebanon and another billion to support Lebanon &apos;s threatened currency . 
Egypt &apos;s heir apparent Gamal Mubarak followed suit in the fourth week of the fighting by heading a 70-member delegation on a solidarity visit to Beirut . 
But , rather than earning him the respect of an outraged Egyptian public , revelations in the opposition press that his plane had to obtain a safe passage and authority to land from the Israelis garnered only howls of derision . 
As for America , anything it touches in the Middle East has become radioactive , even for longstanding clients and friends . 
In the course of maneuvering to delay the UN ceasefire , Bush and Rice continually reiterated the need for a Security Council resolution that deals forcefully with &quot; the roots of the problem . &quot; 
Of course , for them and for Israel , this was Hezbollah and the need to eradicate or at a minimum disarm it and force its fighters to a safe distance from settlements and towns in northern Israel . 
While this is a reasonable demand , the rest of the Middle East - and , indeed , much of the world , including Europe - regard the root cause of the conflict as Israeli intransigence and arrogance , together with America &apos;s blind support for it . 
Both America and Israel have cited foot-dragging in implementing UN Resolution 1559 , which calls for disarming all non-state actors in Lebanon and the deployment of government forces all the way to the southern border . 
But for years the US and Israel have not uttered a word about the dozens of UN resolutions , going back as far as Resolution 49 on partition in 1947 , which called for the establishment of distinct Arab and Jewish states on roughly half of Mandated Palestine . 
This and numerous other resolutions seeking redress for injustices toward Palestinians have been ignored by the US . 
Thus , for 300 million Arabs and more than one billion Muslims the &quot; root cause &quot; of the Middle East conflict is not Hezbollah . 
As its leader , Hassan Nasrallah aptly put it , &quot; We are just a reaction to chronic injustice . &quot; 
It may well be that there is more than one root cause - every party to the conflict has a favorite one . 
There is no point in belaboring whose pain is greater or whose root cause is deeper . 
In fact , arguing over grievances merely drives the sides further apart . 
The long overdue UN Resolution 1701 may , with its adoption , indicate that all parties are fatigued , or could no longer withstand international pressure . 
This is good news for all concerned and provides an opportunity to tackle each party &apos;s &quot; root cause . &quot; 
Seizing the opportunity requires that humility rather than moral supremacy prevails . 
Empathy , not ethnocentrism , should be the order of the day now that the guns are falling silent and we have rediscovered the limits of military force . 
But if we have learned anything at all from the tragic assassinations of the region &apos;s greatest peacemakers , Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin , it is that the guns do not remain silent for long . 
During any lull , a fanatic from either side could jump to center stage and , through an act of utter madness , kick up the settling dust and dash the hopes of the many on both sides who still long for a lasting peace .
