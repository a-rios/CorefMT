An Arab &quot; Third Way &quot; AMMAN - Throughout the post-colonial period , Arab countries have consistently failed to produce an efficient - let alone democratic - system of government . 
Now , after a half-century of competition between military or royal dictatorships and militant Islamist regimes , many Arabs are again seeking a &quot; third way &quot; - a path toward a credible form of representative democracy . 
But will their efforts prove as futile now as they have in the past ? 
The Middle East - named for its geographic position between Europe and East Asia - was under Ottoman rule for 400 years before the Allied powers , after defeating the Ottomans in World War I , partitioned the region into distinct political units that , under the Sykes-Picot Agreement , fell within spheres of influence carved out by the United Kingdom and France . 
But , in response to these new divisions , an Arab awakening - shaped by pan-Arabism and support for Palestine - was occurring . 
Charismatic young military rulers-turned-dictators like Egypt &apos;s Gamal Abdel Nasser , Iraq &apos;s Saddam Hussein , Libya &apos;s Muammar el-Qaddafi , Yemen &apos;s Ali Abdullah Saleh , and Syria &apos;s Hafez al-Assad used these popular causes to win public support . 
But their failure to deliver better lives to their citizens , together with the discrediting of left-wing ideologies following the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , fueled the rise of a rival movement : political Islam . 
The Muslim Brotherhood - established in the Egyptian town of Ismailia in 1928 and political Islam &apos;s oldest , best organized , and most widespread proponent - was ( and is ) despised by both secular Arabs and Arab monarchies . 
Indeed , secular dictators have worked to suppress the Brothers at every turn - often violently , as when Assad ruthlessly crushed a Brotherhood-led uprising in Hama in 1982 . 
Forced to operate clandestinely , the Brotherhood built its support base with a social agenda that targeted the needs of the poor , while consistently reinforcing its Islamic ties , even using the compulsory zakat ( annual financial contribution to religious causes ) to build up its social network . 
The Brothers , with the help of a conservative society and the mosques , were prepared to seize power whenever the opportunity arose . 
Another Islamist movement , Algeria &apos;s Islamic Salvation Front , almost had such an opportunity in 1991 , when it won the first round of a general election . 
But the military prevented its victory by canceling the second round , triggering a brutal eight-year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died . 
Palestine &apos;s Hamas , an offshoot of the Brotherhood , succeeded at the ballot box in 2006 , but has since failed to deliver credible governance . 
Then the Arab Spring erupted in 2011 , creating new opportunities for political renewal . 
Within months , Islamist parties shaped by the Brotherhood &apos;s ideology had replaced secular dictators in Tunisia and Egypt , and seemed poised to take over Yemen and Syria , largely because they were the only well-organized political movements on the scene . 
Moreover , the Muslim Brotherhood gained control of Egypt , the largest and most influential of the Arab Spring countries . 
But their exclusive , rigid ideology was poorly suited to governing such a large and diverse country . 
As a result , after only a year in power , the military - backed by the same secular , liberal young people who had opposed it in 2011 - drove President Mohamed Morsi out of power . 
Unable to mount a political alternative , however , the protesters &quot; rejection of the Islamist government served only to put the army back in charge . 
Some argue that the absence of a secular liberal option in Arab politics stems from fear of political Islam . 
For decades , Western powers backed military regimes in the Arab world , willingly ignoring their systematic repression of democratic movements and rights , in order to ensure that Islamists did not gain power . 
Now that both the military- and Islamist-led systems have been discredited , an ideological vacuum has appeared in Arab politics . 
But Arabs today - most of whom are under the age of 30 - are less interested in an overarching political ideology than they are in an efficient representative government that implements sound policies aimed at creating jobs and bolstering economic growth . 
In short , they want a government that is focused on improving citizens &quot; lives . 
In fact , the absence of a specific ideology was essential to the Arab Spring &apos;s initial success in Egypt and Tunisia , for it allowed a large number of young activists to forge loose alliances . 
But mass movements can take a country only so far ; establishing a credible representative government requires political parties organized around clearly defined principles . 
While the Muslim Brotherhood has such an organizing principle , its internal rigidity - at least with Morsi at its helm - made it unfit to govern . 
Meanwhile , infighting among Egypt &apos;s liberals prevented them from establishing a disciplined , reliable alternative to the Brotherhood based on principles like diversity , plurality , respect for women , and freedom of expression . 
So when the Islamist government &apos;s credibility collapsed , the military was Egypt &apos;s only remaining option . 
In order to make progress , the youth-led movements that drove the Arab Spring must translate their shared principles into effective political structures , and choose leaders who are capable of placing the search for consensus ahead of personal ambition . 
If they succeed , the Arab world may finally have an alternative to rule by generals or mullahs . 
Even if they fail to gain power , the emergence of such an alternative would surely influence the Arab world &apos;s agenda for years to come .
