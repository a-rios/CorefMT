Gross Domestic Wellbeing 
LONDON - During a 2008 discussion of the global financial crisis at the London School of Economics , Queen Elizabeth II famously floored a room full of financial heavyweights by asking , &quot; Why did no one see it coming ? &quot; 
That question has been haunting economists ever since , as the recognition has slowly taken hold that , in the supposed &quot; golden age &quot; preceding the crisis , they were blind not only to the potential consequences of failure - but also to the true cost of &quot; success . &quot; 
That period was , in many people &apos;s view , tarnished by greed , with rapid GDP growth accompanied by increasing inequality of income and wellbeing . 
Leaders in Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and the United States seem to understand this , as they call for a new , more comprehensive policy target to replace national output . 
And such a target can be established . 
Indeed , a group of economists ( including me ) concluded in a report commissioned by the Legatum Institute that , despite its apparent subjectivity , &quot; wellbeing &quot; - or life satisfaction - can be measured robustly , compared internationally , and used to set policies and judge their success . 
The task for governments is to commit to putting this focus on wellbeing into practice . 
A few key insights should inform that process . 
First , governments would be better served by focusing on stability , even if it means sacrificing some output . 
As Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart have shown , financial crises are costly because recoveries from them are slow . 
But wellbeing research yields a sharper insight : even if we could bounce back from a crash , the cost would be high . 
Boom-and-bust destroy wellbeing , which is diminished far more by a fall in GDP than it is enhanced by an equal and opposite GDP increase . 
Second , wellbeing - unlike GDP - is boosted more by increases in income among the poorer segments of the population than by increases among the wealthy . 
That is why the richer European economies tend to have large automatic stabilizers built into their public finances . 
However , the absence of redistributive mechanisms across countries within the eurozone clearly exacerbated the tensions during the recent crisis . 
Third , the implementation of a wellbeing metric to guide policies would have the most rapid - and radical - effect at the national level . 
As a measure of policy success , GDP is particularly poorly suited to countries with large public sectors . 
The crude output measures that are used , such as the number of medical procedures carried out or the number of fires extinguished , miss a crucial point : while responding to the need for such services is a good thing , reducing the need for them would be better . 
And more efficient health services might spend less on hospitals and doctors and more on encouraging healthy lifestyles . 
Societies would be better served by a policy focus on factors that have been shown to be critical to life satisfaction : relationships , community , security , and physical and mental health . 
For example , while mental health is a key determinant of how people feel about their lives , it remains a low priority in most countries . 
In the US , there were more suicides than road deaths last year , and there are three times more suicides than road deaths in Germany and the UK . 
In the UK , the vast majority of people diagnosed with mental illness go untreated , at a huge cost not only in wellbeing , but also in disability benefits and lost earning power . 
Targeted policies aimed at raising awareness of mental-health issues and improving access to treatment would help to kick-start a recovery in wellbeing . 
Of course , specific priorities vary by country . 
For example , in aging societies , loneliness and long-term health become particularly important . 
The fourth key insight is that indicators of wellbeing interact . 
Volunteering does not only enhance the lives of those who are served ; it also boosts the life satisfaction of the volunteers . 
Likewise , given that unemployment diminishes both wellbeing and national income , effective back-to-work policies score two goals , as do policies aimed at augmenting citizens &quot; life skills through improved parenting and education . 
This has positive implications for funding wellbeing-enhancing programs . 
After all , the goal is not to inflate budgets , but to reallocate resources in ways that will ultimately boost citizens &quot; satisfaction and prosperity . 
Finally , reliable data will be critical to guiding efforts and evaluating progress . 
Fortunately , most developed countries - and an increasing number of developing countries - recognize the importance of collecting data on wellbeing . 
Add to that the parameters for measurement set by the OECD , and international comparisons of wellbeing become possible . 
The world is ready for a new , comprehensive metric for national and global progress and prosperity , one that tells us whether people really are better off - and how to ensure that they are .
