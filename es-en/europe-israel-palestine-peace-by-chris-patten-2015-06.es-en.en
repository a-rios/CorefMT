A European Role in Palestine ? 
LONDON - The international community &apos;s attention in the Middle East nowadays is inevitably focused on the Islamic State &apos;s military advances in Syria and Iraq , the failed states of Yemen and Libya , the activities of Islamic extremists everywhere , and the continuing efforts to complete a deal to contain Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Meanwhile , the oldest dispute in the region - the subject of a decades-long peace process that moves nowhere - continues to fester and worsen in Palestine and Israel . 
A report submitted earlier this month by the NGO Defense for Children International - Palestine ( DCIP ) to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the Palestine-Israel conflict &apos;s toll on children in 2014 underscores some of the most damaging consequences of this state of affairs . 
Its reception also serves as a reminder of why we have made no progress toward peace . 
Last year , according to the DCIP report , 561 children were killed - 557 of them Palestinian , most as a result of Israel &apos;s Operation Protective Edge in Gaza during the summer . 
In addition , almost 3,000 Palestinian children were injured during that 50-day conflict , with about 1,000 permanently disabled . 
The report also details the destruction of schools , the post-conflict mental health problems faced by the young , and the imprisonment of children . 
According to Ban , the number of Palestinian children killed in 2014 was higher than the numbers of child deaths in Syria and Darfur , and was exceeded only in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
The number of schools destroyed in Palestinian areas was the highest recorded anywhere . 
Not surprisingly , the UN &apos;s special representative for children and armed conflict , Leila Zerrougui , recommended that Israel and its adversary in Gaza , Hamas ( which has a grim record , too ) , should be placed on the UN &apos;s annual list of states and groups that gravely violate children &apos;s rights . 
But the United States put pressure on the Secretary-General to leave Israel off the list ; 
Ban acceded , and decided to leave Hamas off the list as well . 
Israel , frequently lauded in the US Congress as America &apos;s most dependable ally in the region , is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
It is difficult to imagine that US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power , who has a fine record on human-rights protection , had her heart in lobbying to whitewash Israel . 
Many Europeans will conclude that this is further evidence ( if any was needed ) that the US will always - and disastrously - protect Israel from the international and reputational consequences of its actions . 
Israel and Palestine are trapped in a bloody cul-de-sac , which is catastrophic for Palestinians and increasingly dangerous for Israel &apos;s prospects . 
As a group of eminent European politicians recently noted , a two-state peace deal could be lost , leaving Israel to face a stark choice : become a non-Jewish democracy or a Jewish non-democracy . 
This group , which included former presidents , prime ministers , foreign ministers , European Union commissioners and senior diplomats , sent a set of proposals to EU leaders in May . 
Europe , according to the group , should offset America &apos;s evident withdrawal from the diplomatic process and play a serious role in reviving prospects for peace . 
At the heart of the proposals is EU support in the UN Security Council for a resolution that &quot; either ( 1 ) calls for new negotiations and sets a mandatory deadline for the completion of an agreement to establish a two-state solution , or ( 2 ) creates a greater equivalence between the Israeli and Palestinian parties , including through recognition of a Palestinian state and strong support for Palestine accession to international treaties and organizations . &quot; 
The call for such a resolution reflects the impact of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s obnoxious behavior and the extremist views of several of his ministers , which have increased European countries &quot; sympathy for Palestinian statehood . 
There is also a growing clamor in the EU to enforce the correct labeling of products made in Israel &apos;s West Bank settlements . 
These products are exported to Europe under bilateral trade agreements between the EU and Israel . 
Sooner or later , someone will take EU countries to court over this . 
The response to these sorts of proposals from Israel &apos;s government has been depressingly predictable . First , Israeli spokesmen accuse Europeans of anti-Semitism - that hateful blot on Europe &apos;s history . 
But there is a real danger in conflating criticism of Israeli intransigence and extremism with anti-Semitism . 
To say that it is anti-Semitic to condemn the killing and maiming of children in Gaza is to make a mockery of acts that really are anti-Semitic and that deserve to be condemned by every civilized person . 
Second , Israel repeats its claim that it has no potential partner for peace . 
In fact , Israel is in deep denial , which was reflected in Netanyahu &apos;s contemptuous rejection of a two-state solution in his successful re-election campaign . 
The fact is that every situation in which a dominant power confronts those it condemns as terrorists sooner or later ends in negotiations . 
In Algeria , South Africa , and Northern Ireland , those in power invariably claimed that they had no partner for peace - until they made peace with the very &quot; terrorists &quot; they had spent decades vilifying . 
To put off talking makes violence increasingly difficult to end , which means that the sentiments that violence breeds become increasingly difficult to change . 
To secure peace , Israel will one day have to talk seriously to Hamas as well as Fatah and the PLO . 
There is no alternative . 
Until that happens , the children - the overwhelming majority of them Palestinian -will continue to suffer . 
How long will the rest of the world look the other way ?
