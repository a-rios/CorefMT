Premature Virtue 
NEW YORK - The Obama administration &apos;s insistence on fiscal rectitude is dictated not by financial necessity , but by political considerations . 
The United States is not one of Europe &apos;s heavily indebted countries , which must pay hefty premiums over the price at which Germany can borrow . 
Interest rates on US government bonds have been falling and are near record lows , which means that financial markets anticipate deflation , not inflation . 
Nevertheless , Obama is under political pressure . 
The US public is deeply troubled by the accumulation of public debt , and the Republican opposition has been extremely successful in blaming the Crash of 2008 - and the subsequent recession and high unemployment - on government ineptitude , as well as in claiming that the stimulus package was largely wasted . 
There is an element of truth in this , but it is one-sided . 
The Crash of 2008 was primarily a market failure , for which US ( and other ) regulators should be faulted for failing to regulate . 
But , without a bailout , the financial system would have remained paralyzed , making the subsequent recession much deeper and longer . 
Where the Obama administration went wrong was in how it bailed out the banking system : it helped banks earn their way out of a hole by purchasing some of their bad assets and supplying them with cheap money . 
This , too , was guided by political considerations : it would have been more efficient to inject new equity into the banks , but Obama feared accusations of nationalization and socialism . 
That decision backfired , with serious political repercussions . 
The public , facing a jump in credit card charges from 8 % to nearly 30 % , saw banks earning bumper profits and paying large bonuses . 
The Tea Party movement exploited this resentment , and Obama is now on the defensive . 
The Republicans campaign against any further stimulus , and the administration now pays lip service to fiscal rectitude , even if it recognizes that deficit reduction may be premature . 
I believe that there is a strong case for further stimulus . 
Admittedly , consumption cannot be sustained indefinitely by running up the national debt ; the imbalance between consumption and investment must be corrected . 
The obvious solution is to distinguish between investments and current consumption , and increase the former while reducing the latter . 
Most Americans are convinced that government is incapable of efficiently managing investments aimed at improving the country &apos;s physical and human capital . 
Again , this belief is not without justification : a quarter-century of calling the government bad has resulted in bad government . 
Moreover , the simple truth is that the private sector is not employing available resources . 
Obama has been very friendly to business , and corporations are operating very profitably . 
Perhaps a Republican victory will boost their confidence , but in the meantime investment and employment require fiscal stimulus ( monetary stimulus , by contrast , would be more likely to stimulate corporations to devour each other than to hire workers ) . 
How much government debt is too much is an open question , because tolerance for public debt is highly dependent on prevailing perceptions . 
The risk premium attached to the interest rate is the critical variable : once it starts rising , the existing rate of deficit financing becomes unsustainable . 
Consider Japan , with a debt-to-GDP ratio approaching 200 % - one of the highest in the world . 
Yet ten-year bonds yield little more than 1 % . 
Japan once had a high savings rate , but its current savings rate is about the same as in the US , thanks to an aging and shrinking population . 
The big difference - that Japan has a trade surplus and the US has a deficit - is not important as long as China &apos;s currency policy obliges it to accumulate dollar assets in one form or another . 
The real reason why Japanese interest rates are so low is that Japan &apos;s private sector has little appetite for investing abroad and prefers ten-year government bonds at 1 % to cash at 0 % . 
With the price level falling and the population aging , the Japanese consider the real return attractive . 
As long as US banks can borrow at near zero and buy government bonds without having to commit equity , and the dollar does not depreciate against the renminbi , interest rates on US government bonds may well be heading in the same direction . 
That does not mean that the US should maintain the discount rate close to zero and run up government debt indefinitely . 
Once the economy starts growing again , interest rates will rise - perhaps precipitously , if the accumulated debt is too large . 
The right policy is to reduce imbalances as quickly as possible while minimizing the increase in the debt burden . 
This can be done in several ways , but the Obama administration &apos;s stated goal - halving the budget deficit by 2013 while the economy is operating far below capacity - is not one of them . 
Investing in infrastructure and education makes more sense . 
What stands in the way of this agenda is not economics , but misconceptions about budget deficits that are being exploited for partisan and ideological purposes .
