Deep Decarbonization 
NEW YORK - Have a look at what happened around the world this past month . 
Australia &apos;s heat wave filled headlines when temperatures reaching 45 Â° Celsius disrupted the Australian Open tennis tournament . 
California &apos;s extreme drought forced the governor to declare a state of emergency . 
Major floods in Indonesia killed dozens and displaced tens of thousands . 
Beijing &apos;s coal-induced smog forced people to stay in their homes , closed highways , and diverted flights . 
Such events are daily warnings to the world : wake up before it is too late . 
We have entered the Age of Sustainable Development . 
Either we make peace with the planet , or we destroy our hard-won prosperity . 
The choice seems obvious , but our actions speak louder than words . 
Humanity continues on a path of ruin , driven by short-term greed and ignorance . 
Much ( though not all ) of the global environmental crisis stems from the world &apos;s fossil-fuel-based energy system . 
More than 80 % of all primary energy in the world comes from coal , oil , and gas . 
When these fossil fuels are burned , they emit carbon dioxide , which in turn changes the Earth &apos;s climate . 
The basic physics has been known for more than a century . 
Unfortunately , a few oil companies ( ExxonMobil and Koch Industries are the most notorious ) have devoted enormous resources to sowing confusion even where there is clear scientific consensus . 
There are three parts to this transition . 
The first is improved energy efficiency , meaning that we should use much less energy to achieve the same level of well-being . 
For example , we can design our buildings to use sunlight and natural-air circulation so that they require far less commercial energy for heating , cooling , and ventilation . 
Second , we need to shift to solar , wind , hydro , nuclear , geothermal , and other forms of energy that are not based on fossil fuels . 
The technology exists to use these alternatives safely , affordably , and at a scale large enough to replace almost all of the coal , and much of the oil , that we use today . 
Only natural gas ( the cleanest-burning fossil fuel ) would remain a significant source of energy by mid-century . 
Finally , to the extent that we continue to rely on fossil fuels , we must capture the resulting CO2 emissions at power plants before they escape into the atmosphere . 
The captured CO2 would then be injected underground or under the ocean floor for safe long-term storage . 
Carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) is already being used successfully on a very small scale ( mainly to enhance oil recovery in depleted wells ) . 
If ( and only if ) it proves successful for large-scale use , coal-dependent countries like China , India , and the United States could continue to use their reserves . 
American politicians have proved to be incapable of designing policies to shift the US to low-carbon energy use . 
Such policies would include a rising tax on CO2 emissions , large-scale research-and-development efforts in low-carbon technologies , a shift to electric vehicles , and regulations to phase out all coal-fired power plants except those that install CCS . 
Yet politicians are pursuing none of these policies adequately . 
Climate-change foes have spent billions of dollars to influence policymakers , support election campaigns by defenders of fossil fuels , and defeat candidates who dare to promote clean energy . 
The Republican Party as a whole attracts massive financial support from opponents of decarbonization , and these donors aggressively fight even the smallest step toward renewable energy . 
For their part , many Democratic members of the US Congress are also in the pro-fossil-fuel camp . 
A few big players in the energy industry , showing no concern for truth ( much less for our children , who will bear the consequences of our present folly ) , have teamed up with Rupert Murdoch . 
Indeed , Murdoch , the Koch Brothers , and their allies behave just like Big Tobacco in denying scientific truths ; even use the same experts for hire . 
The situation is generally the same around the world . 
Wherever powerful lobbies defend existing coal or oil interests , politicians typically are afraid to tell the truth about the need for low-carbon energy . 
Brave politicians who do tell the truth about climate change are found mainly in countries that do not have a powerful fossil-fuel lobby . 
Consider the fate of one courageous exception to this rule . 
Kevin Rudd , the former Australian prime minister , tried to implement a clean-energy policy in his coal-producing country . 
Rudd was defeated in his re-election bid by a candidate whose backing from an alliance of Murdoch and coal companies enabled him to outspend Rudd by a huge margin . 
Murdoch &apos;s tabloids pump out anti-scientific propaganda opposing climate-change policies not only in Australia , but also in the US and elsewhere . 
The reason all of this matters is that the path to deep decarbonization is open to us . 
Yet time is very short . 
The world needs to stop building new coal-fired power plants ( except those that implement CCS ) and to shift to low-carbon electricity . 
It needs to phase out the internal combustion engine for almost all new passenger vehicles by around 2030 , shifting to vehicles powered by electricity . 
And it needs to adopt energy-saving technologies that consume less commercial energy . 
If this happens , people around the world will discover something wonderful . 
Not only will they have saved the planet for the next generation ; they will also enjoy sunshine and clean , healthy air .
