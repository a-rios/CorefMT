Historic Election in Egypt ? 
Egyptians go to the polls on September 7th to elect a president from among ten contenders , including the incumbent of 24 years , Hosni Mubarak . 
While few doubt the outcome will be his re-election , many are intensely following the process . 
Some 6000 domestic election monitors have been training for the event , while hundreds of foreign reporters are converging on the country this week . 
Although all the formal trappings of a true electoral contest are in place , important aspects of authenticity are glaringly absent . 
Despite promises to the contrary , this is far from a level playing field . 
Mubarak still commands disproportionate assets : name recognition , a virtual monopoly on state-controlled electronic media and some 85 % of the print media . 
One week before the poll , some opposition candidates have yet to air even one campaign ad on Egyptian television . 
All members of the presidential election commission are Mubarak appointees , and the new election rules eliminated any independent challengers . 
Since the year 2000 , Egypt &apos;s 8000 judges must supervise and certify election results , by ruling of the High Court . 
This was a major step toward fairer elections , as the judges &quot; professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs . 
So the Mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the judge &apos;s union . 
One was to stretch the definition of &quot; the judiciary &quot; to include thousands of loyal government employees who have law degrees but no experience on the bench . This boxes in the true judges , for if they protest by boycotting their supervisory duties , the task will fall once more to police from the infamous Ministry of the Interior . 
Thus , in the past , the judges &quot; union tended to go along , with predictable results . 
In the 2000 parliamentary elections , while Mubarak &apos;s ruling party received roughly 38 % of the popular vote in districts supervised by true judges , that percent somehow jumped to 86 % where the quasi-judges were in charge . 
This year promises to be very different . 
In the spring the judges held a nation-wide assembly and resolved that unless the regime granted them full independence , and exclusive oversight of the voting process they would not supervise the upcoming presidential ( or parliamentary ) races . 
On September 2nd they made their final demands : allow civil society groups to observe the voting process , stop interfering in the definition of legitimate judges for purposes of the election , and agree that no ballot box will leave the presence of a legitimate judge until its contents are counted , certified and reported . 
Thus far , a standoff looks likely , as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refuses all citizen monitoring of the election process . 
Other interesting developments on the eve of the election include a fierce public debate over whether to vote or to boycott the presidential race . 
Several opposition parties have called on their members to stay away in protest over restrictive election rules that strongly favor Mubarak . 
On the other hand , the Muslim Brotherhood , thought to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt , are urging their followers to caste ballots and vote their conscience but not to give support to any &quot; despotic , corrupt rulers . &quot; 
This is a clear if implicit repudiation of Mubarak , the sole ruler for 24 years . 
Some 34 civil society organizations are preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections . 
These groups argue that if the regime is not planning to rig the vote , then domestic as well as foreign observation of the polling process should not be a problem . 
The regime response is to say that any outside monitoring is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty , and that domestic monitors are an affront to the integrity of the judges . 
That argument was quickly undermined when the judges &quot; union announced their support for civil society monitors . 
Whether the Mubarak regime is running scared because of the mounting challenges from within and without to hold a free and fair election , or is simply incapable of ridding the party of cheating as a way of life , the present signs do not bode well for next Wednesday &apos;s polls . 
Meanwhile , Egyptians for the first time are experiencing the thrilling taste of defying tyranny , and enjoying some newly-found space for freedom .
