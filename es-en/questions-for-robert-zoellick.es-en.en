Questions for Robert Zoellick 
Paul Wolfowitz &apos;s resignation from the World Bank solved one problem , but brought another to light . 
When Wolfowitz &apos;s name was first mentioned as a candidate to lead the world &apos;s premier development bank , the idea that the architect of America &apos;s failure in Iraq would be so rewarded was met by incredulity . 
Wolfowitz &apos;s nomination seemed to be part of that effort . 
Should Bush , a lame duck president with little support at home and less abroad , now be allowed to appoint the next World Bank president ? 
Bush has already demonstrated his lack of judgment . 
The arguments against the &quot; old boy &quot; system - by which the United States appoints the head of the World Bank and Europe the head of the IMF - are especially compelling today How effective can the Bank be in promoting good governance and fighting corruption if its president is chosen in a process that demonstrates flaws in its own governance ? 
How credible will an anti-corruption message be when delivered by an appointee of what is considered one of the most corrupt and incompetent administrations in US history ? 
Interestingly , as several heads of US Congressional committees have pointed out , it is in America &apos;s interest for the Bank to be led by the most qualified person , selected in an open and transparent process , regardless of nationality , gender , or race . 
This requires a change in how its president is chosen , and , at Congressional hearings on the World Bank - the first in 13 years - I , like everyone who testified , called for this key reform . 
Presidential appointments to senior posts in America &apos;s government are subject to open hearings . 
Regardless of whether the old boy system is preserved - but especially if it is - the Bank &apos;s Board should likewise conduct open hearings on Bush &apos;s nominee to succeed Wolfowitz . 
Here are some of the questions - with some hints at right and wrong answers - that it should ask any proposed candidate for the Bank &apos;s presidency , including Bush &apos;s nominee , Robert Zoellick : 
Do you believe that the president of the World Bank should put the interests of developing countries first ? 
Will you press for Europe and America to eliminate their agricultural subsidies ? 
Will you advocate a development round that emphasizes liberalization of labor markets more than capital markets , elimination of non-tariff barriers that keep developing countries &quot; goods out of advanced industrial countries , and abolition of so-called &quot; escalating tariffs , &quot; which impede development ? 
Will you be open to research even when that research shows that policies of the advanced industrial countries may , at least in some circumstances , not be in the interests of developing countries ? 
During James Wolfensohn &apos;s presidency of the Bank , there was a change in philosophy . 
We encouraged research-based policies , even when that research was critical of policies being pushed by certain advanced industrial countries and by some in the Bank . 
When our research showed that certain policies ( like agricultural subsidies ) were hurting developing countries , we publicized the findings , helping to redefine the debate . 
Will you support the initiative of developing countries to have a development-oriented intellectual property regime ? 
What separates developing countries from developed countries is not only the gap in resources , but also a gap in knowledge . 
The Bank should be viewed , in part , as a Knowledge Bank , and it should advocate reforms that enhance developing countries &quot; access to knowledge . 
Access to generic medicines is essential if developing countries , with their limited budgets , are to improve the health of the poor . 
TRIPs , the intellectual property provisions of the Uruguay round , were designed to reduce access to generic medicines - and they succeeded . 
Any candidate claiming to represent the interests of developing countries must distance himself from these policies . 
Will you work to redefine the criteria by which countries get access to funds ? 
Today , money goes to countries that are neither most in need nor can most effectively use it . 
Complying with current orthodoxies - for example , on privatization and liberalization - can earn you points on &quot; good governance , &quot; and thus increase aid allocations - even when they reduce true aid effectiveness . 
Do you think countries that are corrupt should be cut off from funding ? 
If so , will do you so in a consistent way ? 
If not , how should the Bank respond ? 
Will you support a comprehensive anti-corruption agenda , including closing down secret bank accounts ? 
One of the flaws of Wolfowitz &apos;s anti-corruption agenda that expansion or continuation of aid for countries favored by the Bush administration , like Iraq or Pakistan , was pushed , regardless of how corrupt they were , while there was little tolerance elsewhere . 
Problems with Uzbekistan were overlooked - until it fell out of favor with the US . 
Likewise , the Bush administration opposed the OECD initiative to restrict bank secrecy - until it realized that secret bank accounts help finance terrorists . 
Since then , it has shown that it can close secret bank accounts , but has chosen to do so only for terrorists . 
Do you think the World Bank should do more to encourage countries to adopt core labor standards ? 
Not only has the Bank not been active in promoting these globally agreed standards , there is a concern that the Bank discourages collective bargaining and protections for workers when it talks about &quot; flexible labor markets &quot; and conditions that are conducive to private investment . 
The old boy system of choosing the head of the World Bank must go . 
It has done enough damage . 
But if the advanced industrial countries that control the Bank refuse to stand by their principles , at least they should give a nod to greater transparency . 
The world should know what it is getting . 
Open hearings would be a step in the right direction .
