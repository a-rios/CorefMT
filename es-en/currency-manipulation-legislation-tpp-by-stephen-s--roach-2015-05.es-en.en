The Currency Manipulation Charade 
NEW HAVEN - As the US Congress grapples with the ever-contentious Trans-Pacific Partnership - President Barack Obama &apos;s signature trade legislation - a major stumbling block looms . 
On May 22 , the Senate avoided it , by narrowly defeating - 51 to 48 - a proposed &quot; currency manipulation &quot; amendment to a bill that gives Obama so-called &quot; fast-track &quot; authority to negotiate the TPP . 
But the issue could be resurrected as the debate shifts to the House of Representatives , where support is strong for &quot; enforceable currency rules . &quot; 
For at least a decade , Congress has been focusing on currency manipulation - a charge leveled at countries that purportedly intervene in foreign-exchange markets in order to suppress their currencies &quot; value , thereby subsidizing exports . 
In 2005 , Senators Charles Schumer , a liberal Democrat from New York , and Lindsey Graham , a conservative Republican from South Carolina , formed an unlikely alliance to defend beleaguered middle-class US workers from supposedly unfair competitive practices . 
Stop the currency manipulation , went the argument , and America &apos;s gaping trade deficit would narrow - providing lasting and meaningful benefits to hard-pressed workers . 
A decade ago , the original Schumer-Graham proposal was a thinly veiled anti-China initiative . 
The ire that motivated that proposal remains today , with China accounting for 47 % of America &apos;s still outsize merchandise trade deficit in 2014 . 
Never mind that the Chinese renminbi has risen some 33 % against the US dollar since mid-1995 to a level that the International Monetary Fund no longer considers undervalued , or that China &apos;s current-account surplus has shrunk from 10 % of GDP in 2007 to an estimated 2 % in 2014 . 
China remains in the crosshairs of US politicians who believe that American workers are the victims of its unfair trading practices . 
While this argument has great emotional and political appeal , it is deeply flawed , because the United States has an insidious saving problem . 
America &apos;s net national saving rate - the sum total of household , business , and government saving ( adjusted for the depreciation of aging capacity ) - currently stands at 2.5 % of national income . 
While that is better than the negative saving rates of 2008-2011 , it remains well short of the 6.3 % average of the final three decades of the twentieth century . 
Lacking in saving and wanting to grow , America must import surplus savings from abroad . 
And to attract that foreign capital , it has no choice but to run equally large balance-of-payments deficits . 
So it is no coincidence that the US economy has a chronic current-account deficit . 
While this shortfall has narrowed from a peak of 5.8 % of GDP in 2006 to 2.4 % in 2014 , it still leaves the US heavily dependent on surplus foreign savings in order to grow . 
This is where the trade deficit comes into play . 
The US does not just pluck surplus foreign savings out of thin air . 
To attract the capital it needs , America must send dollars overseas through foreign trade . 
And it is here that the currency manipulation argument falls apart . 
In 2014 , the US ran trade deficits with some 95 countries . 
In other words , America does not suffer from a small number of bilateral trade deficits that can be tied to charges of currency manipulation by countries like China , Japan , Malaysia , or Singapore . 
Rather , the US suffers from a multilateral trade imbalance with many countries , and this cannot be remedied through the imposition of bilateral penalties such as tariffs . 
Without fixing its savings problem , restricting trade with a few so-called currency manipulators would simply redistribute the US trade deficit to its other trading partners . 
In effect , America &apos;s trade balance is like a water balloon - applying pressure on one spot would simply cause the water to slosh elsewhere . 
Moreover , this approach could easily backfire . 
For example , assuming that there is no increase in domestic US saving , penalizing a low-cost producer like China for currency manipulation would most likely cause the Chinese piece of America &apos;s trade deficit to be reallocated to higher-cost producers . 
That would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on middle-class families - precisely the constituency that so concerns Congress . 
Further complications would arise from putting the verdict on currency manipulation - presumably dependent on some type of &quot; fair value &quot; metric - in the hands of politicians . 
This is also the twist that underscores the ultimate congressional hypocrisy . 
The charge of currency manipulation is nothing but a foil for the US to duck responsibility for fixing America &apos;s saving problem . 
Lacking any semblance of a strategy to boost savings - not just a long-term fix to the federal government &apos;s budget deficit , but also meaningful incentives for personal saving - US politicians have turned to yet another quick fix . 
In the end , there is no way around it : If Congress does not like trade deficits , it needs to address America &apos;s saving problem and stop fixating on misplaced concerns over currency manipulation . 
None of this is to argue that the US should ignore unfair trading practices . 
As a member of the World Trade Organization , the US has ample opportunity to use that body &apos;s dispute-resolution mechanism to adjudicate major problems with its trading partners . 
And it has enjoyed success with this approach . 
What Congress cannot do is pretend that wrong-footed trade policy is the answer to its inability or unwillingness to refocus its domestic policy agenda . 
Of course , it is always easier to blame others than to look in the mirror . 
But history has not been kind to major trade blunders . 
Just as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 sparked a global trade war that may well have put the &quot; great &quot; in the Great Depression , Congressional enactment of enforceable currency rules today could spark retaliatory actions that might devastate the free flow of trade that a sluggish global economy desperately needs . 
The US Senate was wise in rejecting this dangerous option . 
We can only hope that similar wisdom prevails in the House of Representatives . 
Currency manipulation legislation is one tragedy that can and should be avoided .
