The Environmental Bullying of New Europe 
Instead of helping all EU member states to meet their own Kyoto goals , the European Commission is shifting what should be a shared burden onto its newest members , which are already the most environmentally efficient in the European Union . 
In doing so , the Commission is rewarding inefficiency and reducing the effectiveness of its commitments to clean up the environment . 
The Commission &apos;s decision on Latvia &apos;s National Allocation Plan ( NAP ) for 2008-2012 left only 55 % of the CO2 emissions that Latvia requested . 
Similarly , Estonia and Lithuania received only 52-53 % of their requested quotas . 
Serious cuts were also made to other new EU members &quot; quotas , prompting Poland , the Czech Republic , and Slovakia , as well as Latvia , to launch legal challenges . 
Yet almost all of the old EU members received more than 90 % of the requested quotas . 
What is going on here ? 
The Commission &apos;s approach is misguided . 
According to its own information , the aim of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ( EU-ETS ) is to help countries meet their 2010 Kyoto targets by using market instruments to encourage companies to reduce their CO2 emissions . 
Logically , quotas should be linked to each member &apos;s progress in complying with the Kyoto Protocol . 
New EU member states are meeting their individual Kyoto commitments . 
Most are committed to reducing emissions by 8 % by 2010 . 
Latvia is already projected to lower its emissions by 46 % by that date , even without implementing any additional CO2 reduction policies . 
Indeed , the new EU members are projected to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by at least 21 % by 2010 . 
Old EU members also have a collective Kyoto target of lowering their CO2 emissions by 8 % by 2010 , but they are projected to achieve a mere 4.6 % reduction . 
Despite this , countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands , which are not expected to meet their Kyoto commitments , are being allowed to increase their emissions . 
It is imperative that the European Commission distributes all burdens evenly and fairly among the EU &apos;s 27 members . 
Most new members have met or are approaching their Kyoto targets , and they need rapid economic growth to catch up with the rest of the EU . 
Making the Union &apos;s newest members carry a disproportionate share of the burden of reducing the EU &apos;s total amount of pollution is both unjust and foolish . 
Latvia &apos;s example is the most acute . 
After regaining its independence from the Soviet Union , only remnants of the industrial behemoths of the communist era remained . 
As trade links with the former Soviet world collapsed , most of these giant firms collapsed . 
Starting almost from an economic &quot; point zero , &quot; Latvian entrepreneurs have built a new and modern economy , based on new and efficient technologies . 
As a result , Latvia has the lowest per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the EU . 
But , despite being the EU &apos;s third poorest country , the European Commission &apos;s rulings mean that it must purchase emission quotas from richer and more polluting EU members that have done little to meet their Kyoto commitments . 
This unbalanced approach is jeopardizing the economic development of Latvia and other vulnerable new member states , while old members enjoy a free ride . 
In small economies such as Latvia and many of the other new member states , even one large project is important for the whole country &apos;s progress . 
The Commission &apos;s decision to cut their CO2 emissions quotas may lead investors in desperately needed development projects to move outside of the EU , to countries with weaker environmental regulations , where their activities would contribute to higher global emissions . 
Additional emissions would occur when the goods are transported back to the EU . 
As if this weren &apos;t bad enough , the Commission is preparing an emission-trading scheme for EU airlines , with 2004 as the base year for setting quotas . 
This is a clear disadvantage for airlines from the new EU members , as the number of passengers they carry increased sharply only after 2004 , when these countries joined the EU . 
A recent decision to increase the share of energy from renewable sources to 20 % by 2020 will also cause problems . 
Latvia , for example , already generates 37 % of its energy from renewable sources , but will now likely be slapped with a target of around 50 % , while some other members will have targets below 10 % . 
Why are Latvia &apos;s people , among the poorest in the Union , expected to pay for something that Europe &apos;s richest people are finding difficult to do ? 
Latvia and other new EU members have little recourse but to challenge the European Commission in court . 
But suits and countersuits are not how we imagined the EU working when we struggled to join it . 
We thought that Europe believed in sharing its burdens equitably . Unfortunately , when it comes to the environment , Europe &apos;s have-nots are being told to carry the load by themselves .
