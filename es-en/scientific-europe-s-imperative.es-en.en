Scientific Europe &apos;s Imperative 
VIENNA - On June 29 , the European Commission will present its budget proposal for the next multi-year period , which begins in 2014 . 
It will include items such as the common agricultural policy , regional structural funds , and research and innovation . 
But how does the European Union envisage using these investments to shape its future ? 
The European Parliament and the Council of Europe &apos;s member states are yet to have their say , as foreseen in the budget procedure . 
But several trends are discernible in the intense discussion that has already begun , both within the European Commission and among the various stakeholders , 
For one thing , the term &quot; framework program &quot; will be scrapped . 
Even its name is up for grabs : the European Commission has just launched an open competition to come up with a new one . 
The goal is to capture the major underlying policy shift from a highly heterogeneous portfolio of programs - intended to support various goals in various ways and to varying degrees - to a legislative and budgetary package designed to serve as a common strategic framework . 
But a framework constructed to achieve what ? 
The strengthening of Europe &apos;s position within an atmosphere of heightened global competitiveness remains at the forefront . 
The dramatic increase of China &apos;s share in scientific publications worldwide , recently highlighted in a report by the Royal Society in London , is a good indicator of what lies ahead . 
The aim is no longer to become &quot; the world &apos;s most competitive knowledge economy , &quot; as disingenuously announced in 2000 . 
Rather , it has shifted in a more urgent , complex , and inherently unforeseeable way , as spelled out in the EU 2020 strategy &apos;s vision of an &quot; Innovation Union . &quot; 
Under this broad umbrella , research , development , and innovation ( RD I ) policy must identify the right answers on two fronts : &quot; what &quot; and &quot; how . &quot; 
Currently , a three-pronged strategy can be discerned for the &quot; what &quot; : knowledge for growth ( economic recovery and prosperity ) ; knowledge for society ( tackling the grand challenges ahead , from climate change and energy security to healthy aging ) ; and knowledge for science ( nurturing Europe &apos;s science and technology base , which remains indispensible for innovation ) . 
Under the banner of &quot; simplification , &quot; the &quot; how &quot; is gravitating towards outsourcing most of the implementation to agencies that are to be endowed , one hopes , with greater flexibility to fulfill their specific missions . 
This requires a smoothly working and much more efficient interface between the agencies and the European Commission , which retains overall control over them , as well as a thorough revision of the financial regulation for the entire operation and its oft-criticized bureaucratic red tape . 
Some tough political choices lie ahead : Which parts of the framework program are to be continued , and which terminated ? 
How can innovation , which is never only technological , but social as well , be achieved and fully used ? 
And , perhaps most importantly , what are the optimal trade-offs to get EU member states and European institutions to cooperate more efficiently for a common European future ? 
Amid all of this turbulence , the European Research Council ( ERC ) , established in 2007 to fund cutting-edge research , stands out at as an undisputed success story . 
Based on the sole principle of scientific excellence , it has put an evaluation system into place that enjoys high credibility in the scientific community . 
It supports individual researchers without regard to their nationality or age in a unique &quot; bottom-up &quot; mode , provided they work in Europe . 
The ERC puts its trust into the researchers it funds to know where the &quot; frontier &quot; of science is . 
Almost 1,800 of Europe &apos;s best researchers have received ERC awards so far , half of them representing the future generation . 
The ERC &apos;s budget amounts to no more than 0.5 % of total European R D spending , or 15 % of the current Framework Program budget . 
European universities , recognizing the reputational gains associated with ERC grants , have started to compete for them , leading to greater awareness of the need to nurture the talented younger researchers in their midst . 
The ERC includes the social sciences and humanities , thereby recognizing their contributions to the evolution of societies . 
Mark Twain once said , &quot; Fewer things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example . &quot; 
The ERC does not want to annoy , but to make a difference - for European research in a global , competitive context . 
It wants to build on its success in creating a truly European and highly potent research culture . 
It will strengthen its efforts to &quot; go global &quot; by attracting more scientific talent to Europe , whether researchers of European origin or others . 
The ultimate outcome will depend on the strategic wisdom , political clout , and courage of Europe &apos;s decision-makers regarding investment in Europe &apos;s RD I. Innovation , in the sense of doing things with what research has found out , is part of a European future . 
Finding out how things work is what cutting-edge research is all about .
