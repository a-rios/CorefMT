The Feminine Mystique Revisited 
OLYMPIA , WASHINGTON amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; 
Today , many social conservatives still blame Friedan and feminism for inducing women to abandon the home for the workplace , thus destabilizing families and placing their children at risk . 
But feminism was always more of a response to women entering the labor force than its cause . 
In Western Europe and the United States , early capitalism drew huge numbers of young , single women into industries like textiles . 
Mill owners often built dormitories to house young female workers . 
Many of these workers became early supporters of both the anti-slavery and the women &apos;s rights movements , while middle-class women were energized by ( and sometimes envious of ) working women &apos;s vigorous participation in the public sphere . 
By the time Friedan &apos;s book was published in 1963 , capitalism was drawing married women into the expanding service , clerical , and information sectors . 
Friedan &apos;s ideas spoke to a generation of women who were starting to view paid work as something more than a temporary break between adolescence and marriage , and were frustrated by society &apos;s insistence that the only source of meaning in their lives should be their role as housewives . 
Wherever women enter the labor force in large numbers , certain processes unfold . 
Women begin to marry later and have fewer children , especially as they make inroads into higher education or more remunerative careers . 
They are also more likely to challenge laws and customs that relegate them to second-class status in the public sphere or mandate their subordination within the family . 
Often , governments and employers then find that it is in their interest to begin to remove barriers to women &apos;s full participation . 
The dramatic decrease in laws and customs perpetuating female subordination over the past 40 years has been closely connected to women &apos;s expanded participation in paid employment . 
Societies where women remain substantially under-represented in the labor market , such as in the Middle East , remain especially resistant to women &apos;s rights . 
Political scientist Michael Ross argues that the extreme gender inequality found in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is not caused by the intractability of Islamic tradition . 
Rather , it is the result of how oil wealth shifted economic development away from manufacturing jobs that have historically pulled women into the labor force , while promoting jobs in construction , which tend to be dominated by men . 
Within the Muslim Middle East , the oil-rich states score much lower on indices of gender equity than oil-poor states such as Morocco , Tunisia , Lebanon , and Syria . 
Social conservatives are wrong to blame women &apos;s entry into work on feminism . 
But women who work are much more likely to adopt feminist-inspired agendas and to reject traditional ideas about marriage . And when women gain economic and political clout , traditional family life is , indeed , destabilized . 
In Western Europe and North America , divorce rates soared as married women poured into the workplace in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , with women initiating most divorces . 
Although divorce rates leveled off in the 1990 &quot; s , cohabitation and unwed childbearing have continued to rise . 
Nevertheless , the best hope for improving family life today is not to roll back women &apos;s rights , but to further women &apos;s economic and political integration . 
Increases in women &apos;s power and resources are most threatening to family stability in societies marked by gender inequality , where successful women often rebel against marriage . 
In countries such as Japan , Italy , and Singapore , where the terms of marriage remain favorable to men , and women have a hard time combining work and family , working women postpone marriage and motherhood much longer than in the US , leading to declines in birth rates that threaten these societies &quot; future . 
As women gain collective rights , and especially as men accept women &apos;s changed roles , many of the disruptive effects of family change are ameliorated . 
In the US , divorce rates for well-educated women are now much lower than for less-educated women , and women with good jobs or who have completed college are more likely than more traditional women to be married at age 35 . 
In the past , when a stay-at-home wife went to work , the chance that her marriage would dissolve increased . 
Today , going to work decreases the chance of divorce . 
In families where the wife has been employed longer , men tend to do more and better child-care , with measurable payoffs in child outcomes . 
Of course , marriage will never again be as stable or predictable as when women lacked alternatives . 
But even where family change continues apace , it has far less negative consequences when women have access to economic rights than when they do not . 
In the Nordic countries , out-of-wedlock births are much higher than in the US , but children of single mothers are much less likely to experience poverty , and spend more time on average with both biological parents , because cohabitation there is more stable than in many American marriages . 
In poorer countries , women &apos;s access to paid labor is a better predictor of children &apos;s well-being than the stability of marriage . 
In parts of Africa and Latin America , children are better nourished and have more access to education in female-headed households where the woman has a job than in two-parent households where the man earns the income . Children from female-headed households in Kenya , Malawi , and Jamaica , for example , do as well or better than children from male-headed households in their long-term nutritional and health status , despite lower household income . 
Far from being a threat to family life , the further progress of women &apos;s rights may be our best hope for well-functioning families .
