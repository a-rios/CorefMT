End Taiwan &apos;s Isolation 
BRUSSELS - As protests over China &apos;s crackdown in Tibet and the debate about Kosovo &apos;s unilateral declaration of independence continue to fester , the injustice of Taiwan &apos;s ongoing international isolation has barely stirred a flicker of interest , despite Taiwan &apos;s recent presidential election and referendum on United Nations membership . 
This neglect is not only shortsighted , but may also prove dangerous . 
This seeming double standard can be explained partly by a sense of guilt : the West has , for the most part , embraced Kosovo &apos;s independence in an effort to assuage its own culpability for not preventing Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s campaign of ethnic cleansing there . 
Similarly , much of the world is protesting on behalf of Tibet because countless millions have witnessed China &apos;s brutal suppression of Tibetan culture . 
Taiwan , on the other hand , does not grab our attention , because it is stable and flourishing economically . 
It has not been under Chinese central government rule for more than 100 years - indeed , since it was conquered by Japan at the end of the nineteenth century - and it has never been part of the People &apos;s Republic of China . 
Taiwan is , de facto , an unrecognized independent state with a vigorous democracy and high standards of human rights . 
Because Taiwan has not allowed itself to become a victim , the world simply does not feel guilty about it , and so ignores it . 
But perhaps we should feel some guilt . 
Taiwan deserves great credit for standing on its own two feet , despite the international isolation imposed . 
China blocks it from participating fully in the international arena , whether through the World Trade Organization , the Olympics , or the UN &apos;s specialized agencies , including the World Health Organization . 
To its shame , China allows its political goal of excluding Taiwan from membership in all international organizations to trump even urgent public health concerns . 
The small number of countries that recognize Taiwan diplomatically is dwindling constantly , owing to a mixture of Chinese pressure and blandishments . 
On top of all this , Taiwan &apos;s 22 million people go about their daily business knowing that thousands of Chinese missiles are ready to be launched at them at a moment &apos;s notice . 
It is not for me to say that Taiwan should be recognized as an independent country . 
To all intents and purposes , Taiwan is independent already , though without formal recognition . 
Equally , there are plenty of Taiwanese who would like their island eventually to reunify with China , particularly if China democratizes and ceases to be a one-party communist dictatorship . 
However , we cannot deny that Taiwan &apos;s people are unjustly being refused their place in the wider world . 
The international community should do more to usher Taiwan into the international mainstream . 
Western powers have always been champions of human rights and self-determination within the bounds of international law . 
The campaigns that the West waged throughout the 1980 &quot; s in solidarity with democratic forces in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe helped bring about the end of communist domination . 
A similar commitment to the democratic rights of Taiwanese could have salutary effects in China . 
Moreover , Taiwan is a natural ally of any party that espouses the values of pluralist politics , free markets , and human rights . 
It seems particularly short-sighted , indeed hypocritical , for the United States and Britain to seek to spread democracy and human rights throughout the world while failing to recognize and reward the Taiwanese , a people who have embraced these concepts wholeheartedly . 
The message that unquestioning recognition of &quot; One China &quot; is sending is that we appreciate you more if you are a big communist dictatorship than if you are a small multi-party democracy . 
For the record , there are clear precedents for divided countries to enter the UN as separate states and then eventually to reunify : West and East Germany , North and South Yemen , and perhaps one day the two Koreas . 
Ultimately , is for Taiwan and China to regulate and resolve their relations . 
There are already some positive signs of a bilateral thaw as a new administration prepares to take office in Taiwan , with high-level talks taking place between China &apos;s President Hu Jin Tao and Taiwan &apos;s Vice-President-elect Vincent Siew . 
The democratic world has an obligation to support this process - not only because Taiwan deserves its support , but also because engaging more with Taiwan could potentially be a powerful instrument of leverage for broader change in China .
