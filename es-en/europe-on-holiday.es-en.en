Europe on Holiday 
Currently , the average number of hours worked per person aged 15 to 25 each year in France and Germany is about 50 % lower than in the United States . 
Other European countries ( for example , Italy and Spain ) fall somewhere between these poles . 
Although some Americans always like to boast about their superior work ethic , this disparity in working hours between the US and Europe has not always existed . 
Indeed , until the mid-1970 &apos;s , the number of hours worked on either side of the Atlantic was roughly the same . 
From the mid-1970 &apos;s on , however , Americans continued working more or less the same number of hours , while Western Europeans began working less and less each year . 
If Western Europe needs an explanation as to why its rate of economic growth is lagging behind the US , it need look no further . 
The average number of working hours per person depends on a variety of factors : • the level of participation in the labor force ; • the number of vacation days workers have ; 
Virtually all the difference between the US on one side and France and Germany on the other are due to the first two factors , each with roughly equal weight . 
So , lower participation in the labor force explains half of the difference , and longer vacations for those who do work accounts for the other half . 
The importance of vacation time should come as no surprise to anyone who has experienced Europe &apos;s deserted cities in August , the three-week vacation &quot; bridges &quot; in April and May in France and Italy , the &quot; rush hours &quot; that take place every Friday at 2 PM in German cities , and crowded ski slopes in February due to winter school vacations . 
But knowing &quot; how &quot; Europeans work less is one thing ; knowing &quot; why &quot; Europeans work less than Americans is another . 
One view is that Americans are perceived ( and like to see themselves ) as Calvinist workaholics , whereas Europeans like to think that they know how to enjoy life &apos;s pleasures . 
As a European working in the US , I admit that I do take many more vacations than my American colleagues . 
So there may be something in this &quot; cultural &quot; explanation . 
But why did this start around 1973 ? 
A second argument attributes the difference to income taxes , which , in fact , have increased significantly in Europe since the 1970 &apos;s , while in the US income taxes fell from the early 1980 &apos;s onward . 
Income taxes certainly must affect willingness to work . 
They may not change by much the number of hours worked by the main breadwinner in a family ( typically a man ) , but they do influence the participation of women in the labor force . 
After all , why work , when your after-tax salary barely pays for childcare and household help ? 
But even this is not a sufficient explanation , because studies of how the supply of labor responds to tax changes suggest that something else must explain the enormous gap between US and Europe , especially France and Germany . 
For the age group over 50 , the structure of pension systems is clearly a major factor . 
It was and remains much more profitable to retire earlier in Europe than in the US . 
Why should a Frenchman or Italian in his early sixties work today , when in the 1990 &apos;s he could have retired in his mid-fifties with 80 % or more of his last working-age salary ? 
For women , the retirement age in the mid-1990 &apos;s was even lower . 
Public sector employees had even more advantages . 
Nor is that all . 
In the 1980 &apos;s and 1990 &apos;s , many European labor unions , in response to rising unemployment , adopted the policy of &quot; work less , work all . &quot; 
In other words , they obtained shorter hours ( i.e. , more vacations ) in order to keep employment up . 
The problem is that total compensation did not go down in proportion to the shorter hours , thus leading to an increase in pay per hour . 
Lower productivity and higher unit labor costs eroded firms &apos; willingness to hire , leaving Europe with chronically higher unemployment than in the US . 
Today &apos;s debates about growth in Europe are full of buzz words like &quot; knowledge-based society , &quot; &quot; technological progress , &quot; and &quot; investment in education . &quot; 
Europeans certainly need something to compensate for a short working life with many vacations . 
But much of this discussion is merely a form of &quot; political correctness . &quot; 
It is more reassuring - and &quot; feels better &quot; - to tell Europeans that growth is sluggish because society is not sufficiently knowledge-based , rather than pointing to the trade-off between vacations and growth . 
Europeans tend to prefer vacations over growth . 
Personally , I love taking more and more vacations . 
But I cannot ( and do not ) then complain if my income does not grow faster and faster .
