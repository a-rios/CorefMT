The Narrative Structure of Global Weakening 
NEW HAVEN - Recent indications of a weakening global economy have led many people to wonder how pervasive poor economic performance will be in the coming years . 
Are we facing a long global slump , or possibly even a depression ? 
A fundamental problem in forecasting nowadays is that the ultimate causes of the slowdown are really psychological and sociological , and relate to fluctuating confidence and changing &quot; animal spirits , &quot; about which George Akerlof and I have written . 
We argue that such shifts reflect changing stories , epidemics of new narratives , and associated views of the world , which are difficult to quantify . 
In fact , most professional economists do not seem overly glum about the global economy &apos;s prospects . 
For example , on September 6 , the OECD issued an interim assessment on the near-term global outlook , written by Pier Carlo Padoan , that blandly reports &quot; significant risks &quot; on the horizon - the language of uncertainty itself . 
The problem is that the statistical models that comprise economists &quot; toolkit are best applied in normal times , so economists naturally like to describe the situation as normal . 
If the current slowdown is typical of other slowdowns in recent decades , then we can predict the same kind of recovery . 
For example , in a paper presented last spring at the Brookings Institution in Washington , DC , James Stock of Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University unveiled a new &quot; dynamic factor model , &quot; estimated using data from 1959 to 2011 . 
Having thus excluded the Great Depression , they claimed that the recent slowdown in the United States is basically no different from other recent slowdowns , except larger . 
Their model reduces the sources of all recessions to just six shocks - &quot; oil , monetary policy , productivity , uncertainty , liquidity / financial risk , and fiscal policy &quot; - and explains most of the post-2007 downturn in terms of just two of these factors : &quot; uncertainty &quot; and &quot; liquidity / financial risk . &quot; 
But , even if we accept that conclusion , we are left to wonder what caused large shocks to &quot; uncertainty &quot; and to &quot; liquidity / financial risk &quot; in recent years , and how reliably such shocks can be predicted . 
When one considers the evidence about external economic shocks over the past year or two , what emerges are stories whose precise significance is unknowable . 
We only know that most of us have heard them many times . 
Foremost among those stories is the European financial crisis , which is talked about everywhere around the globe . 
The OECD &apos;s interim assessment called it &quot; the most important risk for the global economy . &quot; 
That may seem unlikely : Why should the European crisis be so important elsewhere ? 
Part of the reason , of course , is the rise of global trade and financial markets . 
But connections between countries do not occur solely through the direct impact of market prices . 
Interacting public psychology is likely to play a role as well . 
This brings us to the importance of stories - and very far from the kind of statistical analysis exemplified by Stock and Watson . 
Psychologists have stressed that there is a narrative basis to human thinking : people remember - and are motivated by - stories , particularly human-interest stories about real people . 
Popular stories tend to take on moral dimensions , leading people to imagine that bad outcomes reflect some kind of loss of moral resolve . 
The European crisis began with a Greek meltdown story , and it appears that the entire global economy is threatened by events in a country of only 11 million people . 
But the economic importance of stories bears no close relation to their monetary value ( which can be measured only after the fact , if at all ) . 
It depends , instead , on their story value . 
The Greek crisis story began in 2008 with reports of widespread protests and strikes when the government proposed raising the retirement age to address a pension funding shortfall . 
Reports began to appear in global news media portraying an excessive sense of entitlement , with Greeks taking to the streets in protest , even though the increase was modest ( for example , women with children or in hazardous jobs would be able to retire with full benefits at just 55 , up from 50 ) . 
That story might have invited some gossip outside of Greece , but it gained little purchase on international attention until the end of 2009 , when the market for Greek debt started to become increasingly unsettled , with rising interest rates causing further problems for the government . 
This augmented news reports about Greek profligacy , and thus closed a negative feedback loop by attracting intensifying public interest , which eventually fueled crises in other European countries . 
Like a YouTube video , the Greek story went viral . 
One might object that most people outside of Europe surely were not following the European crisis closely , and the least informed have not even heard of it . 
But opinion leaders , and friends and relatives of the least informed in each country , were following it , and their influence can create an atmosphere that makes everyone less willing to spend . 
The Greek story seems connected in many people &apos;s minds with the stories of the real-estate and stock-market bubbles that preceded the current crisis in 2007 . 
These asset bubbles were inflated by lax lending standards and an excessive willingness to borrow , which seemed similar to the Greek government &apos;s willingness to take on debt to pay lavish pensions . 
Thus , people saw the Greek crisis not just as a metaphor , but also as a morality tale . 
The natural consequence was to support government austerity programs , which can only make the situation worse . 
The European story is with us now , all over the world , so vivid that , even if the euro crisis appears to be resolved satisfactorily , it will not be forgotten until some new story diverts public attention . 
Then as now , we will not be able to understand the world economic outlook fully without considering the story on people &apos;s minds .
