Japan &apos;s Treacherous Bureaucrats 
Much has been made of the massive defeat Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party suffered in the recent election to Japan &apos;s Upper House . 
Instead , it is Japan &apos;s bureaucrats who are celebrating . 
The aim of these entrenched mandarins is to block Abe &apos;s plans for extensive civil-service reforms intended to inhibit them from parachuting into lucrative post-retirement jobs in the public corporations and private firms that they once regulated . 
They also want to stop Abe from dismantling and privatizing one of their central fiefdoms , the Social Security Agency . 
In this struggle , the mandarins are aligning themselves with the DPJ , at least to the general public &apos;s eye , because it has proposed merging the Social Security Agency with the National Tax Agency , a move that would ensure government jobs for the former &apos;s employees . 
The LDP &apos;s declining vote is attributable largely to Abe &apos;s mishandling of pension fund issues , particularly his late admission of knowledge last December about 50 million &quot; lost &quot; pension files . 
But a close look reveals the hands of the mandarins behind these debacles . 
Abe and his ministers were simply not provided with critical facts by the bureaucrats who are supposed to serve them . 
Indeed , a DPJ member of the Diet was able to pose pointed questions to Abe and his ministers because he had obtained detailed information from an unidentified Social Security Agency official . 
This constant stream of leaks from the bureaucrats has seriously shaken popular confidence in the Abe administration as well as the ruling LDP . 
The mandarins are now counting on an Upper House controlled by the DPJ to wreck Abe &apos;s civil-service reforms . 
Former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi handpicked Abe as his successor to continue his administration &apos;s central policies : divorcing the LDP from pork-barrel politics and consolidating the huge non-performing loans in the private sector that resulted from the collapse of Japan &apos;s property market bubble in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
By revitalizing and modernizing Japan &apos;s financial system , and by getting politicians out of the game , Koizumi intended to reinvigorate the Japanese economy . 
Koizumi had real successes in these reform efforts , which significantly transformed a malfunctioning Japanese state that was in the grip of pork-barrel LDP politicians , bureaucrats , and big business elites . 
Koizumi had relied on the bureaucrats to implement his reforms , but he did so at the price of postponing an overhaul of the civil service , which became a poisoned chalice that he passed on to Abe . 
Moreover , Abe &apos;s lack of Koizumi &apos;s star quality and outsider charisma has made him rely more heavily than his predecessor on the LDP &apos;s existing leadership . 
These leaders are less concerned with the reform agenda than with promoting patriotism among Japanese youth , upgrading the Defense Agency to a ministry , and enacting a law to permit a referendum to revise the pacifist constitution . 
These are all important matters , but they are not among the electorate &apos;s priorities . 
Koizumi &apos;s approach was to defy the LDP &apos;s leaders by appealing over their heads directly to the electorate . 
He successfully portrayed himself as a rebel resisting the LDP &apos;s old guard , actually purging some of them , in defense of ordinary Japanese . 
But Koizumi &apos;s reforms seemed to abandon not only rent-seekers , but also the disadvantaged who had relied on the state &apos;s protectionist measures . 
Abe is now confronting the legacy of this strategy : domestic polarization between highly educated and unskilled labor , between competitive and declining sectors , and between urban and rural areas . 
And , to protect their jobs , Japan &apos;s bureaucrats are now aligning their interests with those who see themselves as having lost out in the Koizumi years . 
The DPJ , now temporarily aligned with low-profile bureaucrats behind the scene , can now either obstruct any bill in the Upper House that is sponsored by Abe &apos;s administration , thereby cornering him into dissolving the Lower House , or they can engage in meticulous deliberations in the Diet in the hope of demonstrating to the electorate their fitness to govern . 
The DPJ &apos;s leader , Ichiro Ozawa , seems to be opting for the obstructionist approach favored by the bureaucrats , which will seek to bring not only a populist reversal of Koizumi &apos;s economic and political reforms , but the shelving of Abe &apos;s civil-service reforms as well . 
Japan will now likely face a hung Diet for a year or two . 
Until Koizumi , the electorate was never faced with such clear-cut choices , and his administration taught the Japanese to like them . 
In the meantime , Japan will drift , unable to take any significant foreign policy decision at a time when Asia &apos;s security landscape is changing rapidly .
