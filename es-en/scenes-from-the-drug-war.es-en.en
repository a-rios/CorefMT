Scenes from the Drug War 
The war on drugs takes many forms . 
Colombia presents the militarized version , with specially trained battalions of soldiers skimming over jungles and mountainsides , spraying defoliants from helicopter gun-ships . 
This &quot; poisoned earth &quot; policy kills coca plants , not peasant farmers . 
So many of these cross into Ecuador to cultivate coca there . 
Or you can take a poppy field and dig a large pond , fill it with fish , plant trees around it , buy some ducks and have your children watch them . 
This will , supposedly , eradicate a field of poppies , provide local people with protein from fish and fowl , help reforestation and also bring employment to local children . 
That , at least , was the idea behind a United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) -funded poppy eradication program in Afghanistan . 
As in Colombia , however , the results were fleeting . 
Poppy , like coca , is an ideal cash crop for farmers with small areas of land and few resources . 
It needs little care and brings a secure income . 
Fighting poppy and / or coca production , on the other hand , is an ideal political stance for politicians . 
It is easier to vote to spend millions of dollars to eradicate poppy / coca production in poor countries than confront addiction at home . 
To see the folly of these endeavors , let me dissect a number of anti-poppy schemes undertaken in Afghanistan with which I was connected . 
The promise of funds to fight poppy production galvanized the American Embassy in Islamabad into action . 
The wife of the then American Ambassador personally threw her weight behind the program . 
Impatient , she flew to Quetta to discuss with Mullah Nasim Aukhundzada a poppy substitution program . 
Mullah Aukhundzada was the Amir of a big area of Helmand in Southwest Afghanistan , a major poppy producing area . 
He promised to slash poppy production in return for tractors , seed , and other goodies . 
Soon after , USAID funded its own big eradication program . 
Although it attracted some experienced advisers , political pressure for fast results left little time to prepare the groundwork . 
Instead of researching the focus area &apos;s agricultural base , social structures , and local cultures the plan &apos;s officers launched a program based on hearsay and feeble contacts . 
Wily and resourceful , Afghans were quick to take advantage of the ignorance , goodwill and craving for instant results of the program &apos;s officers . 
As well as happily receiving requests from individual social , political or military representatives within the target areas , the USAID-sponsored program invited NGOs to submit their own proposals . 
These NGOs , who flourished during the fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , had seen their funding dry up after Russia &apos;s withdrawal , so funds for fighting poppy seemed a gift from heaven . 
Although they lacked experience in narcotics eradication , many NGOs based in Peshawar and Pakistan &apos;s North West Frontier jumped at the opportunity to secure USAID money , proposing ill-considered programs . 
Injections of American money promised to help pay office administration costs and keep NGO jobs alive . 
One self � serving program was &quot; Afghanaid , &quot; a British organization that provided an area in Nangahar with several teams of bullocks . 
After ploughing the land in preparation for winter wheat , however , the farmers slaughtered the cattle because they could not keep them fed throughout the winter , because no fodder was provided . 
This program was quickly dubbed the &quot; Kebabs for Poppy &quot; scheme . 
There are , of course , other amusing anecdotes . 
What is not amusing is the end result : the poppy eradication program achieved the opposite to what was intended . 
In a number of cases the program failed to deliver what it promised . 
Mullah Aukhundzada became so angry and humiliated when the promised goodies failed to materialize , that he ordered all the former poppy producing areas , as well as surrounding areas , to double poppy production the following year . 
In another instance a dashing young Afghan , who convinced the program &apos;s administrators that his uncle ( in reality a nonentity ) represented many growers whom he could persuade to stop cultivating poppy , walked away with one hundred thousand dollars worth of aid . 
Another bitter irony was that , in areas that received assistance , neighboring farmers who cultivated food crops soon switched to cultivating poppy because then , too , could then qualify for aid . 
It is , of course , easier to mock the attempts of organizations such as USAID to tackle poppy production than provide a viable solution . 
So long as political masters yearn for quick fixes and high profile results , however , such programs are likely to yield only short � term successes . 
Indeed , helicopter gun-ships and expensive crop replacement programs may provide TV-friendly images that politicians love , but do nothing to lessen the demand for drugs . 
Peasant farmers may , for a time , be bribed or intimidated ( the Taliban executes Afghan poppy growers ) into cultivating crops other than poppy or coca . 
They may even be persuaded to dig a fishpond and to try and eek out a living from that .
