The Phelps Factor 
On December 10 , Edmund Phelps , my colleague at Columbia University , received the Nobel Prize in economics for 2006 . 
The award was long overdue . 
While the Nobel Prize committee cited his contributions to macroeconomics , Phelps has made contributions in many areas , including the theory of growth and technological change , optimal taxation , and social justice . 
Phelps &quot; key observation in macroeconomics was that the relationship between inflation and unemployment is affected by expectations , and since expectations themselves are endogenous - they change over time - so , too , will the relationship between unemployment and inflation . 
If a government attempts to push the unemployment rate too low , inflation will increase , and so , too , will inflationary expectations . 
This insight holds two possible policy implications . 
Some policymakers have concluded from Phelps &quot; analysis that the unemployment rate cannot be lowered permanently without ever-increasing levels of inflation . 
Thus , monetary authorities should simply focus on price stability by targeting the rate of unemployment at which inflation does not increase , referred to as the &quot; non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment &quot; ( NAIRU ) . 
But the NAIRU is not immutable . 
The correct implication , which Phelps repeatedly emphasized , is that governments can implement a variety of policies , particularly structural policies , to allow the economy to operate at a lower level of unemployment . 
Policies that focus exclusively on inflation are misguided for several other reasons . 
As a practical matter , even controlling for expectations ( as Phelps &quot; work insists that we do ) , the relationship between unemployment and inflation is highly unstable . 
It is virtually impossible to discern the relationship from the data except in a few isolated periods . 
Changes in education levels , unionization , and productivity are part of the explanation for this instability . 
But , whatever the reason , policymakers face considerable uncertainty about the level of NAIRU . 
Thus , they still face a trade-off between pushing unemployment too low , and setting off an episode of inflation , and not pushing hard enough , resulting in an unnecessary waste of economic resources . 
How one views these risks depends on the costs of undoing mistakes , which in turn depends on other properties of the inflation-unemployment relationship that Phelps &quot; analysis did not address . 
The weight of evidence indicates that the cost of undoing the mistake of pushing unemployment down too far is itself very low , at least for countries like the US , where the relationship has been carefully studied . 
In this view , the Federal Reserve should aggressively pursue low unemployment , until it is shown that inflation is rising . 
By contrast , inflation &quot; hawks &quot; argue that inflation must be attacked preemptively . 
While most central banks are inflation hawks , this stance is a matter of religion , not economic science . 
There is simply little or no empirical evidence that inflation , at the low to moderate rates that have prevailed in recent decades , has any significant harmful real effects on output , employment , growth , or the distribution of income . 
Nor is there evidence that inflation , should it increase slightly , cannot be reversed at a relatively minor cost - comparable to the benefits of additional employment and growth enjoyed in the excessive expansion of the economy that led to the increase in inflation . 
In the early 1990 &quot; s , the Fed , and many others , thought that the NAIRU was around 6 % -6.2 % . 
Based on changes in the economy , I and the staff that worked with me on President Bill Clinton &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers argued that the NAIRU was considerably lower . 
We were right . 
Unemployment fell to 3.8 % without any surge in inflation . 
This matters because , as the great economist Arthur Okun argued , reducing unemployment by two percentage points would increase output by 2 % -6 % , or $ 0.5-1.5 trillion dollars in the case of America . 
Even for a rich country , that is a lot of money . 
It could be used to put America &apos;s social security system on a stable footing for the next 75-100 years . 
It could even pay for a substantial share of the cost for a war like that in Iraq ! 
Phelps &quot; work helped us to understand the complexity of the relationship between inflation and unemployment , and the important role that expectations can play in that relationship . 
But it is a misuse of that analysis to conclude that nothing can be done about unemployment , or that monetary authorities should focus exclusively on inflation . 
That view belongs to a school of modern macroeconomics that assumes rational expectations and perfectly functioning markets . 
In other words , individuals - usually assumed to be identical - fully use all available information to forecast the future in an environment of perfect competition , no capital market shortcomings , and full insurance of all risks . 
Not only are these assumptions absurd , but so are the conclusions : there is no involuntary unemployment , markets are fully efficient , and redistribution has no real consequence . 
But , while government policies , according to this school , are ineffective , that matters little . 
Because markets are always efficient , there is no need for government intervention . 
More perniciously , many supporters of this view , when confronted with the reality of unemployment , argue that it arises only because of government-imposed rigidities and trade unions . 
In their &quot; ideal &quot; world without either , there would , they claim , be no unemployment . 
For more than three decades , Phelps has shown that there is an alternative approach . 
He has tried to understand what we can do to lower unemployment and increase the well-being of those at the bottom . 
But he has also striven to understand what makes capitalist economies dynamic , what lies behind the entrepreneurial spirit , and what we can do to promote it further . 
Phelps &quot; economics remains one of action , not resignation .
