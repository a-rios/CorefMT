Why Has America &apos;s Economic Recovery Stalled ? 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States &quot; import bill now exceeds $ 2.4 trillion a year , more than twice that of China and greater than that of the 27 European Union countries combined . 
Since the volume of US imports varies with the overall strength of the American economy , so does the volume of other countries &quot; exports . 
So it was good news for everyone when the US economy began expanding in the summer of 2009 , 19 months after falling into the recession that officially started in December 2007 . 
Unfortunately , the recovery has turned out to be very anemic . 
Now , 15 months into the expansion , the level of real GDP is still lower than it was when the recession started . 
Even more worrying , the rate of GDP growth has been declining almost from the start of the recovery . 
Real GDP rose by 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , reflecting the end of the decline in inventories . 
GDP growth then fell to 3.7 % in the first quarter of 2010 and to only 1.7 % in the second quarter . 
The third quarter is shaping up to be much like the second . 
This recovery has been much weaker than previous ones because of fundamental differences in the cause of the downturn and in the policies chosen to achieve recovery . 
Previous downturns were caused by the central bank &apos;s efforts to reverse or prevent inflation by hiking short-term interest rates . 
When the central bank succeeded , it lowered those rates and the economy bounced back . 
But this time the downturn was not caused by higher interest rates , and reducing those rates did not produce a strong rebound . 
This recession was caused by a mispricing of risk , leading to excessive leverage and high prices for a wide range of assets . 
When those price bubbles burst , households lost substantial wealth and financial markets became dysfunctional . 
Because the downturn was not caused by high interest rates , lowering them could not lift the economy out of recession . 
The Obama administration therefore turned to fiscal policy - tax cuts and a range of spending programs . 
Unfortunately , the fiscal stimulus was not well enough designed to get the economy onto a strong , self-sustaining growth path . 
And , now that those stimulus programs are coming to an end , there is a danger that the economy will slide back into slow growth or even recession . 
One key to the US economy &apos;s future is household demand . 
Although consumer spending has increased during the past four quarters , helped by substantial government transfer payments , the pace of spending growth by households was less than the overall pace of GDP growth , because households were increasing their rate of saving . 
Indeed , household saving rose from 2 % of after-tax incomes in 2007 to about 6 % in recent months . 
If the saving rate continues to rise at the same pace in the future as it has over the past three years , the overall GDP growth rate could turn negative after a few quarters . 
Of course , there is no way to be certain of what will happen to saving . 
If the saving rate now rises quickly to that level , it will be hard to keep overall GDP growing . 
A significantly higher saving rate would help the US economy in the long run , but it would be a barrier to robust growth in the next few years . 
A major obstacle to higher consumer spending is the current condition of the housing market . 
The rapid rise in house prices until 2006 caused households to increase their spending , financed in part by converting home equity into cash . 
But house prices have since fallen some 40 % on average , leaving one-third of homeowners with mortgages owing more than their house is worth . 
The resulting fall in wealth has reduced consumer spending , while the decline in homeowners &quot; equity prevents borrowing to finance any increase . 
And the recent end of a special tax subsidy for first-time homebuyers has caused house prices to start falling again . 
If that decline continues , it will inevitably reduce the pace of consumer spending . 
Earlier this year , economic forecasters were predicting that annual GDP growth would reach 3 % or more in the second half of 2010 . 
Now those projections have been cut to less than 2 % , which is too slow to make a dent in the very high rate of unemployment . 
The forecasters have now shifted their predictions of 3 % -plus growth to 2011 . 
Let &apos;s hope that they are right this time .
