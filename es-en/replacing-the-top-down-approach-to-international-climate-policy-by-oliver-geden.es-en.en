A New Climate-Policy Paradigm 
BERLIN - Let &apos;s be serious : the ongoing United Nations climate negotiations will probably fail . 
To be sure , as with the recent gathering in Bonn , expectations for the November climate conference in Warsaw are so low that there is almost no room for failure . 
But , with climate negotiators promising to deliver the global agreement that they could not deliver in Copenhagen in 2009 , the December 2015 summit in Paris is almost certain to be another debacle . 
For the European Union , the leading authority in international climate policy , the outcome of the Copenhagen summit was particularly disappointing . 
After years of negotiation and numerous scientific-assessment reports , delegations had the highest expectations for concluding a comprehensive climate treaty . 
Those expectations turned out to be illusory . 
This time will not be different . 
While an agreement might be reached in 2015 , it will probably not cover all major emitters , and it definitely will not be ambitious enough to achieve the overarching goal of international climate cooperation , which is to prevent global temperatures from rising more than 2 ° Celsius above pre-industrial levels . 
Moreover , negotiators will not get another chance . 
After more than two decades of largely fruitless debate , during which CO2 emissions have continued to rise , another failed summit will trigger a profound crisis for international climate diplomacy , forcing its proponents either to change the rules of the game or accept that it cannot be won . 
The first victim of such a crisis will be the top-down approach to climate policy pursued by the EU and many prominent scientists . 
This policy-making model begins with the limit for tolerable climate change ; the world &apos;s remaining emissions budget until 2050 is calculated from the agreed boundary , then divided among the 193 UN member states . 
Should the Paris summit fail ( and it likely will ) , the resulting collapse in confidence in the top-down approach could lead to one of two outcomes . 
In the worst-case scenario , the very concept of global climate policy would lose all value , with decades of climate alarmism giving way to fatalism . 
Given that the UN formally accepted the 2 ° C limit as the starting point for the top-down approach in 2010 , the well-practiced strategy of obscuring current failures by announcing more ambitious future efforts would become unsustainable . 
At that point , the EU &apos;s role as global climate-policy leader would be weakened , as would its emphasis on building a green economy . 
With the EU forced to promote second- and third-rate strategies , countries would lose confidence in international climate policy &apos;s problem-solving potential and become unwilling to pursue shared solutions . 
As a result , international climate policy would become unrecognizable , ineffective , and , ultimately , irrelevant . 
Countries would begin to focus almost entirely on enhancing their own ability to adapt to climate change , with ambitious emissions-reduction agreements giving way to exclusively national initiatives in areas ranging from regulatory policy to geo-engineering . 
This would leave the EU no choice but to change its internal plans , undermining its ability to stay on track to meet emissions-reduction aspirations for 2050 and diminishing member states &quot; willingness to agree to ambitious and legally binding climate and energy targets for 2030 . 
Furthermore , the loss of legislative continuity beyond 2020 would create considerable insecurity for businesses in the EU , leading to diminished investment and interrupting - if not terminating - Europe &apos;s advance toward a low-carbon economy . 
Once such a process begins , the politically fragile EU will be unable to stop it , at least in the foreseeable future . 
The other , more promising scenario involves a fundamental shift in how the problem of climate change is understood , and thus in how potential solutions are framed . 
A new bottom-up approach , whose contours are only just emerging , is predicated on the basic principle that the less emissions , the better . 
In order to ensure this outcome , the EU must begin preparing a Plan B that accounts for the coming climate-policy paradigm shift . 
While the new paradigm would safeguard the legitimacy of existing regulatory and diplomatic instruments , such as emissions trading , the EU would have to reconsider the framework for applying them . 
Plans for flexible , incentive-led cooperation between developed and developing countries ( so-called &quot; clubs &quot; ) would become increasingly important , with progress depending on the cooperation of major emitters like the United States , China , and India . 
In the future , the EU will have to approach climate change primarily as a matter of politics , rather than in terms of scientifically defined objectives . 
Only by adjusting to the international system &apos;s practical constraints can the EU stay the course of economic transformation , remain relevant internationally , and help to contain global warming .
