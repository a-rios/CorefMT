Democracy on the Nile ? 
The surprise decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow direct and competitive presidential elections may be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab World . 
Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what a potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years . 
Under the current system , Egyptian citizens can only show up on the day of a presidential referendum every six years and say yes or no to the single name that appears on the presidential ballot . 
This explains why someone like Mubarak always received over 90 % of the vote , albeit amid indifferent turnout . 
Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system , no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters be put at the bottom of each ballot . 
Many people have long argued that democratization in the Middle East will not get far until Egypt becomes fully engaged in the process . 
Egypt could not truly set out on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution - to downsize the Pharaonic powers of its president and set limits on his term in office . 
Mubarak , after all , is already in his 24th year as president . 
So the announcement that he wants competitive presidential elections is an important first step . 
The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its own advantage , but events may not be that easy to control once people begin to feel empowered . 
The democratic genie is out of the bottle . 
In any case , Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region that is now embarking on the road of democracy . 
Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way . 
The real groundswell this time seems to have come from the close timing and positive outcomes of recent elections in Iraq , Palestine , and to a lesser degree in Saudi Arabia . 
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria &apos;s occupation of Lebanon following the assassination of its former prime minister , Rafiq al-Hariri , show no signs of abating . 
Egyptian opposition groups , too , have staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in the last few weeks . 
The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the ailing opposition leader Ayman Nour at the end of January . 
The government &apos;s heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the homegrown &quot; Kifaya &quot; ( Enough ) movement , which has demanded an end to the Mubarak regime . 
Suddenly the popular wisdom that Egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem to be holding up . 
An alliance of local , regional , and international forces is uniting against tyranny-as-usual on the banks of the Nile . 
The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime . 
Only a month ago , Mubarak dismissed demands for constitutional reform as &quot; futile . &quot; 
But , whatever combination of events brought about his change of heart , election initiative should be welcomed . 
It is a necessary - but insufficient - first step for overhauling Egypt &apos;s stagnant political system . 
Egyptians are already wary of token reforms Ã  la Tunisia , where longstanding President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections , but then staged a sham contest with a few handpicked &quot; opponents . &quot; 
In previous Tunisian presidential referenda , Bin Ali routinely received 99 % of the vote ; he now got 96 % . 
Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform . 
As a measure of sincerity , he needs to order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to terminate the 24-year-long state of emergency , which effectively prevents political campaigning from taking place . 
Mubarak should also endorse a limit of no more than two successive five-year terms for any president . 
Equally necessary are confidence-building measures , including open and equal access to the media , which are now state-controlled . 
I have announced that I intend to contest this upcoming presidential election as a way of opening debate on these essential reforms . 
But I would gladly go back to my life as a private citizen once guaranteed a free and open election this fall . 
If seriously implemented , these steps will transform Mubarak &apos;s legacy . 
Along with events in Lebanon , Iraq , and Palestine , it may well usher in an Arab spring of freedom , one long overdue .
