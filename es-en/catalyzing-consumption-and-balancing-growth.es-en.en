Catalyzing Consumption and Balancing Growth 
WASHINGTON , DC - China has weathered the Great Recession well . 
The world now waits to see if last year &apos;s impressive domestic demand growth can be sustained , and if China can , in the words of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao , &quot; give full play to the leading role of ... consumer demand in driving economic growth . &quot; 
The Chinese consumer has been held back for too long , and now must be put front and center in China &apos;s growth model . 
China &apos;s government is already moving ahead on multiple fronts to attain this goal as was clear from announcements at this week &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress . 
Of the many factors that have decreased the share of consumption in China &apos;s economy , declining household disposable income has been central . 
That , in turn , has reflected the fall in labor income as a share of the economy , owing in part to structural changes that have moved workers out of agriculture ( where the labor share of income is high ) and into manufacturing ( where capital commands a larger share of income ) . 
Concurrent with diminishing labor income , government-imposed ceilings on bank deposits - the primary savings vehicle for most households - have held down household capital income . 
This fall in income has been magnified by rising household savings rates , driven by insufficient insurance for health care and old age , the high cost of education , growing income inequality , and demographic trends . 
So what to do ? 
Recently , I attended an IMF-organized workshop in Beijing that brought together Chinese officials , academics , international analysts , and IMF staff to discuss how best to catalyze household consumption in China . 
Participants emphasized that changes would be needed in multiple areas , including improving the system of taxation and social insurance , further developing housing and the service economy , and eliminating a range of relative price distortions . 
One key idea was to lighten the tax burden on labor . 
Taking into account the personal-income tax and various social contributions , taxation of labor income in China is too high . 
To be sure , taxes are needed to finance social spending , but revenue sources other than taxes on labor income could do the job . 
China could usefully explore shifting part of the burden from labor toward property , capital gains , and inheritance taxes . 
Larger dividends paid to the budget from the highly profitable state-enterprise sector could also provide an alternative source of funds . 
Another route to improve consumption could be to offer households greater support . 
The global crisis has prompted China &apos;s government to push ahead with its social-reform program . 
Important improvements have been made over the past year to expand the pension system &apos;s coverage , move toward universal health care , and provide public funding for basic education . 
But more can be done to speed up the existing reform package , find ways to develop full coverage for catastrophic health events , and develop government-backed financing of tertiary education . 
Fixing the housing market could also help spur consumption . 
Distortions in the real-estate market are a powerful motivation for saving , particularly among young people who struggle to meet the high down-payment needed to buy a first home . 
Part of the high cost of housing arises from an underdeveloped financial system , which makes housing one of the few alternatives to bank deposits as a store of value . 
Property or capital-gains taxes could help curb demand for housing as an investment vehicle . 
In addition , a comprehensive nationwide housing policy is urgently needed to ensure that housing remains affordable , particularly for those on limited incomes . 
Related to this is the need for improvements in the overall financial system . 
By developing markets for private pensions , commercial health insurance , and annuities , China could complement expanded government provision of social insurance and weaken the incentives that underlie high precautionary saving . 
Similarly , broadening the range of available savings instruments could raise household disposable income and increase consumption . 
A more developed financial system would provide alternatives to real estate as a store of value , thereby making home ownership more accessible . 
These issues will be examined carefully during the course of this year as the Chinese government and the IMF collaborate on a Financial Sector Assessment Program for China . 
Fostering a dynamic service economy will invariably boost consumption as well . 
In the coming years , a more fully-fledged service economy will be an essential ingredient to increase employment and lessen China &apos;s reliance on manufacturing . 
But spurring faster growth in services is a complex undertaking . 
Entry barriers , particularly in service industries dominated by state-owned oligopolies , need to be lowered . 
Distortions in key prices that favor capital-intensive manufacturing need to be removed by raising the cost of land , energy , water , and capital . 
Changing the tax structure will also help . 
At present , industry is the primary source of tax revenue for the government , particularly at the local level , giving the state too little incentive to foster a service economy . 
Finally , a stronger renminbi ought to be an integral part of the package of reforms to boost consumption . 
A stronger currency would increase household income . 
It would also create a powerful incentive for companies to expand into the service economy , providing more jobs and more choices for Chinese consumers . 
If consumption can be successfully and sustainably boosted , I believe that China &apos;s development will enter a new era , one in which economic growth continues at a rapid pace , generates higher employment , increases social welfare , places less demand on natural resources , and , ultimately , is of a much higher quality thereby underpinning more balanced global growth .
