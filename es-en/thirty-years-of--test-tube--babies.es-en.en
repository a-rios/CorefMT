Thirty Years of &quot; Test-Tube &quot; Babies 
MELBOURNE - Louise Brown , the first person to be conceived outside a human body , turned 30 last year . 
The birth of a &quot; test-tube baby , &quot; as the headlines described in vitro fertilization was highly controversial at the time . 
Leon Kass , who subsequently served as chair of President George W. Bush &apos;s Council on Bioethics , argued that the risk of producing an abnormal infant was too great for an attempt at IVF ever to be justified . 
Some religious leaders also condemned the use of modern scientific technology to replace sexual intercourse , even when it could not lead to conception . 
Since then , some three million people have been conceived by IVF , enabling otherwise infertile couples to have the child they longed for . 
The risk of having an abnormal child through IVF has turned out to be no greater than when parents of a similar age conceive though sexual intercourse . 
However , because many IVF practitioners transfer two or three embryos at a time to improve the odds of a pregnancy occurring , twins and higher multiple births are more common , and carry some additional risk . 
The Roman Catholic Church has not moved away from its opposition to IVF . 
In a recently released instruction , Dignitas Personae , the Church &apos;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith objects to IVF on several grounds , including the fact that many embryos are created in the process , and few survive . 
This outcome is not , however , very different from natural conception , for the majority of embryos conceived by sexual intercourse also fail to implant in the uterine wall , with the woman often not even knowing that she was ever &quot; pregnant . &quot; 
In addition , the Vatican objects to the fact that conception is the result of a &quot; technical action &quot; rather &quot; a specific act of the conjugal union . &quot; 
But while any couple would prefer to conceive a child without the intervention of doctors , that option is not available for infertile couples . 
In those circumstances , it is harsh to say to a couple that they cannot have their own genetic child at all . 
It also appears contrary to the broad thrust of the Church &apos;s teaching about marriage and the family as the appropriate context for rearing children . 
Dignitas Personae says that new human life should be &quot; generated through an act which expresses the reciprocal love between a man and a woman . &quot; 
But if by that the Church is referring to sexual intercourse , then it surely has an unduly narrow view of what kinds of acts can express reciprocal love between a man and a woman . 
Taking the several inconvenient and sometimes unpleasant steps required to have a child together by means of IVF can be , and often is , the result of a much more deliberate and reciprocally loving act than sexual intercourse . 
A better objection to IVF is that in a world with millions of orphaned or unwanted children , adoption is a more ethical way of having a child . 
If that is the argument , however , why should we single out couples who use IVF ? 
Why not , for example , criticize Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar , the Arkansas couple who recently had their 18th child ? 
Yet Michelle Duggar was named &quot; Young Mother of the Year &quot; in Arkansas in 2004 , when she had already given birth to 14 children . 
I haven &apos;t noticed the Vatican telling them that they should be adopting instead of conceiving so many children . 
Religious opposition notwithstanding , the use of IVF by infertile couples of normal reproductive age has been widely accepted around the world , and rightly so . 
But in countries where the Church &apos;s influence remains strong , IVF &apos;s opponents are fighting back . 
In Poland , for example , proposed new legislation would drastically restrict its availability . 
Elsewhere , the ethical debate is not about IVF itself , but the limits of its use . 
Last November , Rajo Devi , a 70-year-old Indian woman , became the world &apos;s oldest mother , thanks to IVF . 
She and her 72 year-old husband have , she says , longed for a child through 55 years of marriage . 
Her husband &apos;s sperm appears to have been used , but news reports are unclear about the source of the egg . 
Some will find it grotesque to become a mother at an age when most women are grandmothers , but the more significant question is what kind of care such children will have if their parents die or become incapable of rearing them . 
Like many people in rural India , Devi lives in an extended family with other relatives , so she is confident that there would be others to bring up her child if necessary . 
But , as this example suggests , the impact of parental age on a child &apos;s welfare will vary from one culture to another . 
Becoming a mother at 70 is more acceptable for someone living in a joint family than it would be for Western couples living in their own home without close relatives or friends nearby .
