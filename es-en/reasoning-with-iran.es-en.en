Reasoning with Iran 
PARIS - Negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program have been stalled for more than three years . 
For six years , the voices of reason have largely been drowned out , with passions and delusions claiming primacy . 
Countries sitting on their own nuclear arsenals seem to think that they can give Iran orders ; it &apos;s a case of &quot; do as I say , not as I do . &quot; 
Another favorite delusion in the West is to believe that Iran will surrender if pressure is steadily increased . 
Anyone familiar with Iran knows that this provokes only a defiant response . 
But Iran , too , harbors illusions , including the notion that it can count on support from non-Western countries , or at least from some sort of Islamic caucus . 
Yet , at each stage in the crisis , Iran &apos;s supposed &quot; friends &quot; have let it down . 
Iran has also believed that it could split France , and perhaps Germany , away from the United States - as if either country would risk infuriating the Americans for the sake of a leader like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
Above all , Iran deludes itself that it can develop an advanced nuclear program by itself . 
In fact , continued isolationism would force Iran to reinvent nuclear technologies already invented by others , no doubt with poor results . 
Passions abound . 
The West feels repugnance over the Iranian regime &apos;s cynical human rights transgressions and hypocritical mixing of religion and politics . 
Western public opinion abhors the constant insults directed at Israel , Jews , and the West in general . 
There is a profound conviction in the West that an Iranian regime such as this must want nuclear weapons , and that it is acting accordingly . 
But Iran has been forecast to develop the bomb for 20 years . 
People remain convinced that next year , or maybe the year after , the prediction will come true . 
Thus , insidiously , the burden of proof is shifted . 
As Angela Merkel said at the United Nations in 2007 : &quot; The world does not need to prove to Iran that Iran is building an atomic bomb . 
Iran must persuade the world that it does not want the Bomb . &quot; 
Emotions run high in Iran too , which is happy to return to its familiar role as eternal victim in plots by the Great Powers . 
From time to time , Mohammed El Baradei , Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , has attempted to reintroduce reason and remind everyone that the focus must remain on capabilities , not intentions . 
This raises the practical question of what Iran &apos;s current bomb-making capability is . 
Would it be possible to detect in advance clandestine activity aimed at producing one , and , if so , what would Iran have to pledge in the matter of inspections and checks , and how might such pledges be obtained ? 
We know that Iran has made progress with the centrifuge technology essential for producing the enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons . 
It is likely that Iranian teams have been working on the mechanics of a nuclear explosive device , at least at the blueprint stage , and the country is also developing ballistic missiles that would bring many regional capitals within range of a nuclear attack - Israeli cities , of course , being the obvious targets . 
That said , Iran must still bring all of these programs together , and that cannot happen undetected . 
Iran may be capable of producing sufficient nuclear material to make one or two bombs within the next couple of years , but such activities would inevitably come into the open , because Iran would either have to enrich the uranium under the eyes of IAEA inspectors or expel them , giving the game away . 
At this stage , Iran still needs at least a year or longer to assemble one or two crude Hiroshima-type bombs . 
The hardest part still lies ahead : the miniaturization needed to fit a nuclear device into a warhead . 
Here , too , Iranian testing would also be easily detected . 
So , to build a credible nuclear arsenal , Iran would need a decade or longer . 
No one can say for sure that Iran &apos;s regime has formally adopted a nuclear weapons program . 
Although many Iranian leaders no doubt toy with the idea , others are carefully weighing the costs of such a venture - the risks of preventive strikes from outside , increased isolation , and a regional nuclear arms race . 
The West &apos;s options will continue to narrow if it maintains its present course . 
It is a great pity that formal negotiations with Iran have been stalled since 2005 amid Western demands that Iran suspend all of its enrichment-related activities . 
Three years have been wasted , and we have seen no signs of suspension or willingness to negotiate . 
Do negotiations stand any chance of success with Ahmadinejad as president ? 
The answer is &quot; no &quot; if our objective remains forcing Iran to renounce all activity on centrifugation . 
But this objective was also unattainable under President Mohammad Khatami , Ahmadinejad &apos;s reform-minded predecessor . 
Acquisition of this technology was , even then , a national priority . 
If we alter course , progress may still be possible . 
For example , if Iran &apos;s nuclear activities were to be surrounded with enough voluntarily accepted checks and controls , we could be confident of detecting at an early stage any diversion toward military purposes . 
Iran could develop its civil nuclear program while remaining a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ; the IAEA would be able to fulfill its role as watchdog ; and perhaps confidence in Iranian intentions would slowly be restored . 
We cannot know whether this course of action is realistic unless we try it . 
But we do know that the alternatives - increasing sanctions , military strikes , and perhaps war - would have unforeseeable consequences . 
Only rational behavior by the West has any chance of eliciting a rational response from Iran .
