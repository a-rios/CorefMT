The Closing of the European Mind 
PARIS - Kishore Mahbubani , a prominent Asian voice from Singapore , and a man often highly critical of Europe , was recently asked what Asia could learn from Europe . 
His reply : Europe was above all the continent of peace , compassion , and cooperation . 
&quot; Asia &quot; may not exist culturally , historically , religiously , socially , and economically , the way that Europe does . 
It is a much more varied continent . 
But &quot; Asians &quot; have been looking at , and reflecting upon , the European experiment for a long time . 
Enlightened Japanese elites are fascinated by Franco-German reconciliation . 
Could that model be applied to Japan &apos;s relations with its former enemies , from Korea to China ? 
And today , with the irresistible rise of a more assertive China , the European example of a continent where the prospect of war between traditional enemies - or contemporary rivals - has simply disappeared is more attractive than ever . 
One does not naturally associate China with the quest for compassion . 
Yet some Chinese have recently discovered the virtues of the Nordic social model , and Chinese delegations have been coming to Oslo regularly to see what lessons they can bring home . 
The reasoning of China &apos;s elites is pragmatic : if the Chinese were reassured by the existence of a social-welfare state , they would probably save less and spend more , allowing the domestic market to take over from export-led growth . 
Although the European Union &apos;s image has deteriorated , Asians still find Europe &apos;s &quot; sharing of sovereignty &quot; model appealing in many ways . 
For Mahbubani , the &quot; lessons of Europe &quot; are crystal clear . 
If emerging Asia begins to look more and more &quot; like a socially and politically harmonious Europe , &quot; the world would be a much better place . 
At a time when Europeans are full of self-doubt , though perhaps not as morose as the French , this praise from thoughtful Asians is more than welcome . 
Europeans , unfortunately , too often fail to see the merits of their peaceful conquest over their own worst natures . 
Moreover , Europeans should , in the same spirit of openness , ask themselves what they can learn from Asia . 
In a multipolar world , the flow of examples and inspiration has become a two-way street . 
Europeans can no longer look down upon Asians with a &quot; Western &quot; combination of arrogance and ignorance , perceiving themselves as the unique carriers of a universal message . 
The problem , of course , is that the concept of Asia is largely a Western one . 
Asians do not perceive themselves as Asians in the way that most Europeans view themselves as Europeans . 
India &apos;s historical patrimony is very different from China &apos;s , for example , not to mention the singular experience of Japan . 
Yet it is legitimate to ask what , for Europeans looking at Asia , would be the equivalent of the &quot; peace , compassion and cooperation &quot; that Asians see in Europe ? 
Could it be a combination of hope , energy , long-term thinking , and curiosity ? 
Hope is a state of mind and not only the result of economic growth . 
Hope means confidence , and young Asians are exuding the stuff , whereas young Europeans - arrogant towards others and diffident towards themselves - too often lack &quot; appetite &quot; and cling to the status quo , seeming to demand protection from life . 
Many Chinese may dream of spending like Europeans , but the nightmare of most Europeans nowadays is that they might have to start working as hard as the Chinese . 
Beyond confidence and the energy that goes with an appetite for success , Europeans lack long-term thinking and curiosity about the &quot; other &quot; in general . 
As a result , they know little about the history , culture , and languages of Asia . 
By contrast , the large numbers of young Chinese and Indians who are graduating from the best Western universities ( mostly American ) know the Western mind from the inside , and thus feel that they understand &quot; what makes us tick . &quot; 
Indeed , they are &quot; us &quot; while remaining themselves . 
How many Europeans can claim such familiarity with the &quot; Asian Other &quot; ? 
The fact that so many Asian students come to the West to study - and so few Europeans ( Westerners ) do so in Asia - is not a sign of the superiority of the Western mind and model . 
On the contrary , it impoverishes our mindset , if not our culture . 
The need to open ourselves as Europeans to the Asian mind , and even to some different societal models , does not imply , however , that we should relinquish our values . 
The peace , compassion , and cooperation Asians are contemplating with such admiration are the direct product of values which some of them see as &quot; Western , &quot; and that , yes , we regard as &quot; universal . &quot; 
Given Asia &apos;s rise , it is , of course , illusory for Europeans to consider their relations with the biggest Asian power , China , only through the prism of human rights . 
Moreover , Europe &apos;s ability to exert pressure on China is extremely limited at best , and may be least potent where Chinese domestic matters are concerned . 
Nevertheless , Europeans should not be deterred by the Chinese government &apos;s anger at the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo . 
In the name of Europe &apos;s core values , all EU ambassadors to Norway should make a point of attending the Nobel award ceremony - which the imprisoned Liu cannot - despite China &apos;s call for them to stay away . 
It is simply a question of self-respect - and , ultimately , that of China .
