Moral Dilemmas for Fannie and Freddie 
NEW HAVEN - The United States government &apos;s takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a huge bailout of these institutions &quot; creditors , whose losses have ballooned as house prices continue to plummet . 
With the government now fully guaranteeing Fannie &apos;s and Freddie &apos;s debts , American taxpayers will have to pay for everything not covered by their creditors &quot; inadequate capital . 
Why is this bailout happening in the world &apos;s most avowedly capitalist country ? 
Don &apos;t venerable capitalist principles imply that anyone who believed in the real estate bubble and who invested in Fannie and Freddie must accept their losses ? 
Is it fair that innocent taxpayers must now pay for their mistakes ? 
The answers to such questions would be obvious if the moral issues in the current financial crisis were clear-cut . 
But they are not . 
Most importantly , it is not clear that the bailout will actually impose any net costs on US taxpayers , since it may prevent further systemic effects that bring down the financial sector and , with it , the world economy . 
Just because systemic effects are difficult to quantify does not mean that they are not real . 
The bonds issued by Fannie and Freddie were widely thought to carry an implicit US government guarantee . 
Even though there was no official guarantee , the US government &apos;s failure to come to the rescue could destroy confidence in government debt , and , by association , other financial paper as well . 
The issues go far beyond the US economy . 
The global economy has been driven in recent years by remarkable speculative asset booms and busts , which bring into the equation questions of confidence and trust , as well as fairness . 
Similar housing booms in many other countries are now ending , and they may face the pain - and the moral dilemmas - that the US economy is now experiencing . 
Moreover , housing markets are not the only issue . 
So are stock markets . 
The Shanghai Composite in China rose by a factor of five in real terms from 2005 to 2007 , and then lost two-thirds of its real value . 
The Sensex in India rose by a factor of five in real terms over 2003 to 2007 , and has since lost a third of its value . 
Similar stock market booms and busts have occurred in many other countries . 
While they lasted , the booms that preceded these busts caused these economies to overheat . 
Now that the booms have been reversed , a decline in confidence could engulf the world economy , throwing it into recession . 
To prevent that , some selective bailouts will likely be needed , not to support the market but to deal with injustices . 
There is no accurate science of confidence , no way of knowing how people will react to a failure to help when markets collapse . 
People &apos;s reactions to these events depend on their emotions and their sense of justice . 
The booms and busts have caused great redistributions of wealth . 
People who bought into the stock market or housing market did either well or poorly , depending on their timing . 
People will judge the fairness of these outcomes in terms of what they were told , and what kinds of implicit promises they inferred . 
What were people in all these countries told about the markets in which they invested ? 
Was it all really truthful ? 
Unfortunately , there is no way to find out . 
Policymakers can provide only general responses , not deal with all cases individually . 
We do know that recent economic growth in many countries has been spectacular . 
But were investments in their markets oversold ? 
Did cynical salespeople in these and other countries lead people to believe that the boom times would produce wealth for everyone ? 
To be sure , while there may have been much &quot; cheap talk &quot; - general advice with disclaimers - most of the losers in this game are not starving . 
But we cannot blithely conclude that all the losses should be allowed to stand in full force . 
The gnawing problem is one of &quot; good faith . &quot; 
Economies prosper only on the perception that &quot; good faith &quot; exists . 
The current situation , in which speculative booms have driven the world economy - and , having collapsed , are now driving it into recession - suggests that there may have been a lot of bad faith by people promoting certain investments . 
Consider investors in Fannie and Freddie bonds . 
While the US government never officially promised to bail them out , it did create a special agency , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , which was to assess their strength in an annual report . 
But this agency never even acknowledged that there was a housing bubble . 
Government leaders gave no warnings . 
So can we really say that investors must suffer the full consequences of any losses ? 
How can this be fair ? 
The world is discovering capitalism and its power to transform economies . 
But capitalism relies on good faith . 
A perception of unfair treatment can be deadly to economic growth , because it means that people will lose trust in businesses , and hence be less willing to offer to them their precious capital and labor . 
Is that outcome morally superior to a bailout ?
