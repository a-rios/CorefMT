China , the Olympics , and Global Leadership 
The whole world , it seems , views China as the next great global power . 
A trip to Beijing does little to dispel that impression . 
Out of the welter of dust , noise , welders &quot; sparks , flotillas of cement mixers and construction cranes , the setting for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games is taking shape . 
A visitor feels inconsequential in the chaotic vastness of this epic undertaking . 
But looking down on the scene from the half-finished Morgan Centre , the luxury apartment complex ( where annual rents are $ 800,000 ) and seven-star hotel that is arising beside the Olympic site , one is awestruck not only by the project &apos;s grandeur , but by its design daring . 
Below , like some latticed popover , is the Herzog de Meuron-designed &quot; birds nest &quot; Olympic Stadium . 
Beside it is the stunning &quot; water cube , &quot; or Aquatics Center , of Chinese / Australian design . 
It is hardly surprising that after the Games , the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s leaders plan to vacate their retro pavilions in Zhongnanhai , the cloistered compound beside the Forbidden City , to move to a new &quot; campus &quot; adjacent to the Olympic Green , China &apos;s new power center . 
China &apos;s leaders view the Olympics not only as a national celebration , but also as the greatest national coming-out party in history . 
Feeling the Promethian energy unleashed in Bejing , it is easy to believe in China &apos;s aspirations to restore itself to a position of global wealth and power . 
Indeed , over the past half-century , when the Chinese have put their minds to it , they have always demonstrated extraordinary fortitude and resolution , whether in embracing Mao &apos;s revolution or in the equally unfettered way in which they are realizing the economic counter-revolution unleashed by Deng Xiaoping . 
But , to become a truly &quot; great nation , &quot; China must make two great leaps . 
First , it must become more comfortable playing an active and constructive international role . 
China is now deeply involved in the world , especially the Third World , because of trade . 
But it maintains a nineteenth-century notion of sovereignty - namely , that a country &apos;s national territory , its leaders have an absolute right to do whatever they want without outside &quot; interference . &quot; 
This view is not only out of step with international trends , but it also inhibits China from playing a useful role in world crises . 
China &apos;s leaders fear that if they begin to pronounce on the domestic record of other nations , much less join in sanctions or United Nations peacekeeping missions , they will help establish a precedent that would allow others to intrude on domestic Chinese affairs . 
But the Chinese government has just had a wake-up call in Sudan , from which China imports 50 % of its oil . 
After doing little to pressure Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir into admitting UN peacekeepers to stem the killing in Darfur , China suddenly found the promise of an unsullied Olympics at risk . 
The actress Mia Farrow , for example , suggested that the 2008 Olympics might be remembered as &quot; the genocide games . &quot; 
This got the Chinese leadership &apos;s attention . 
In a matter of days , an emissary was dispatched and al-Bashir relented . 
It was an important moment in China &apos;s evolution from a defensive to an offensive player on the international scene . 
China &apos;s second challenge concerns its hybrid capitalist / Leninist system of governance , which may not function well enough without democratic feedback and the rule of law . 
Party leaders may not become sufficiently attuned to the needs of China &apos;s people to respond to problems like corruption , environmental degradation , or peasant unrest before crises make them unsolvable . 
Although hardly democrats , President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao already are expending large of amounts of time and resources on divisive social problems in the countryside , where Mao &apos;s revolution started , but where income growth has lagged . 
Hu and Wen have cancelled national agricultural taxes , made rural schooling free , launched a new rural medical insurance plan , and guaranteed that , since there is still no title for holding private agricultural land , peasants are entitled to renew their long-term leases . 
So China may be edging towards a whole new way of interacting with the world and dealing with its people ; its curious authoritarian capitalism may be inching towards some new , and possibly viable , model for long-term development . 
But , as Mao always noted , theory should not be confused with practice , and the sustainability of such a model remains untested . 
Indeed , no state run by a Communist Party has yet managed to reform itself sufficiently to modernize and develop successfully . 
In this , China is a both pioneer and a developmental curiosity . 
What kind of nation China aspires to be , and where it is ultimately headed , is still something of a conundrum . 
Right now , China &apos;s focus is not on grand political visions for the future , but on grand visions for a Beijing reborn to impress the world . 
Beneath the surface are many threatening cracks . 
But to drive past the Olympic Green in Beijing will help make many Chinese believe that perhaps the center will hold in this unprecedented and unusual experiment of nation building .
