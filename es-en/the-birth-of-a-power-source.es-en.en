The Birth of a Power Source 
OXFORD - Germany has just crossed the threshold of 20 % renewable power - honoring its 2020 commitment to the European Union eight years ahead of schedule . 
As a bonus , towards the end of the decade , the world will also thank Germany for affordable solar power - not because the technology was invented there , but because its citizens will have paid for the critical cost-reduction phase by offering a large market . 
Germany &apos;s decade-long support of the rollout of solar photovoltaic ( PV ) technology has forced the technology down the cost curve at an accelerated rate . 
Before 2015 , it will be fully commercial for sunny South Africa , Greece , or Mexico - and soon thereafter for Germany itself . 
Without Germany &apos;s energy policy , this reduction in costs would have taken far longer to achieve . 
But German policy is not simply a matter of altruism . 
The story is sometimes told as follows : &quot; Germany has subsidized solar PV for years through artificially high feed-in tariffs . 
The result has been lots of solar panels - many of them imported from China - in a country with little sun , and 100,000 expensive jobs . &quot; 
The costs are certainly substantial - higher even than the estimated € 4 billion annual subsidy that Germany currently doles out to its nuclear industry , not to mention the € 2 billion subsidy for coal . 
Yet stories often reflect the frame of the storyteller , so here is an alternative version : &quot; Recognizing that new technologies require support to become competitive , Germany invented a system of diminishing feed-in tariffs . 
And when solar hits cost parity , Germany will have a well-positioned industry cluster . 
It will also have made a substantial contribution to the global commons by picking up the bill for everybody else . &quot; 
Some argue that governments don &apos;t have a role in picking the economy &apos;s winners and losers , and that the market should decide which technologies come out ahead in the race to decarbonize the power system . 
But the market can work its magic only when individual companies are large enough to fund the early learning curve of a new technology until it becomes competitive ( and thus profitable ) . 
The scale of the energy system and the long lead times needed to develop a new technology make radical change incompatible with short-term shareholder interests . 
At a minimum , a market-based approach would require putting a price on carbon and stopping subsidies to some of the old sources of power , both of which are currently out of reach politically . 
But , even with a hefty carbon price , it is unlikely that the market on its own would deliver low-carbon power . 
The reason is that the cost of goods and services , including low-carbon power , is reduced in two ways : research , such as thin-film technology to replace silicon-based solar panels , and incremental improvements in design , logistics , or operations as new technologies are implemented . 
The cost of solar panels has fallen by 10-20 % for every doubling of the manufacturing volume . 
Only by actually making more has the technology gotten cheaper . 
This is what officials ignore when , as Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte put it , &quot; wind turbines are powered by subsidies . &quot; 
As Germany has demonstrated , time-bound and diminishing subsidies are necessary to make any new power source competitive with the old . 
But , because the benefits accrue globally , this can be a hard sell for a narrow domestic agenda , particularly given that a decade of support may be required . 
Germany is actually not unique in midwifing a new energy technology . 
Brazil has successfully rolled the dice on a sugar-cane ethanol industry , and Denmark has taken an early lead in on-shore wind power . 
The United Kingdom &apos;s massive push into offshore wind power takes on a different meaning when viewed as a balanced contribution to the global commons . 
According to the International Energy Agency figures , offshore wind power would not be competitive until the early 2020 &quot; s - but the scale of the UK &apos;s plans could change that , making it competitive much sooner , as well as giving the country &apos;s industry a critical competitive head start . 
And the rewards go well beyond Britain : just as the UK will benefit from Germany &apos;s push in solar , Germany would reap rewards from the British effort . 
It doesn &apos;t always work : France &apos;s 1973 Messmer plan might well have led to safe and cheap nuclear power for all . 
But things turned out differently , and nuclear power has become an increasingly unattractive option . 
This is the heart of learning : sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t . 
True failure is not trying at all and free-riding on others &quot; efforts . 
Once someone agrees to underwrite the early-deployment phase of a new energy technology , what comes next is picking an area with some established expertise . 
Britain has been able to use its shipyards and its engineering skill base to capitalize on the opportunity of offshore wind . 
Likewise , Brazil &apos;s farming pedigree and favorable climate , not just its visionary policies , have made it the leader in ethanol fuels . 
Many other energy technologies are waiting for similar champions in order to reach their full potential . 
These include concentrated solar power , carbon sequestration and storage , driverless electric cars , direct-current backbones , zero-energy buildings , and second-generation biofuels . 
Governments should investigate the merits and possible pitfalls of each of these technologies , assess their own domestic strengths , and make strategic , long-term decisions about spearheading one or more of them . 
At a time of economic hardship , taking such risks would not only provide jobs , but would also offer potentially huge economic rewards .
