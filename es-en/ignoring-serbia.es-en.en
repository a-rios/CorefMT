Ignoring Serbia 
Berlin - Just before Christmas , Serbia &apos;s government formally submitted its application for European Union membership . 
A few days earlier , visa requirements for the country &apos;s citizens were lifted , together with those for citizens of Montenegro and Macedonia . 
The exultation about this step was great in all three of these countries ; their expectations of the EU are even greater now . 
Reactions in Europe , by contrast , were meager or non-existent . 
Public sentiment towards EU enlargement is negative . 
In fact , a majority of states and citizens would prefer to stop enlargement - the most important and effective means by which Europe is capable of projecting power - once and for all . 
Anonymous senior diplomats in Brussels were quoted as regarding Serbia &apos;s application to be too early ; otherwise , an embarrassing silence prevailed . 
Exhausted by the frustrating climate negotiations in Copenhagen , European leaders seemed not to be in the mood for questions about EU enlargement . 
Indeed , given the domestic political mood in the 27 member states , they are deeply convinced that discussing further enlargement would win them no bouquets . 
As a result , a subjective twilight is lowering over the European project . 
Serbia &apos;s application for accession is precisely such an opportunity . 
It was Serbia , Yugoslavia &apos;s largest federal unit , which , led by Slobodan Milosevic , triggered the great Balkans crisis and caused numerous wars and &quot; ethnic cleansings &quot; as the federation collapsed at the start of the 1990 &quot; s . 
Under Milosevic , a majority of the Serbs turned to radical nationalism based on violence and territorial conquest . 
Four wars - in Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and Kosovo - had to be fought and a fifth one - in Macedonia - had to be prevented at the last minute by NATO and the EU in order to put violent Serb nationalism in its place . 
With the defeat in Kosovo , Milosevic was finally thwarted . 
Still , throughout this time , integrating Serbia into the region &apos;s post-nationalist order remained central to the West &apos;s strategy . 
Certainly by the time of the West &apos;s military intervention in Bosnia , this strategy was based on the assumption that the European continent after the end of the Cold War should not allow itself to have a divided security system - that is , if security and peace were to be permanent . 
This meant that the Balkans , too , had to be introduced to Euro-Atlantic structures first and then integrated into NATO and the EU , because only a new European order could overcome the region &apos;s recurring tragedies and guarantee lasting security . 
Serbia played and plays a central - perhaps even the leading - role in this . 
Without addressing the question of its final borders , however , Serbia has no prospect of joining the EU . 
The Europeans have gained experience with Cyprus . 
They will not let another state into the EU whose border issues are not resolved beyond any doubt . 
And , in Serbia &apos;s case , this question remains open regarding Kosovo and - in a more concealed way - Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina . 
Serbia must also deliver Gen. Ratko Mladic , who led the Bosnian Serb army during the Balkan wars , to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague - or prove that he is dead or hiding elsewhere . 
Mladic , whose troops carried out atrocities throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina - including the massacre of thousands of Muslim civilians at Srebrenica in 1995 - is the most significant war-crimes suspect still at large since former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic &apos;s arrest in Belgrade and extradition to The Hague in 2008 . 
Nevertheless , the great importance of Serbia &apos;s application for EU accession is that it could bring about successful and permanent reorganization of the Balkans . 
To be sure , sure , the path to accession will be tiresome and long , but if both sides set out on this path decisively and sincerely , the whole region will be changed for the better . 
Europe stands only to gain from continued accession negotiations over Serbia . 
Bringing Serbia into the EU would permanently stabilize the regional order and - at the time when Europe is increasingly wary of indefinite military commitments  -  offer the prospect of a concrete exit strategy for NATO troops in Kosovo . 
But this assumes that the governments of EU member states finally accept their political responsibility and , instead of pandering to rampant enlargement fatigue , take decisive steps against it . 
Europeans may be too tired and divided to play a significant role in world politics , which could have dire consequences for Europe in this time of global realignment . 
But even if Europe abdicates its global role , the EU cannot forget about order within its immediate neighborhood , or hope that others will solve their problems for them . 
The Balkans are a part of Europe , and Europeans must solve the region &apos;s problems . 
Serbia &apos;s application for EU accession provides a historic opportunity to achieve just that .
