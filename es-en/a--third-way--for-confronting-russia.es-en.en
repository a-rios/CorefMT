A &quot; Third Way &quot; for Confronting Russia 
PARIS - &quot; Let &apos;s engage Russia if we can , but contain it if we must . &quot; 
These two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
Since then , Russia may have changed dramatically , but not our questions about it . 
What do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture , which is European , and its political system , which is becoming increasingly &quot; Asian , &quot; at least in the bad old sense of &quot; Oriental despotism &quot; ? 
Should the best answer to the return of Russia &apos;s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world &apos;s new maverick ? 
Or is a latter-day Yalta Conference , aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe , necessary ? 
Could the answer be a bit of both ? 
If Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon , or reverting to Soviet form - shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and re-conquest - what is needed is not the &quot; league of democracies &quot; advocated by some conservatives in America . 
What is needed , instead , is a &quot; stability league &quot; that includes prominent actors like China , India , and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in &quot; rocking the boat &quot; of the international system . 
Such a strategy implies , first of all , a solid partnership with China , not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy , but because it is a status-quo power . 
Such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran , and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO . 
The message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear . 
&quot; Do not fool yourself . 
Nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere ; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment . 
Europe may be weak and divided , America may no longer be what it was , but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas , you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers . 
China is ; you are not . &quot; 
But the containment argument fails , because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner . 
More importantly , rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia &apos;s great power pretensions too seriously . 
For example , many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe , but no longer for the world . 
At the Cold War &apos;s end , Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union . 
Today , the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia . 
The other alternative to a rebirth of &quot; containment &quot; would consist in accepting the Russian argument , or more precisely , Russian &quot; emotions . &quot; 
It would mean saying , in effect , &quot; We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years . 
From NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo , we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests . 
Let &apos;s sit down together like Churchill , Roosevelt , and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twenty-first-century map of Europe . 
What do you want back ? 
What do we keep ? &quot; 
This approach might recognize Russia &apos;s droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus . 
Indeed , while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s France , which currently holds the EU presidency , Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia &apos;s dismemberment . 
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia . 
The West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president &apos;s irresponsible behavior . 
As for Ukraine , it may one day become part of the European Union , but its future is not in NATO . 
Yet , between all-out containment , which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic , and accommodation which borders on appeasement , which would be dangerous for Europe &apos;s future , a third way , based on a few firm principles , must be found . 
These principles are clear . 
First , Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity is not negotiable . 
This has been said many times , but repetition does not diminish its importance . 
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state ; 
Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire . 
Second , even if the West condemns Georgia &apos;s irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia &apos;s sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its ex-imperial territories , the Kremlin &apos;s shameless brutality is unacceptable . 
After all , this is Europe more than six decades after World War II , and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
The use of force to settle scores and impose one nation &apos;s will upon another cannot be accepted passively . 
In the short term , time may be on Russia &apos;s side . 
In the long run - economically , demographically , politically , strategically - time is on &quot; our &quot; side , if we stick to our values and our principles .
