The BP Oil Spill &apos;s Lessons for Regulation 
CAMBRIDGE - As the damaged BP oil well continues to spew millions of gallons of crude from the depths of the floor of the Gulf of Mexico , the immediate challenge is how to mitigate an ever-magnifying environmental catastrophe . 
One can only hope that the spill will be contained soon , and that the ever-darkening worst-case scenarios will not materialize . 
The disaster , however , poses a much deeper challenge to how modern societies deal with regulating complex technologies . 
The accelerating speed of innovation seems to be outstripping government regulators &quot; capacity to deal with risks , much less anticipate them . 
The parallels between the oil spill andtherecent financial crisis are all too painful : the promise of innovation , unfathomable complexity , and lack of transparency ( scientists estimate that we know only a very small fraction of what goes on at the oceans &quot; depths . ) Wealthy and politically powerful lobbies put enormous pressure on even the most robust governance structures . 
It is a huge embarrassment for US President Barack Obama that he proposed - admittedly under pressure from the Republican opposition - to expand offshore oil drilling greatly just before the BP catastrophe struck . 
The oil technology story , like the one for exotic financial instruments , was very compelling and seductive . 
Oil executives bragged that they could drill a couple of kilometers down , then a kilometer across , and hit their target within a few meters . 
Suddenly , instead of a world of &quot; peak oil &quot; with ever-depleting resources , technology offered the promise of extending supplies for another generation . 
Western officials were also swayed by concerns about the stability of supplies in the Middle East , which accounts for a large proportion of the world &apos;s proven reserves . 
Some developing countries , most notably Brazil , have discovered huge potential offshore riches . 
Now all bets are off . In the United States , offshore drilling seems set to go the way of nuclear power , with new projects being shelved for decades . 
And , as is often the case , a crisis in one country may go global , with many other countries radically scaling back off-shore and out-of-bounds projects . 
Will Brazil really risk its spectacular coastline for oil , now that everyone has been reminded of what can happen ? 
What about Nigeria , where other risks are amplified by civil strife ? 
Oil experts argue that offshore drilling never had the potential to amount to more than a small share of global supply . 
And the problem is not just with oil . 
With important reserves near populated areas , governments will need to temper their enthusiasm and think about the balance between risks and riches . 
The basic problem of complexity , technology , and regulation extends to many other areas of modern life . 
Nanotechnology and innovation in developing artificial organisms offer a huge potential boon to mankind , promising development of new materials , medicines , and treatment techniques . 
Yet , with all of these exciting technologies , it is extremely difficult to strike a balance between managing &quot; tail risk &quot; - a very small risk of a very large disaster - and supporting innovation . 
Financial crises are almost comforting by comparison . 
Speculative bubbles and banking crises have been a regular feature of the economic landscape for centuries . 
Awful as they are , societies survive them . 
True , people who thought , &quot; This time is different , &quot; before the recent Great Recession were proven wrong . 
But , even if we are not getting any better at dealing with financial crises , things have not necessarily been getting worse , either . 
Perhaps the G-20 government leaders have not done quite as brilliant a job plugging the hole in the financial system as they claim . 
If ever there were a wake-up call for Western society to rethink its dependence on ever-accelerating technological innovation for ever-expanding fuel consumption , surely the BP oil spill should be it . 
Even China , with its &quot; boom now , deal with the environment later &quot; strategy should be taking a hard look at the Gulf of Mexico . 
Economics teaches us that when there is huge uncertainty about catastrophic risks , it is dangerous to rely too much on the price mechanism to get incentives right . 
Unfortunately , economists know much less about how to adapt regulation over time to complex systems with constantly evolving risks , much less how to design regulatory resilient institutions . 
Until these problems are better understood , we may be doomed to a world of regulation that perpetually overshoots or undershoots its goals . 
The finance industry already is warning thatnew regulation may overshoot - that is , have the unintended effect of sharply impeding growth . 
Now , we may soon face the same concerns over energy policy , and not just for oil . 
Given the huge financial stakes involved , achieving global consensus will be difficult , as the Copenhagen climate-change fiasco proved . 
The advanced countries , which can best afford to restrain long-term growth , must lead by example . 
The balance of technology , complexity , and regulation is without doubt one of the greatest challenges that the world must face in twenty-first century . 
We can ill afford to keep getting it wrong .
