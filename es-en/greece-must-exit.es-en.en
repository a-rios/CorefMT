Greece Must Exit 
NEW YORK - The Greek euro tragedy is reaching its final act : it is clear that either this year or next , Greece is highly likely to default on its debt and exit the eurozone . 
Postponing the exit after the June election with a new government committed to a variant of the same failed policies ( recessionary austerity and structural reforms ) will not restore growth and competitiveness . 
Greece is stuck in a vicious cycle of insolvency , lost competitiveness , external deficits , and ever-deepening depression . 
The only way to stop it is to begin an orderly default and exit , coordinated and financed by the European Central Bank , the European Commission , and the International Monetary Fund ( the &quot; Troika &quot; ) , that minimizes collateral damage to Greece and the rest of the eurozone . 
Greece &apos;s recent financing package , overseen by the Troika , gave the country much less debt relief than it needed . 
But , even with significantly more public-debt relief , Greece could not return to growth without rapidly restoring competitiveness . 
And , without a return to growth , its debt burden will remain unsustainable . 
But all of the options that might restore competitiveness require real currency depreciation . 
The first option , a sharp weakening of the euro , is unlikely , as Germany is strong and the ECB is not aggressively easing monetary policy . 
A rapid reduction in unit labor costs , through structural reforms that increased productivity growth in excess of wages , is just as unlikely . 
It took Germany ten years to restore its competitiveness this way ; 
Likewise , a rapid deflation in prices and wages , known as an &quot; internal devaluation , &quot; would lead to five years of ever-deepening depression . 
If none of those three options is feasible , the only path left is to leave the eurozone . 
A return to a national currency and a sharp depreciation would quickly restore competitiveness and growth . 
Of course , the process would be traumatic - and not just for Greece . 
The most significant problem would be capital losses for core eurozone financial institutions . 
Overnight , the foreign euro liabilities of Greece &apos;s government , banks , and companies would surge . 
Yet these problems can be overcome . 
A similar &quot; drachmatization &quot; of euro debts would be necessary and unavoidable . 
Losses that eurozone banks would suffer would be manageable if the banks were properly and aggressively recapitalized . 
Avoiding a post-exit implosion of the Greek banking system , however , might require temporary measures , such as bank holidays and capital controls , to prevent a disorderly run on deposits . 
The European Financial Stability Facility / European Stability Mechanism ( EFSF / ESM ) should carry out the necessary recapitalization of the Greek banks via direct capital injections . 
European taxpayers would effectively take over the Greek banking system , but this would be partial compensation for the losses imposed on creditors by drachmatization . 
Greece would also have to restructure and reduce its public debt again . 
The Troika &apos;s claims on Greece need not be reduced in face value , but their maturity would have to be lengthened by another decade , and the interest on it reduced . 
Further haircuts on private claims would also be needed , starting with a moratorium on interest payments . 
Some argue that Greece &apos;s real GDP would be much lower in an exit scenario than it would be during the hard slog of deflation . 
But that is logically flawed : even with deflation , real purchasing power would fall , and the real value of debts would rise ( debt deflation ) , as the real depreciation occurs . 
More importantly , the exit path would restore growth right away , via nominal and real depreciation , avoiding a decade-long depression . 
And trade losses imposed on the eurozone by the drachma depreciation would be modest , given that Greece accounts for only 2 % of eurozone GDP . 
Reintroducing the drachma risks exchange-rate depreciation in excess of what is necessary to restore competitiveness , which would be inflationary and impose greater losses on drachmatized external debts . 
To minimize that risk , the Troika reserves currently devoted to the Greek bailout should be used to limit exchange-rate overshooting ; capital controls would help , too . 
Those who claim that contagion from a Greek exit would drag others into the crisis are also in denial . 
Other peripheral countries already have Greek-style problems of debt sustainability and eroded competitiveness . 
Portugal , for example , may eventually have to restructure its debt and exit the euro . 
Illiquid but potentially solvent economies , such as Italy and Spain , will need support from Europe regardless of whether Greece exits ; indeed , without such liquidity support , a self-fulfilling run on Italian and Spanish public debt is likely . 
The substantial new official resources of the IMF and ESM - and ECB liquidity - could then be used to ring-fence these countries , and banks elsewhere in the eurozone &apos;s troubled periphery . 
Regardless of what Greece does , eurozone banks now need to be rapidly recapitalized , which requires a new EU-wide program of direct capital injections . 
The experience of Iceland and many emerging markets over the past 20 years shows that nominal depreciation and orderly restructuring and reduction of foreign debts can restore debt sustainability , competitiveness , and growth . 
As in these cases , the collateral damage to Greece of a euro exit will be significant , but it can be contained . 
Like a doomed marriage , it is better to have rules for the inevitable divorce that make separation less costly to both sides . 
Make no mistake : an orderly euro exit by Greece implies significant economic pain . 
But watching the slow , disorderly implosion of the Greek economy and society would be much worse .
