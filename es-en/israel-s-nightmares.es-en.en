Israel &apos;s Nightmares 
Paris - &quot; It is reasonable to believe in miracles , &quot; David Ben-Gurion , the first Prime Minister of Israel , once said . 
Today &apos;s Israelis do not seem to believe in miracles . 
Instead , more than ever before they are obsessed by nightmares , foremost among them , the prospect of a nuclear Iran . 
To prevent a regime imbued with an absolute ideology from gaining possession of the &quot; absolute weapon &quot; is Israel &apos;s paramount priority . 
Everything must be done , even a unilateral military strike , to prevent or at least delay Iran &apos;s acquisition of such a weapon . 
This Israeli conviction on what it considers an existential issue stands in stark contrast with the fatalism that otherwise dominates Israelis &quot; thinking about themselves and their relations with the Palestinians . 
How is this fatalism manifesting itself , where does it come from , and what can be done to transcend it ? 
These questions are important , because &quot; fatalism &quot; has become a major obstacle that must be overcome by anyone seriously interested in bringing peace to the region . 
For this fatalism is a strong card in the hands of someone such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who is intent on preserving the status quo . 
A majority of Israelis would probably back a preventive attack on Iran and satisfy themselves with the preservation of the status quo in relations with the Palestinians . 
In the aftermath of the Israeli election in February , which brought to power a government coalition that includes the extreme rightist Avigdor Lieberman , now Israel &apos;s foreign minister , an Israeli friend whose sympathies had always been with the left said to me in a resigned , cryptic way , &quot; It &apos;s sad , but it does not change anything ; we have no one to talk to anyway . &quot; 
He gave me approximately the same answer when I referred to the need to change Israel &apos;s electoral system based on proportional representation , which produces weak majorities at best and near-paralysis at worst . 
The same fatalism directly applies to the prospect of peace with Palestinians and the Arab / Muslim world in general . 
It is as if , paradoxically , Israelis had internalized the concept of &quot; temporary truce &quot; advocated by their Hamas adversary , and had given up the goal of peace through a two-state solution that they once pursued with the Palestinian Authority . 
For a majority of Israelis today , the present and the foreseeable future are not about peacemaking , but about conflict management , through the preservation of credible deterrence - a hard-core realistic assessment darkened by the perception that , while time is not necessarily on Israel &apos;s side , that there is no alternative . 
Israelis don &apos;t want to delude themselves the way they did in the 1990 &quot; s during the so-called Oslo peace process . 
The same fatalism also applies to relations with the outside world . 
A majority of Israelis are even more convinced today than they were yesterday that they can count only on themselves and , at the margin , on the Jewish Diaspora . 
This vision not only tends to encourage a process of self-isolation , but it raises serious issues in the long run . 
At the end of the day , there are only 13.2 million Jews in the world and nearly 1.3 billion Muslims . 
Israel needs allies , because its ultimate security depends on its legitimacy nearly as much as on its deterrence capability . 
If each relative military success is accompanied by an absolute political defeat , as was the case with the recent military operations in Gaza , what is the ratio between costs and benefits ? 
These deep Israeli emotions are the product of the encounter between the weight of the past and the &quot; facility &quot; of the present . 
It could be said without any exaggeration that the weight of the Holocaust is even more present today than it was decades ago . 
By calling for the destruction of the &quot; Zionist entity , &quot; Iran &apos;s president rubs that raw nerve . 
A little more than 60 years after the Shoah , one does not play lightly with such an evocation of destruction . 
In a world where , for many Israelis and non-Israeli Jews , Israel is becoming to the community of nations what Jews once were in the community of peoples - a pariah state , if not an eternal scapegoat - the memory of the Shoah resounds with a vengeance . 
On the other hand , there is great comfort in the status quo . 
After all , if you walk along Tel Aviv &apos;s beaches , the dramas of Hamas-controlled Gaza and Hezbollah-controlled southern Lebanon seem so far away . 
If the United States wants to be seriously involved in a renewed peace initiative , it can neither ignore nor passively accept the hierarchy of Israeli emotions . 
But creating a new balance that contains a little less obsession with Iran and a little more concern for the Palestinians is a formidable challenge .
