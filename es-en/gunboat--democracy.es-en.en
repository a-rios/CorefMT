Gunboat Democracy ? 
In one sense , Iraq &apos;s weapons of mass destruction were also weapons of mass distraction . 
Without doubt , President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair believed that Saddam Hussein either had , or had the wherewithal to produce , such weapons when they decided for pre-emptive war . 
In the case of Iraq , there was particular fear of chemical and biological weapons . 
But WMD were not the only motive for war . 
Both leaders were outraged about a murderous dictator and hoped that toppling him would open the door for democracy in Iraq . 
This ( they hoped ) would automatically bring about a degree of stability that would help resolve other conflicts in the region , and also guarantee the uninterrupted flow of oil . 
Mixed motives are not necessarily bad motives . 
In fact , most human motives are mixed . 
The real question is whether democracy could really have done the trick , and then , whether missiles and tanks are the right method to bring democracy to a country that has suffered dictatorial rule for a long period of time . 
Historical precedents played a part in the Iraq decision , not least because President Bush &apos;s national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice , cited them often . 
One example is Nazi Germany . 
To be sure , the Allies did not enter that war to bring democracy to Germany . 
In any case , Germany started the war . 
The Allies defended those to whom they were bound by treaty , and then the integrity of their own countries . 
Perhaps the entry of the United States into the ( European ) war had something to do with the post-war order . 
One was that Germany should be flattened and reduced to a pre-industrial society from which no effective aggression could ever emerge again . 
The other was that Germany should be helped on the way to democracy . 
As it happened , the protagonists of the first view were sidelined and the proponents of democratization prevailed . 
Indeed , the US was effective in using its &quot; soft power &quot; to build democracy in post-war Germany , though Britain was better . 
Democratic manners came more naturally to the British occupation forces . 
The second example , the end of the Cold War in 1989 , was also a success story . 
Of course , communism &apos;s collapse was not the result of a pre-emptive strike by the West ( though the arms race helped drive the system to implosion ) . 
After 1989 , however , Western assistance , not least by the US and Britain , eased the transition to democracy , the rule of law , and market economies in most post-communist countries . 
So why does this not seem to work in Iraq ? 
Evidently , differences of culture and circumstances abound . 
Even so , why has so little come of the intention of the Iraq war &apos;s leaders to give democracy a chance in that country ? 
One reason is that bringing democracy with missiles and tanks is almost a contradiction in terms . 
Democracy is by definition a peaceful method of settling conflicts . 
Of course , the bombing of Dresden in 1945 was not exactly peaceful . 
One must doubt whether it contributed anything to making democracy more acceptable after WWII . 
Still , when the fighting was over , the bombing stopped for good , and out of the tanks came people who were intent on creating democratic conditions and capable of doing so . 
There is much talk these days about &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft power , &quot; about America having one and Europe the other . 
In fact , the two belong together . 
Soft power without the backing of hard power changes little : witness Iran . 
On the other hand , hard power without soft power means only destruction . 
It is the greatest single weakness of the US forces that in 2004 - contrary to 1945 - they do not have the capacity to stop the bombing , get out of their tanks , and encourage indigenous democratic development from the bottom up . 
Where such capacity exists , there would also be recognition of the fact that democracy does not mean the same institutions in all cultural contexts . 
If there are elections in Iraq in January - and this is a very big &quot; if &quot; - they may not resolve much . 
Involving the people and providing for peaceful conflict resolution may require institutions peculiar to the region and its history . 
It is a great shame that so many Europeans have steered clear of Iraq with a mixture of self-righteousness and anti-American Schadenfreude . 
Greater European input might have balanced the &quot; hard power &quot; of the US military machine with the &quot; soft power &quot; of Europe &apos;s experience of diversity and of dealing with post-war situations . 
In fact , Europe &apos;s failure is not just a shame , but a historic calamity . 
Missiles and tanks alone cannot bring democracy , but coupled with the civil power of sensitive help for the defeated , democracy can be adapted to Iraq and the rest of the Middle East .
