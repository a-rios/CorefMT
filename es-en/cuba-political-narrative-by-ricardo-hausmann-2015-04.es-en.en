The Narrative Roots of Public Policy 
BUENOS AIRES - At the recent Summit of the Americas in Panama , Cuban President Raúl Castro chose to break with the agreed protocol . 
Instead of speaking for eight minutes , he took six times longer to present a political history of his country that was only loosely based on fact . 
Why ? 
As a card-carrying member of the economics profession , I have been trained to view the world from the perspective of the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham , according to whom the purpose of public policy is to create the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people . 
Policies that do not abide by some variant of this utilitarian principle ( as proposed by , say , John Rawls or Amartya Sen ) are bound to be inefficient or unfair . 
But recent advances in psychology and neuroscience may suggest that if we want to understand social and political behavior , or improve policies , we should be reading Hegel more than Bentham . 
That may sound weird , given that Hegel was an Idealist and would never have expected neuroscience - a material reality independent of Geist ( usually translated as Mind or Spirit ) - to be relevant to his inquiry . 
As Antonio Damasio argues in his aptly titled book Self Comes to Mind , the brain creates an autobiographical sense of self . 
It is also the autobiographical self - through the narrative that it creates about itself - that makes life something more than what the American writer , artist , and philosopher Elbert Hubbard once called &quot; one damn thing after another . &quot; 
And our brains are wired to figure out what other selves are thinking and feeling . 
I believe that this same structure applies to how we understand multi-person groups . 
It is no coincidence , for example , that the law treats corporations as persons . 
We think of the organization in which we work as if it was a person with rights , obligations , values , reputation , and temperament , on whose behalf managers regard themselves as acting . 
The same applies to nations and states . 
Our brains need to create a shared sense of self , an &quot; imagined community , &quot; as the political scientist Benedict Anderson put it , on whose behalf collective decisions are made . 
This community is a &quot; person &quot; that has a past and a future that transcend us as individuals . 
It has a history and a telos . 
By contrast , a purely Benthamite view would lead to a view of politics as a set of disparate decisions based on a disembodied utilitarian calculus . 
But this would feel like &quot; one damn thing after another . &quot; 
The set of political decisions made over time must make some sense , and this sense must come from the narrative that is superimposed on historical events . 
The narrative itself is socially constructed and only marginally bound by fact . 
For example , according to President Barack Obama &apos;s narrative , the United States has always been about a steady march toward freedom and equality , from the War of Independence to the abolition of slavery and the empowerment of women , minorities , and other previously marginalized groups , such as gays and those with handicaps . 
To the extent that this narrative is inaccurate , it is aspirational . 
It is the role of politics to create , sustain , and reshape this shared sense of self , of us ( and hence of them ) . 
It is an illusion , but a socially created illusion . 
It is how Bavarians and Venetians in the 1860s , for example , became convinced that they were and had always been Germans or Italians . 
Likewise , only a new narrative - a new Geist - can persuade the British today that they are really Europeans . 
Liberals , as the political scientist Drew Westen has explained , often refrain from the narrative of shared identity , perhaps owing to awareness that great crimes are often committed in its name . 
Hitler redefined the German Volk as the collective victim of an internal enemy that was tainting its blood - a type of narrative that , whether framed in terms of race , religion , or class , underlies genocide wherever it occurs . 
But it was also a national &quot; person &quot; that Abraham Lincoln invoked in his Gettysburg Address . 
In just 272 words , Lincoln synthesized America as an ideal based on the proposition that all men are created equal . 
In this narrative , the Civil War was fought to ensure &quot; that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . &quot; 
As the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre argued in After Virtue , narratives frame individuals &quot; moral choices . 
Likewise , narratives frame the choices that governments make . 
After his brush with Communists in Spain , George Orwell captured the essence of the narrative &apos;s importance in his novel 1984 : &quot; Who controls the past controls the future ; who controls the present , controls the past . &quot; 
For example , maintaining open labor markets in the European Union requires people to regard themselves and their new neighbors as European . 
Similarly , Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro cannot stop inflation , because the narrative of economic warfare in which he is trapped prevents him from justifying the decisions needed to stabilize prices . 
Marx &apos;s comparative advantage was to read Hegel and create a narrative in which history is the history of class struggle , with the newly emergent industrial proletariat destined to develop &quot; class consciousness &quot; and overthrow the political and economic order created by the bourgeoisie . 
Liberal democracy has been at a disadvantage in the battle for the narrative because it tends to treat the collective self as if it were just a rational median voter in search of a better job . 
But that is inadequate . 
Policies must fit within the prevailing narrative framework , while the great task of politics is to shape the narrative of tomorrow . 
No wonder , then , that while Obama used his eight minutes in Panama to delineate concrete policy initiatives that would bring happiness to the greatest number , Castro spent 48 minutes reinventing the past .
