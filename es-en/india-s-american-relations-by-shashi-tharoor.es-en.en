India &apos;s American Relations 
NEW DELHI - With America &apos;s presidential election looming , perhaps its most striking aspect from an Indian point of view is that no one in New Delhi is unduly concerned about the outcome . 
There is now a broad consensus in Indian policymaking circles that , whoever wins , India-United States relations are more or less on the right track . 
Democrats and Republicans alike have both been responsible for this development . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s successful visit to India in 2010 , and his historic speech to a joint session of Parliament , capped the most significant recent milestone in bilateral relations . 
This was one of many encounters that Obama has had with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in various forums since taking office , often in multilateral summits like the G-20 , and it consolidated the new relationship that has emerged from a decade of dramatic change . 
Throughout the Cold War , the world &apos;s oldest democracy and its largest were essentially estranged . 
America &apos;s initial indifference was best reflected in President Harry Truman &apos;s reaction when Chester Bowles asked to be named ambassador to India : &quot; I thought India was pretty jammed with poor people and cows round streets , witch doctors , and people sitting on hot coals and bathing in the Ganges ... but I did not realize anybody thought it was important . &quot; 
If that was bad , India &apos;s political orientation was worse . 
The American preference for making anti-communist allies , however unsavory , tied Washington to Pakistan &apos;s increasingly Islamist dictatorship , while India &apos;s non-aligned democracy drifted toward the secular Soviet embrace . 
The US government regarded non-alignment with distaste ; 
In a world divided between two uncompromising superpowers , India &apos;s temporizing seemed like appeasement at best , and aid and comfort for the enemy at worst . 
Pakistan , on the other hand , became an essential component in America &apos;s strategy of containment of the Soviet Union and in its later opening to China . 
From India &apos;s point of view , US indulgence of Pakistan became overt hostility when the US sent the Seventh Fleet into the Bay of Bengal in support of the Pakistani genocide in Bangladesh in 1971 . 
Tempers cooled soon enough , but India was always regarded as tilting toward the Kremlin , hardly a recommendation for warm relations in American eyes . 
With the end of the Cold War , and India &apos;s reorientation of its foreign policy , as well as its increasing integration into the global economy , a thaw set in . 
India &apos;s detonation of a nuclear device in 1998 , however , triggered a fresh round of US sanctions . 
President Bill Clinton began to turn things around with a hugely successful visit to India in 2000 , his last year in office . 
George W. Bush &apos;s administration took matters much further , with a defense agreement in 2005 and a landmark accord on civil nuclear cooperation in 2008 ( which remains the centerpiece of the transformed relationship ) . 
The nuclear accord simultaneously accomplished two things . 
It admitted India into the global nuclear club , despite its refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
More important , it acknowledged that US exceptionalism had found a sibling . 
Thanks to the US , which strong-armed the 45 countries of the Nuclear Suppliers &quot; Group into swallowing their concerns that special treatment for India could constitute a precedent for rogue nuclear aspirants like Pakistan , North Korea , and Iran , there is now an &quot; Indian exception . &quot; 
Under Obama , nothing quite so dramatic was possible : no spectacular breakthroughs were conceived or executed , nor could many have been imagined . 
The US is India &apos;s largest trading partner ( if both goods and services are included ) . 
American exports to India have grown faster in the last five years than those to any other country . 
The Confederation of Indian Industry estimates that , despite the recent global financial crisis and the US recession that sparked it , bilateral trade in services is likely to grow from $ 60 billion to more than $ 150 billion in the next six years . 
During the Obama years , there has been progress on other fronts - the small but significant steps that add up to strengthening the sinews of a relationship . 
Agreements on seemingly mundane subjects like agriculture , education , health , and even space exploration and energy security attest to enhanced cooperation . 
The two governments have also proclaimed initiatives on clean energy and climate change . 
Significant trade and investment deals , as well as growing linkages between American and Indian universities , have confirmed that each country is developing a more significant stake in the other than ever before . 
As a result , Indians will follow the unfolding US elections , like everyone else , with more than passing interest .
