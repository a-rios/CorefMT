Stock Market Fantasies 
Historically , the stock market has performed well . 
In his celebrated 2002 book Stocks for the Long Run , Jeremy Siegel shows that the American stock market returned 6.9 % per year in real terms between 1802 and 2001 . 
Though the return varied by decade , even turning negative in some decades , overall it performed fairly consistently . 
This 6.9 % annual average return has since been referred to as &quot; Siegel &apos;s constant , &quot; as if Siegel had discovered a new law of nature . 
The idea that stocks will perform well in the future has many promoters today , especially among those trying to sell investments in stocks . 
In the United States , President George W. Bush &apos;s Commission to Strengthen Social Security cited Siegel for its claim that the government should encourage people to invest in stocks . 
Bush has been traveling the country promoting a plan to introduce personal retirement accounts invested in stocks and bonds . 
The plan assumes a 6.5 % real return for stocks - only slightly below Siegel &apos;s constant -in future decades . 
But most people don &apos;t believe that the stock market will perform so well in the future . 
Siegel himself recently projected only a 6 % average real return for US stocks over the next four decades . 
Others have lower expectations . 
I have been conducting surveys of US investors under the auspices of the Yale School of Management , asking what percentage change they expect for the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
The expected one-year increase in the Dow in 2005 averages 4.8 % for institutional investors and 4.3 % for individual investors . 
On closer inspection , the idea that the market will yield a real 6.9 % a year in the future appears suspect . 
Think about it : investing in the stock market at 6.9 % a year , and reinvesting any dividends , means that , in a tax-free account , the real value of the investment will double every ten years . 
At that rate , a 20-year-old who in 1960 invested $ 4,000 a year in a tax-free account in the US stock market would have one million dollars by age 65 today . 
Should we expect to be able to do that in the future ? 
Obviously , most people didn &apos;t invest this way in 1960 . 
But could most people have ? 
It is natural to suppose that it could not . 
In fact , statistics on past stock market performance mislead because of what statisticians call &quot; selection bias , &quot; which occurs when the sample from which a statistic is derived is not representative of all the data . 
Several kinds of selection bias must be considered when we look at Siegel &apos;s constant . 
The most fundamental problem is that , in examining stock market investments , we are selecting an economic activity because it was a consistent success in the past . 
We are trying to extrapolate the past experience of a small fraction of the world population that we have chosen to examine because they made a lot of money . 
Of course , if one looks at many different investment strategies and many different countries , one can find something that performed spectacularly in the past , even if there is no strategy that can be expected to do so well in the future . 
The US had one of the world &apos;s most successful stock markets in the twentieth century . 
Elroy Dimson , Paul Marsh , and Mike Staunton wrote in their book Triumph of the Optimists that of 15 countries that have advanced economies today , the US stock market ranked fourth in its rate of return between 1900 and 2000 , behind Australia , Sweden , and South Africa . 
The geometric average real return of the US stock market was 6.7 % , but the median geometric real return for the other countries was only 4.7 % . 
But even this comparison involves a selection bias . 
Countries with more successful markets are more likely to have complete data on both prices and dividends for a hundred years . 
A study by Philippe Jorion and William Goetzmann found 39 countries with reliable stock price data - though not dividend data - for a good part of the twentieth century . 
Their sample included countries in Latin America and Asian countries beyond Japan . 
They found that the median real stock price appreciation from 1920 to 1996 for all these countries was only 0.8 % , compared to 4.3 % for the US . 
The US was actually ranked first among the 39 countries . 
Of course , even looking at these countries entails selection bias , for it excludes countries without price data for much of the twentieth century , notably China and Russia , where communist revolutions terminated the stock markets , resulting in -100 % returns for investors . 
The particular problems that prevented us from observing the returns on these stock markets will never be repeated , but it is wrong to assume that problems of that scale will not recur . 
There is also the selection bias that we infer from looking at the twentieth century , the most successful in terms of economic growth in human history . 
The twenty-first century will be different in ways that we cannot fathom today . 
Of course , investing in stocks is not a bad thing . 
Indeed , the stock market is an important component of any modern economy .
