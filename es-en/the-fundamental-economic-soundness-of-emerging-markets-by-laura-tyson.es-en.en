A Bumpy Ride for Emerging Markets 
BERKELEY - Emerging markets have been the darlings of global investors for most of the last decade . 
Even staid pension funds and sovereign wealth funds have increased their allocations to emerging-market assets . 
Recently , however , the environment for capital flows to emerging economies has deteriorated sharply . 
Slowing growth and policy missteps , together with signs that the US Federal Reserve will start tightening monetary policy by scaling back its &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ( QE , or open-ended purchases of long-term assets ) , have triggered deep sell-offs in emerging economies &quot; currency , bond , and equity markets . 
What went wrong ? 
Are we witnessing the collapse of yet another economic bubble , as many analysts are claiming ? 
Capital flows to emerging economies surged from 2002 to 2007 , collapsed briefly during the 2008 global financial crisis , and then surged again from 2009 to 2011 . 
In 2011 , growing anxiety about a possible financial crisis in Europe interrupted these flows , but they rebounded in 2012 . 
By the end of that year , flows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , portfolio equity , and portfolio debt to emerging economies had reached record highs . 
FDI flows , which are less volatile than other capital flows , remained by far the largest , accounting for nearly 60 % of emerging markets &quot; total inflows in 2012 . 
But , from 2009 to 2012 , portfolio bond flows , which are sensitive to sudden shifts in investor sentiment , were the most rapidly growing component of inflows . 
Forthcoming research by the McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ) estimates that emerging markets accounted for about 15 % of all cross-border portfolio bond flows during this period - an all-time high . 
According to economic theory , the major determinants of capital flows to emerging-market economies are real growth-rate differentials , interest-rate differentials , and global risk aversion . 
Faster growth and higher interest rates in emerging markets relative to those in developed economies encourage capital flows to the former , while an increase in global risk aversion - for example , during the eurozone crisis in 2011 - discourages them . 
Research by the International Monetary Fund and a Fed working paper confirm that this theory fits the patterns of the last decade , although some changes have occurred since the 2008 financial crisis . 
The IMF finds that emerging markets &quot; net capital inflows have been above their long-term structural trend and more sensitive to interest-rate differentials since 2008 . 
The Fed study finds that emerging economies &quot; total net capital inflows have been higher than expected in the post-crisis period , driven by larger-than-predicted net portfolio inflows ( mainly bond flows ) . 
And , since the crisis , portfolio flows have been more sensitive to both interest-rate differentials and global risk aversion . 
The MGI also finds that , compared to pre-crisis trends , portfolio-debt inflows to emerging markets were larger than predicted between 2009 and 2012 . 
The recent decline in capital flows to emerging markets is also consistent with theory . 
For starters , the growth-rate differential favoring emerging markets has declined . 
China &apos;s growth has fallen as it attempts to rein in excessive credit and bad debt . 
China &apos;s slowdown and prolonged recession in parts of Europe have weakened demand in global commodity markets , depressing growth in commodity-exporting countries like Brazil , Russia , and South Africa . 
Meanwhile , India &apos;s growth rate has plunged as a result of faltering economic reforms and unsustainable budgetary choices : it now has record-high fiscal and current-account deficits . 
And political unrest has marred growth prospects in Turkey , Brazil , and South Africa . 
Moreover , global risk aversion has spiked in response to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s announcement of plans to &quot; taper &quot; QE . 
As the 2008 and 2011 experiences demonstrate , heightened risk aversion among global investors reduces capital flows to emerging markets , even when they are not the source of risk . 
Finally , the interest-rate environment has changed . 
Despite repeated assertions by Fed officials that they are committed to near-zero short-term interest rates for the foreseeable future , hints of QE tapering have caused yields on ten-year US Treasury bonds to rise by 100 basis points from this year &apos;s lows . 
Higher long-term interest rates in the US ( and expectations of further hikes ) are eating into the interest-rate differentials that attracted yield-hungry investors to emerging markets from 2009 to 2012 . 
The losses in emerging-market currencies and assets in recent months are a harsh reminder of an inconvenient truth : when the Fed tightens monetary policy to manage macroeconomic conditions in the US , there are large unintended spillover effects on capital flows to emerging markets . 
We saw this before in the events precipitating the financial crises that engulfed emerging markets in the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Fortunately , many emerging economies are better prepared to weather the storm now than they were then . 
Their exchange rates are now flexible , they have built large foreign-currency reserves , and they have limited their foreign-currency debt . 
Moreover , their macroeconomic fundamentals are sound , and they have used macro- and micro-prudential tools to contain surges in capital inflows and minimize their destabilizing effects on asset prices and credit conditions . 
But some countries are at risk , especially those with large current-account deficits , large foreign capital inflows relative to the size of their financial markets , and low foreign-exchange reserves . 
Among the most vulnerable are Turkey , South Africa , Brazil , India , and Indonesia - a group that Morgan Stanley researchers have dubbed the &quot; Fragile Five . &quot; 
At the recent annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde expressed concern about slowing growth in emerging markets and urged them to pursue additional economic reforms . 
But she acknowledged that the inevitable exit from ultra-easy monetary policies in the US and other developed economies could trigger financial-market instability in emerging economies , and pledged IMF support , including on a precautionary or pre-emptive basis , to assist them . 
Over the long term , owing to increasing populations , expanding middle classes , and rapid productivity gains , emerging-market economies that pursue sound policies will continue to grow much faster than developed economies . 
Once the market turbulence sparked by changes in US monetary policy subsides , they will once again become the darlings of global investors seeking returns from growth and diversification .
