Europe \ u0027s University Challenge 
The university systems in the US and Continental Europe couldn &apos;t be more different . 
Which works better ? 
The answer is clear : America &apos;s by a long shot . 
European universities are generally based on three misguided principles : taxpayers rather than students pay for university education ; faculty appointments are governed by public sector contracts and university procedures are often centralized and almost always inflexible ; salaries amongst teachers tend to be equalized as well as teaching quality amongst universities . 
This system is supposedly more egalitarian than America &apos;s system of higher education , which many Europeans look down on as elitist . 
In reality , Europe &apos;s system typically produces less research , worse students ( especially at the doctoral level ) , and is probably less egalitarian than the US system . 
Having taxpayers cover the costs of university education is indeed redistributive , but in the wrong direction - the beneficiaries are most often the children of comfortable European families . 
Even taking a generous view , the best that can be said is that the system is neutral insofar as redistribution is concerned , because the wealthiest pay more taxes and use more university services . 
In addition to favoring Europe &apos;s &quot; haves , &quot; this system makes it virtually impossible for self-financed private universities to survive . 
In fact , this is probably the true motivation of Europe &apos;s free public university system : to maintain the state &apos;s monopoly on higher education . 
But consider , instead , the US system : students pay for their education and , with part of the tuition these students pay , universities finance scholarships for deserving but poor students . 
Such a system is at least as &quot; fair &quot; as Europe &apos;s model , and probably more so than one in which taxpayers pay for everybody , including the rich . 
Indeed , recent research comparing education in the US and Italy finds that family income is more important in determining a student &apos;s success ( measured in terms of his salary ) in &quot; egalitarian &quot; Italy than it is in &quot; elitist &quot; America . 
But competition is as important as financing in determining a university &apos;s quality , because competition increases the merit of the product . 
This is true in the US system , where public and private universities coexist happily . 
The University of California at Berkeley is public . 
Stanford University , an hour away down the coast , is private . 
Both are among America &apos;s finest universities . 
Competition between them works because it involves fighting for the best students and offering scholarships to deserving poor ones . 
By contrast , Europe &apos;s centralization and bureaucratization control over universities produces only mediocrity . 
Appointments in European universities are often governed by complex bureaucratic processes that involve countless &quot; judges &quot; chosen from all over a country . 
This process is supposedly designed to &quot; guarantee &quot; that the best are appointed . 
In reality , however , these judges make it easier for insiders to appoint their friends , rather than for the quality of research and teaching to determine who is hired . 
Some countries , take France , are changing their systems by appointing a few academics from other countries onto hiring and promotion committees . 
While this is obviously a move in the right direction , it will produce few results . 
The best American universities operate their hiring processes internally , relying on outsiders only for expert opinions on the quality of a candidate professor &apos;s research . 
What produces good appointments is the threat that mediocre professors will make it difficult to attract good students and large research grants . 
Europe &apos;s tendency to equalize salary and treatment of professors and researchers also reduces the incentive to engage in good research and good teaching . 
If the only factor that increases a professor &apos;s salary is the passage of time , why make the extra effort to excel ? 
Of course , love of research and teaching is why many people join university faculties in the first place , but why not give these noble sentiments a helping hand with appropriate financial incentives ? 
Low salaries are often part of an implicit bargain : in exchange for the bad pay , university administrators close their eyes to lazy teaching and research . 
Moreover , if salaries are low , how can university deans stop their faculty members from scouring the country to do lucrative consulting ? 
The result is bad teaching , lousy research , and absentee professors . 
US universities often use aggressive financial incentives and differential treatment of professors to reward good teaching and research . 
Also , the private nature of contracts between an American university and its professors creates healthy competition for talent and a flexible and efficient market for scientists . 
The result is that it is not uncommon for a bright , productive young professor in America to earn as much , if not more , than older and less productive colleagues . 
In Europe , promising young researchers struggle and have to supplement teaching and research with outside jobs , while established professors earn good salaries . 
Given these conditions , it should surprise no one that American universities nowadays are increasingly staffed by many of Europe &apos;s best scholars . 
What is surprising in the face of this brain drain is the power of the lobby of university professors in Europe to block reform .
