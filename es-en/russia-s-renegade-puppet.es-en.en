Russia &apos;s Renegade Puppet 
MOSCOW - Ramzan Kadyrov , the president of Chechnya , recently proposed to Ahmed Zakaev , a leader of the nationalistic and comparatively moderate Chechen opposition , that he return to Chechnya . 
Kadyrov promised Zakaev amnesty and various positions ranging from director of the local theater to Minister of Culture . 
Zakaev looked ready to accept the proposal . 
His position in the nationalist opposition was weak . 
There seem to be few , if any , fighters in Chechnya who recognize him as commander ; his recent attempt to send an emissary to create a fighting unit directly under his command was not successful . 
At the same time , Zakaev maintained rather friendly relations with Kadyrov , whose achievements - making Chechnya practically independent - he implicitly acknowledged . 
The Kremlin supposedly would not have opposed the deal . 
But , although Zakaev was one of the most moderate members of the Chechen resistance , an amnesty for him needed the Kremlin &apos;s approval , and he does not seem to have received it , which is probably why he refused Kadyrov &apos;s offer . 
But the reason the Kremlin balked at offering Zakaev an amnesty is unlikely to be related him personally , but rather to Kadyrov . 
The return to Chechnya of an amnestied Zakaev would greatly increase Kadyrov &apos;s prestige . 
But the Kremlin wants to avoid this , owing to Kadyrov &apos;s growing power and its general unease with a Russian Muslim elite that , while formally acknowledging Russian suzerainty , increasingly demands a redistribution of power within the Russian Federation . 
For most of the past two decades , jihadists in the Caucasus and Central Asia were a major source of concern for the Kremlin . 
Fear of &quot; Talibanization &quot; of the Caucasus prompted the Kremlin &apos;s recent announcement that Russian Muslims should be protected from extremist propaganda from abroad , and that Russian Muslim education and spiritual life should be controlled in order to direct them away from extremism . 
It was fear of extremism , as well as a more general increase violence , that led to the rise of the Kadyrov clan in 2004 , when the Kremlin decided to engage in a &quot; Chechenization &quot; of the conflict . 
The plan implied that the Kremlin would provide the Kadyrovs - first Akhmad Kadyrov , and then , after his death , his son , Ramzan - broad autonomy ( independence in all but name ) and huge sums of money . 
The Kremlin closed its eyes to Kadryov &apos;s amnesty of former guerrillas and their inclusion in his paramilitary units . 
In exchange , Kadyrov was to wage war against the remaining Islamist resistance and thus relieve Moscow of the burden of shedding Russian blood , or at least minimize the cost in Russian casualties . 
The plan initially worked . 
Kadyrov was able to create a strong force that could fight the guerrillas , basically on its own . 
Kadyrov &apos;s efforts can also be credited with ending major terrorist attacks in Russia &apos;s heartland , such as those that occurred in Moscow in 2002 and in Beslan in 2004 . 
Kadyrov seemed an effective antidote to the jihadists . 
Still , the logical conclusion of the Kremlin &apos;s Kadyrov policy appears to be precisely what it sought to prevent - Chechen independence - when it engaged in the first Chechen war almost a generation ago . 
Receiving from the Kremlin virtual carte blanche to do what he wants in Chechnya , Kadyrov made genuine efforts to transform himself into a popular leader . 
It is clear that he has not brought down the unemployment rate and has no intention of ending corruption . 
Still , he can be credited for some tangible results in bringing Chechnya a modicum of normality . 
The restoration of the capital , Grozny , was one of his clear achievements . 
Grozny was totally destroyed during the first Chechen war ; both Russian and foreign observers compared it with WWII Stalingrad and assumed that it would be impossible to restore the city . 
It was suggested that a new Chechen capital be built . 
Yet , having enjoyed a huge subsidy from Moscow , Kadyrov has rebuilt Grozny and provided it with some security . 
Kadyrov also catered to the spiritual aspirations of the Chechen majority . 
He rejected Wahhabism - the ideological framework of the jihadists . 
But he maintained that Islam is an essential part of the Chechen tradition and presented himself as a leader who fully understood this . 
So he encouraged an Islamic dress code and built a huge mosque - one of the biggest , if not the biggest , in Europe . 
All of this brought Kadyrov wide support among the Chechen population . 
Even those who dislike him sometimes conclude that he is the best all the possible options , and he has improved his position by persistently weeding out Chechen military forces that are not directly under his command . 
His most recent effort was the liquidation of the &quot; Vostok &quot; battalion , despite its being an integral part of the Russian army . 
It was probably inevitable that Kadyrov &apos;s increasing power would worry the Kremlin , especially after the Kremlin itself created a precedent for secession by recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia of the war with Georgia of 2008 . 
Allowing Zakaev &apos;s return would have worsened matters by increasing Kadyrov &apos;s prestige at home , as well as his international visibility and legitimacy . 
That would have pushed Kadyrov even further away from Russian control at a time when the Kremlin has become increasingly unable , and possibly reluctant , to purchase his loyalty .
