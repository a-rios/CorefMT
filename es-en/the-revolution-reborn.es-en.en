The Revolution Reborn 
MEXICO CITY - In El Salvador , for the first time ever in Latin America , a former political-military organization that tried to gain power through the barrel of a gun has achieved its aims through the ballot box . 
Although the Sandinista Front in Nicaragua did win a semi-legitimate election in 1984 , it had reached power five years earlier by overthrowing the Somoza dictatorship . 
By 2006 , when Daniel Ortega was finally re-elected , the old Sandinista Front of 1979 was unrecognizable . 
El Salvador &apos;s Farabundo Martí Liberation Front ( FMLN ) was created in 1980 , through the fusion of five guerrilla groups supported by Cuba and Nicaragua . 
The FMLN nominated a presentable and attractive candidate , Mauricio Funes , for last Sunday &apos;s presidential election , and , despite seeing a 10-point lead whittled down to barely two points by election night , squeaked out an uncontested victory . 
The conservative ARENA party , which has governed El Salvador since the country &apos;s 10-year civil war ended in 1992 , did everything possible to prevent an FMLN victory , resorted , once again , to every red-baiting trick in the book . 
According to ARENA &apos;s relentlessly negative campaign , a triumph for the left would bring communism , Hugo Chávez , and the Castro brothers to San Salvador . 
But scare tactics did not work this time . 
There is obviously a lesson here to be learned by other left-wing political movements and guerrilla groups in Latin America . 
The Socialist Party in Chile , the Workers Party in Brazil , the Broad Front in Uruguay , even Chávez in Venezuela and the PRD and FSLN in Mexico and Nicaragua , respectively , have shown that , after years of waiting , the left can win elections in Latin America . 
The difference between these victorious leftists and El Salvador &apos;s FMLN will be revealed when the FMLN &apos;s old characteristics as an armed movement are challenged by the daily facts of governance . 
It is they , not Funes , who control the FMLN organization . 
The FMLN &apos;s most reform-minded , democratic , modern , and brilliant leaders - Facundo Guardado , Joaquin Villalobos , Salvador Samayoa , Ana Guadalupe Martinez , and Ferman Cienfuegos - have all left the party . 
A second worrying factor is the FMLN &apos;s links to Cuba and Venezuela . 
As recently as a year ago , anyone who visited FMLN headquarters in San Salvador to interview , for example , Ceren , its Secretary General , would be struck by the overwhelming presence of Chávez : red shirts , red berets , pictures of the Venezuelan caudillo , quotations from his teachings and musings . 
Chávez helped the FMLN by giving free or cheap oil to its mayors in many parts of the country , and probably ( though it has not been proven ) by channeling funds , if only in small quantities , to the party &apos;s electoral coffers . 
The Cuban presence also remains strong , although the recent political purges initiated by Raúl Castro make it difficult to know who exactly is working for whom . 
Ramiro Abreu , who &quot; ran &quot; El Salvador for Cuba &apos;s Department of the Americas in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , remains active , but now more as a businessman and a senior statesman than as a Cuban operative . 
But Cuba &apos;s influence on the old FMLN leadership remains intact . 
Cuban and Venezuelan involvement in political parties in Mexico or Brazil , for example , is undisputable , but not necessarily very relevant . 
These are large countries with huge economies , where conspiring and doling out small perks and favors is not very effective . 
But El Salvador , like Nicaragua , Bolivia , and Ecuador , is another story . 
A third factor that weighs in the balance in analyzing what sort of government the FMLN may deliver is the economic crisis that is battering Latin America . 
For the moment , it is impossible to ascertain whether the recession will provoke a radicalization of the left in the region , which Chávez seems to be promoting , or induce moderation through resignation - that is , a postponement of revolutionary goals owing to inauspicious economic conditions . 
We will know soon . 
But the most important consequence of the FMLN &apos;s victory may lie in its effect on the rest of Central America and Mexico . 
Honduran President Manuel Zelaya , more out of convenience and demagogy than conviction , has moved into the Chávez orbit ; 
Nicaragua &apos;s Ortega was always part of that orbit , as are people close to Alvaro Colóm in Guatemala . 
If too we add El Salvador to this list , only Costa Rica and Panama to the south remain out of the loop , leaving Mexico to the north increasingly exposed . 
Of course , the Central American nations do not wield huge influence in Mexico ; if anything , it is the other way around . 
But the Mexican left , while no longer as weak as it was after its defeat in 2006 , has always needed foreign role models . 
It sympathizes far more with Chávez , Bolivian President Evo Morales , Cuba , the Sandinistas , and now the FMLN than with the moderate left elected in Chile , Brazil , Uruguay , and Peru . 
They will read Funes &quot; victory as one more notch on the barrel of &quot; the people &apos;s &quot; rifle and one more hair plucked from Uncle Sam &apos;s beard . 
To dismiss the FMLN &apos;s historical achievement as simply an act of justice or a foreseeable event in a tiny backwater would be reckless .
