Cyber War and Peace 
CAMBRIDGE - Two years ago , a piece of faulty computer code infected Iran &apos;s nuclear program and destroyed many of the centrifuges used to enrich uranium . 
Some observers declared this apparent sabotage to be the harbinger of a new form of warfare , and United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has warned Americans of the danger of a &quot; cyber Pearl Harbor &quot; attack on the US . 
But what do we really know about cyber conflict ? 
The cyber domain of computers and related electronic activities is a complex man-made environment , and human adversaries are purposeful and intelligent . 
Mountains and oceans are hard to move , but portions of cyberspace can be turned on and off by throwing a switch . 
It is far cheaper and quicker to move electrons across the globe than to move large ships long distances . 
The costs of developing those vessels - multiple carrier task forces and submarine fleets - create enormous barriers to entry , enabling US naval dominance . 
But the barriers to entry in the cyber domain are so low that non-state actors and small states can play a significant role at low cost . 
In my book The Future of Power , I argue that the diffusion of power away from governments is one of this century &apos;s great political shifts . 
Cyberspace is a perfect example . 
Large countries like the US , Russia , Britain , France , and China have greater capacity than other states and non-state actors to control the sea , air , or space , but it makes little sense to speak of dominance in cyberspace . 
If anything , dependence on complex cyber systems for support of military and economic activities creates new vulnerabilities in large states that can be exploited by non-state actors . 
Four decades ago , the US Department of Defense created the Internet ; today , by most accounts , the US remains the leading country in terms of its military and societal use . 
But greater dependence on networked computers and communication leaves the US more vulnerable to attack than many other countries , and cyberspace has become a major source of insecurity , because , at this stage of technological development , offense prevails over defense there . 
The term &quot; cyber attack &quot; covers a wide variety of actions , ranging from simple probes to defacing Web sites , denial of service , espionage , and destruction . 
Similarly , the term &quot; cyber war &quot; is used loosely to cover a wide range of behaviors , reflecting dictionary definitions of war that range from armed conflict to any hostile contest ( for example , &quot; war between the sexes &quot; or &quot; war on drugs &quot; ) . 
At the other extreme , some experts use a narrow definition of cyber war : a &quot; bloodless war &quot; among states that consists solely of electronic conflict in cyberspace . 
But this avoids the important interconnections between the physical and virtual layers of cyberspace . 
As the Stuxnet virus that infected Iran &apos;s nuclear program showed , software attacks can have very real physical effects . 
A more useful definition of cyber waris hostile action in cyberspace whose effects amplify or are equivalent to major physical violence . 
In the physical world , governments have a near-monopoly on large-scale use of force , the defender has an intimate knowledge of the terrain , and attacks end because of attrition or exhaustion . 
Both resources and mobility are costly . 
In the cyber world , by contrast , actors are diverse ( and sometimes anonymous ) , physical distance is immaterial , and some forms of offense are cheap . 
Because the Internet was designed for ease of use rather than security , attackers currently have the advantage over defenders . 
Technological evolution , including efforts to &quot; reengineer &quot; some systems for greater security , might eventually change that , but , for now , it remains the case . 
The larger party has limited ability to disarm or destroy the enemy , occupy territory , or use counterforce strategies effectively . 
Cyber war , though only incipient at this stage , is the most dramatic of the potential threats . 
Major states with elaborate technical and human resources could , in principle , create massive disruption and physical destruction through cyber attacks on military and civilian targets . 
Responses to cyber war include a form of interstate deterrence through denial and entanglement , offensive capabilities , and designs for rapid network and infrastructure recovery if deterrence fails . 
At some point , it may be possible to reinforce these steps with certain rudimentary norms and arms control , but the world is at an early stage in this process . 
If one treats so-called &quot; hacktivism &quot; by ideological groups as mostly a disruptive nuisance at this stage , there remain four major categories of cyber threats to national security , each with a different time horizon : cyber war and economic espionage are largely associated with states , and cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors . 
For the US , the highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime , but over the next decade or so , war and terrorism could become greater threats than they are today . 
Moreover , as alliances and tactics evolve , the categories may increasingly overlap . 
In the view of Admiral Mike McConnell , America &apos;s former director of national intelligence , &quot; Sooner or later , terror groups will achieve cyber-sophistication . 
It &apos;s like nuclear proliferation , only far easier . &quot; 
The world is only just beginning to see glimpses of cyber war - in the denial-of-service attacks that accompanied the conventional war in Georgia in 2008 , or the recent sabotage of Iranian centrifuges . 
States have the greatest capabilities , but non-state actors are more likely to initiate a catastrophic attack . 
A &quot; cyber 9 / 11 &quot; may be more likely than the often-mentioned &quot; cyber Pearl Harbor . &quot; 
It is time for states to sit down and discuss how to limit this threat to world peace .
