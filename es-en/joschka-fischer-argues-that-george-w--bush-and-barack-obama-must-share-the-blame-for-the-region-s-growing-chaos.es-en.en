The Middle East and the Return of History 
BERLIN - Ever since Francis Fukuyama argued , more than two decades ago , that the world had reached the end of history , history has made the world hold its breath . 
China &apos;s rise , the Balkan wars , the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the global financial crisis of 2008 , the &quot; Arab Spring , &quot; and the Syrian civil war all belie Fukuyama &apos;s vision of the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy . 
In fact , history could be said to have come full circle in the space of a quarter-century , from the fall of communism in Europe in 1989 to renewed confrontation between Russia and the West . 
But it is in the Middle East that history is at work on a daily basis and with the most dramatic consequences . 
The old Middle East , formed out of the remains of the Ottoman Empire after World War I , is clearly falling apart , owing , in no small part , to America &apos;s actions in this conflict-prone region . 
The United States &quot; original sin was its military invasion of Iraq in 2003 under President George W. Bush . 
The &quot; neoconservatives &quot; in power at the time were oblivious to the need to fill the power vacuum both in Iraq and the region following the removal of Saddam Hussein . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s hasty , premature military withdrawal constituted a second US failure . 
America &apos;s withdrawal , nearly coinciding with the outbreak of the Arab Spring and the eruption of the Syrian civil war , and its persistent passivity as the regional force for order , now threatens to lead to the disintegration of Iraq , owing to the rapid advance of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , including its capture of the country &apos;s second-largest city , Mosul . 
Indeed , with ISIS in control of most of the area northwest of Baghdad , the border between Iraq and Syria has essentially ceased to exist . 
Many of their neighbors &quot; borders may also be redrawn by force . 
An already massive humanitarian disaster seems certain to become worse . 
Should ISIS succeed in establishing a permanent state-like entity in parts of Iraq and Syria , the disintegration of the region would accelerate , the US would lose its &quot; global war on terror , &quot; and world peace would be seriously threatened . 
In fact , &quot; civil war &quot; is a misnomer , because events there have long entailed a struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran for regional predominance , powered by the age-old conflict between Islam &apos;s Sunni majority and Shia minority . 
The Kurds form another unstable component of the Ottoman legacy . 
Divided among several Middle Eastern countries - Iran , Iraq , Syria , and Turkey - the Kurds have been fighting for their own state for decades . 
Nonetheless , they have shown great restraint in northern Iraq since Saddam &apos;s fall , contenting themselves with building up their autonomous province both economically and politically - to the point that it is independent in all but name , with a strong and experienced army in the Peshmerga militia . 
The advance of ISIS and its capture of Mosul have now resolved , in one fell swoop , all territorial disputes between the central government and the Kurdish regional government in favor of the latter , particularly regarding the city of Kirkuk . 
Following the Iraqi army &apos;s retreat , the Peshmerga promptly took over the city , giving the Kurdish north ample oil and gas reserves . 
Moreover , neighboring Iran and Turkey , as well as the US , will urgently need the Peshmerga &apos;s support against ISIS . 
Thus , an unexpected window of opportunity has opened for the Kurds to achieve full independence , though their dependence on good relations with both Turkey and Iran for access to global markets will moderate their political ambitions . 
Moreover , with its invasion of Iraq , the US opened the door to regional hegemony for Iran and initiated a dramatic shift in its own regional alliances , the long-term effects of which - including the current nuclear negotiations with the Iranian government - are now becoming apparent . 
Both sides are fighting the same jihadists , who are supported by America &apos;s supposed allies , the Sunni-ruled Gulf states . 
Though the US and Iran remain opposed to official cooperation , the wheels have been set in motion , with direct bilateral talks becoming routine . 
One key question for the future is whether Jordan , which plays a key function in the region &apos;s equilibrium , will survive the geopolitical shifts unscathed . 
If it does not , the entire balance of power in the traditional Middle East conflict between Israel and the Palestinians could collapse . 
The consequences would most likely be far-reaching , if difficult to assess in advance . 
For Europe , developments in the Middle East pose two major risks : returning jihadi fighters who threaten to bring the terror with them , and a spillover of their extremist ideas to parts of the Balkans . 
In the interest of their own security , the European Union and its member states will be compelled to pay much closer attention to southeastern Europe than they have until now .
