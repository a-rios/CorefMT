Aid Works 
NEW YORK - The critics of foreign aid are wrong . 
A growing flood of data shows that death rates in many poor countries are falling sharply , and that aid-supported programs for health-care delivery have played a key role . 
Aid works ; it saves lives . 
One of the newest studies , by Gabriel Demombynes and Sofia Trommlerova , shows that Kenya &apos;s infant mortality ( deaths under the age of one year ) has plummeted in recent years , and attributes a significant part of the gain to the massive uptake of anti-malaria bed nets . 
These findings are consistent with an important study of malaria death rates by Chris Murray and others , which similarly found a significant and rapid decline in malaria-caused deaths after 2004 in sub-Saharan Africa resulting from aid-supported malaria-control measures . 
Let &apos;s turn back the clock a dozen years . 
In 2000 , Africa was struggling with three major epidemics . 
AIDS was killing more than two million people each year , and spreading rapidly . 
Malaria was surging , owing to the parasite &apos;s growing resistance to the standard medicine at the time . 
Tuberculosis was also soaring , partly as a result of the AIDS epidemic and partly because of the emergence of drug-resistant TB . 
In addition , hundreds of thousands of women were dying in childbirth each year , because they had no access to safe deliveries in a clinic or hospital , or to emergency help when needed . 
These interconnected crises prompted action . 
The United Nations &quot; member states adopted the Millennium Development Goals in September 2000 . 
Three of the eight MDGs - reductions in children &apos;s deaths , maternal deaths , and epidemic diseases - focus directly on health . 
Likewise , the World Health Organization issued a major call to scale up development assistance for health . 
And African leaders , led by Nigeria &apos;s president at the time , Olusegun Obasanjo , took on the challenge of battling the continent &apos;s epidemics . 
Nigeria hosted two landmark summits , on malaria in 2000 and on AIDS in 2001 , which were a crucial spur to action . 
At the second of these summits , then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria . 
The Global Fund began operations in 2002 , financing prevention , treatment , and care programs for the three diseases . 
High-income countries also finally agreed to reduce the debt owed by heavily indebted poor countries , allowing them to spend more on health care and less on crippling payments to creditors . 
The United States also took action , adopting two major programs , one to fight AIDS and the other to fight malaria . 
In 2005 , the UN Millennium Project recommended specific ways to scale up primary health care in the poorest countries , with the high-income countries helping to cover the costs that the poorest could not pay by themselves . 
The UN General Assembly backed many of the project &apos;s recommendations , which were then implemented in numerous low-income countries . 
Donor aid did start to rise sharply as a result of all of these efforts . 
In 1995 , total aid for health care was around $ 7.9 billion . 
This inadequate level then crept up slowly , to $ 10.5 billion by 2000 . 
By 2005 , however , annual aid for health had jumped another $ 5.9 billion , and by 2010 , the total had grown by another $ 10.5 billion , to reach $ 26.9 billion for the year . 
The expanded funding allowed major campaigns against AIDS , TB , and malaria ; a major scaling up of safe childbirth ; and increased vaccine coverage , including the near-eradication of polio . 
Many innovative public-health techniques were developed and adopted . 
With one billion people living in high-income countries , total aid in 2010 amounted to around $ 27 per person in the donor countries - a modest sum for them , but a life-saving one for the world &apos;s poorest people . 
The public-health successes can now be seen on many fronts . 
Around 12 million children under five years old died in 1990 . 
By 2010 , this number had declined to around 7.6 million - still far too high , but definitely an historic improvement . 
Malaria deaths in children in Africa were cut from a peak of around one million in 2004 to around 700,000 by 2010 , and , worldwide , deaths of pregnant women declined by almost half between 1990 and 2010 , from an estimated 543,000 to 287,000 . 
Another $ 10-15 billion in annual aid ( that is , roughly $ 10-15 more per person in the high-income world ) , bringing total aid to around $ 40 billion per year , would enable still greater progress to be made in the coming years . 
The MDGs for health could be achieved even in many of the world &apos;s poorest countries . 
Unfortunately , at every step during the past decade - and still today - a chorus of aid skeptics has argued against the needed help . 
They have repeatedly claimed that aid does not work ; that the funds will simply be wasted ; that anti-malaria bed nets cannot be given to the poor , since the poor won &apos;t use them ; that the poor will not take anti-AIDS medicines properly ; and so on and so forth . 
Their attacks have been relentless ( I &apos;ve faced my share ) . 
The opponents of aid are not merely wrong . 
Their vocal antagonism still threatens the funding that is needed to get the job done , to cut child and maternal deaths by enough to meet the MDGs by 2015 in the poorest countries , and to continue after that to ensure that all people everywhere finally have access to basic health services . 
A decade of significant progress in health outcomes has proved the skeptics wrong . 
Aid for health care works - and works magnificently - to save and improve lives . 
Let us continue to support these life-saving programs , which uphold the dignity and well-being of all people on the planet .
