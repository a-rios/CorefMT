Berlin , Birthplace of Modern Asia 
NEW DELHI - By marking the Cold War &apos;s end and the looming collapse of the Soviet Union , the fall of the Berlin Wall 20 years ago transformed global geopolitics . 
But no continent benefited more than Asia , whose dramatic economic rise since 1989 has occurred at a speed and scale without parallel in world history . 
For Asia , the most important consequence of the fall of the Berlin Wall was that the collapse of communism produced a shift from the primacy of military power to economic power in shaping the international order . 
To be sure , rapid economic growth also occurred during the Industrial Revolution and in the post-WWII period . 
But in the post-Cold War period , economic growth by itself has contributed to altering global power relations . 
Another defining event in 1989 was the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy protestors in Beijing . 
If not for the Cold War &apos;s end , the West would not have let China off the hook over those killings . 
Instead , the West adopted a pragmatic approach , shunning trade sanctions and helping to integrate China into the global economy and international institutions through the liberalizing influence of foreign investment and trade . 
Had the United States and its allies pursued an approach centered on punitive sanctions , as with Cuba and Burma , the result would have been a less prosperous , less open , and potentially destabilizing China . 
Indeed , China &apos;s phenomenal economic success - illustrated by its world-beating trade surplus , world &apos;s largest foreign-currency reserves , and highest steel production - owes a lot to the West &apos;s decision not to sustain trade sanctions after the Tiananmen Square massacre . 
Having vaulted past Germany to become the world &apos;s biggest exporter , China now is set to displace Japan as the world &apos;s second largest economy . 
India &apos;s rise as an economic giant is also linked to the post-1989 events . 
India was heavily involved in barter trade with the Soviet Union and its communist allies in Eastern Europe . 
When the East Bloc unraveled , India had to start paying for imports in hard cash . 
That rapidly depleted its modest foreign-exchange reserves , triggering a severe financial crisis in 1991 , which in turn compelled India to embark on radical economic reforms that laid the foundations for its economic rise . 
More broadly , the emblematic defeat of Marxism in 1989 allowed Asian countries , including China and India , to pursue capitalist policies overtly . 
Although China &apos;s economic renaissance had already begun under Deng Xiaoping , the Chinese Communist Party , after 1989 , was able publicly to subordinate ideology to wealth creation . 
That example , in turn , had a constructive influence on surviving communist parties in Asia and beyond . 
Geopolitically , the post-1989 gains extended far beyond the West . 
The Soviet Union &apos;s sudden collapse was a strategic boon to Asia , eliminating a menacing empire and opening the way for China rapidly to pursue its interests globally . 
Russia &apos;s decline in the 1990 &quot; s became China &apos;s gain . 
For India , the end of the Cold War triggered a foreign-policy crisis by eliminating the country &apos;s most reliable partner , the Soviet Union . 
But , as with its 1991 financial crisis , India was able to emerge with a revamped foreign policy - one that abandoned the country &apos;s quixotic traditions and embraced greater realism and pragmatism . 
Post-Cold War India began pursuing mutually beneficial strategic partnerships with other key players in Asia and the wider world . 
The new &quot; global strategic partnership &quot; with the United States - a defining feature of this decade - was made possible by the post-1989 shifts in Indian policy thinking . 
Of course , not all post-1989 developments were positive . 
For example , the phenomenon of failing states , which has affected Asian security the most , is a direct consequence of the Cold War &apos;s end . 
When the Cold War raged , one bloc or the other propped up weak states . 
But , with the Soviet Union &apos;s disappearance , the US abandoned that game . 
As a result , dysfunctional or failing states suddenly emerged in the 1990 &quot; s , constituting a threat to regional and international security by becoming home to transnational pirates ( Somalia ) or transnational terrorists ( Pakistan and Afghanistan ) , or by their defiance of global norms ( North Korea and Iran ) . 
Asia has suffered more casualties from the rise of international terrorism than any other region . 
Moreover , two decades after the Berlin Wall fell , the spread of democracy has stalled . 
Between 1988 and 1990 , as the Cold War was winding down , pro-democracy protests erupted far from Eastern Europe , overturning dictatorships in countries as different as Indonesia , South Korea , Taiwan , and Chile . 
After the Soviet disintegration , even Russia emerged as a credible candidate for democratic reform . 
But , while the overthrow of totalitarian or autocratic regimes shifted the global balance of power in favor of the forces of democracy , not all the pro-democracy movements succeeded . 
And the subsequent &quot; color revolutions &quot; in places like Ukraine only instilled greater caution among the surviving authoritarian regimes , prompting them to implement measures to counter foreign-inspired democratization initiatives . 
Aside from the retreat of democracy in Russia , China - now the world &apos;s oldest autocracy - is demonstrating that when authoritarianism is entrenched , a marketplace of goods and services can stymie the marketplace of political ideas .
