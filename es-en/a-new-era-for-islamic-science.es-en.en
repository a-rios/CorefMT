A New Era for Islamic Science ? 
For a few hundred years , when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention , one region of the world stood out . 
Masters of these disciplines were revered there , medicine advanced quickly , and the average person was curious about how nature worked . 
Not surprisingly , this region was globally respected . 
In the other half of the known planet , scientists were punished , even killed . 
Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien , and was later made subservient to religion . 
The standard of living was low . 
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East , while an ignorant Europe remained poor . 
Both regions were religiously governed ( historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context ) , but science flourished only in one of them . 
Now , of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed . 
Since World War II , the United States has been the world &apos;s undisputed leader in science . 
Throughout this period , the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands , attracted by superior research universities and opportunities . 
Until recently , more than half of all mathematics , science , and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born . 
Many of these talents stayed after graduation , and both industry and government took advantage of this . 
Meanwhile , Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed . 
Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research , Arab rulers did not encourage such investment , with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have . 
Recently , a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology , which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions . 
But while such weapons carry political weight , the science behind them is mundane and old . 
More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights , rather than the products of past discoveries . 
Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research . 
Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS ? 
This is one unclaimed opportunity . 
But another exists , and not just for Islamic societies . 
The US has made profound missteps recently . 
&quot; Matters of faith &quot; have been substituted for science across government , from the president down . 
Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief . 
Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration , school systems are shifting their focus from science to &quot; values . &quot; 
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 , entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain , stanching the flow of young talent into US universities . 
Major scientific organizations have protested , without result . 
At the same time , tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term , discouraging long-term investment in research . 
Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq , an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years . 
Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age , it clearly risks losing its global research dominance . 
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Japan &apos;s chief industrialist , Akio Morita , the chairman of Sony , and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book called 
Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible . 
For example , Texas , like most southern US states , was once economically poor and declining . 
Although it had oil revenue , the flow of dollars into an economy , by itself , does not boost prosperity as much as one might think . 
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment . 
Today , that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities . 
The effect has been staggering : aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California , but is booming in Texas . 
Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas , even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel . 
Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis , Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world . 
There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East . 
First , however , the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage .
