Libya &apos;s Anti-Military Militias 
NEW YORK - As the United States struggles to understand last September &apos;s attack on its diplomatic mission in Benghazi , which took the lives of four Americans , including US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens , a formal investigation has not even been opened in Libya - and likely never will be . 
The country &apos;s leaders face myriad challenges - from a vocal federalist movement in the East , aimed at usurping the central government &apos;s prerogatives , to a wave of assassinations targeting security officials - which leaves them few resources to allocate to a case that poses no immediate threat to their domestic standing . 
Instead , they are focusing on rebuilding the state that former leader Muammar el-Qaddafi destroyed . 
They have been grappling with the need to create effective administrative institutions and foster an independent judiciary . 
While the National Transitional Council ( NTC ) , the interim governing body that replaced Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s regime , failed to lay the groundwork for a modern state , it is too soon to pass judgment on the elected leadership that took power in November 2012 . 
The litmus test will be progress on security . 
The Benghazi attack , and the lack of a credible Libyan response , demonstrated that the country is neither governed by the rule of law nor in a position to impose it . 
The new government must change this situation by disbanding militias and integrating their members into official Libyan security forces . 
For starters , the government must stop coddling the militias , and focus on building the national army - something that the NTC neglected . 
To be sure , persuading the militias to transfer their loyalties to the state will not be easy , especially given the fighters &quot; strong , often ideological connections to their individual units . 
But it is a crucial step toward establishing order and enhancing the newly elected government &apos;s legitimacy . 
Brigades in eastern Libya , or Cyrenaica , for example , are strongly rooted in traditional Islamist ideology . 
Fighters in the region have been organized into powerful units , such as the February 17 Martyrs Brigade , the large government-allied force that was hired to protect the US mission in Benghazi , and the Libya Shield Force , the widely deployed coalition of militias that assisted the US mission on the night of the attack . 
By contrast , militias in western Libya , or Tripolitania , tend to emerge in individual cities , with the most powerful brigades based in Misrata and Zintan . 
These groups want to join the security services as units , rather than as individual fighters , in order to retain their communal bonds and , in turn , to prevent their full integration into a national army . 
For its part , the government has treated the creation of national armed forces as an afterthought . 
During the revolution , NTC leaders funneled resources and funding to the Islamist brigades with which they shared a common ideology , rather than to the fledgling Libyan National Army ( LNA ) . 
After Islamist fighters killed the commander-in-chief of the rebel forces , Abdul Fattah Younes , in July 2011 , the military was sidelined . 
Indeed , the NTC willingly facilitated the military &apos;s demise . 
When tribal clashes erupted in the remote desert town of Kufra early last year , the council dispatched the Libya Shield Force , not LNA units , to quell the unrest . 
Moreover , the military receives inadequate financing , with officers forced to use their personal funds to purchase gas for military vehicles . 
Meanwhile , the governments of the wealthy Gulf States provide funding directly to militias , allowing them to purchase new vehicles and cutting-edge communications equipment . 
Libyans complain that the new government has continued the NTC &apos;s policy of favoring revolutionary brigades over institutionalized security services . 
After the September 11 attack in Benghazi , frustrated Libyans poured into the streets shouting anti-militia slogans . 
Ten days later , protesters overran the base of Ansar al-Sharia , the Islamist militia suspected of masterminding the attack , as part of a sweep of raids on militia compounds throughout the city . 
Only a few hours after the demonstrations began , government authorities sent a mass text message that urged the protesters to return to their homes , adding that &quot; the Rafallah al-Sahati Brigade , the February 17 Brigade , and the Libya Shield Force are legal , and are subject to the authority of the &#91; military &#93; general staff . &quot; 
President Mohamed Magariaf later confirmed this view . 
In response , a former NTC member lamented that the government had &quot; lost a chance to finish off all of the militias , &quot; stating that the groups responsible are backed by Qatar , and that the government did not want to interfere with their agenda . 
Such patronage extends to the military establishment itself . 
Chief of Staff Yousef al-Manqous is said to favor Cyrenaican militias over the military units under his command , while government officials complain about the lack of an effective chain of command . 
For example , in June , Defense Minister Osama al-Juwali attacked the NTC for failing to consult with the appropriate officials on its decisions , stating that his role had been reduced to &quot; signing the plans of the chief of staff . &quot; 
With ample foreign funding and preferential treatment from the government , the militias have no incentive to disband . 
Furthermore , they are wary of turning over control of their brigades to military commanders whom they claim supported Qaddafi or , at least , failed to oppose him . 
While there is no shortage of challenges facing Libya &apos;s new government , disbanding the militias must be at the top of its agenda .
