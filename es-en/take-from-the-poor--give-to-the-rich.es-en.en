Take From the Poor , Give to the Rich 
President Bush seems poised to wreck America &apos;s budget for years to come . 
When Bush came into office , the outlook was for budget surpluses as far as the eye could see . 
Today , through a combination of irresponsible Republican-led tax cuts , a slowing economy , the bursting of the stock market bubble , and a massive increase in defense spending , huge deficits dominate the fiscal horizon . 
Worse is coming , because the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress are preparing to deepen the fiscal mess . 
The damage they will do will likely weaken the US and add instability to the world economy . 
Traditionally , America &apos;s Republican Party stood for balanced budgets . 
This changed with the Reagan Administration , when conservative Republicans favored tax cuts even at the cost of large budget deficits . 
President Reagan told the American people that they could enjoy tax cuts , a military build-up , and continuation of their favorite spending programs all at the same time . 
The result - no surprise - was a series of vast budget deficits that took years to clean up . 
Both President George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to clean up the Reagan-era mess . 
Those tax increases probably contributed to President Bush Sr &apos;s defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992 . 
Yet Clinton bravely decided to complete the process of restoring fiscal balance , in part to protect the long-term financing of the Social Security retirement program . 
When Clinton left office in 2000 , the budget situation was the best in decades . 
Then along came President George Bush Jr. to replay Reagan : large tax cuts , a big increase in military spending , and continuation or even expansion of popular spending programs . 
The result was predictable . 
In January 2001 , the cumulative budget outcome for the years 2002-2011 was projected to be $ 5.6 trillion dollars in surplus . 
By mid-2002 , those projected surpluses had vanished . 
In view of these changed economic conditions , and the shadow of war in Iraq , you might expect the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress to be cautious in advocating new tax cuts . 
But no , their highest priority is to enact more tax cuts that will mainly benefit the rich . 
At the same time , the Administration is calling for big increases in military spending . 
With the November 2004 presidential election now coming into view , you can be certain that no meaningful cuts in non-military spending programs will be made . 
So massive budget deficits seem here to stay . 
If domestic spending simply stays constant as a fraction of national income , the cumulative budget outcome for the next ten years will be a combined deficit of $ 1.5 trillion . 
But this figure may be optimistic , because it probably doesn &apos;t adequately factor in the costs of a possible war in Iraq , nor another round of tax cuts , nor the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead . 
Why are Republicans so unconcerned about this mess ? 
Some Republican care more about tax cuts for the rich than they do about almost anything else . 
Others believe that deficits will force major cuts in domestic government spending , thus shrinking the state , which is their heart &apos;s desire . 
The problem with this latter view is that most taxpayers like domestic programs , and will not readily support major spending cuts . 
A more intriguing question is why do Americans vote for such policies , when they should know that trouble will probably result . 
One answer is that many voters do not see the looming budget troubles . 
A better answer is that most Americans did not actually vote for these policies . 
Voter turnout in the 2002 election was only around 40 % , of which around half went to the Republicans , or around 20 % of eligible voters . 
Of course , the outlook need not be so bleak . 
War in Iraq may be avoided . 
Proposed tax cuts may be watered down or abandoned . 
But I predict large budget deficits for years to come , and a growing sense of unease within the US and abroad about America &apos;s macroeconomic situation . 
Foreign investors may decide to cut back financing America &apos;s budget and current account deficits on favorable terms . 
The dollar may weaken , and fears of inflation may become more pronounced . 
All of this will make US policymakers less confident and less flexible in their responses to economic shocks . 
The poor , both inside the US and abroad , could suffer the most , as President Bush and the Congress tell the American people and the world that , due to the large budget deficits , there is no money available to address problems of poverty , disease , and education . 
Unless ordinary Americans wake up to these fiscal risks , the rich may walk away with another multi-billion-dollar gift as the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for years to come .
