Egypt &apos;s Broken Economy 
WASHINGTON , DC - Egyptians &quot; political aspirations have dominated the country &apos;s public life since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak last year . 
Unfortunately , as those aspirations are addressed , the economy has entered a steep decline , jeopardizing one of the revolution &apos;s main goals , namely improvement in Egyptians &quot; living standards and welfare . 
Indeed , the populist rhetoric of Egyptian politicians threatens to undo the economic reforms undertaken by the Mubarak regime . 
In 2004 , a major reform program was launched under former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif . 
It was aimed at removing bureaucratic constraints to growth by restructuring the financial sector , streamlining business regulations , liberalizing foreign trade , and reducing the government &apos;s role in the economy . 
The 2004 reforms , with their elimination of restrictions on access to foreign exchange and reduction of import tariffs , gradually improved the business and investment climate . 
Coupled with favorable international conditions , Egypt &apos;s annual GDP growth rate rose to 7.2 % in 2008 , from 4.1 % in 2004 , and remained at 5 % in 2009-2010 , despite the global recession . 
The new measures also helped to attract large capital inflows and foreign direct investment , underpinning a dramatic rise in foreign-currency reserves , from $ 14.8 billion in 2004 to more than $ 36 billion by the end of 2010 . 
In 2011 , the situation worsened on virtually all fronts . 
Annual growth fell to about 0.5 % , and inflation remained in double digits . 
The unemployment rate reached 12.4 % in the fourth quarter , up from 8.9 % in the same period of 2010 . 
The current-account balance deteriorated rapidly , owing to the loss of more than $ 4 billion in tourism revenues and a sharp fall in remittances by Egyptian workers abroad . 
The fiscal deficit widened to 10 % of GDP , causing government debt ( including external debt ) , which had been falling steadily , to rise to 76 % of GDP . 
The most striking development , however , was the loss of international reserves in the year following the Tahrir Square revolution . 
The International Monetary Fund estimates that foreign-currency reserves fell by half , to $ 18 billion , by December 2011 , owing partly to the worsening current-account balance , but , more importantly , to withdrawal from Egypt by foreign and domestic investors alike . 
In the face of large and growing external imbalances , the Central Bank of Egypt ( CBE ) chose to defend the Egyptian pound during last year &apos;s political and economic turmoil . 
The CBE allowed the exchange rate , which is formally defined as a &quot; managed float , &quot; to depreciate by only 3 % . 
Keeping the currency relatively stable was considered a higher priority than preventing the loss of foreign reserves . 
Today , Egypt not only remains vulnerable to unstable domestic politics ; owing to the depletion of its international reserves - at a rate of roughly $ 2 billion a month since last October - the country now also faces the threat of a currency crisis . 
Moreover , this almost certainly underestimates the extent of the losses , because it does not exclude inflows of $ 3.5 billion since November of last year from auctions of US-dollar-denominated treasury bills . 
In addition , the Egyptian military gave a $ 1 billion loan to the government , and another $ 1 billion was received through grants from Saudi Arabia and Qatar , bringing the loss of reserves since December 2010 closer to $ 22 billion . 
The other source of international reserves , tourism , brought in only $ 8 billion , down sharply from $ 12 billion in 2010 . 
Egypt continues to import almost double what it exports , resulting in a trade deficit of over $ 10 billion by the end of 2011 . 
As a result , Egypt &apos;s financing must continue to grow : the country now needs to borrow about $ 14-15 billion to plug its estimated financing gap of $ 24 billion . 
Much depends on when , or whether , external aid materializes , which is contingent on approval of Egypt &apos;s renegotiated $ 3.2 billion IMF loan . 
If finalized , the IMF program could trigger further aid packages by the World Bank and other international donors . 
If the aid arrives , Egypt could begin to address some of its financing problems , but it is still in need of a long-term strategy to spur sustainable growth . 
Egypt &apos;s economy is facing continued risks , owing to capital flight , rising inflation , unemployment , and populist policies . 
Even with the availability of external finance , Egyptian leaders must look for ways to engage the private sector in reviving the country &apos;s economy . 
Unfortunately , the latest political incident involving the democracy-promoting activities of American NGOs has cooled bilateral relations and threatens the $ 1.3 billion in military assistance that Egypt receives annually from the United States . 
This may have an impact on other donors , as well as the international financial institutions , particularly the IMF and the World Bank . 
Egypt &apos;s transition from populist economic policies to anti-American populism exemplifies the impact that political uncertainty can have on economic developments . 
The upcoming presidential election in May and the formation of a democratically elected government , one hopes , will calm the political turmoil and lead to economic stabilization and revival . 
Otherwise , Egyptians &quot; hard-won political gains may well be lost .
