Battleground Budget 
MILAN - The world &apos;s developed economies , of which the United States is by far the largest and systemically most important , face a range of difficult political and social choices . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s proposed US budget acknowledges and addresses those choices and tradeoffs directly and fully for the first time in the post-crisis period . 
Obama &apos;s proposal is an important , honest , and politically courageous document . 
The debate that follows will largely determine whether the US shifts toward a strong , inclusive , and sustainable pattern of growth and employment , and how the burden of moving to such a path will be shared by Americans of various ages , educational levels , incomes , and wealth . 
We know that powerful technological and global market forces have reduced dramatically the number of routine professional and blue-collar jobs , shifted employment options for the middle class toward the non-tradable side of the economy , and channeled growth in national income toward capital and high-end employment , with stagnating income elsewhere . 
Job creation remains weak , and employment continues to diverge from growth . 
These trends cannot be blamed entirely on poor policy choices or shortsighted government . 
They arise mainly from an increasingly integrated global economy &apos;s shifting technological landscape ; but they have been exacerbated by a systematic pattern of public-sector underinvestment . 
The lesson from many developed and developing countries is that underinvestment in infrastructure , human capital , institutions , and the economy &apos;s knowledge and technology base reduces long-term growth . 
Short- and medium-term growth can be sustained for a while by substituting public and private debt for investment - that is , borrowing against future income and consumption . 
This brings us to the choices that Obama &apos;s budget embodies . 
First there is the issue of how fast to reduce government deficits and the accumulation of public debt . 
Sudden fiscal contraction would reduce domestic aggregate demand faster than the economy &apos;s deleveraging and structural shifts could replace it , thereby killing off growth and hiring , with adverse feedback effects on budget deficits . 
Deficits have to fall within a time horizon of 5-10 years . 
The alternative is either a sovereign-debt crisis , followed by a destructive spike in borrowing costs , or a growing burden for subsequent generations of taxpayers . 
In an ideal world , where compromise is unnecessary , US fiscal policy would maintain the commitments embedded in the social-welfare system , even as demographic and other forces drive up costs ( especially for health care ) . 
It would also maintain current consumptions levels and avoid tax increases , while redressing public-investment shortfalls in order to boost growth and expand employment options for today &apos;s middle class and future generations . 
Finally , future generations would not be asked to bear the entire burden of rebalancing . 
Obviously , it is impossible to reconcile all of these objectives . 
To be fair , some reforms - including tax , regulatory , and health-care measures - will help to restore balance without imposing large additional costs on the public sector . 
Simply put , one cannot sustain current levels of consumption and entitlements without crowding out public-sector investment , unless one believes that the state &apos;s borrowing power is unlimited , and that the intergenerational burden shift is unimportant . 
So choices have to be made . 
Gridlock , too , implies a choice - one that ensures that some version of the status quo will be the outcome . 
What would that look like ? 
Here some guess work is required . 
Entitlement programs would likely be reduced , but not enough to offset a substantial intergenerational burden transfer . 
Taxes might rise somewhat in the high-income ranges , with the proceeds going to fund entitlements and redistribution . 
The desire to avoid substantial tax increases ( and to sustain consumption levels ) will almost surely be reflected in a continuing shortfall of public-sector investment , in turn undermining long-term growth . 
Obama &apos;s proposed budget recognizes that all objectives and expectations cannot be met , and that growth is partly a distributional issue now and an intergenerational issue ( and potentially one of inclusiveness and social stability ) in the longer term . 
It is an invitation to the US Congress and the American public to acknowledge and address the choices and tradeoffs that are needed to establish a sustainable pattern of economic growth - and to ensure a fair distribution of the burden of getting there . The choices are more extreme in countries where the imbalances are more severe and markets suffer more policy-induced impediments to the private-sector flexibility , mobility , and dynamism that continue to benefit the US . 
In Italy and Spain , growth is negative , and youth unemployment is 35 % and 55 % , respectively . 
To be sure , this is a moral issue , but it is also an issue of political and social stability . 
Every country has its own version of a social contract that defines the rights and responsibilities of citizens , the role of the state , and the idea of inclusiveness . 
The most successful public policies and fiscal choices are those that are not only guided by the enduring values embedded in the social contract , but that are also adapted to changing demographic , technological , and global circumstances . 
That sometime means making hard choices of the type that the US and many other developed countries are facing now . 
If we make these choices poorly , growth will suffer and future distributional choices will be far more painful .
