The Specter of Global Stagflation 
New York - Will rising global inflation lead to a sharp global economic slowdown ? 
Even worse , will it revive stagflation , that deadly combination of rising inflation and negative growth ? 
Inflation is already rising in many advanced economies and emerging markets , and there are signs of likely economic contraction in many advanced economies ( the United States , the United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Japan ) . 
In emerging markets , inflation has - so far - been associated with growth , even economic overheating . 
But economic contraction in the US and other advanced economies may lead to a growth recoupling - rather than decoupling - in emerging markets , as the US contraction slows growth and rising inflation forces monetary authorities to tighten monetary and credit policies . 
They may then face &quot; stagflation lite &quot; - rising inflation tied to sharply slowing growth . 
Stagflation requires a negative supply-side shock that increases prices while simultaneously reducing output . 
Stagflationary shocks led to global recession three times in the last 35 years : in 1973-1975 , when oil prices spiked following the Yom Kippur War and OPEC embargo ; in 1979-1980 , following the Iranian Revolution ; and in 1990-91 , following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait . 
Even the 2001 recession - mostly triggered by the bursting high-tech bubble - was accompanied by a doubling of oil prices , following the start of the second Palestinian intifada against Israel . 
Today , a stagflationary shock may result from an Israeli attack against Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities . This geopolitical risk mounted in recent weeks as Israel has grown alarmed about Iran &apos;s intentions . 
Such an attack would trigger sharp increases in oil prices - to well above $ 200 a barrel . 
The consequences of such a spike would be a major global recession , such as those of 1973 , 1979 , and 1990 . 
Indeed , the most recent rise in oil prices is partly due to the increase in this fear premium . 
But short of such a negative supply-side shock , is global stagflation possible ? 
Between 2004-2006 global growth was robust while inflation was low , owing to a positive global supply shock - the increase in productivity and productive capacity of China , India and emerging markets . 
This positive supply-side shock was followed - starting in 2006 - by a positive global demand shock : fast growth in &quot; Chindia &quot; and other emerging markets started to put pressure on the prices of a variety of commodities . 
Strong global growth in 2007 marked the beginning of a rise in global inflation , a phenomenon that , with some caveats ( the sharp slowdown in the US and some advanced economies ) , continued into 2008 . 
Barring a true negative supply-side shock , global stagflation is thus unlikely . 
Recent rises in oil , energy and other commodity prices reflect a variety of factors : 
High growth in demand for oil and other commodities among fast-growing and urbanizing emerging-market economies is occurring at a time when capacity constraints and political instability in some producing countries is limiting their supply . 
The weakening US dollar is pushing the dollar price of oil higher as oil exporters &quot; purchasing power in non-dollar regions declines . 
Investors &quot; discovery of commodities as an asset class is fueling both speculative and long-term demand . The diversion of land to bio-fuels production has reduced the land available to produce agricultural commodities . 
Easy US monetary policy , followed by monetary easing in countries that formally pegged their exchange rates to the US dollar ( as in the Gulf ) or that maintain undervalued currencies to achieve export-led growth ( China and other informal members of the so-called Bretton Woods 2 dollar zone ) has fueled a new asset bubble in commodities and overheating of their economies . 
Most of these factors are akin to positive global aggregate demand shocks , which should lead to economic overheating and a rise in global inflation . 
Exchange rate policies are key . 
Large current-account surpluses and / or rising terms of trade imply that the equilibrium real exchange rate ( the relative price of foreign to domestic goods ) has appreciated in countries like China and Russia . 
Thus , over time the actual real exchange rate needs to converge - via real appreciation - with the stronger equilibrium rate . 
If the nominal exchange rate is not permitted to appreciate , real appreciation can occur only through an increase in domestic inflation . 
So the most important way to control inflation - while regaining the monetary and credit policy autonomy needed to control inflation - is to allow currencies in these economies to appreciate significantly . 
Unfortunately , the need for currency appreciation and monetary tightening in overheated emerging markets comes at a time when the housing bust , credit crunch , and high oil prices are leading to a sharp slowdown in advanced economies - and outright recession in some of them . 
The world has come full circle . 
Following a benign period of a positive global supply shock , a positive global demand shock has led to global overheating and rising inflationary pressures . 
Now the worries are about a stagflationary supply shock - say , a war with Iran - coupled with a deflationary demand shock as housing bubbles go bust . 
Deflationary pressure could take hold in economies that are contracting , while inflationary pressures increase in economies that are still growing fast . 
Thus , central banks in many advanced and emerging economies are facing a nightmare scenario , in which they simultaneously must tighten monetary policy ( to fight inflation ) and ease it ( to reduce the downside risks to growth ) . 
As inflation and growth risks combine in varied and complex ways in different economies , it will be very difficult for central bankers to juggle these contradictory imperatives .
