The Secret Language of Central Bankers 
&quot; If I seem unduly clear to you , &quot; Alan Greenspan said to his political masters in the United States Congress , &quot; you must have misunderstood what I said . &quot; 
It was 1987 , and the newly-confirmed chair of the Federal Reserve was elaborating on how he had &quot; learned to mumble with great incoherence &quot; in the short months since he had &quot; become a central banker . &quot; 
Mr. Greenspan was a strong believer , in practice if not in theory - for who could understand his theory ? - that central bankers should speak in an opaque and convoluted dialect . 
In comparison , the Oracle at Delphi &apos;s advice to the King of Lydia - &quot; If you attack Persia , you will destroy a great kingdom &quot; - is clarity itself . 
There was an old argument for &quot; Greenspanese &quot; : voters or politicians or both are inherently short-sighted and myopic . 
They would always see and want to grasp the benefits of lower interest rates and a little more demand pressure - more production , more employment , higher wages , and higher profits in the short run . 
But they would either not see or be cynically indifferent to the problems of stagflation that would inevitably follow . 
The job of the central bank , according to Greenspan &apos;s distant predecessor , William McChesney Martin , was to &quot; take away the punchbowl &#91; of low interest rates &#93; before the party really gets going . &quot; 
But , the argument went , the Fed could not say that this was what it was doing in clear and transparent language , for , if voters and politicians could understand central bankers , they would then force them into following destructive inflationary policies that would be worse for everyone , at least in the long run . 
By using an opaque and convoluted idiom , the only outsiders - reporters , politicians , and academics - who would be able to understand what the central bank was saying would be those who had carefully studied the issues and the language . 
This , in turn , would lead them all ( with the rare exception of a maverick critic like William Greider ) to understand and approve , and to agree that talking in &quot; Greenspanese &quot; is essential for enabling central banks to ensure price stability . 
There seems to be general agreement today that this argument no longer applies , if it was ever truly valid . 
Voters and politicians today , it seems , fear inflation and are willing to accept occasional economic recessions and unemployment above its natural rate as unfortunate but inevitable consequences of the necessary and beneficial pursuit of long-term price stability . 
The debate about monetary policy can thus be fruitful and productive even if it is no longer restricted to those who have learned &quot; Greenspanese . &quot; 
Thus , all across the North Atlantic core of the world economy , central banks have embarked on a &quot; transparency &quot; initiative to make their organization &apos;s goals , guesses , procedures , and policies more widely and clearly known . 
They are relying on economists &quot; basic predisposition to believe that more information is always better than less , that individuals are good judges of what they need to know , and that they are able to evaluate and place in perspective what they know . 
But recently - and increasingly so in recent months - central bankers &quot; doubts about the utility of the transparency initiative have increased . 
The more central banks talk , and the clearer they try to make their language , the more it seems that markets may be reacting excessively and inappropriately to statements that are not really news at all . 
More information may be leading not to better knowledge , but to more confusion . 
We economists have a hard time figuring out why there appears to be so much static on the communications line . 
Why were so many people in financial markets so sure that the Fed &apos;s late-March meeting statement heralded a likelihood of interest-rate hikes soon , rather than being simply an acknowledgement ( as the Fed explicitly stated ) that what had been very unlikely was now a possibility ? 
Why are cable TV personalities so eager to overstate how quickly central banks change their view of the likely future ? 
Why do participants in financial markets trade on the advice of cable TV personalities when a small amount of number-crunching reveals that the benefits must be lower than the transactions costs incurred by over-frequent trading ? 
We don &apos;t have answers to these questions . 
So we really don &apos;t know whether we should tell central bankers to brush up on their Greenspanese .
