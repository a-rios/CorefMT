Unlearned Lessons from the Housing Bubble 
NEW HAVEN - There is a lot of misunderstanding about home prices . 
Many people all over the world seem to have thought that since we are running out of land in a rapidly growing world economy , the prices of houses and apartments should increase at huge rates . 
That misunderstanding encouraged people to buy homes for their investment value - and thus was a major cause of the real estate bubbles around the world whose collapse fueled the current economic crisis . 
This misunderstanding may also contribute to an increase in home prices again , after the crisis ends . Indeed , some people are already starting to salivate at the speculative possibilities of buying homes in currently depressed markets . 
But we do not really have a land shortage . 
Every major country of the world has abundant land in the form of farms and forests , much of which can be converted someday into urban land . 
Less than 1 % of the earth &apos;s land area is densely urbanized , and even in the most populated major countries , the share is less than 10 % . 
There are often regulatory barriers to converting farmland into urban land , but these barriers tend to be thwarted in the long run if economic incentives to work around them become sufficiently powerful . 
It becomes increasingly difficult for governments to keep telling their citizens that they can &apos;t have an affordable home because of land restrictions . 
The price of farmland hasn &apos;t grown so fast as to make investors rich . 
In the United States , the price of agricultural land grew only 0.9 % a year in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms over the entire twentieth century . 
Most of the benefit from land for investors has to be from the profit that agribusiness can make from their operations , not just from the appreciation of the price of land . 
Despite a huge twenty-first century boom in cropland prices in the US that parallels the housing boom of the 2000 &quot; s , the average price of a hectare of cropland was still only $ 6,800 in 2008 , according to the US Department of Agriculture , and one could build 10-20 single-family houses surrounded by comfortable-sized lots on this land , or one could build an apartment building housing 300 people . 
Land costs could easily be as low as $ 20 per person , or less than $ 0.50 per year over a lifetime . 
Of course , such land may not be in desirable locations today , but desirable locations can be created by urban planning . 
Many people seem to think that the US experience is not generalizable , because the US has so much land relative to its population . 
Population per square kilometer in 2005 was 31 in the US , compared with 53 in Mexico , 138 in China , 246 in the United Kingdom , 337 in Japan , and 344 in India . 
But , to the extent that the products of land ( food , timber , ethanol ) are traded on world markets , the price of any particular kind of land should be roughly the same everywhere . 
Farmers will not be able to make a profit operating in some country where land is very expensive , and farmers would give up in those countries unless the price of land fell roughly to world levels , though corrections would have to be made for differing labor costs and other factors . 
Shortages of construction materials do not seem to be a reason to expect high home prices , either . 
For example , in the US , the Engineering News Record Building Cost Index ( which is based on prices of labor , concrete , steel , and lumber ) has actually fallen relative to consumer prices over the past 30 years . 
To the extent that there is a world market for these factors of production , the situation should not be entirely different in other countries . 
An even more troublesome fallacy is that people tend to confuse price levels with rates of price change . 
They think that arguments implying that home prices are higher in one country than another are also arguments that the rate of increase in those prices should be higher there . 
But , the truth may be just the opposite . 
Higher home prices in a given country may tend to create conditions for falling home prices there in the future . 
The kinds of expectations for real estate prices that have informed public thinking during the recent bubbles were often totally unrealistic . 
A few years ago Karl Case and I asked random home buyers in US cities undergoing bubbles how much they think the price of their home will rise each year on average over the next ten years . 
The median answer was sometimes 10 % a year . 
If one compounds that rate over ten years , they were expecting an increase of a factor of 2.5 , and , if one extrapolates , a 2000-fold increase over the course of a lifetime . 
Home prices cannot have shown such increases over long time periods , for then no one could afford a home . 
The sobering truth is that the current world economic crisis was substantially caused by the collapse of speculative bubbles in real estate ( and stock ) markets - bubbles that were made possible by widespread misunderstandings of the factors influencing prices . 
These misunderstandings have not been corrected , which means that the same kinds of speculative dislocations could recur .
