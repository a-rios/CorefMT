France and the Netherlands Strike Back 
BRUSSELS - In 2005 , France and the Netherlands both voted no to a constitutional treaty for the European Union , derailing years of integration efforts . 
They seem to be poised to disrupt Europe once again . 
On April 21 , the Dutch coalition government collapsed , after right-wing populist Geert Wilders refused to endorse the spending cuts needed to limit the budget deficit to 3 % of GDP . 
The next day , candidates who advocated backtracking on European integration captured one-third of the vote in the first round of the French presidential election . 
On May 6 , France is expected to turn left and elect Fran√ßois Hollande , who questions the EU &apos;s German-inspired fiscal compact , agreed last December , and has called for Europe to emphasize growth . 
These are the first skirmishes in a highly significant debate for Europe . 
Start with austerity . 
The question here is not whether deficits should be reduced . 
They must be , given the dire state of European public finances , and also because the countries whose competitiveness deteriorated during the first decade of monetary union must tighten fiscal policy in order to deliver the necessary adjustment of wages and prices . 
Indeed , it is revealing that , as eurozone countries with severe external imbalances at the onset of the crisis have benefited from the European Central Bank &apos;s wholesale liquidity provision , they have reduced their current-account deficits much less than non-euro countries in a similar situation . 
Germany , the arch-advocate of austerity , is right on this point . 
The problem is that austerity has perverse effects . 
Private and public deleveraging can hardly take place at the same time , unless trade partners generate demand for exports . 
Recession and price deflation reduce tax receipts and worsen the dynamics of public debt , threatening the return to sustainability . 
Moreover , deficit targets lead governments to respond to recessions by doubling down on austerity , generally without much regard for the adverse supply-side effects . 
So there is a need to approach austerity and rebalancing strategically . 
First , finance ministers tried to reassure markets last October by demonstrating toughness and endorsing headline , instead of cyclically adjusted , deficit targets . 
This may be justified for a country on the verge of losing access to capital markets , but not for a country with relatively low debt and a moderate deficit . 
Ministers should change course and revert to their original 2009 commitment , which was to plan consolidation efforts and adhere to them through fluctuations and shocks . 
Second , the eurozone still shies away from a comprehensive approach to its internal rebalancing . 
Price competitiveness is a relative concept , not an absolute value , yet the policy discussion still ignores this basic fact . 
This is paradoxical , because the ECB &apos;s policy framework provides clear guidance . 
The ECB is committed to 2 % inflation in the eurozone as a whole , which implies that lower wage and price increases in southern Europe arithmetically mean higher wage and price increases in northern Europe . 
The wider the gap between the two , the sooner the rebalancing will be achieved . 
It is time to say loud and clear that the ECB will fight hard to keep average inflation on target , and that northern Europe - especially Germany - will not attempt to counter higher domestic inflation as long as price stability is maintained in the eurozone as a whole . 
The third mistake is one of omission : as ECB President Mario Draghi recently said , Europe has a fiscal compact , but lacks a growth compact . 
To be sure , there are no quick fixes : headline-grabbing initiatives often fail to measure up to the challenge of reviving growth . 
Nevertheless , serious discussion is needed concerning how to use the EU budget to enhance economic performance , rather than for redistribution only ; how to foster pro-growth reforms at the national level ; and how to boost investment in the periphery countries &quot; tradable sectors . 
A credible growth compact would help to overcome immediate hurdles . 
After all , the post-war Marshall Plan was so successful not because of its size , but because it helped to counteract zero-sum games and self-fulfilling pessimism . 
That is a lesson to keep in mind today . 
But austerity is not the only dimension of the debate . 
Developments over the last two years have exposed the weaknesses of a bare-bones monetary union based only on a single monetary policy and fiscal discipline . 
While reforms enacted in the wake of the Greek crisis have equipped the eurozone with crisis-management capabilities , more is needed to restore confidence , ensure financial stability , and ward off financial fragmentation . 
A key characteristic of the European crisis has been the strong correlation between banking stress and sovereign distress . 
Time and again , banks &quot; woes have affected governments &quot; borrowing costs , and concerns over governments &quot; solvency have affected banks &quot; balance sheets . 
This major potential threat to financial stability has been alleviated , but not eliminated , by the ECB &apos;s large-scale provision of liquidity . 
The recent re-emergence of concerns about Spain has shown that the problem has not gone away . 
Systemic reforms to resolve the problem all involve significant further integration : joint issuance of government bonds that play the role of safe asset in banks &quot; portfolios , a &quot; banking union &quot; with a common regime for deposit insurance , supervision , and crisis resolution - or both . 
Either one involves risk-sharing among eurozone members . 
In France , the Netherlands , and elsewhere , many citizens view Europe as a threat to their way of life . 
Telling them that the euro is an unfinished construct that requires even more commitment is a hard call for politicians . 
The question for the coming months is whether European leaders will have enough political capital to embark on further reforms and make the case for them to angry publics . 
If not , it is to be feared that they will agree only on platitudes and hope for the best .
