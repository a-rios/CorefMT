Rebooting China 
MILAN - Despite China &apos;s widely discussed economic slowdown , annual GDP growth remains above 7 % , implying little cause for alarm - at least for now . 
The question is whether the government &apos;s efforts to implement structural reforms and transform the economy &apos;s growth model are working - that is , whether internal imbalances continue to threaten long-term economic performance . 
Given that China remains the global economy &apos;s most important growth engine , the answer matters to everyone . 
Assessing China &apos;s economic stability requires considering the conflicts and tensions affecting the country - none of which advances the cause of growth . 
For starters , China &apos;s territorial disputes with many of its neighbors , including Japan , Vietnam , and the Philippines , are undermining regional peace , not to mention economic integration . 
Moreover , China &apos;s relationship with the United States is deteriorating , owing to conflict over America &apos;s foreign-policy &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia and disputes over cyber security . 
China has already restricted access to its market for some US-based technology firms , and more such actions may follow . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s domestic political system is being shaken up by President Xi Jinping &apos;s anti-corruption campaign - an effort that is essential to boosting the government &apos;s accountability and legitimacy as it pursues deep systemic reforms . 
Since China launched its process of &quot; reform and opening up &quot; more than three decades ago , it has benefited from its willingness to consider - if not adapt - foreign ideas . 
In many areas - economic policy in a market economy , business management , technology , energy , the environment , and health care , to name a few - selective learning has accelerated China &apos;s development ( and benefited the countries that have learned from Chinese experience ) . 
Lumping outside influences together with a legitimate anti-corruption campaign would undermine this positive dynamic , with potentially serious consequences for China &apos;s quest to transform its growth model and achieve high-income status . 
The good news is that the data - while incomplete - show progress in China &apos;s economic transformation . 
Weak growth in China &apos;s major export markets ( particularly in Europe , North America , and Japan ) , together with rapidly rising domestic wages and incomes , is driving the tradable part of the economy toward higher-value components in global supply chains . 
Meanwhile , inflation , rising wages , and the renminbi &apos;s nominal appreciation have driven up the real effective exchange rate , though this trend has been tempered , to some extent , by the euro &apos;s persistently high value . 
How businesses handle this transition - which is already contributing to China &apos;s growth slowdown - will determine the transformation &apos;s progress . 
China has no choice but to change its growth model . 
Its share in global markets is now so large that the economy could be demand-constrained for the first time in four decades . 
The only way to avoid this outcome is by pursuing a balanced program comprising high-return investment , high-value government services , and a higher level of household consumption . 
Public and private investment - which has served as a key driver of China &apos;s growth over the last four decades - can play a central role in expanding domestic demand , but only if returns are high . 
While low-return investments generate aggregate demand , they do not increase future income or productive potential , and thus do not foster sustainable growth . 
Given this , China &apos;s leaders must use a combination of financial-sector reforms and improved public-sector incentives to increase access to capital in sectors with high potential rates of return . 
In fact , this process is underway with the licensing of new private banks and the development of China &apos;s shadow banking system . 
Given the limited capacity of investment demand to drive growth , high-value government services and increased household consumption are also needed . 
As it stands , private consumption accounts for an unusually small share of China &apos;s GDP . 
Consider the telecommunications-equipment industry , which has been growing at more than 15 % annually in the past couple of years . 
Gross merchandise volume in online retail sales is approaching CN Â¥ 2 trillion ( $ 316 billion ) , and growing at a rate of 40-60 % annually . 
Many other industry segments serving domestic demand are also growing at double-digit rates , suggesting that domestic consumption is already making a more significant contribution to China &apos;s GDP growth . 
But there remains the question of whether consumption share growth is sustainable - that is , whether it is the result of income share growth or rising leverage . 
If it is supported by excessive leverage , effectively shifting future consumption to the present , China could face a significant slowdown - or even a major crisis . 
Leverage has undoubtedly increased at unsustainable rates in recent years . 
Most important , shadow banks &quot; activities must be regulated in a way that enhances transparency and deters excessive risk-taking , while allowing the sector to continue to contribute to financial-sector development by providing savings options to households and credit to small and medium-size firms . 
As for the official banking sector , liberalization of interest rates on deposits , scheduled for 2016 , will reduce financial repression and implicit investment subsidies . 
That , in turn , should help to rebalance the demand side of the growth pattern . 
Such complex structural changes cannot be perfectly synchronized and thus are likely to be accompanied by a dip in growth rates . 
But whether a slowdown is the start of a trend or a temporary part of a complex transition , will not be apparent from the start .
