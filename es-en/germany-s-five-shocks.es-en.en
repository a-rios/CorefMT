Germany &apos;s Five Shocks 
Over the last decade , Germany has been the slowest growing economy in the European Union , and Europe has been the slowest growing continent in the world . 
From 1995 to 2005 , Germany will have grown by only 14.6 % , while the old EU on average will have grown by 24 % , the US by 39.9 % , and the world economy by 45.6 % . 
Why has Germany performed so badly ? 
One theory , endorsed by the head of Germany &apos;s ruling Social Democratic Party , Franz MÃ¼ntefering , is that Germany is already where the others still want to be . 
Slow German growth , he maintains , is a sign of natural convergence . 
But this theory is not convincing . 
Germany has recently been overtaken in terms of per capita income by several EU countries , including Ireland , the UK , the Netherlands , and France , and is still growing more slowly than all of them . 
Another , more plausible theory is that over the past fifteen years there have been various external challenges or shocks that have hit the country simultaneously . 
Rigid as it was , with an extensive welfare system and an over-regulated labor market , Germany was unable to react to these shocks and ran into trouble . 
This theory recalls that of the British historian Arnold Toynbee , according to which empires collapse because they are unable to react to external challenges . 
The first shock was intensified globalization , which brought a lot of new low-wage competition . 
Although globalization is a gradual process , it gained momentum when China decided to play the game . 
China is ten times the size of Japan , and Japan was not easy to deal with , either . 
German precision instruments and optical equipment , for example , lost their competitive edge when Japan entered the game . 
The second shock was EU integration , including the northern and southern enlargements . 
The dismantling of the EU &apos;s internal borders boosted each country &apos;s market size and brought about the predicted economies of scale . 
But this helped Europe &apos;s small countries more than the big ones , and it implied more competition for Germany , Europe &apos;s biggest economy . 
Think of Nokia , the mobile phone maker . 
Due to the economies of scale that the common market made possible , Nokia was able to exploit its inventions fully , while Germany &apos;s Siemens recently decided to give up on the mobile phone market . 
The third shock was the euro , which has induced a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates , which in some countries had been five to seven percentage points above the German level . 
Freed from exchange-rate risk , international investors no longer demanded a risk premium from these countries and were willing to provide funds to all of them under the same favorable conditions that previously had been reserved for Germany . 
This is good for Europe , because it helps improve the allocation of capital and stimulates growth by transporting German savings to the remote and previously disadvantaged regions of the euro zone . 
But it is of doubtful benefit to German workers who also would have liked to cooperate with that capital . 
The fourth shock was eastern EU enlargement , which has brought extraordinary chances for trade and investment in the east , but has also brought massive low-wage competition . 
On average , wage costs in the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004 are only 14 % of the West German level . 
Low-wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and off-shoring activities that have kept German firms competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor . 
As neither Germany &apos;s unions nor its welfare state would accept falling wages , the result was higher unemployment and slower growth . 
The fifth shock was German unification , which is a failure in economic terms . 
GDP per working-age person in East Germany had been 61 % of the West German level in 1996 , but it is now only 59 % . 
The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has pulled down the Germany-wide average , while the enormous demand for public funds in the east has increased public debt . 
The weak fiscal position has in turn undermined investors &quot; confidence , with obvious implications for economic growth . 
All five shocks constitute historical developments that are good for the world as a whole , but problematic for Germany . 
In order for the country to meet the challenges and to continue to grow , it would have to make its labor markets flexible . 
Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new international environment can German workers become competitive again , so that the country returns to a higher employment level , exploiting its human capital up to the capacity constraint . 
The new government that voters will most likely elect in September will be confronted with the difficult task of confronting Germans with reality and pushing through the necessary reforms . 
Only then will we know whether Germany can meet the Toynbeean challenge it is facing .
