The Power of Cuba \ u0027s Powerless 
A little more than a year ago , poet and journalist Raúl Rivero Castañeda wrote that he refused to let America &apos;s embargo against Cuba define the international debate over the fate of the island &apos;s 11 million people . 
&quot; In this country , the real blockade , the one that affects the daily life of the people is the internal governing system , &quot; he declared . 
Since then , Rivero has endured his own private blockade . 
Cuba &apos;s internal system is one that Rivero managed to avoid annoying too much until March of this year . 
But over three days that month , the Cuban government arrested Rivero and 27 other independent journalists . 
By April , all had been sentenced to 14-27 years in prison . 
The journalists were part of a spring sweep that turned 75 Cubans-including librarians , writers , and other professionals-into political prisoners . 
For Rivero and journalists who smuggled their missives abroad , it was their insistence on writing what they saw and felt that put them in jail . 
That fidelity to the truth could now kill them . 
Rivero and journalist Oscar Espinosa Chepe , 62 , are both ill , their families tell visitors . 
Rivero , who has lost much weight , has circulatory problems , and Espinosa suffers from a worsening liver disease . 
Castro must realize that even if he relents and sets Rivero and others free , they are likely to stay . 
Rivero has long understood that Castro may be the Father of the Cuban Revolution , but that the revolution &apos;s children are increasingly restive . 
Castro can deny their simple truths like a Cuban King Lear , but Rivero and others persist . 
They witness . 
They write . 
Rivero made his decision to go beyond the revolution &apos;s definition of journalism in 1989 , when he broke from the writer &apos;s union and joined with nearly a dozen other intellectuals to sign an open letter raising the issue of political prisoners . 
With the children of the revolution no longer obeying , Castro punished them . 
So , one-by-one , many left . 
But Rivero stayed . 
Still others-including the economist Martha Beatriz Roque and Dr. Oscar Elías Biscet , who are now in jail with Rivero-continued their peaceful opposition . 
Rivero formed an independent news service and under the noses-and watchful eyes-of the authorities , sent his work abroad . 
In one 1998 column , he wrote about journalists jailed for operating independently and lamented an internal press &quot; totally devoid of meaning . &quot; 
In another article , he wrote that no one could make him feel like a criminal : &quot; I am merely a man who writes ; one who writes in the country where I was born . &quot; 
Over the years , the authorities picked up Rivero , questioned him , harassed him , and tried to nudge him off the island , where he would presumably disappear into the black hole of Miami &apos;s exile community . 
But Rivero was too smart . 
He stayed , calling himself an &quot; inixile . &quot; 
Others did , too . 
When I visited Cuba in 2001 with a group of students reporting on the island , one of them , Ezequiel Minaya , spent his days talking to Rivero and other writers . 
Many of Rivero &apos;s old friends feared that talking to the poet would endanger them , and he appeared lonely . 
My student asked why Rivero stayed and he replied with the mantra he lived : &quot; Why should I leave , this is my country . &quot; 
For years , Castro has blamed any internal problems on a draconian US trade embargo . 
But writers like Rivero and his fellow political prisoners , as well as those dissidents who are not in jail , refuse to let Castro off so easily . 
They don &apos;t want to leave Cuba ; they want to redefine it . 
More than 30,000 Cubans signed the Varela petition requesting a referendum on basic rights . 
The international community is listening , and the arrests and detentions have only made them pay more attention . 
The American left , long silent on Cuba , has cleared its throat . 
In mid-September the pressure continued to build . 
The European Parliament condemned Cuba &apos;s human rights violations and demanded that Rivero and other prisoners be released . 
Earlier , the European Union agreed new sanctions against Cuba &apos;s government , enraging Castro . 
The Cuban Conference of Bishops followed by demanding clemency for the prisoners . 
Jailed or freed , Rivero will not go away . 
In 2000 , he wrote about a poetry contest in Cuba run by the dissident group Reflection . 
It was clear from the entries that Castro was failing to control his island &apos;s imagination . 
Rivero must still take pleasure in the poem by Nestor Leliebre Camue , a native of Santiago de Cuba . 
&quot; Don &apos;t plunge into the sea 
for the love of God . 
Wait . 
A fascinating brightness 
Is rising from the land . &quot; 
To end here , however , would fail Rivero . 
Cubans are known for managing humor in the worst situations . 
I imagine that Rivero would want to end with a diary entry smuggled out by his fellow journalist and prison mate Manuel Vázquez Portal . 
The Vázquez diary is posted on the web site for the Committee to Protect Journalists : 
&quot; Now , like T.S. Eliot , I can say , &apos; April is the cruelest month.&apos; 
April 4 is a bad day for me . 
On April 4 , my mother gave me 18 knocks on the head for joining the Young Pioneers ( the communist youth organization ) without her permission . 
This last April 4 , they gave me 18 years for writing without permission . 
The first time I was a child , this second I &apos;m an old man . 
It seems repression does not work ; either that or I &apos;m very stubborn . &quot;
