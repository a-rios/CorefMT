The Unraveling of Europe &apos;s Peace 
COPENHAGEN - The European Commission recently unveiled long-awaited measures to bring neighboring countries in the Mediterranean and the former Soviet Union closer to Europe . 
On the same day , another department of the same Commission presented proposals aimed at curbing visa-waiver programs for some non-European nationals . 
Few missed the irony of formulating two plans that pointed in opposite directions . 
Attracting neighbors has long been a noble aspiration - and something of a European specialty . 
The European Union &apos;s embrace of post-communist republics in Central Europe represented a most powerful symbol of the reach of Western liberal democracy . 
In today &apos;s neighborhood , where EU expansion is not in the cards , Europe hopes to shore up its presence by opening its huge internal market and increasing assistance . 
Crucially , the Commission &apos;s recent proposals include the creation of &quot; mobility partnerships &quot; with Tunisia , Morocco , and Egypt , aimed at facilitating travel for local students and businesspeople . 
By contrast , the proposed restrictions on the visa-waiver program include &quot; safeguard clauses &quot; that would temporarily suspend access to Europe &apos;s Schengen area , most likely for those from Balkan countries . 
This is controversial enough : the decision is motivated by a large influx of asylum-seekers , often offering frivolous reasons , originating from Serbia . 
But visa liberalization has been the main concrete signal of Europe &apos;s goodwill towards this neglected backyard , which dreams of joining the EU . 
Whatever this plan &apos;s impact in practice , the political message is clear : when in doubt , Europe is better off sealing its borders . 
The same Janus-faced approach is evident in Europe &apos;s response to the Arab Spring . 
After a lukewarm reaction to the uprisings , Europe was eager to show its support for democratic movements in the region . 
At the same time , with boatloads of migrants arriving from Tunisia , some rather drastic measures have been adopted . 
A recent dispute between Italy ( the main port of arrival ) and France ( the principal final destination ) ended with the French reintroducing border controls . 
In an unrelated move , Denmark did the same , ostensibly to prevent cross-border crime . 
To its credit , the European Commission also issued strong calls to member states for better legislation and practices concerning migration . 
But there is a clear correlation between unrest at the EU &apos;s doorstep and Europe &apos;s irresistible instinct to keep trouble at arm &apos;s length . 
For once , the rot is not in Brussels , but rather in a growing number of European capitals . 
The case of Italy is instructive : &quot; human tsunami &quot; is the unfortunate phrase used by senior policymakers to warn against the possible flood of migrants . 
But , almost six months into the North African upheavals , the number of arrivals on the southern island of Lampedusa has reached roughly 30,000 . 
By comparison , Sweden , with one-sixth the population of Italy , accepted the same number of asylum-seekers in 2009 . 
Italian officials privately confirm that the current figures are not unmanageable . 
The problem for Italian officials , as for the other governments concerned by the recent migration flows , is the pressure of right-wing populist parties , which no longer need to be on the defensive . 
The case for openness , inclusion , and diversity in European societies has become much harder to make . 
Not coincidentally , mainstream leaders , from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to British Prime Minister David Cameron , have caught up with the current mood by deeming European multiculturalism a failure . 
This turn of events comes at a price . 
The genius of modern Europe has consisted in linking long-term stability to the pursuit of ever-deeper economic and political integration . 
For the past half-century , this has represented Europe &apos;s revolutionary recipe for peace , and has served as something of a microcosm of globalization . 
The ever-freer and faster flow of capital , labor , goods , and ideas found in the EU a model and a forerunner . 
Free movement of people within Europe constitutes this visionary project &apos;s most tangible feat . 
One unintended effect of the Arab revolutions is that the link between security and integration that forms Europe &apos;s foundation is decoupling . 
The advantages of pooling sovereignty and resources ring increasingly hollow to ordinary Europeans . 
Governments find it more politically rewarding to pursue security by erecting administrative or physical barriers . 
As election campaigns beckon in some of the countries that are now debating immigration controls , this trend is unlikely to be reversed any time soon . 
But Europeans should make no mistake about the consequences . 
Opposing Europe now means not only standing up to an unelected behemoth in Brussels , as Euro-skeptics would have it . 
Nor is it merely about questioning the sources of Europe &apos;s influence in a fast-changing world . 
Unraveling the nexus between security and integration means nothing less than rejecting the formula of Europe &apos;s peace .
