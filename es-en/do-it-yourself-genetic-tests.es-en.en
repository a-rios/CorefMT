Do-It-Yourself Genetic Tests 
LONDON - If you were hoping to pick up a DNA kit along with your shampoo from the drugstore , you would be out of luck . The United States Food and Drug Administration recently warned the giant pharmacy chain Walgreen &apos;s to think twice before stocking personal genetic testing kits . As an FDA spokeswoman said , &quot; These kits have not been proven safe , effective or accurate , and patients could be making medical decisions based on data from a test that hasn &apos;t been validated by the FDA . &quot; 
Since the first personal genetic tests became available on the Internet three years ago , critics have raised concerns about their potential impact on patients and families , along with their accuracy . Some say that the tests are &quot; genetic horoscopes , &quot; and just about as scientific . 
Such misgivings have led to personal genetic tests being banned in several US states , as well as in European countries like France and Germany . 
Personal genetic tests vary from one manufacturer to another . 
At one end of the market , there are companies offering to test for recessive red-hair genes or sexual chemistry . 
A firm called Scientific Match tests a small number of genes related to immune response , promising that it can put you in touch with partners whose genetic make-up will promise you a better sex life and your children a high natural immune response . 
At the other end of the spectrum , firms like Navigenics and 23andMe offer tests for genetic predispositions to a range of medical conditions like Alzheimer &apos;s disease , breast cancer , and diabetes . 
Four main issues worry critics . 
First , because these are only partial tests , they don &apos;t cover all the bases . 
They target different combinations of SNPs ( single nucleotide polymorphisms , or genetic variants ) . 
There are about three billion SNPs in the human genome , of which the personalized genetic testing companies each cover a fraction . 
That means that customers can and do receive widely different assessments from different firms of how likely they are to develop any particular condition . 
In October 2009 , the scientific journal Nature published an article describing how five researchers submitted their DNA samples to both Navigenics and 23andMe , to be tested for risk of 13 diseases . 
Three researchers were given opposite findings for major risks such as heart attack , lupus and type 2 diabetes . 
Although genetic knowledge could be empowering , a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing , especially if people take irreversible actions based on a &quot; false positive &quot; - or ignore measures like breast cancer screening because of a &quot; false negative . &quot; 
Why don &apos;t all the tests cover the same genes ? 
To be blunt , genetic knowledge hasn &apos;t advanced to the point where clinicians and scientists can generally link one gene , or even a set of genes , to one condition . 
This is the second source of criticism . 
In the early days of genetic testing , researchers had considerable success in identifying the genetic basis of conditions such as Huntington &apos;s disease . 
But Huntington &apos;s , linked to a certain number of repeats in a single genetic marker , is unrepresentative of the role that genes play in causing disease . 
Most diseases are not caused solely by genetic factors , and linkage to many genes is much more typical for those that do have a strong genetic association . 
Genetic medicine is advancing at a rapid pace , but its clinical applications seem to be receding . 
Earlier this month , researchers at the United Kingdom &apos;s Institute of Cancer Research identified five new gene regions associated with breast cancer , taking the total up to 18 . 
But the more genes that are involved , the less feasible it becomes for personal genomics to test for all of them , and the more difficult the consumer will find it to interpret the results without professional help . 
That is the third source of concern about do-it-yourself genetic tests : they don &apos;t necessarily include counseling about the results ( although Pathway says it offers genetic counseling by phone ) . 
What , for example , should consumers - and family members who may have inherited similar predispositions - if they test positive for genes linked to incurable conditions ? 
Moreover , after the DNA sample has been put in the mail , it is no longer the customer &apos;s property , and the company decides what to do with it . 
Scientific Match says that it destroys samples after the &quot; matchmaking &quot; in order to minimize the risk of a violation of privacy . 
But other firms have been accused of having more interest in developing a &quot; biobank &quot; of samples and data than in genetic testing . 
As Jesse Reynolds of the Center for Genetics and Society writes , &quot; Just as the traditional business model of newspapers is to get revenue not from readers but from advertisers , personal genomics companies see the potential profit not from the consumers themselves but from the compiled databases - likely in the form of selling access to them . &quot; 
Drug companies and other firms may well be eager to buy biobanks on which they can test their products for differential responses according to patients &quot; genetic make-up . 
This new development , called &quot; pharmacogenetics , &quot; aims to deliver better-calibrated dosages and more effective treatments . 
There is certainly nothing wrong with that , but it does seem odd that customers are effectively paying a firm for the privilege of donating their DNA to its database . 
As 23andMe founder Anna Wojcicki puts it , &quot; We will not sell individuals &quot; data , but the database as a whole will have enormous value . &quot; 
In fact , that is more doubtful than it seemed when the companies first drew up their business plans . 
The cost of full-genome sequencing has fallen rapidly , from $ 27 billion for the first genome ever completed to around $ 10,000 now , which makes partial genome databases much less attractive . 
One major company has already gone bankrupt ; another is laying off staff .
