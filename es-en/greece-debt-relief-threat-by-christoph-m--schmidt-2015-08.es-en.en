The Threat of Greek Debt Relief 
BERLIN - With Greece &apos;s economic crisis still raging , prominent voices , ranging from Nobel laureate economists like Paul Krugman to officials like US Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew , are calling for more lenient bailout terms and debt relief . 
Even the International Monetary Fund - which , along with other European lenders , has provided Greece with emergency financing - recently joined that call . 
But could such an approach really be the proverbial silver bullet for Greece &apos;s crisis ? 
The short answer is no . 
While Greece &apos;s public debt is undeniably high , and evidence abounds that high debt can hold back economic growth , the country faces even stronger drags on growth , including structural weaknesses and political brinkmanship , that must be addressed first . 
In fact , Greece will likely depend on concessional funding from official sources in the years ahead - funding that is conditional on reforms , not debt ratios . 
Greece &apos;s nominal debt stock will matter only once the country re-enters the debt markets and becomes subject to market , not concessional , borrowing terms . 
In the meantime , Greece must implement the structural reforms needed to restore the country &apos;s long-term growth prospects and thus to strengthen its capacity to repay its creditors without a large nominal debt reduction . 
But there is another critical reason why debt relief is not the answer , and it lies in the political architecture of the European Monetary Union . 
Because the eurozone lacks a strong central governing body , crisis policies emerge from a political process in which each of the 19 member states has veto power . 
For such a complex system to work , eurozone policymakers must be able to trust one another to behave in a particular way - and that requires a common framework of rules and standards . 
A restructuring of Greece &apos;s official debt , despite offering short-term benefits , would weaken that framework in the long run by setting a precedent for exceptions , with other eurozone countries , sooner or later , requesting the same concession . 
In 2013 , the extension of Greece &apos;s loan maturities prompted Ireland and Portugal to demand - and receive - comparable extensions , despite their less obvious need . 
Instead of offering concessions , which could create long-term instability in the eurozone , Europe &apos;s leaders must remain committed to creating strong incentives for all member states to maintain prudent fiscal policies capable of reducing public-debt ratios and restoring fiscal buffers against asymmetric shocks to the currency union . 
Only then will the eurozone have a chance of upholding the Lisbon Treaty &apos;s &quot; no bailout &quot; clause . 
Greece may account for less than 2 % of eurozone GDP , but the pursuit of shortsighted ad hoc solutions to its problems may set precedents that could bring down the entire monetary union . 
To prevent such an outcome , it is critical that any solution to the Greek crisis reinforces , rather than undermines , the eurozone &apos;s cohesion . 
It is true that Greece has had to undergo painful adjustments to address its deep structural weaknesses , unsustainable public finances , and lack of price competitiveness - adjustments that led to a drop in Greek output . 
But high unemployment and a lack of investment cannot be blamed on the medicine prescribed ; they are symptoms of the country &apos;s failure to reform its public administration and to enhance the flexibility of its economy . 
The international debate about how much austerity is appropriate to balance the interests of Greece and its creditors has distracted policymakers for too long . 
It is time to focus on the real imperative : designing and implementing vital structural reforms , at the national and European levels . 
To guide this process , the German Council of Economic Experts , which I chair , has developed a set of reforms - called &quot; Maastricht 2.0 &quot; - that would reinforce the rules-based framework that is so essential to the eurozone &apos;s long-term success . 
For example , the banking union needs to be strengthened through an enhanced resolution regime and an integrated financial supervisor , and a sovereign insolvency mechanism should be introduced . 
Underpinning the proposed reforms is the so-called &quot; principle of unity of liability and control , &quot; which demands that both the power to make decisions and liability for their consequences are kept at the same political level , be it national or supranational . 
In other words , if countries want to make their own fiscal decisions independent of their eurozone partners , they cannot expect those partners to step in and save them later . 
To be sure , in recent years , the European institutional framework has undergone major reforms that reflect the principles of &quot; Maastricht 2.0 , &quot; such as the need to emphasize national responsibility for public finances and international competitiveness . 
But the reform process remains far from complete . 
There is no denying that short-term measures to address acute problems - such as debt relief for Greece - threaten the eurozone &apos;s long-term stability . 
If the European Monetary Union is to survive and ultimately thrive , its leaders must not be tempted by facile solutions .
