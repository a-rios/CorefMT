Obama the European ? 
WASHINGTON - Barack Obama began his second term as US President with an inaugural address that presented a broad vision of American government . 
In Europe , the prevailing reaction highlights that , between the lines , America &apos;s first self-proclaimed &quot; Pacific president &quot; delivered the most &quot; European &quot; inaugural address in recent memory . 
Obama &apos;s speech not only embraced the core principles of social democracy as understood in Europe , but also heralded a new era of American engagement in global governance issues . 
But , notwithstanding Obama &apos;s Euro-enthusiasm , valid questions remain concerning his administration &apos;s foreign policy . 
Along with frequent references to America &apos;s founding principles and to the touchstones of US history , Obama presented a vision of society , government , and foreign relations with which most Europeans could identify , including explicit references to women &apos;s rights and , for the first time in such a high-level speech , gay rights . 
The address also embraced social welfare ( &quot; The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security , these things do not sap our initiative , they strengthen us &quot; ) and the idea of fraternit√© ( &quot; preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action &quot; ) . 
For those who see Obama becoming more &quot; European , &quot; the climax of the speech was his mention of the &quot; threat of climate change &quot; - again , for the first time in an American inaugural address . 
In the same vein , Obama &apos;s pledge to &quot; renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crises abroad &quot; was hailed as another telling sign that Obama &apos;s views coincide with Europe &apos;s . 
But , while Obama &apos;s emphasis on institutions is particularly striking when compared with other major US presidential addresses , the starkest contrast is with British Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s speech about Europe , delivered two days later . 
Cameron &apos;s remarks ( &quot; the EU is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf &quot; ) came closer to the institutional skepticism of Ronald Reagan &apos;s inaugural address in 1981 ( &quot; &#91; I &#93; t is not my intention to do away with government , &quot; but &quot; to make it ... work with us , not over us &quot; ) than to Obama &apos;s &quot; European &quot; vision . 
But is Obama &apos;s inaugural address an indication of a renewed vigor for US-backed / led multilateralism ? 
At the outset of his first administration , Obama spoke of the need &quot; for a global response to global challenges , &quot; which was followed by a move toward multilateral engagement , most notably in Libya . 
In a recent interview , Obama emphasized America &apos;s &quot; extremely effective &quot; participation in multilateral organizations and its role in developing international rules and norms as successes of his first-term foreign policy . 
To the extent that an institutional approach was taken , however , it was largely taken outside the framework of formal institutions such as the United Nations . 
Rather , it highlighted soft or ad hoc structures , such as the Global Counterterrorism Forum , the Open Government Partnership , or the various G &apos;s , particularly the G-20 . 
The hard truth is that the US remains reluctant to trade its sovereignty for multilateral solutions . 
Notably , it is not a party to a large number of important international conventions , including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) , the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court , the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , and the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( one of only three UN members that has not ratified the CRC ) . 
America &apos;s absence from such instruments has much to do with Congressional opposition , as was seen in the latest attempt to ratify UNCLOS . 
Nonetheless , there is room for executive action - for example , signing the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Treaty or ratifying the Rome Statute , which established the International Criminal Court . 
A second-term shift toward institutional multilateralism would embrace such action . 
Obama &apos;s treatment of global warming in his inaugural address is telling in this regard , because , other than a passing reference to preserving &quot; our planet , &quot; the issue of climate was dealt with as an internal matter . 
The impetus for focusing on the environment was framed as a need to counter the threat of fires , drought , and &quot; more powerful storms . &quot; 
This policy rationale was underscored by his warning that America &quot; cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries . &quot; 
The rallying cry was national competition , not international cooperation . 
Obama &apos;s silence with regard to multilateral efforts to combat global warming is notable . 
Given the rapidly approaching 2015 deadline to negotiate a new binding international agreement on climate change under the Durban Platform , a US administration that supports institutional solutions to global problems is vital . 
It remains to be seen whether Obama &apos;s inclusion of institutional renewal in his inaugural address marks a turning point in America &apos;s approach to multilateralism . 
If the international community is to produce &quot; a global response to global challenges , &quot; Obama must translate his call for institutional renewal into meaningful action .
