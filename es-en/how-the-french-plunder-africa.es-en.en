How the French Plunder Africa 
France &apos;s unchallenged political , economic , and military domination of its former sub-Saharan African colonies is rooted in a currency , the CFA franc . 
Created in 1948 to help France control the destiny of its colonies , fourteen countries - Benin , Burkina-Faso , Ivory Coast , Mali , Niger , Senegal , Togo , Cameroon , Central African Republic , Congo , Gabon , Equatorial Guinea , Bissau Guinea , and Chad - maintained the franc zone even after they gained independence decades ago . 
In exchange for France guaranteeing the CFA franc &apos;s convertibility , these countries agreed to deposit 65 % of their foreign exchange reserves in a special account within the French Treasury and granted to France a veto over the franc zone &apos;s monetary policy whenever this special account was overdrawn . 
These decisions have had devastating consequences for forty years . 
The bulk of the CFA franc money supply comes from trade between France and its African allies . 
As a result , the franc zone &apos;s basic features have always been scarce money and high interest rates . 
On the other hand , in line with IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs , strict budget discipline has kept inflation low - as if further belt tightening in the name of price stability was the right policy priority in desperately poor countries hit by decades of depressed demand . 
The result has been a lethal combination of currency convertibility , skyrocketing interest rates , low inflation , and free capital movement , which merely fuels speculation and capital flight . 
Speculators transfer huge amounts of money from France to high-interest-bearing local deposit accounts , collect their tax-free gains every three months , and take the no-risk plunge again . 
Commercial banks are awash with these volatile short-term speculative funds , which they lend to governments on the most stringent conditions . 
The banks and speculators reap handsome gains , governments are overburdened with unsustainable commercial debts , the domestic productive sector is starved of medium- and long-term financing , and most people remain mired in appalling poverty . 
Capital flight , meanwhile , stems from free transfer of profits , debt payments , and the propensity of the elite to exile their assets . 
This massive hemorrhage of foreign currency is channeled exclusively to France , thanks to a capital control it put in place in 1993 . 
As a result , some of the poorest countries in the world are financing part of the French budget deficit . 
The only rational reason for the CFA franc &apos;s existence is connivance between France and the governing elites of its former colonies in order to plunder the franc zone states . 
Even the common currency &apos;s beneficial effects on trade among member countries were nullified by the paradoxical decision taken by the former sub-Saharan French colonies to dismantle the federal governmental structure and the single market of colonial times and to erect trade barriers in their place . 
As though all of this were not bad enough , the CFA franc &apos;s exchange rate , which had remained unchanged since 1948 , was devalued by 50 % in 1994 . 
What better time - from the prospective of foreign investors , that is - to undertake a vast privatization of state assets ? 
Under the auspices of the IMF and the World Bank , lucrative sectors such as energy , telecommunications , water supply , and banks were sold off at knockdown prices to western companies . 
So the end result of the partnership between France and its former African colonies has been spectacularly lopsided . 
France has secured a vast market for its products , a steady supply of cheap raw materials , repatriation of the lion &apos;s share of local savings , unrivaled political influence , a strategic presence with military bases occupied free of charge , and the certainty that it can rely on its African allies &apos; diplomatic support . 
But for the Africans , the partnership has meant weak trade performance , tight money , high interest rates , massive capital flight , and mountains of debt whose repayment prevents higher investment in education , training , health , food production , housing , and industry . 
This arrangement &apos;s negative effects extend , moreover , to the entire African continent . 
At the political level , France and its allies opposed the concept of a continental government advocated in the late 1950 &apos;s and early 1960 &apos;s by the likes of Nasser and Nkrumah . 
They helped block the project and establish the notoriously inefficient African club of heads of states , the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , thus setting back the clock of African integration by decades . 
When the OAU mandated the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) to promote regional economic and monetary union , France and its allies moved quickly to impede it by spearheading the creation of the West African Economic and Monetary Union ( UEMOA ) and the Central African Economic and Monetary Union ( CEMAC ) . 
This partly prevented ECOWAS from emulating the economic performance of it sister organizations , the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) and the Common Market of East and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) . 
But for France &apos;s African allies , grafting a program of economic integration onto a pre-existing artificial monetary union is delusory and unworkable . 
Indeed , it has been tearing apart the fabric of these societies ever since so-called independence came in 1960 . 
No wonder that nowadays most of these countries face civil unrest , rebellion , and risk of implosion . 
If French Africa is to grow , the franc zone must be dismantled . 
The euro &apos;s birth provided an opportunity for these former colonies to break free of France &apos;s suffocating embrace . 
They missed it . 
Instead , they shifted the peg for the CFA franc to the euro while keeping the same rules , institutions , and mode of functioning . 
For the citizens of Francophone Africa , this will certainly have tragic consequences .
