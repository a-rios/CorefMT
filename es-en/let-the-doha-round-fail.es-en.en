Let the Doha Round Fail 
Imagine that the world &apos;s trade ministers simply walk away from their forthcoming Hong Kong meeting of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) with this simple declaration : &quot; We failed to reach an agreement ; we &apos;ll try to do better next time . &quot; 
This would bring the so-called Doha &quot; Development &quot; Round to an unsuccessful conclusion , but it would be no disaster . 
Talk to World Bank and WTO officials , and you will get an earful of inflated claims about the benefits that a successful Doha round would bring . 
These officials often make it sound as if the livelihood of hundreds of millions of poor people in developing nations hangs in the balance . 
Look closer at these claims , and you find that they are built on sand . 
The World Bank &apos;s most recent estimate is that complete trade liberalization ( including in manufactures and by developing nations themselves ) would produce a net gain to the developing world of half a percentage point of their income . 
But that hasn &apos;t stopped the Bank doing its best to hide this meager impact behind impressive-sounding claims . 
The fact is that the world economy is more open today than it has ever been , and will remain so even if the Doha talks collapse . 
Most developing nations have opened themselves significantly to foreign trade and no longer employ the most damaging policies of the past ( such as quantitative restrictions on imports ) . 
The political balance in these countries has tilted decisively in favor of pro-trade groups with an outward-looking orientation . 
In the advanced countries , trade barriers for manufactured goods and many services are at a historic low . 
It would be hard to identify any poor country whose development prospects are seriously blocked by restrictions on market access abroad . 
Any country with a sensible development strategy has the opportunity to make its economy grow , with assistance from trade . 
But what about agriculture ? 
Don &apos;t the farm subsidies and other forms of support in the United States and European Union undercut the livelihood of millions of poor farmers ? 
Wouldn &apos;t phasing them out make a big dent in world poverty ? 
The reality is that the global impact of agricultural liberalization in rich countries would be relatively small and highly uneven . 
These policies may hurt agricultural producers elsewhere , but they also benefit poor urban consumers . 
The balance depends on the poverty profile of individual countries and on whether they are food exporters or importers . 
Of course , there would be some big gainers from agricultural reform , but they are chiefly consumers and taxpayers in rich countries . 
Some large middle-income food exporters ( such as Brazil and Argentina ) would also reap gains . 
Such outcomes are not unimportant , but they represent a far cry from the picture painted by free-trade fundamentalists . 
Indeed the only serious risk from the Doha round &apos;s &quot; failure &quot; is that rich countries would take their own rhetoric seriously and react in unproductive ways that prove self-fulfilling . 
The US , in particular , could intensify its pursuit of bilateral deals , by which it is able to impose increasingly inappropriate policy priorities on smaller nations . 
The silver lining in an amicable break-up of the trade talks is that it would give negotiators a chance to focus on issues that are of much greater significance to developing nations . 
The next time around , trade talks should take up the two most glaring omissions to date : 
A comprehensive effort to enhance the mobility of temporary workers from poor countries to rich countries . 
This is where the gains from liberalization would be the largest , because it is here that the barriers are the highest . 
Creation of a &quot; policy space &quot; for developing countries in WTO agreements . 
Developing nations &quot; pursuit of growth-promoting trade and industrial policies are increasingly running afoul of restrictive WTO rules . 
Growth superstars such as South Korea , Taiwan , China , and many others would not have been able to adopt the growth strategies that they did if today &apos;s WTO strictures had applied to them . 
Trade officials must acknowledge the lessons from these countries &quot; experience and reform the rules accordingly . 
There remains a possibility that trade negotiators will patch together a last-minute deal in Hong Kong and emerge claiming victory . 
We will then end up with an agreement that will have been wildly oversold and is certain to lead to disappointment in the future - especially in developing nations . 
We will also have given up the opportunity to have a real development round next time around . 
Sometimes there is no success like failure . 
The Doha round is a case in point .
