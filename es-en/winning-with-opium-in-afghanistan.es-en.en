Winning with Opium in Afghanistan 
Despite considerable effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the Taliban and al Qaeda , the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months . 
Our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people - the Taliban are . 
Indeed , the international community &apos;s methods of fighting the insurgency and eradicating poppy crops have actually helped the insurgents gain power . 
The international community has so far pursued policies of destruction , rather than the promised reconstruction . 
The aggressive United States-led counter-narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of Afghans , because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers , with their only livelihood destroyed , are unable to feed their families . 
This has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country &apos;s poorest areas . 
At the same time , communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns , which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect . 
This , in addition to four years of drought , has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps . 
You do not win people over by bombing them , but by helping them . 
The Taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti-Western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in Afghanistan . 
Sadly , our troops are often the first to pay the price - sometimes with their lives . 
It is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people . 
International troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment , but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone . 
With public perception a crucial factor in winning the war , and the Taliban poised to launch a large military initiative next spring , failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signify the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable Afghanistan . 
But a successful strategy - one that responds to Afghanistan &apos;s extreme poverty crisis -requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication . 
In fact , the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community &apos;s goals , but it is also failing : opium production last year was at an all-time high . 
In September , the United Nations Office on Drugs Crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record-high 60 % . 
Eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan , because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south &apos;s harsh climate - and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people . 
So a new , long-term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed - one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most - in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population . 
As a way to address this dilemma , the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan , which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process . 
A system in which poppy is cultivated under license for the production of pain-killing medicines such as morphine and codeine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional livelihood and way of life , and , more importantly , to feed themselves and their families . 
There is a global shortage of morphine and codeine , particularly in underdeveloped countries , where these vital medicines are often in short supply , if not completely unavailable . 
Not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of Afghanistan ; it also would stabilize existing local structures , giving communities a reason to support President Hamid Karzai &apos;s government and the international community . 
Farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter-narcotics efforts , in sharp contrast to the current idealistic - and evidently un-achievable - policy of crop eradication . 
We must have the backing of the Afghan people if we are to defeat the Taliban . 
By endorsing such an initiative , the international community would demonstrate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local population , which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency . 
But for such a system to be successful , the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority . 
According to the World Food Program , 70 % of the population lack food security . 
An immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence . 
Only then could a new , long-term development strategy in Afghanistan - one that admits that the international community is not winning the war , and that the status quo is unacceptable - be implemented . 
Licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy &apos;s success .
