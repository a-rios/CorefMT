Latin America &apos;s Stymied Innovators 
SANTIAGO - First , there was one disappointed foreign entrepreneur . 
In December , Israeli venture capitalist Arnon Kohavi , whose firm had been lured to Chile by a government program to promote startups , announced that he was leaving . 
&quot; A handful of monopolistic families control the country , &quot; Kohavi declared to an online magazine . 
&quot; Worse , these families don &apos;t care about anything except their money . 
They don &apos;t have to : the country &apos;s natural resources are a disadvantage here , because the rich don &apos;t need to work hard . &quot; 
Though the interview generated a buzz in the startup business community , establishment papers were quick to dismiss Kohavi &apos;s criticism as sour grapes . 
But Kohavi was not alone . 
One month later , Argentine entrepreneur Martin Varsavski , a bit of a guru in the tech world , had this to say about Chile : &quot; The tendency is to copy old models rather than create new ones . 
Entrepreneurship has to do with non-conformity , and Chileans lack that . 
It is a small society of embarrassed people who are uncomfortable being different . &quot; 
Are Kohavi and Varsavski on to something ? 
I certainly think so . 
And what they are on to applies not just to Chile , but to much of Latin America . 
The region &apos;s challenge is to transform its huge natural-resource wealth into the kind of wealth that does not run out , because it is constantly enlarged by human creativity . 
In recent years , a natural-resource boom fueled growth . 
Resource-rich countries in South America did well ( even when , like Argentina , they had misguided policies ) . 
Resource-poor countries in Central America and the Caribbean stagnated . 
But , with the crucial exception of Mexico , the composition of Latin American exports has not changed much in the last quarter-century . 
Contrast that with Singapore or Ireland , whose export baskets today bear little resemblance to those of 1985 . 
In a series of recent papers , Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard has shown that as countries get richer , their economies diversify : they widen their set of productive skills , and start making new things while continuing to make what they have always made . 
The more skills , the wider the range of what can be made in the future . 
Hausmann shows that a diversified economy is a strong predictor of future growth , which implies that Asia will grow much faster than Latin America for decades to come . 
To understand Latin America &apos;s weakness , it helps to go back to Kohavi and Varsavski . 
Natural-resource abundance bears at least some of the blame . 
Why run risks and innovate if you don &apos;t have to ? 
As Chile &apos;s finance minister in 2006-2010 , I spoke to local business audiences dozens of times , and received countless questions ( sometimes less than friendly ) about tax policy and labor-market regulation . 
I do not recall a single question about incentives for innovation or technology adoption . 
This is not the optimal economic response to commodity abundance . 
Chile is well endowed with natural resources , but not that well endowed . 
Canada , Norway , Australia , and New Zealand have much larger per capita commodity exports than Chile . 
Yet that has not kept these four countries from diversifying their economies and developing the capacity to produce many complex , non-commodity goods . 
Lack of domestic competition is also to blame . 
Innovators in Latin countries often face high prices for key inputs like energy or Internet access , provided by large local firms that may not be monopolies , but that sure act like they are . 
Mexico is the poster child for this problem , but it is far from the only example of it in the region . 
Aggressive pro-competition policies - certain to be resisted by powerful business groups - are the order of the day . 
In the last few years , Chile has taken some promising steps in this direction . 
More are needed . 
Last but not least is the persistence of a culture that impedes innovation . 
The firm started in a garage by two kids with big brains and little money is an American ideal that does not travel well , especially when heading south . 
However good your startup business plan may be , obtaining the necessary financing is nearly impossible if you do not have the right connections or did not attend the right school . 
Bogot√° , Buenos Aires , Lima , and Santiago have their networking parties and incubators . 
But all too often they resemble an alumni reunion for posh academies , rather than a gathering of hungry , lift-yourself-up-by-your-own-bootstraps types . 
And , if their startup fails , young entrepreneurs don &apos;t tell the story with pride at the next party , as they might have done were they in Palo Alto , Helsinki , or Tel Aviv . 
In Latin America , bankruptcy and fraud are still inextricably linked in too many people &apos;s minds . 
The big question is how quickly such an anti-innovation culture can change . 
Optimists point out that , once upon a time , Asia &apos;s top-down culture was viewed as inimical to innovation and economic growth . 
That view is now a distant memory . 
Kohavi and Varsavski are not the only ones hoping for a similarly unexpected turn of events in Latin America .
