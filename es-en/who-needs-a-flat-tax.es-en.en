Who Needs a Flat Tax ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - With America &apos;s Republican presidential candidates lining up to declare their fealty to a flat tax - a system of personal-income taxation that assesses a single rate for all - opponents have focused on why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on the poor in order to reduce them for the wealthy . 
But , if a flat tax is such a bad idea , why have so many countries embraced it ? 
A careful study of these countries - mainly post-communist countries in Eastern Europe and a smattering of tiny micro-states worldwide - suggests that there are three main reasons . 
First , some countries are so relatively poor and lacking in domestic capital that they opt to drop rates in order to attract foreign investors . 
Other countries are so small and ineffective at collecting revenue that they cannot afford a progressive tax system . 
Finally , some countries are so corrupt that they have to offer the wealthy a huge rate cut to get them to pay any taxes at all . 
The United States , like other developed countries , does not suffer from any of these conditions ( yet ) , so it is not clear why it needs a flat tax . 
The formerly communist countries of Eastern Europe that have adopted a flat tax - including Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Macedonia , Romania , Slovakia , and Ukraine , among others - sorely lack investment capital . 
Whether on the European Union &apos;s doorstep or just inside , they compete for the attention of foreign direct investors , for whom a flat tax provides an important signal : You are welcome , we will not steal your money , and you can keep what you earn . 
For developed countries that already have capital and a track record of inward investment , &quot; the appeal of the flat tax is consequently less , &quot; as a report by the International Monetary Fund concludes . 
Thus , the flat tax has not been adopted in any developed countries , or in China . 
The other countries that have embraced a flat tax are small or micro-states : Jamaica , Tuvalu , Grenada , Mauritius , Timor-Leste , Belize , and Seychelles . 
The only ( partial ) exception to this rule is Paraguay , which adopted a flat tax in 2010 . 
Here , flat-tax advocates &quot; administrative-simplicity arguments have some traction . 
If a country is so small that it cannot develop a tax administration effective enough to manage a fair system of progressive taxation , then a flat tax may make sense . 
Moreover , some small countries have other sources of revenue , so the benefit of implementing a progressive tax system does not justify the cost . 
Tuvalu &apos;s government , for example , derives nearly 10 % of its revenues from the sale of rights to its . &quot; tv &quot; Internet domain name , which brings in about $ 2 million annually . 
Countries that are just slightly larger can afford to collect income taxes in a fairer way . 
Finally , if a country &apos;s public institutions are in the thrall of oligarchs who are accustomed to stealing with impunity from the public till , a flat tax may be the only way to induce the wealthy to pay any tax at all . 
Thus , in 2001 Russia became the first large state to adopt a flat tax , reducing the top marginal rate from 30 % to 13 % . 
In 2003 , Ukraine dropped its top rate from 40 % to 13 % . 
In nearly all countries that have introduced a flat tax , government revenues from income tax have declined . 
That is why its adoption is often associated with an increase in value-added tax rates ( as has occurred throughout Eastern Europe ) . 
In the US , the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain &apos;s &quot; 9-9-9 &quot; plan calls for a 9 % rate for personal and corporate taxes , together with a new 9 % national sales tax . 
A country &apos;s tax system reflects its institutional capacity , economic circumstances , and distribution of political power . 
If the US were to become the first developed country to experiment with a flat tax , that shift would tend to confirm what many suspect but hope is not true : that America is broke , desperate for inward investment , incompetently governed , and increasingly ruled by a self-regarding oligarchic elite .
