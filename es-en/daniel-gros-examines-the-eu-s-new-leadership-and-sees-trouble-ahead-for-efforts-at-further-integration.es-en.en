The Government Europe Deserves ? 
BRUSSELS - With the final allocation of portfolios within its executive branch , the European Commission , the European Union has completed its change of guard . 
The process took almost four months , following the European Parliament election in late May , and the end result was inevitably based on a series of compromises - to be expected for an EU of 28 prickly nation-states . 
Indeed , the proper functioning of EU institutions requires that no important constituency ( left or right , East or West , and so forth ) feels left out . 
And the new European Commission looks rather strong , given that more than 20 of its 28 members previously served as prime ministers , deputy prime ministers , or ministers . 
People who have held high political office at home find it worthwhile to come to Brussels . 
But most attention has focused on the EU &apos;s three top positions : the President of the European Commission , the President of the European Council , and the High Representative for external affairs . 
The Commission &apos;s new president , Jean-Claude Juncker , was the first ever to be selected based on his faction &apos;s strong showing in the European Parliament election . 
As a seasoned Brussels insider , he was not one to move the crowds . 
An insider knows best how to reconcile contrasting interests and how to get the institutional machinery moving again , as Juncker showed with his deft handling of the distribution of tasks among the individual Commissioners . 
Selecting the president of the European Council required considerable time and horse-trading , with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk emerging as the final choice . 
But , though Tusk now has an important-sounding position , the European Council President decides nothing . 
The president mainly presides over the meetings of the EU &apos;s national leaders , and an incumbent &apos;s influence depends on his or her ability to set the agenda and facilitate compromises . 
The experience of the previous incumbent , former Belgian Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy , in dealing with his own country &apos;s fractious coalitions proved very useful when he had to persuade national leaders to make decisions during the euro crisis . 
Tusk will have to achieve something similar in the face of the new challenges confronting Europe today , which include Russian aggression in Ukraine , the rise of terrorism in the Middle East , and a stagnant economy at home . 
On the EU &apos;s most immediate challenge , posed by Russia , Tusk will have to broker decisions with leaders from countries that feel immediately threatened ( like his own ) and those for which economic ties with Russia outweigh any threat to European security , which they feel to be remote . 
On the economy , he must reconcile the priorities of full-employment Germany with those of Greece and Italy , which remain in the grip of recession and sky-high unemployment . 
Being able to converse directly with the Council &apos;s members , mostly in English , might be the biggest immediate challenge , as he admitted immediately . 
The appointment of the Italian foreign minister , Federica Mogherini , as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has been widely questioned , owing to her limited executive experience in foreign policy . 
But , since the de facto invasion of Ukraine in late August , her government has changed its position on Russia , and she has sought to convince many critics that she knows the problems facing Europe well ( her university thesis , for example , was about political Islam ) . 
But can she lead ? 
Europe &apos;s foreign service , the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , is a huge bureaucracy , which must be managed well if it is to be effective . 
And , though the head of the EEAS has been dubbed the &quot; EU &apos;s foreign-policy chief , &quot; Mogherini should be seen as its CEO , with key decisions taken by the member states &quot; leaders when they convene in the European Council . 
Her lack of managerial experience is thus her key weakness , and she will have to find a strong team to support her . 
But there is at least one encouraging , if hidden , signal from Mogherini &apos;s appointment : The fact that the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is also an Italian was not an impediment . 
This implies that the ECB presidency is not counted among the posts to be distributed according to nationality quotas , and that Draghi &apos;s nationality is not regarded as having influenced his decisions in any way . 
Leaders of the EU &apos;s institutions have to be political entrepreneurs if they are to leave a mark on history . 
Their decision-making power is limited . 
But they can often frame the choices and broker coalitions to push the existing boundaries of European integration . 
None of the EU &apos;s top three new faces ( Juncker , Tusk , and Mogherini ) has a track record in this sense . 
Evidently the national bosses like it that way . 
The most sobering message from the appointment process is thus that the member states &quot; leaders will not suffer anyone who might rock the boat and push integration forward . 
There will be little movement toward the &quot; ever closer union &quot; envisioned in the Treaty of Rome . 
That might come as a relief for those in the United Kingdom and elsewhere who fear domination by Brussels , but it can only dismay those who hope that , despite its sluggish economy and declining population , Europe can become a relevant global actor .
