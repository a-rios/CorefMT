Will Cuba Rejoin the IMF ? 
SANIBEL - The restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States unlocks new prospects for the island &apos;s economy . 
Some steps , including the removal of the US trade embargo , are prohibited by the Helms-Burton Act , adopted by the US Congress in 1996 . 
But the renewal of Cuba &apos;s membership in the International Monetary Fund is a real possibility . 
Cuba was one of the IMF &apos;s 40 original members . It was involved in much of the preliminary planning for the 1944 Bretton Woods conference , and had an active delegation there . 
As early as 1941 , Cuba worked together with other Latin American countries in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a monetary role for silver , alongside gold . 
Later , it helped to secure greater voting rights for small states and a special status for Latin American countries on the IMF Executive Board . 
After Cuba joined the IMF ( and the World Bank ) in 1946 , it played a positive role in the Fund for the next 12 years . 
In 1954 , it became the tenth country to accept the full obligations of the Fund &apos;s Article VIII , eschewing the use of foreign-exchange restrictions on international trade . 
In 1956 , it took a routine loan from the Fund , repaying it the following year . 
And then the trouble began . 
In 1958 , the government of President Fulgencio Batista borrowed a small amount from the IMF : $ 12.5 million , equivalent to 25 % of Cuba &apos;s quota . 
The terms of the loan called for Cuba to repay it within six months ; by then , however , the government was close to collapsing . 
After Fidel Castro &apos;s forces overthrew the Batista regime in January 1959 , the new government repeatedly sought to postpone repayment . 
That process dragged on for several months , until Cuba renounced its membership in 1964 . 
Nonetheless , over the next five years , the Castro government gradually repaid the full amount due , including all interest charges . 
After the US trade embargo was imposed in 1960 , Cuba became heavily dependent on the Soviet Union for economic support . 
When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , the end of reliable trade and financial backing threw the Cuban economy into a severe recession , which abated only after the government relaxed some restrictions on private enterprise . 
In an effort to strengthen economic relations with a broader range of countries , the Castro government then began putting out feelers toward the IMF . 
In 1993 , Cuba invited an IMF official , Executive Director Jacques de Groote , to visit Havana for secret meetings with Castro and other senior officials . 
De Groote , who had a good relationship with a number of Communist countries , offered advice on a personal basis and provided documents and other information about how the Fund operated and what it could offer . 
That led to further contact , at a lower level , and eventually to a request for technical assistance from the IMF . 
The Fund , bowing to opposition from the US , declined the request . 
It is impossible to know whether the Castro government was interested in rejoining the IMF in the 1990s . 
What is clear , however , is that any effort in that direction would have been futile . 
Approval of a membership application requires a simple majority vote by the IMF Board of Governors . Opposition by the US , which controls approximately 17 % of the vote , would not in itself be decisive . 
But many countries - even some that would normally be receptive to a Cuban application - would be reluctant to cross the US . 
To be sure , Cuba might initially decide not to apply . 
Joining the IMF would give it access to information , advice , and hard-currency loans ; but it would also require the government to divulge data on the Cuban economy . 
At some point , however , it is likely that Cuba will want to renew its membership , at which point the outcome will hinge on the US position . 
Absent US pressure on others to follow its lead , there would be nothing to stop the rest of the board from approving Cuba &apos;s application . 
Under President Barack Obama , the US is on record as favoring Cuba &apos;s reintegration into the world economy . 
The US could further that objective by letting it be known diplomatically that it will not object if others allow Cuba to return to the IMF .
