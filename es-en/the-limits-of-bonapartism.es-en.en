The Limits of Bonapartism 
PARIS - After four decades , France has returned to NATO &apos;s unified military command . 
At a stroke , President Nicolas Sarkozy overturned one of the pillars of French policy - and of the legacy of Charles de Gaulle , the founder of Sarkozy &apos;s own political party . 
The decision is consistent with the way Sarkozy has governed since his election in 2007 . 
Whether he is seeking to reform France &apos;s judicial system , redrawing its administrative map , proposing a new alliance of Mediterranean countries , or seeming to end France &apos;s ambiguous foreign policy of being both aligned and not aligned with the United States , Sarkozy is nothing if not ambitious . 
The problem is that far too many of Sarkozy &apos;s decisions have proved purely symbolic , like the ill-fated Mediterranean Union ; badly conceived , such as judicial reform , which is opposed by virtually the entire legal profession ; or nakedly self-serving , like the administrative reform , which somehow managed to abolish only those departments and regional administrations controlled by the opposition Socialists . 
Many in Sarkozy &apos;s governing UMP have become increasingly public in expressing their unhappiness with his decision-making method . 
In effect , rather than according serious room for decision-making to his prime minister , François Fillon , or to Fillon &apos;s cabinet , Sarkozy has arrogated almost every lever of power to himself and his advisers within the Élysée Palace . 
Indeed , few informed observers doubt that Sarkozy &apos;s chief foreign policy adviser , Jean-David Levitte , has far more influence than France &apos;s foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner . 
Likewise , on matters of domestic policy , the interior minister , Michele Alliot-Marie , has nothing close to the agenda-setting power of Claude Guéant , Sarkozy &apos;s longtime aide and director-general of the President &apos;s office . 
For all the authoritarian habits of de Gaulle or François Mitterand , Sarkozy &apos;s personalization of the presidency is unprecedented in the history of the Fifth Republic . 
Sarkozy makes little secret of his disdain for members of his own party , luring Socialists like Kouchner and Rama Yade , the junior minister for foreign affairs , into his cabinet , and naming retired Socialist politicians like former Prime Minister Michel Rocard to head national commissions and represent France in international treaty negotiations . 
Sarkozy can afford to thumb his nose at his party , given the total collapse of the opposition Socialists , who will almost certainly lose the 2012 election . 
If Sarkozy governed effectively , such political and institutional departures might seem like a breath of fresh air in a society whose institutions seem increasingly ill-suited to the challenges of a multi-ethnic and post-industrial society ( even though dirigiste France has conserved its industrial base better than many other rich countries ) . 
This was how many who supported Sarkozy &apos;s presidential bid viewed him . 
Despite policy differences , Sarkozy would be for France what Margaret Thatcher was for Britain : someone who would lead the country out of its impasse , conserving the best aspects of dirigisme but finally giving entrepreneurs room to grow , cracking down on crime , and reforming education . 
But Sarkozy has not governed effectively , as his party &apos;s disenchantment with him and polling data make abundantly clear . 
The manic character of his presidency - initiative spilling into initiative , each being the transformative solution to the problem at hand , all opposition denounced as lies , bad faith , and cowardice - has worn thin . 
On a number of issues , notably wages , liberalization of employment rules , and reform of the judiciary and of secondary education , programs announced with tremendous fanfare have had to be delayed or withdrawn . 
Almost invariably , Sarkozy has blamed the minister in question , and then moved on to the next subject to strike his interest . 
In the meantime , his obsession with dominating the daily news cycle , no matter how flimsy the pretext , continues unabated . 
He has even appeared at crime scenes - not urban riots , but private crimes of passion , where no reason of state could possibly warrant the presence of the President of the Republic . 
Given the pathetic state of the Socialist opposition , it is difficult to see what price , if any , Sarkozy will pay for his record in office . 
But this style of government - essentially an electoral campaign , not a government - virtually guarantees that almost nothing of real importance can be accomplished . 
At a recent press conference , US President Barack Obama remarked that he was loathe to comment immediately on matters of great public importance before being absolutely sure that he knew - and knew what he thought about - the subject in question . 
Many French wish that such self-discipline could rub off on Sarkozy . 
Given his temperament , however , that hardly seems likely . 
As a result , an administration in which many had placed high hopes is lapsing into demagoguery and ineffectiveness .
