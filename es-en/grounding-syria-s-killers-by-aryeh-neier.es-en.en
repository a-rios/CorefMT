Grounding Syria &apos;s Killers 
NEW YORK - As Syria has descended into all-out civil war , much of the worsening slaughter has been attributable to aerial bombardments of urban neighborhoods that President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s opponents control , with such attacks causing especially high casualties in recent weeks in the ancient city of Aleppo . 
Can anything be done to stop the killing ? 
There are many good reasons not to intervene militarily . 
For one thing , it would be impossible to do so under the auspices of the United Nations , owing to Russian and Chinese obstructionism in the Security Council . 
There is also America &apos;s understandable reluctance to become involved in yet another war in an Islamic country , as well as the impossibility of knowing what kind of regime might emerge if and when Assad is overthrown . 
Yet it also seems impossible to stand by while the daily bloodbath continues . 
The situation in Syria feels more and more like what we witnessed in Bosnia 20 years ago . 
Then , as now , the international community &apos;s main response for an extended period was to provide humanitarian assistance to the conflict &apos;s growing number of victims . 
Thanks to satellite television , the world had a front-row seat to watch the citizens of Sarajevo , who were kept alive by UN food deliveries , being killed by shelling and sniping from the surrounding hills . 
Today , the UN is delivering an increasing amount of assistance to Syrian refugees who have managed to escape to neighboring countries , while those who have not are being slaughtered . 
As with Syria now , Russian support for the Serbian side two decades ago was one of the factors that prevented military intervention . 
But it was by no means the only obstacle . 
The US presidential election in 1992 made George H. W. Bush &apos;s administration reluctant to use military force . 
Other political factors deterred Britain and France - and Bush &apos;s successor , Bill Clinton - from intervening until another three years of killing had taken place . 
While military intervention in Syria may be impossible , imposing a no-fly zone is not . 
To be sure , a no-fly zone over Syria would not be a simple undertaking : substantial resources would be required , and , given the regime &apos;s military capabilities , it would not be a risk-free operation . 
Yet it was accomplished for more than a decade in neighboring Iraq to keep Saddam Hussein from attacking segments of his own population , so we know that it can be done in Syria as well . 
Of course , someone - presumably Gulf States such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia - is supplying the Syrian opposition with weapons . 
Yet , as long as Assad &apos;s forces can attack opposition-controlled neighborhoods with helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes , the opposition &apos;s ability to overthrow the regime with the arms that are now available to it seems questionable . 
What is more certain is that the presence of armed fighters in a neighborhood provokes aerial attacks that destroy civilian infrastructure and maim and kill those residents who have not fled . 
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan made a valiant effort to negotiate a peace settlement when there still seemed to be a remote chance of success . 
Since then , the sharp rise in bloodshed has made it increasingly unlikely , or even impossible , that Assad &apos;s opponents would consent to any arrangement that kept him in power . 
At the same time , Assad &apos;s loyalists , especially members of the minority Alawite sect , must fear that they would be massacred if his regime fell . 
At some point , the international community may have to intervene to prevent or mitigate such a massacre . 
Its credibility in doing so , and therefore its likelihood of success , would be far greater if it were to intervene now to establish a no-fly zone to protect civilians in the opposition neighborhoods of Syria &apos;s cities . 
Because Russian and Chinese intransigence precludes the UN from establishing a no-fly zone , the Arab League and NATO should jointly take the lead . 
And , while the participation of the US , which has by far the greatest logistical capacity , is essential , it should not be in the forefront . 
As in the case of Libya , this would be an excellent opportunity to &quot; lead from behind . &quot; 
A no-fly zone is by no means a solution to the conflict in Syria . 
But it would be a modest step in the direction of reducing the great harm currently being done . 
A more comprehensive approach , if one could be found , would be far preferable . 
Until then , it seems well worth pursuing efforts that would help to abate the carnage .
