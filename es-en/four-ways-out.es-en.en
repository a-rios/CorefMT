Four Ways Out 
BERKELEY - When an economy falls into a depression , governments can try four things to return employment to its normal level and production to its &quot; potential &quot; level . 
Call them fiscal policy , credit policy , monetary policy , and inflation . 
Inflation is the most straightforward to explain : the government prints up lots of banknotes , and spends them . 
The extra cash in the economy raises prices . 
As prices rise , people don &apos;t want to hold cash in their pockets or their bank accounts - its value is melting away every day - so they step up the pace at which they spend , trying to get their wealth out of depreciating cash and into real assets that are worth something . 
This spending pulls people out of unemployment and into jobs , and pushes capacity utilization up to normal and production up to &quot; potential &quot; levels . 
But sane people would rather avoid inflation . 
It is a very dangerous expedient , one that undermines standards of value , renders economic calculation virtually impossible , and redistributes wealth at random . 
As John Maynard Keynes put it , &quot; there is no subtler , no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency . 
The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction , and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose ... &quot; But governments will resort to inflation before they will allow another Great Depression - we just would very much rather not go there , if there is any alternative way to restore employment and production . 
The standard way to fight incipient depressions is through monetary policy . 
When employment and output threaten to decline , the central bank buys up government bonds for immediate cash , thus shortening the duration of the safe assets that investors hold . 
With fewer safe , money-yielding assets in the financial market , the price of safe wealth rises . 
This makes it more worthwhile for businesses to invest in expanding their capacity , thus trading away cash they could distribute to their shareholders today for a better market position that will allow them to reward their shareholders in the future . 
This boost in future-oriented spending today pulls people out of unemployment and pushes up capacity utilization . 
The problem with monetary policy is that , in responding to today &apos;s crisis , the world &apos;s central banks have bought so many safe government bonds for so much cash that the price of safe wealth in the near future is absolutely flat - the nominal interest rate on government securities is zero . 
Monetary policy cannot make safe wealth in the future any more valuable . 
The third tool is credit policy . 
We would like to boost spending immediately by getting businesses to invest not only in projects that trade safe cash now for safe profits in the future , but also in those that are risky or uncertain . 
But few businesses are currently able to raise money to do so . 
No one is willing to buy assets and take on additional uncertainty , because everyone fears that somebody else knows more than they do - namely , that anyone would be a fool to buy . 
Although the world &apos;s central banks and finance ministries have been devising many ingenious and innovative policies to stimulate credit , so far they have not had much success . 
This brings us to the fourth tool : fiscal policy . 
There are drawbacks : the subsequent deadweight loss of financing all the extra government debt that has been incurred , and the fear that too rapid a run-up in debt may discourage private investors from building physical assets , which form the tax base for the future governments that will have to amortize the extra debt . 
But when you have only two tools left , neither of which is perfect for the job , the rational thing is to try both - credit policy and fiscal policy - at the same time . 
That is what the Obama administration is attempting to do right now .
