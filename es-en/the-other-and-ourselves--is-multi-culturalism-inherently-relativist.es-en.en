The Other and Ourselves : Is Multi-culturalism Inherently Relativist ? 
Understanding &quot; the other &quot; will pose the 21 st century &apos;s greatest social challenge . 
The days are over when &quot; Westerners &quot; could consider their experience and culture as the norm and other cultures merely as earlier stages in the West &apos;s development . 
Nowadays , most of the West senses the arrogant presumption at the heart of that old belief . 
Sadly , this newfound modesty , so necessary for understanding other cultures and traditions , threatens to veer into relativism and a questioning of the very idea of truth in human affairs . 
For it may seem impossible to combine objectivity with the recognition of fundamental conceptual differences between cultures . 
So cultural openness poses the risk that we debase the currency of our values . 
To grapple with this dilemma , we must understand culture &apos;s place in human life . 
Culture , self-understanding , and language mediate whatever we identify as fundamental to a common human nature . 
Across human history , always and everywhere , these basic faculties have demonstrated endless extraordinary innovation . 
In accounting for such variety , some people anchor our understanding of human nature at a level below that of culture . 
Sociobiology , for example , seeks to discover human motivation in the ways that human beings evolved . 
Advocates of this view claim that cultural variation is but the surface play of appearances . 
But we can never discover species-wide laws , because we can never operate outside of our historically and culturally specific understanding of what it is to be a human being . 
Our account of the decline of the Roman Empire is not and cannot be the same as that put forward in 18 th century England , and it will differ from accounts offered in 22 nd century Brazil or 25 th century China . 
Here the charge of relativism arises . 
But it is wrong to believe that accepting cultural differences requires abandoning allegiance to truth . 
The 17 th century scientific revolution &apos;s great achievement was to develop a language for nature that purged the purpose- and value-terms bequeathed by Plato and Aristotle to earlier scientific languages , which were nourished by earlier civilizations . 
But the universality of the language of natural science cannot be applied to the study of human beings , where a host of theories and approaches compete . 
One reason for this is that the language of human science draws on our ordinary understanding of what it is to be human , to live in society , to have moral convictions , aspire to happiness , and so on . 
No matter how much our everyday views may be questioned by a theory , we nonetheless draw on our understanding of basic features of human life that seem so obvious as to need no formulation . 
It is these tacit understandings that make it difficult to understand people of another time or place . 
Ethnocentrism results from the unchallenged understandings that we unwittingly carry with us , and which we cannot dispel by adopting another attitude . 
If our tacit sense of the human condition can block our understanding of others , and if it is so fundamental to who we are that we cannot merely wish it away , are we utterly imprisoned in our own outlooks , unable to know others ? 
True understanding in human affairs requires a patient identification and undoing of those facets of our implicit assumptions that distort the reality of &quot; the other . &quot; 
This can happen when we begin to see our own peculiarities clearly , as facts about us , and not simply as taken-for-granted features of the general human condition . 
At the same time , we must begin to perceive , without distorting , corresponding features in the lives of others . 
Our understanding of the &quot; other &quot; will be improved through these corrections , but it will remain imperfect . 
If the historiography of the Roman Empire in 25 th century China turns out to be different from our own , this will not be because the facts will be found to be different than we ( or 22 nd century Brazilians ) thought . 
The difference will be that different questions will be asked , different issues raised , and different features will stand out as remarkable . 
Of course , as in our time , some accounts will be more ethnocentric and distortive , others more superficial . 
In short , some will be more &quot; right &quot; and come closer to truth than others . 
Avoiding distortion requires acknowledging that our way of being is not uniquely &quot; natural , &quot; that it merely represents one among many possible forms . 
We can no longer relate to our way of doing or construing things as if it were too obvious to mention . 
There can be no understanding of &quot; the other &quot; without a changed understanding of the self - an identity shift that alters our understanding of ourselves , our goals , and our values . 
This is why multiculturalism is so often resisted . 
We have a deep investment in our distorted images of others . 
Most of us recognize that we are enriched by understanding other human possibilities . 
It cannot be denied , however , that the path to acknowledging their existence and value can be painful . 
The crucial moment occurs when the &quot; other &apos;s &quot; differences can be perceived not as error , or as a fault , or as the product of a lesser , undeveloped version of what we are , but as the challenge posed by a viable human alternative . 
Other societies present us with different and often disconcerting ways of being human . 
Our task is to acknowledge the humanity of these &quot; other &quot; ways while still living our own . 
That this may be difficult to achieve , that it will demand a change in our self-understanding and hence in our way of life , is the challenge our societies must reckon with in the years ahead .
