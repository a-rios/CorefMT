Defusing Russia &apos;s Energy Weapon 
COPENHAGEN - As winter approaches , many people in Central and Eastern Europe remember the chill caused last winter by Russia &apos;s deliberate cut-off of gas supplies . 
That shutdown was a harsh reminder that gas is now the Kremlin &apos;s primary political instrument as it seeks to re-establish its privileged sphere of interest in what it thinks of as Russia &apos;s &quot; near-abroad . &quot; 
If Russia is allowed to continue imposing Moscow rules on Europe &apos;s energy supplies , the result will be costly - not only for Europe , but for Russia as well . 
So it is past time that the European Union stopped treating energy as a bilateral issue , with some of the larger member states trying to protect their own narrow interests at the expense of the common European good . 
The EU urgently needs to build a common energy policy and a single market for natural gas . 
Until both are established , there is a grave risk that Russia will use new blockades to continue the kind of divide-and-rule policy that the world has witnessed since Vladimir Putin came to power . 
The planned Nord Stream gas pipeline on the bottom of the Baltic Sea is a good example of the problems that everyone in Europe is facing . 
The pipeline has been established as a Russian-German-Dutch consortium , but it is the Russian energy giant Gazprom that is in the driver &apos;s seat with 51 % of the shares . 
Nord Stream will enable Russia to deliver natural gas directly to Germany without using the existing land-based connections . 
At first glance , there seems to be no problem . 
But the real reason Russia wants to build Nord Stream - which is more expensive than the existing gas-pipeline network - is that it will enable Russia to interrupt gas supplies to EU member countries like Poland , the Baltic states , and neighbors like Ukraine , while keeping its German and other West European customers snug and warm . 
Countries that have good reason to fear a Russian manufactured chill have loudly proclaimed that Nord Stream is politically rather than economically motivated . 
After all , it would be much cheaper to expand existing land pipelines than to build undersea . 
Yet these concerns have been pushed aside by the powerful pro-Nord Stream lobby , led by former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder , who , having approved Nord Stream while in office , was quickly hired by Gazprom after he left it . 
In most democracies , such a move would have quickly received prosecutorial attention . 
But no serious investigation of the propriety of Schröder &apos;s dealings was ever launched , perhaps because of the scale and importance of German-Russian economic ties . 
This November , Nord Stream was given a surprising go-ahead by three Scandinavian countries that will lend their seabed to the project : Denmark , Sweden , and Finland . 
They seem to regard the case as a &quot; technical issue , &quot; and are now satisfied because environmental guarantees have been given . 
But Nord Stream is no &quot; technical issue . &quot; 
The concerns of countries that fear being left out in the cold must be addressed , which is why it is necessary to establish a single EU market for natural gas . 
That way , no one would be left exposed to Russian pressure . 
Europe undoubtedly needs Russian gas , but fears that this gives Russia a monopolistic stranglehold over Europe are exaggerated . 
Russia &apos;s share of total EU gas imports is just above 40 % today , compared to 80 % in 1980 . 
Moreover , Russian gas represents only 6-7 % of the EU &apos;s total primary energy supply . 
So , in general , dependence on Russian gas should not be feared . 
The problem is that some countries in the eastern part of the EU are much more dependent on Russian gas than the average figures suggest . 
Thus , they must be guaranteed the kind of solidarity that is fundamental to EU membership . 
Last year &apos;s experience with interrupted gas supplies did have one benefit : new life was blown into plans for alternative routes , like the Nabucco pipeline that is to bring Azeri gas to Europe through Turkey . 
An early warning system on potential supply cuts has also been agreed between Russia and the EU . 
And it looks like Ukraine &apos;s Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has charmed Prime Minister Putin into concluding a new gas deal . 
Yet anxiety remains high in the countries most exposed to new supply cuts . 
It is in Russia &apos;s own interest that the EU deal with it as a united entity . 
Continued fear and uncertainty about Russian gas supplies would undoubtedly lead the most exposed EU countries to seek to protect themselves by blocking EU-Russia negotiations on new partnership and cooperation agreements . 
In his State of the Nation speech this November , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev stressed the need for modernization of the Russian economy . 
Closer cooperation with the EU is the most obvious way to make this possible . 
But , so long as Russia is perceived as an energy blackmailer and not a partner , such cooperation will be impossible .
