The Truth about Negotiations 
ATHENS - When people and countries negotiate , they often talk about their interests as though they were the only matters that could elicit agreement . 
In casting his veto at the European Union &apos;s December summit in Brussels , British Prime Minister David Cameron said , &quot; What is on offer isn &apos;t in Britain &apos;s interests , so I didn &apos;t agree to it , &quot; as if agreement solely depended upon whether or not interests were satisfied . 
Then again , reaching an agreement might never have been Cameron &apos;s goal . 
While so-called &quot; win-win &quot; outcomes are increasingly considered to be the ultimate purpose of every negotiation , what if the negotiating parties contemplate a win-win outcome that actually harms non-participants to the talks , or is against the law ? 
What if the outcome is beneficial but contrary to the principles of the negotiating parties ? 
Imagine that you are at a negotiating table and want the other party to agree with you . 
A strategy that could work would be to stress how the outcome is beneficial to everyone involved . 
But the outcome you propose might not be fair , or realistic , or you might be consciously lying . 
So , although based on interests , such a proposal will not be easily accepted . 
Indeed , when one ponders how many issues there are to consider , it becomes obvious that negotiation is a type of communication that involves far more than interests . 
Principles , morality , and simple respect for the truth guide agreement as much as interests do . 
Some would argue that successful negotiators require only tact - the ability to use principles to conceal one &apos;s true interests . 
If this were correct , the United States was right to wage war on Iraq on the basis of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime . 
But it is now widely accepted that the way in which the US negotiated its way into war was a mistake - one that has cost it enormous credibility as a negotiating partner . 
In fact , the US often stands for high principles , such as freedom and democracy , and incorporates them successfully into its foreign policy . 
Defending economic aid to Europe after World War II , General George C. Marshall , then US Secretary of State , gave an inspirational speech that argued that US policy is not directed against &quot; any country or doctrine , but against hunger , poverty , desperation , and chaos . &quot; 
The Marshall Plan was as much about principles as it was about protecting US interests . 
Even if the Cameron government &apos;s rhetoric seems to be focused on &quot; interests , &quot; its negotiating positions also reflect higher principles , just as other countries &quot; do . 
The United Nations and other organizations bear witness to countries &quot; commitment to principles of justice and solidarity , and to their willingness to set aside their narrow agendas to serve higher causes . 
Negotiation should address these causes no less than it speaks to interests . 
None of this is to deny that interests do , after all , play a role in negotiations , or that interests can affect morality . 
Immanuel Kant famously argued otherwise - that morality should be free of non-universal interests . 
But the contemporary philosopher JÃ¼rgen Habermas argues that moral norms are valid as long as people accept them freely after having considered the consequences of their implementation for the satisfaction of interests . 
Of course , consideration of interests means just that : they must be taken into account ; they do not have to be entirely satisfied . 
In some cases , the defense of interests alone might seem appropriate - for example , in certain business transactions . 
The more complicated a negotiation , though , the more difficult it is to disregard complex issues such as values and norms or the importance of being sincere . 
As Aristotle said : &quot; that which is true and better is naturally always easier to prove and more likely to persuade . &quot; 
Failure to provide proper arguments and reasons for a negotiating position could lead to a breakdown of communication among the parties . 
If negotiations truly need proper argumentation of this sort , it surely makes sense that many differences are resolved outside the context of negotiations . 
Likewise , certain &quot; negotiations &quot; are not negotiations at all , but are better understood as processes of extortion and blackmail . 
In today &apos;s globalized world , true negotiation is necessary . 
Countries and peoples form an interconnected web of interests that cannot be easily disentangled and satisfied in an isolated manner . 
Resolving disputes requires mutually accepted principles that guide how individuals and countries interact . 
Negotiation is the path toward successful conflict resolution , but it should be conducted according to basic rules of true and open communication . 
Countries and peoples should stop debating the interests that often divide them and start discussing the principles that unite them . 
As long as communication is conducted truthfully and with respect to values , norms , and objective facts , negotiations will be able to achieve consensus and agreement .
