Françafrique at 50 
DAKAR - This month , Africa &apos;s Francophone countries will mark the 50th anniversary of their independence , and of the ties they maintain with France . 
But is there much to celebrate ? 
Even before French President Charles de Gaulle took office in 1958 , he foresaw the wave of revolutionary nationalism that would soon sweep across Africa , Asia , Latin America , and the Middle East . 
As French president , he sought to circumvent that tide by proposing to the leaders of France &apos;s African colonies a negotiated settlement for independence . 
To accept de Gaulle &apos;s offer , these leaders had to agree , among other things , to allow the stationing of French troops on their territory , provide France with a steady supply of raw materials at pre-determined prices , assume all colonial-era debts incurred by France , maintain the CFA Franc as their common currency , and grant the French Treasury veto authority over their sub-regional central banks . 
De Gaulle got most of what he wanted , and granted independence . 
Francophone Africa has been paying for independence ever since . 
French troops have repeatedly intervened in Chad , Gabon , Zaire , Central Africa , Togo , and Côte d &apos;Ivoire to prop up and protect complacent , corrupt , undemocratic , and incompetent leaders , remove recalcitrant ones , or curb civil unrest . 
In Rwanda , France has yet to live down its perceived role in enabling the 1994 genocide . 
On the monetary front , the CFA Franc Zone &apos;s member countries dismantled the federal structure that united them during French occupation and erected trade barriers instead . 
The CFA franc issued by two sub-regional central banks ( BCEAO and BEAC ) are not interchangeable . 
As a result , regional trade and economic integration have been stifled . 
The ensuing economic difficulties were exacerbated under President François Mitterrand , whose prime minister , Pierre Bérégovoy , pursued a strong French franc - a policy that ultimately led to a massive 100 % devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 . 
And the euro &apos;s appreciation against the dollar from 2002 until very recently meant that the shift in the CFA franc &apos;s exchange-rate peg from the French franc to the euro caused a repeat of that scenario . 
With the bulk of their exports denominated in US dollars and their imports priced mainly in euros , chronic structural deficits have wrecked the Franc Zone economies , and the prospect of a second devaluation looms larger by the day . 
More appalling is the fact that France guarantees the CFA franc &apos;s free convertibility into hard currency , originally on the condition that all 15 Franc Zone countries surrender 100 % of their foreign reserves to the French Treasury . 
The amount was reduced to 65 % , and then 50 % , in 2005 , but France still deducts its share directly from these countries &quot; export earnings . 
Moreover , the mandatory 20 % foreign exchange cover stipulated in the convention signed with France in 1962 now stands at 110 % . 
And a foreign-exchange control enacted in 1993 ensures that only France benefits from this capital drain by limiting the free flow of capital to France alone . 
The ensuing massive capital flight has bled the region &apos;s economies and eroded their competitiveness . 
This is a shame , because the economic situation elsewhere in Africa has been improving in recent years - mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa , where economic integration is proceeding within the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA ) and the Southern Africa Development Community ( SADC ) . 
Unfortunately , West Africa &apos;s regional grouping , the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , is not as effective . 
With the establishment of ECOWAS , the Franc Zone countries created two sub-regional groupings , WAEMU and CEMAC , in a bid to curb British , American , and Nigerian influence . 
As a result , West African countries are mostly missing out on Africa &apos;s current revival - and the prospect of a prolonged period of stagnation in the eurozone certainly won &apos;t help . 
The imbalanced relationship between France and its former African colonies would beggar belief if the psychology of Africa &apos;s &quot; liberators &quot; 50 years ago were overlooked . 
Senegal &apos;s first president , Léopold Sédar Senghor , was a strong believer in white supremacy who once wrote that &quot; reason is Helennic ; emotion is Negro . &quot; 
Leon Mba , the first Gabonese president , was such a Francophile that he bequeathed his personal fortune to France in order to finance the construction of a hospital in Paris . 
Similarly , the founder of Côte d &apos;Ivoire , Félix Houphouët-Boigny , coined the word &quot; Françafrique &quot; to underline the total osmosis between France and its former colonies . 
Houphouët-Boigny &apos;s support for France &apos;s African policy led him to establish diplomatic ties with South Africa &apos;s apartheid regime and make his country a supply-transit route for the Biafra secessionists . 
These leaders were unlikely ever to dispute France &apos;s Diktat , and the same applies to their heirs . 
Indicted French child abductors were freed by Chad at France &apos;s request . 
In Mali , several suspected terrorists - members of a local branch of Al Qaeda - were set free in exchange for a lone French hostage . 
Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade once labeled the CFA franc a colonial relic - but that was when he was an opposition leader . 
Now he considers it the best currency in the world . 
This economic and psychological status quo ensures that , after 50 years of independence , true emancipation for Françafrique will remain a distant prospect . 
If there is something to celebrate , it is that the balance of global economic power is shifting to emerging countries , and that new role models and a new generation raised in a globalized world are becoming ready to assume the mantle of leadership .
