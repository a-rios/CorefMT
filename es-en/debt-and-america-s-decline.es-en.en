Debt and America &apos;s Decline 
MILAN - Italians and other Europeans have serious problems addressing their own national debts , public and private , so it may seem immodest for a European to discuss America &apos;s growing and grave debt problem . 
But the fiscal realities on both sides of the Atlantic nowadays are very similar , and only lingering trust in the promise of America keeps alive the expectation among some Europeans that some grand American coup de théâtrewill resolve the country &apos;s dire debt situation . 
Of course , many Americans recognize the scale of the country &apos;s debt burden . 
Admiral Mike Mullen , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and thus America &apos;s highest ranking military officer , recently said , &quot; The greatest danger to American security comes from the national debt . &quot; 
Four Americans out of ten agree with him , whereas less than three in ten deem terrorism or Iran more dangerous . 
America &apos;s Great Power status has always been tied to its level of debt . 
Indeed , it was the absence of debt that marked the United States &quot; emergence as a world power between 1914 and 1917 . 
The US went from owing $ 3 billion ( mostly to Great Britain ) to being a net creditor for about the same amount , thanks to $ 6 billion in war credits given to the Western Allies . 
A further $ 3 billion in credits for European post-war reconstruction cemented America &apos;s status as the world &apos;s premier creditor nation , with its surplus equal to roughly 8 % of GNP at the time . 
This shift meant that the US had essentially replaced Britain as the heart of the world &apos;s financial and monetary system . 
Previously , thanks to the gold standard and Britain &apos;s political stability , the City of London had been the world &apos;s key source of capital and financial guarantees for more than a century . 
The new era began suddenly in January 1915 , when , after a few months of deep uncertainty , gold started to be shipped to New York in increasing quantities . 
A few months earlier , the veteran Boston financier Henry Lee Higginson had sketched in a letter to President Woodrow Wilson what America &apos;s new strategy should be . 
America &apos;s financial house had to be put in order , all debts repaid , and , as London had done for a long time , confidence had to be maintained , which meant guaranteeing the dollar &apos;s convertibility into gold . 
Alone among the world &apos;s great nations , the US did manage to guarantee dollar convertibility throughout the Great War . 
With peace , the dollar and Wall Street became the dominant force on the world &apos;s financial landscape . 
The financial-market rules established after 1933 by President Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal enabled the dollar to replace the British pound at the center of the international system . 
America &apos;s role as the world &apos;s banker went unchallenged for the next 40 years ago , until President Richard Nixon decoupled the dollar from gold . 
Yet , even without the gold standard , America &apos;s economic might , together with the recycling of petrodollars , kept the dollar on top . 
Indeed , the US remained the world &apos;s premier creditor nation until 1986-1987 , when it became a debtor nation again . 
In the two decades that followed , America &apos;s debt usually was around $ 3 trillion , rising or falling with the exchange rate of the dollar . 
Starting in 1990 , the US began to import more and more capital , particularly from Asia . 
In the 2000 &quot; s , China became the prime source of debt financing , and Americans were happy , because it enabled the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low . 
There were some who foresaw danger . 
The Swedish economist Axel Leijonhufvud foresaw asset-price inflation - houses in particular - and a worsening of credit quality . 
Financial innovation soon made that prediction come true . 
It is enough to remember that in 2008 there were only 12 public companies in the world with AAA credit ratings , but more than 60,000 - mostly American - triple-A structured financial products . 
The US , the world &apos;s banker , had mutated into the world &apos;s hedge fund . 
With that change , the banker &apos;s traditional imperative to maintain fidelity and trust - to &quot; keep faith , &quot; as Higginson put it - was forgotten . 
And it is in America &apos;s public debt that the debris of its financial system &apos;s broken promises are collected , just as Italy &apos;s massive public debt reflects its past national prodigality . 
The figures for the US are staggering . 
In addition , there is the $ 3.9 trillion in debt owed by America &apos;s government-backed housing-finance agencies ( Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and others ) , which currently underwrite more than 90 % of all US mortgages . 
As a result , America &apos;s public debt has reached roughly 140 % of GDP . 
The US Congress is well aware of what these numbers portend , but its members have chosen to avert their eyes . 
Indeed , the president is no longer required to provide the usual five-year forecast of the country &apos;s fiscal position . 
A one-year perspective is now deemed sufficient . 
So , where does that leave the world economy ? 
There is no newly emerging Great Power that can assume responsibility for global finance , as there was in 1914 . 
Back then , Wall Street was ready for the job . 
Someday , Shanghai and Hong Kong might be ready , but that possibility is of little help now .
