Immigration and American Power 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States is a nation of immigrants . 
Except for a small number of Native Americans , everyone is originally from somewhere else , and even recent immigrants can rise to top economic and political roles . 
President Franklin Roosevelt once famously addressed the Daughters of the American Revolution - a group that prided itself on the early arrival of its ancestors - as &quot; fellow immigrants . &quot; 
In recent years , however , US politics has had a strong anti-immigration slant , and the issue played an important role in the Republican Party &apos;s presidential nomination battle in 2012 . 
But Barack Obama &apos;s re-election demonstrated the electoral power of Latino voters , who rejected Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney by a 3-1 majority , as did Asian-Americans . 
As a result , several prominent Republican politicians are now urging their party to reconsider its anti-immigration policies , and plans for immigration reform will be on the agenda at the beginning of Obama &apos;s second term . Successful reform will be an important step in preventing the decline of American power . 
Fears about the impact of immigration on national values and on a coherent sense of American identity are not new . 
The nineteenth-century &quot; Know Nothing &quot; movement was built on opposition to immigrants , particularly the Irish . 
Chinese were singled out for exclusion from 1882 onward , and , with the more restrictive Immigration Act of 1924 , immigration in general slowed for the next four decades . 
During the twentieth century , the US recorded its highest percentage of foreign-born residents , 14.7 % , in 1910 . 
A century later , according to the 2010 census , 13 % of the American population is foreign born . 
But , despite being a nation of immigrants , more Americans are skeptical about immigration than are sympathetic to it . 
Various opinion polls show either a plurality or a majority favoring less immigration . 
Both the number of immigrants and their origin have caused concerns about immigration &apos;s effects on American culture . 
Demographers portray a country in 2050 in which non-Hispanic whites will be only a slim majority . 
Hispanics will comprise 25 % of the population , with African- and Asian-Americans making up 14 % and 8 % , respectively . 
But mass communications and market forces produce powerful incentives to master the English language and accept a degree of assimilation . 
Modern media help new immigrants to learn more about their new country beforehand than immigrants did a century ago . 
Indeed , most of the evidence suggests that the latest immigrants are assimilating at least as quickly as their predecessors . 
While too rapid a rate of immigration can cause social problems , over the long term , immigration strengthens US power . 
Whereas most developed countries will experience a shortage of people as the century progresses , America is one of the few that may avoid demographic decline and maintain its share of world population . 
For example , to maintain its current population size , Japan would have to accept 350,000 newcomers annually for the next 50 years , which is difficult for a culture that has historically been hostile to immigration . 
In contrast , the Census Bureau projects that the US population will grow by 49 % over the next four decades . 
Today , the US is the world &apos;s third most populous country ; 50 years from now it is still likely to be third ( after only China and India ) . 
This is highly relevant to economic power : whereas nearly all other developed countries will face a growing burden of providing for the older generation , immigration could help to attenuate the policy problem for the US . 
In addition , though studies suggest that the short-term economic benefits of immigration are relatively small , and that unskilled workers may suffer from competition , skilled immigrants can be important to particular sectors - and to long-term growth . 
There is a strong correlation between the number of visas for skilled applicants and patents filed in the US . 
Immigrants or children of immigrants founded roughly 40 % of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies . 
Equally important are immigration &apos;s benefits for America &apos;s soft power . 
The fact that people want to come to the US enhances its appeal , and immigrants &quot; upward mobility is attractive to people in other countries . 
The US is a magnet , and many people can envisage themselves as Americans , in part because so many successful Americans look like them . 
Moreover , connections between immigrants and their families and friends back home help to convey accurate and positive information about the US . 
Likewise , because the presence of many cultures creates avenues of connection with other countries , it helps to broaden Americans &quot; attitudes and views of the world in an era of globalization . 
Rather than diluting hard and soft power , immigration enhances both . 
Singapore &apos;s former leader , Lee Kwan Yew , an astute observer of both the US and China , argues that China will not surpass the US as the leading power of the twenty-first century , precisely because the US attracts the best and brightest from the rest of the world and melds them into a diverse culture of creativity . 
China has a larger population to recruit from domestically , but , in Lee &apos;s view , its Sino-centric culture will make it less creative than the US . 
That is a view that Americans should take to heart . 
If Obama succeeds in enacting immigration reform in his second term , he will have gone a long way toward fulfilling his promise to maintain the strength of the US .
