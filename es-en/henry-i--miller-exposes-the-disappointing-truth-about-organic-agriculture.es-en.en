The Myth of Organic Agriculture 
STANFORD - Organic products - from food to skin-care nostrums to cigarettes - are very much in vogue , with the global market for organic food alone now reportedly exceeding $ 60 billion annually . 
The views of organic devotees seem to be shared by the European Commission , whose official view of organic farming and foods is , &quot; Good for nature , good for you . &quot; 
But there is no persuasive evidence of either . 
A 2012 meta-analysis of data from 240 studies concluded that organic fruits and vegetables were , on average , no more nutritious than their cheaper conventional counterparts ; nor were they less likely to be contaminated by pathogenic bacteria like E. coli or salmonella - a finding that surprised even the researchers . 
&quot; When we began this project , &quot; said Dena Bravata , one of the researchers , &quot; we thought that there would likely be some findings that would support the superiority of organics over conventional food . &quot; 
Many people purchase organic foods in order to avoid exposure to harmful levels of pesticides . 
But that is a poor rationale . 
While non-organic fruits and vegetables had more pesticide residue , the levels in more than 99 % of cases did not cross the conservative safety thresholds set by regulators . 
Moreover , the vast majority of the pesticidal substances found on produce occur &quot; naturally &quot; in people &apos;s diets , through organic and conventional foods . 
The biochemist Bruce Ames and his colleagues have found that &quot; 99.99 % ( by weight ) of the pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend themselves . 
Only 52 natural pesticides have been tested in high-dose animal cancer tests , and about half ( 27 ) are rodent carcinogens ; these 27 are shown to be present in many common foods . &quot; 
The bottom line is that natural chemicals are just as likely as synthetic versions to test positive in animal cancer studies , and &quot; at the low doses of most human exposures , the comparative hazards of synthetic pesticide residues are insignificant . &quot; 
In other words , consumers who buy expensive organic foods in order to avoid pesticide exposure are focusing their attention on 0.01 % of the pesticides that they consume . 
Ironically , in both Europe and North America , the designation &quot; organic &quot; is itself a synthetic bureaucratic construct - and it makes little sense . 
It prohibits the use of synthetic chemical pesticides , with some pragmatic exceptions . 
For example , the EU &apos;s policy notes that &quot; foreseen flexibility rules &quot; can compensate for &quot; local climatic , cultural , or structural differences . &quot; 
When suitable alternatives are lacking , some ( strictly enumerated ) synthetic chemicals are allowed . 
Similarly , in the US , there is a lengthy list of specific exceptions to the prohibitions . 
But most &quot; natural &quot; pesticides - as well as pathogen-laden animal excreta , for use as fertilizer - are permitted . 
Another rationale for buying organic is that it is supposedly better for the natural environment . 
But the low yields of organic agriculture in real-world settings - typically 20-50 % below yields from conventional agriculture - impose various stresses on farmland and increase water consumption substantially . 
According to a recent British meta-analysis , ammonia emissions , nitrogen leaching , and nitrous-oxide emissions per unit of output were higher in organic systems than in conventional agriculture , as were land use and the potential for eutrophication - adverse ecosystem responses to the addition of fertilizers and wastes - and acidification . 
An anomaly of how &quot; organic &quot; is defined is that the designation does not actually focus on the food &apos;s quality , composition , or safety . 
Rather , it comprises a set of acceptable practices and procedures that a farmer intends to use . 
For example , chemical pesticide or pollen from genetically engineered plants wafting from an adjacent field onto an organic crop does not affect the harvest &apos;s status . 
EU rules are clear that food may be labeled as organic as long as &quot; the ingredients containing &#91; genetically modified organisms &#93; entered the products unintentionally &quot; and amount to less than 0.9 % of their content . 
Finally , many who are seduced by the romance of organic farming ignore its human consequences . 
American farmer Blake Hurst offers this reminder : &quot; Weeds continue to grow , even in polycultures with holistic farming methods , and , without pesticides , hand weeding is the only way to protect a crop . &quot; 
The backbreaking drudgery of hand weeding often falls to women and children . 
Of course , organic products should be available for people who feel that they must have and can afford them . 
But the simple truth is that buying non-organic is far more cost-effective , more humane , and more environmentally responsible .
