Scotching the Eurozone 
LONDON - Which of the following events is more likely to happen this year : Scotland votes to secede from the United Kingdom in its September referendum , or at least one country decides to leave the eurozone ? 
Conventional wisdom suggests that Scottish independence is possible , albeit not very likely , while any country &apos;s departure from the single currency is fanciful . 
But the decisions that Scotland would have to make about its monetary arrangements in the months following a vote for independence are at least as likely to be confronted by some eurozone countries over the next couple of years . 
In fact , there is a natural link between the two situations . 
An independent Scotland &apos;s continued use of the British pound - the Scottish government &apos;s official position - could be approached in two ways . 
The first possibility , which First Minister Alex Salmond appears to have in mind , would entail a monetary union under a central bank accountable both to Scotland and the rump UK . 
But the UK government could - and undoubtedly would - veto any such adaptation of the Bank of England &apos;s responsibilities for monetary policy , financial stability , and banking supervision . 
Any other conceivable model of monetary union - including one based on a central bank as unaccountable as the European Central Bank - would be subject to the same rejection . 
As the journalist Martin Wolf noted recently , &quot; the rest of the UK has surely not escaped the horrors of the eurozone only to create similar horrors for itself at home . &quot; 
The alternative for a fully sovereign Scotland would be to continue using the pound without retaining any influence over interest rates or the exchange rate . 
This was the path taken by the Irish Free State ( later the Republic of Ireland ) , which used the sterling-pegged &quot; Irish pound &quot; ( the punt ) for several decades . 
Even if the UK disapproved of the arrangement , it could not stop Scotland from adopting it - much as the European Union deplores but cannot stop Montenegro &apos;s unilateral use of the euro . 
While the decision would have a significant political downside - that is , immediately diluting Scotland &apos;s newly acquired sovereignty - its economic implications are mixed . 
Borrowing the credibility of an established monetary authority - especially one that issues a global reserve currency - would be tactically advantageous for a post-independence Scotland ; but the new country would be exposed to the risk of an inflation shock and sterling crisis stemming from the Bank of England &apos;s expansionary monetary policy . 
From a fiscal perspective , the case is similarly balanced . 
The interest-rate premium that the market would inevitably demand from a young sovereign like Scotland could be minimized by issuing debt in sterling , thereby protecting investors from additional devaluation risk . 
But , without its own currency-issuing central bank , Scotland would forego seigniorage ( profits from central-bank operations that typically benefit the national treasury ) . 
Perhaps more important , it would have no lender of last resort capable of stabilizing the banking and financial system in a crisis . 
All things considered , an independent Scotland would be best served by issuing its own national currency from the outset , empowering the National Bank of Scotland to set interest rates according to domestic economic conditions . 
By allowing for exchange-rate flexibility , this approach would also enable the central bank to avoid the twin hazards that arise in a currency union : undervaluation , which produces inflationary pressure , and overvaluation , which demands wrenching internal devaluations ( driving down real wages ) . 
To see just how difficult the latter can be , consider the eurozone . 
The agony of internal devaluation in the currency union &apos;s weaker economies is increasingly driving voters and financial markets alike to call for a return to their national currencies - a trend that may well come to a head in May &apos;s European Parliament election . 
Italy is perhaps the prime candidate to lead an exit from the eurozone , though a political shock could also arise in France , spurring it to negotiate with Germany the dissolution of the monetary union . 
But , regardless of who leaves first , any countries trading in the euro for their defunct national currencies would , like an independent Scotland , have to determine the right degree of exchange-rate flexibility . 
For example , while a fully floating currency would create a beneficial combination of discipline and flexibility , it might best be delayed in favor of an adjustable ( &quot; crawling &quot; ) peg to some anchor currencies . 
This would buy time to build credibility and , more important , to help keep public debt under control . 
An instructive precedent is Slovakia , whose &quot; velvet &quot; divorce from the Czech Republic at the beginning of 1993 led to the creation of a new national currency . 
The Slovak koruna was initially kept within pre-defined fluctuation bands around target parities with the Deutsche Mark and the US dollar , before moving to a fully floating exchange rate in 1998 . 
Furthermore , Slovakia , unlike most of its regional peers , has fulfilled its legal obligation to join the eurozone - an obligation that an independent Scotland would have to take on when , as expected , it sought EU membership . 
But a sovereign Scottish government might try to negotiate an exemption to this rule - and , in so doing , join the tide of other European countries seeking a way out of the great blunder that Europe &apos;s monetary union has turned out to be .
