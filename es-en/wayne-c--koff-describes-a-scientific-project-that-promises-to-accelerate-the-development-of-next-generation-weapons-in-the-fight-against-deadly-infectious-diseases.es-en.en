Breakthrough Vaccines 
NEW YORK - Vaccines are one of the great success stories in the history of individual and public health . 
They have helped rid the planet of the scourge of smallpox , are poised to eliminate polio , and each year prevent millions of deaths , reducing the suffering and costs caused by infectious diseases . 
But there are still many diseases for which vaccines do not yet exist . 
Moreover , strategies that have previously led to the successful development of vaccines are unlikely to work against more complex bacteria or viruses , such as HIV , which have evolved multiple mechanisms to evade the immune system . 
The history of vaccinology is one in which biomedical and technological advances usher in the &quot; next generation &quot; of vaccines . 
In the 1950 &quot; s , a breakthrough that enabled viruses to grow in tissue cultures led to the development of both live attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines for measles , polio , and other diseases . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , recombinant DNA technology led to the development of vaccines against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus . 
Around the turn of the century , the first sequencing of the human genome led to &quot; reverse vaccinology . &quot; 
The past decade has already yielded major advances in structure-assisted vaccine discovery , synthetic biology , systems biology , and immune monitoring . 
However , successfully translating these advances into the development of next-generation vaccines continues to be impeded by gaps in our understanding of the human immune response that protects against specific bacteria , viruses , or parasites . 
That is why I , along with eight fellow scientists , have proposed the establishment of a new human-immunology-based clinical-research initiative , the Human Vaccines Project . 
In February 2014 , leading scientists and public-health specialists will gather in La Jolla , California , to craft a scientific plan to identify , prioritize , and , most important , solve the major problems currently hindering development of vaccines against diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria . 
Such a project would represent a paradigm shift in vaccine development . 
The current process is long ( often spanning decades from concept to licensure ) , has a low probability of success ( because of the limitations of animal models in predicting immune response and efficacy in humans ) , and is costly ( often requiring hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a single vaccine ) . 
Consider this : In just the past few years , many candidate vaccines against HIV , dengue , herpes , tuberculosis , and staphylococcus aureus have failed , at a cost of more than $ 1 billion . 
Investing that amount over the next decade in a coordinated effort to address the major questions facing vaccine development would rapidly accelerate our search for effective solutions , implying a transformative impact on individual and public health . 
HIV presents perhaps the greatest challenge , because the virus leverages its extensive genetic variability to hide from the immune system . 
Using recent advances , however , scientists have now identified highly conserved regions of this variable virus , determined their molecular structure , and begun designing next-generation vaccine candidates to elicit antibodies that target these regions to prevent HIV infection . 
But HIV vaccine development , like that for several other diseases , is still impeded by the limitations of what animal models can tell us about how to elicit the necessary immune responses in humans . 
Two recent advances could accelerate vaccine development and reduce its costs dramatically . 
In synthetic biology , the rapid engineering of nucleic acid-based vaccines means more candidates move more quickly from concept to trial . 
In systems biology , high-throughput technologies have increased the number of genetic and immunologic parameters assessed in trials . 
This approach has helped predict the efficacy of potential new-generation vaccines against yellow fever and influenza within days of immunization , compared with the usual timeframe of months or years . 
Vaccines already prevent the deaths of 2-3 million people every year , preempt human suffering , lighten the burden placed on health-care systems , and enable more rapid economic and social development . 
Models show that adding even a partly effective AIDS vaccine to the current range of prevention and treatment procedures could dramatically lower the rate of HIV infection . 
As the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu , one of the world &apos;s great campaigners against HIV / AIDS , wrote recently : &quot; We must make the most of scientific advances over the last half-century , which have made vaccines for other preventable diseases the most powerful and cost-effective health-care investment that currently exists . &quot; 
That is the idea behind the Human Vaccines Project - a concept that would have been unimaginable even a decade ago . 
Today , technological advances in vaccine discovery and immune monitoring allow us realistically to explore this potentially game-changing approach to disease prevention . 
February &apos;s gathering in California may take us a giant step closer to a world without deadly and debilitating infectious diseases .
