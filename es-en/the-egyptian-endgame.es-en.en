The Egyptian Endgame 
PRINCETON - Can Egypt &apos;s long history help us to understand the uprising , already labeled a revolution , now underway in Cairo , and how it might turn out ? 
I believe so . 
After all , the demonstrations by millions of people to demand an end to the rule of President Hosni Mubarak and his National Democratic Party ( NDP ) are not an unprecedented phenomenon in the country . 
Egypt &apos;s history is replete with powerful and famous rulers ( starting with Ramses II in pharaonic times , and including Saladin , Muhammad Ali , Napoleon Bonaparte , Lord Cromer , all the way up to the Egyptian military trio of Gamal Abdel Nasser , Anwar El Sadat , and Mubarak ) . 
This suggests that , although Egyptians may not necessarily prefer strongman rule , they are entirely comfortable with it and may even believe that it is necessary . 
To be sure , popular revolts are nothing new for Egypt . 
Crowds rose against Napoleon &apos;s French forces in 1798 , against the monarchy in 1881-1882 , against British dominance in 1919 and 1952 , against Sadat in 1977 , and against Mubarak in 1986 . 
These uprisings were repressed , often brutally , first by foreign troops ( the French army in 1798 and British soldiers in 1882 and 1919 ) and more recently by the Egyptian army . 
Unfortunately , while angry protesters have sometimes forced unwelcome rulers out of power , they have been unable to replace tyrants with governments that respect the public &apos;s wishes . 
Will this long history of authoritarian rule now be broken ? 
The first days of the current uprising favored the people . 
The crowds were enormous and peaceful , not only in Cairo , the historic node for protest , but in all of Egypt &apos;s cities . 
In addition , the army , called out ostensibly to restore order , held back , a markedly different response from its repression of past uprisings . 
French and British soldiers did not hesitate to put down resistance . 
Nor did the Egyptian army in 1952 , 1977 , and 1986 . 
The uprising in 1952 is particularly revealing , because it was widespread and intensely popular , for it was directed against the much-hated British . 
Although the British had 100,000 troops stationed near the Suez Canal at the time , they chose not to intervene . 
Instead , it was the small and highly professional Egyptian army that crushed the uprising , to the dismay of the young officer corps , who were already well advanced in their plans to seize power . 
Years of fighting in Arab-Israeli conflicts , however , transformed the army , giving rise to a massive conscript force that totals approximately 400,000 soldiers today . 
The army &apos;s lower ranks are now filled with young men , drawn from all segments of Egyptian society , whose backgrounds are no different from those of the people they may be called upon to suppress . 
Today &apos;s Egyptian army is a people &apos;s army , and , unlike the reviled security forces , it is widely admired . 
Senior officers surely know the risks that they will incur if they order these men to fire on friends and relatives . 
Moreover , the current mass demonstrations are radically different from previous protest movements that the army suppressed . 
In 1977 , many rose to oppose an end to food and other consumer subsidies ; in 1986 , poorly paid security forces went on a rampage . 
The numbers involved in those protests were miniscule compared to now . 
Nor were the protesters &quot; actions peaceful . 
They threatened property and undermined political order from the outset . 
The Egyptian high command did not need to worry that rank-and-file soldiers would disobey orders , because they were protecting the citizenry . 
Yet , the current protest , which started so peacefully and with such ebullience , took a dramatic and violent turn several days ago . 
Mubarak &apos;s promise that he would not run for re-election this coming September , which might have mollified his critics two weeks earlier , was no longer enough . 
When this concession failed , Mubarak and the ruling NDP began to work behind the scenes , encouraging their followers to attack protesters and provoke violence . 
But Mubarak has also prepared the way for a new set of leaders - all strongly committed to the old order . 
Almost all of them are high-ranking military officers , now elevated to the government &apos;s most important offices . 
Generals now hold the positions of Vice-President , Prime Minister , Deputy Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , and Minister of the Interior . 
Nor are the anti-government protesters likely to find robust support from the United States , always deeply involved in Egyptian affairs , regardless of how often President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasize America &apos;s commitment to freedom and democracy . 
Yes , the Americans want Mubarak to leave - and quickly . 
But the anchor of US policy in the Middle East is the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty , negotiated by Sadat in 1979 , maintained by Mubarak , and well liked by Egypt &apos;s military high command , which controls the strongest Arab army , is US-trained , and has been supplied with top-shelf American weaponry . 
A popular government in which the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood is represented would worry the Americans and the Egyptian military , owing to the prospect that it would repudiate the peace treaty with Israel and jeopardize relations with the US . 
But that is not the most immediate concern . 
Should violence increase , ordinary soldiers would likely once again feel duty-bound to intervene to restore order and prevent further bloodshed . 
If not , the prospects for a transition to a government formed by leaders of the much-respected Egyptian army and moderates representing business and political elites seem high .
