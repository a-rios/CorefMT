Latin America in the Second Machine Age 
PANAMA CITY - At the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Panama City , business and government leaders will discuss the economic challenges facing the Western Hemisphere , especially how to support inclusive growth in the wake of the commodities bonanza that endured for the better part of the last decade . 
Any strategy will have to account for an inescapable global phenomenon : the so-called &quot; Second Machine Age . &quot; 
The MIT economists Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson , among others , identify the Second Machine Age with the rise of new automation technologies and artificial intelligence . 
While optimists predict that these innovations will usher in an era of unprecedented abundance , less sanguine analysts estimate that nearly half of all jobs currently performed by humans are vulnerable to replacement by robots and increasingly sophisticated software . 
Advanced technologies are already making inroads into some of Latin America &apos;s principal industries . 
For example , carmakers , which employ hundreds of thousands of people across the region , are rapidly deploying robots that are more efficient and precise than humans . 
In South America &apos;s grain belt , GPS-guided machinery is diminishing the need for farmhands , even as output increases . 
Service industries , which already account for two-thirds of all jobs in Latin America , are particularly vulnerable . 
One Brazilian startup &apos;s tax-management software , for example , can perform in seconds operations that would demand thousands of billable hours from an army of accountants . 
Other sectors that currently account for a large share of employment in lower-income countries - including apparel , light manufacturing , logistics , and call centers - are forecast to undergo increasing automation . 
Is Latin America ready for this epochal change ? 
For a region that arrived late to the Industrial Revolution , this is not a trivial question - especially at a time when many Latin American economies are facing daunting challenges , stemming from the end of the commodities boom . 
Most notably , Latin American and Caribbean economies must address their productivity gap - the result of their failure , with few exceptions , to boost productivity significantly since the 1960s . 
As they adjust to lower prices for oil , metals , and grain - and the eventual upturn in global interest rates - they will have to pursue productivity-enhancing reforms . 
Ensuring that the region &apos;s already-skewed income distribution does not worsen - and , indeed , improves - is also essential . 
The good news is that Latin America &apos;s agendas for technology , productivity , and inclusivity overlap ; for example , improvements in education and the encouragement of formal employment advance all three objectives . 
In the meantime , there are four areas in which the private sector can contribute . 
First , companies can boost their own human capital by providing on-the-job training - a proven tactic that remains rare in Latin America . 
Here , there has been some progress . 
For example , the government agency Uruguay XXI &apos;s &quot; finishing schools &quot; initiative offers subsidies to export-oriented companies to train staff in specific skills , such as English , and help them to master new technologies . 
Second , Latin American companies should increase their investment in research and development . 
As it stands , companies in the region devote about 0.4 % of their sales , on average , to R D - far less than the 1.9 % average in OECD countries . 
Latin American businesses can change this by emulating their counterparts in the Brazilian state of São Paulo , which have research contracts with leading public universities . 
Such links , common throughout North America , have helped to lift São Paulo &apos;s R D spending to 1.6 % of GDP - higher than that of Spain or Italy . 
Third , Latin American companies can help to improve education - often much faster than the government can implement effective reforms . 
In Peru , one businessman took matters into his own hands , commissioning the creation of an entirely new education model . 
Four years later , Carlos Rodriguez-Pastor has established 23 Innova schools , serving 13,500 students , where teachers &quot; knowledge and skills are continuously updated . 
He hopes to build a 200-school network in the coming years . 
Finally , Latin American business leaders should support budding entrepreneurs , who lack not only the capital , but also the support system needed to turn their ideas into viable ventures . 
Local shortcomings force too many innovators - such as the Guatemalan Luis von Ahn , who co-developed CAPTCHA , the word puzzles that websites use to ensure that users are human - to move abroad . 
Von Ahn , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States , has already sold one innovative company to Google . 
That company , reCAPTCHA , harnesses CAPTCHAs to have people decode a word from , say , a newspaper article that a computer scanner has been unable to recognize and digitize . 
He is now working on Duolingo , a free language-learning platform that aspires to coordinate the translation of Wikipedia &apos;s entire content into several major languages . 
Latin America cannot afford to lose gifted innovators like von Ahn . 
It is in the interest of established business leaders to help mentor and finance these visionaries , enabling them to flourish at home so that they do not set up shop abroad . 
For each of these challenges , there are successful models that can be adapted and replicated . 
With diligence , persistence , and intelligence , Latin America may yet make the most of the coming technological era - and ensure that its benefits are more widely shared .
