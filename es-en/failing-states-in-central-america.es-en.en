Failing states in Central America 
When the US Defence Department produced a report in December in which it named Mexico as one as one of two countries ( along with Pakistan ) at risk of rapidly becoming a failed state there was a predictable rejection of its findings in many quarters . 
In fact , the authors may have got their analysis right , just for the wrong country . 
Head further south to Central America - Guatemala in particular - and the failed state paradigm may be far more applicable . 
Considering the apparent progress made by democracy in the region since the 1990 &quot; s , this assessment may seem a little harsh . 
But dig a little closer to look at the quality of democracy , above all in the condition of state institutions such as the judiciary and the police , and the picture becomes less rosy . 
Ironically , it is Mexico &apos;s hardline strategy against the drug cartels on its own territory which is making the situation worse ; gangs are seeking the relative sanctuary of Central America as a base for their operations . 
The evidence from Guatemala is particularly worrying . 
Some 80 % of Latin American cocaine reaching the US passes through the country at some point . 
President Álvaro Colom in February claimed that 40 % of the 6,200 murders recorded in 2008 were linked to drug-related violence . 
Investigators from the US and Guatemala believe that the two biggest Mexican cartels , the Sinaloa and Gulf gangs , are spreading their tentacles across various departments ; the Gulf cartel &apos;s notorious armed wing , Los Zetas , is held responsible for a spate of massacres in the country in the past year . 
Many economists believe that a major reason for the quetzal &apos;s strength against the dollar in recent years has been the amount of drug money laundered through the Guatemalan financial system . 
Compared with the strong-arm tactics employed by his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón , Colom seems resigned to defeat . 
Comments in January that the country was helpless against an &quot; avalanche &quot; of drug-trafficking from the north were aimed at securing international support , but do little to inspire confidence in his leadership . 
The sad truth is that he may well be right : the national police ( PNC ) are notoriously corrupt , understaffed and inefficient , as much a part of the problem as the drug gangs themselves . 
Moreover , the armed forces have become a shadow of their former self , and still have human rights legacies hanging over them from the country &apos;s bitter civil war . 
Even if the PNC were to convert itself overnight into the world &apos;s most effective crime-fighting machine , it would still be unlikely to have a significant immediate impact . 
Without an overhaul of the entire judicial system , any government measures or societal pressure are not going to make much of a difference . 
This is true as much as for the rest of Central America - with the general exception of Costa Rica and Panama - as it is for Guatemala alone . 
Evidence from El Salvador would appear to bear this point out : the Salvadoran police are widely regarded as stronger and more efficient , but crime rates remain roughly on a par with Guatemala . 
In both countries , impunity is the key : in Guatemala only 4 % ( at most ) of all crimes , and less than 2 % of murders , result in a criminal conviction . 
The condition of the Central American judiciary is at the heart of the prospect of state failure . 
Already weak and inefficient , prone to corruption , politicisation , lack of co-ordination between departments , and outright intimidation of its officials , judicial systems across the isthmus have been an easy target for organised crime . 
Guatemala has been the most obvious victim so far , but Honduras also suffers all the similar conditions to be the next in line . 
Bringing the judicial system and other key state institutions to their knees is the main aim of the drug cartels . 
Being in virtual control of large swathes of Central American territory and being able to act with relative impunity are ultimately very good for business . 
The US may view its war on drugs in Mexico and Colombia as partially successful ; the danger is that Central America does not have those countries &quot; institutional resilience , leaving the way open for new fronts to be opened . 
Quite aside from the terrible human and institutional impact , this situation also undermines the long-term economic strategies of Central American governments . 
For better or for worse , democracy in the region has been accompanied by policies of economic liberalisation and efforts to attract foreign investment , culminating in the signing of the Central American Free Trade Agreement with the US in 2005 . 
While foreign companies have not been deliberately targeted , regular headlines of new killings hardly present a positive international image . 
On-the-surface political stability and favourable investment laws may be in place , but in the absence of an effective judiciary or reliable security forces , committing capital to promising projects becomes that much more difficult . 
Significant improvements to this situation will be hard won . 
Central American politicians &quot; habitual tough talk on violent crime has paid few dividends in practice ; it makes little impact on drug cartels , whose resources often far outweigh those of the local police or army . 
Attention will inevitably be focused on the US to provide more material and technical support to the security forces ; drips of funding for Central America under the term of the Mérida Initiative agreed with Mexico are welcome , but likely to be insufficient in the grand scheme of things . 
Meanwhile , the economic downturn is doing its bit to help the gangs &quot; cause : jobs will dry up , poverty will increase and the government &apos;s ability to provide basic welfare and social services will be tested , making a life of crime all the more attractive and rewarding . 
The possible implications of this Catch-22 are troubling to say the least .
