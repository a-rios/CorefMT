Innovation and Philosophy 
MIAMI - Is it possible to learn to innovate ? 
Is innovation something that can be taught at school ? 
After reading literature by some of the world &apos;s leading experts on innovation - Clayton Christensen , Henry Chesbrough , John Kao , James Andrew , and Harold Sirkin - I was fascinated , but , alas , also frustrated . 
Innovation is the production of new knowledge that generates value . 
It is about fresh ideas that give rise to novel products , services , and processes , new management methods , and original designs and inventions that generate greater profits for firms , regions and countries . 
Most experts agree that there are no ready-made formulas or recipes for how to innovate . 
But is it possible to create the appropriate conditions - to filter ideas and execute plans , and thus to facilitate creativity - under which innovation may flourish ? 
Managers can perhaps be taught how to nurture innovation by creating an environment that stimulates and encourages individual freedom , creativity , and constructive criticism . Innovation is more likely where it is possible to defy restrictions and authority ; where individuals and groups are allowed to ignore conventions ; where a mixing of ideas , people , and cultures is permitted and stimulated ; and where management techniques enable firms and industries to acknowledge , identify , and learn from errors as quickly as possible . 
Above all , innovation will blossom wherever it is recognized that innovation must be open to the physical world and to the world of ideas , and that , because no firm , no process , and no invention has a guaranteed future , everyone should be prepared for uncertainty . 
Innovation may increase even more when firms and managers realize that even the most successful firms - those that &quot; have done everything right &quot; - may languish and disappear . 
In brief , innovation will only truly take off with the understanding that the world is rapidly changing , extremely dynamic and volatile , and that the future is unpredictable . 
These are great ideas , but as I went through these texts I found them to be rather familiar sounding - I had the feeling that somehow and somewhere I had already studied them . 
I soon realized that these clever ideas had already been developed by the theory of knowledge and the philosophy of science . 
Indeed , innovation is simply a subset of scientific knowledge . 
According to the school of rational criticism , when existing theories can neither explain nor solve current problems , the formulation of new hypotheses - and thus new scientific knowledge - is , like innovation , more likely to flourish when constructive criticism is openly allowed and encouraged . 
Here , too , the formulation of new ideas and hypotheses quite often takes place at a far remove from the authority of experts , because experts , like business managers , often become prisoners of their specializations and backgrounds . 
Scientific knowledge is more likely to emerge in environments where it is accepted that there are no prescribed or logical methods for formulating hypotheses ; that they may be the result of sudden inspiration ; or that they may come from dreams , from other disciplines , or from people that belong to different professions or have different backgrounds . 
Once a plausible hypothesis is formulated , it must be tested against all existing theories and against all available experience and information . 
It has to be subject to open criticism from all directions , and only if it survives these tests and criticisms may it be adopted as tentative and conjectural new knowledge . 
Science and knowledge are made up not of winners , but of survivors of continuous and systematic efforts to refute . 
Theories are never certain and must always be prepared for an uncertain future . 
Or , as Karl Popper put it , truth is never definitive and error is always probable . 
No book on innovation that I have read makes the connection between innovation and the theory of knowledge and philosophy of science . 
This is unfortunate , because the theories of innovation may be subject to all the questions , conjectures , and answers that these disciplines have developed with respect to scientific knowledge . 
Should business administration students and future business managers immerse themselves in the philosophy of science , they would not only become more knowledgeable and have greater respect for science ; they might also become more rigorous and more competent , have greater respect for other disciplines , and be more humble . 
At the same time , philosophy professors and students might also profit from the questions that challenge firms and industries . 
They might broaden their scope and find that they , too , can contribute to the productivity of firms , industries , and the economy in general . 
But it is past time that some basic principles in the theory of knowledge and of philosophy of science be introduced into schools of business administration .
