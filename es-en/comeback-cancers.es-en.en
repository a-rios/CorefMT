Comeback Cancers 
LONDON , ONTARIO - Progress is being made against many types of cancer , with more patients surviving longer , thanks to research on two fronts : improved methods for earlier detection , and development of therapies that are more effective and less toxic . 
Indeed , it is estimated that there are now more than 10 million cancer survivors in the United States alone , and this number has been steadily increasing . 
Similar numbers , in proportion to population sizes , are found in other developed countries . 
Cancers that are detected early - when they are small and less likely to have metastasized ( spread away from the primary tumor ) - are more likely to be treatable with local therapy , whereas successful treatment is ultimately unlikely once metastatic tumors develop . 
And improved therapies mean that patients can be treated with drugs that work better ( and that patients are more likely to receive the full dose needed ) . 
But our dramatic progress in detecting and treating cancer has also led to growing awareness of the problem of tumor dormancy : a patient appears to be cured , only to have the same cancer return years or even decades later . 
In breast cancer or melanoma , for example , recurrences 25 years after initial treatment have been reported . 
With a growing number of cancer survivors , we need to understand better the twin processes of tumor dormancy and metastatic cancer recurrence . 
While remarkable progress has been made in understanding the biology of cancer - leading in part to the development of new , less toxic drugs - our understanding of the biology of tumor metastasis , and especially the development of metastases after a long period of tumor dormancy , has lagged . 
We do know that metastasis is a very inefficient process , with most cancer cells that escape into the blood stream failing to form metastatic tumors in distant organs . 
Recent studies - from both the laboratory and the clinic - suggest that many cancer cells that leave the primary tumor may lodge themselves in new organs and go into a dormant state . 
We also have evidence that says that these dormant cells may resist most current treatments . 
This means that adjuvant cancer therapy , designed to kill presumed micrometastatic disease , may be missing an important fraction of disseminated cancer cells , some of which may eventually wake up . 
Moreover , we are beginning to identify molecular mechanisms that regulate the entry of cancer cells into a dormant state , as well as their re-awakening at later times . 
Our knowledge of the regulation of tumor dormancy is really in its infancy . 
But , given the growing numbers of cancer survivors , the need for this knowledge is becoming more pressing . 
Indeed , there is evidence suggesting that tumor dormancy is a valid target for therapy . 
For example , in some types of breast cancer , patients may be treated for more than a decade with anti-hormone therapies , and these long-term treatments are working - they are successful at preventing some of the cancer recurrences that occur with shorter treatment . 
But , while these long-term therapies are relatively safe , they do have side-effects , and the number of cancer recurrences that they prevent is small . 
The challenge today is thus to understand the processes of tumor dormancy and metastasis better , in order to determine more accurately which patients will benefit from long-term therapy . 
We have much to learn , and at this stage don &apos;t even know all of the questions to ask . 
Would intermittent therapy be as useful as long-term treatment ? 
Are there features of the primary cancer , or of individual patients , that can help us predict who will develop late recurrences and metastatic disease ? 
What if late recurrences simply cannot be predicted at diagnosis ? 
Are there modifiable factors - for example , lifestyle , immune-system status , or environmental conditions - that influence whether or not patients develop late recurrences ? 
The answers to these questions will require research , and research into metastasis and tumor dormancy is difficult . 
It requires patience , development of models , and willingness to undertake long-term studies . 
We also need to understand better the prevalence of long-term dormant disease in patients . 
How common is the phenomenon we are examining ? 
It may be that many cancer patients harbor disseminated tumor cells , and not all of these cells are destined to re-awaken . 
In some ways , the success of cancer research is fueling pressure to &quot; cure &quot; cancer quickly , steering clinical and laboratory researchers away from the tricky problems of metastasis and long-term tumor dormancy . 
This focus ultimately may be shortsighted , as the increasing number of cancer survivors leads to an increase in late recurrences . 
Metastases , not the primary tumor , are responsible for most cancer deaths . 
If we are to continue to improve on cancer survival statistics , we need to learn how to prevent , delay , or thwart the processes that give rise to metastatic disease .
