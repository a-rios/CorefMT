Modernization à la Carte ? 
BERLIN  -  
Two centuries ago the American and French Revolutions brought forth the natural law concept of inalienable human rights . 
However , it took nearly two centuries of wars , political and social disasters , and decolonization before this idea became globally accepted , at least in theory . 
In the beginning , the idea of human rights was limited to domestic politics . 
In international relations , power , not right , continued to be the only thing that mattered : the traditional concept of state sovereignty focused exclusively on power , i.e. , on control over people and territory , and protected the state &apos;s authority , regardless of whether its enforcement was civilized or brutal , democratic or authoritarian . 
The Nuremberg Trials of the German war criminals after World War II marked the first important change in the world &apos;s understanding of the concept of sovereignty . 
For the first time , an entire state leadership was put on trial for its crimes , as its representatives and henchmen were brought to justice . 
The Nuremberg Trials and , in parallel , the creation of the United Nations and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights , signaled the growing importance of law in international relations . 
Sovereignty was no longer based solely on power , but increasingly on law and respect for the rights of citizens . 
This process was largely frozen during the five decades of the Cold War . 
But human rights and the rule of law began to re-emerge as a theme of Western policy , especially in the wake of the Helsinki Conference on European Security and Cooperation and its use by the administration of US President Jimmy Carter , as well as by numerous non-governmental advocates protesting the treatment of Soviet dissidents . 
The next big step was the emergence of the concept of humanitarian intervention after the genocide in Rwanda and the Balkan wars in the 1990 &quot; s . 
As a result , international law came to recognize the &quot; right of protection &quot; against governmental arbitrariness and states &quot; crimes against their own people , even though enforcement remains quite uncertain . 
Finally , the same developments in politics and international law led to the creation of the International Court of Justice . 
With its establishment , resulting from long and terrible experience , the basic idea of modernity - that the power of states and their rulers should be subject to the rule of higher law , thus placing individual rights above state sovereignty - has taken a great step forward . 
This development was anything but accidental . 
In the face of the totalitarian challenges of fascism and communism in the twentieth century , Europe and the United States have become aware that the rule of law , separation of powers , and democracy decisively determine foreign policy and matter greatly from the point of view of international security . 
Democracies have proved to be much more peaceful than authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . 
But the progress achieved so far is again under threat . 
China &apos;s rise and Russia &apos;s resurgence suggest that there is no necessary link between economic development , on the one hand , and political and cultural modernization , on the other . 
In particular , China &apos;s breathtaking economic success seems to point to the existence of viable authoritarian alternatives to the Western idea that freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and the market economy are bound together . 
Indeed , China appears to suggest that selective modernization is possible ( modernization à la carte , so to speak ) , allowing states to choose to implement only those elements of modernity - technology , economics , infrastructure , political institutions , and values - that they like . 
But modernization à la carte is an illusion . 
Its proponents forget the experience of the first half of the twentieth century , when authoritarian modernization was tried in both Germany and Russia -with disastrous results . 
In the medium term , modernity is indivisible : you can have all of it or none . 
The deep technological and social changes unleashed by the forces of modernity create tensions that , in the end , cannot be resolved without appropriate normative and institutional responses . 
China and Russia today are no exceptions . 
The symptoms of the disease of selective modernization are clearly discernible in both countries in the form of ubiquitous corruption . 
China , for example , faces increasing export difficulties because of deficient control of the safety of its products , which is largely the result of corruption . 
Without a commitment to a free press and an independent judiciary , these difficulties will only intensify . 
Before too long , Russia &apos;s &quot; managed &quot; ( read : authoritarian ) modernization will also have to allow for the rule of law and a functioning separation of powers , or the country will remain dependent on oil and gas prices and mired in a brutal struggle for power , influence , and money . 
Moreover , neither oil and gas deposits nor imperialist policies will stop Russia &apos;s decline . 
Without functioning democratic institutions , Russia &apos;s second attempt at selective modernization will fail just as certainly as its previous , Soviet incarnation did . 
In the globalized world of the twenty-first century , in which crises in one part of the world spread like wildfire to others , selective modernization , based on suppression of the conflicts and tensions that modernization generates , is likely to be even more dangerous . 
Indeed , while the greatest threats to peace once came from power politics and economic rivalry , they now increasingly derive from the regional and global repercussions of the political and social disintegration of stable countries , a decline of their normative and institutional systems , and new totalitarian ideologies . 
This is why the opposition between so-called &quot; realists &quot; and &quot; idealists &quot; in foreign policy , and between proponents of &quot; hard &quot; and &quot; soft &quot; power , is proving to be a thing of the past . 
To be sure , states are still following traditional interest-oriented policies . 
But such policies will be less and less able to guarantee peace and stability in the future . 
In the twenty-first century , human rights and security will be inextricably intertwined . 
Such is the outcome of globalization , i.e. , the mutual dependence of 6.5 billion people in a single global economy and system of states .
