What Reset Button ? 
MOSCOW - The emergence of a Kremlin leader , President Dmitri Medvedev , without a KGB background , combined with the economic crisis , has inspired talk that when Barack Obama visits Moscow , America &apos;s president will be seeing a country on the verge of a new political thaw , a revived perestroika . 
Russian ( or Soviet ) leaders opt for perestroika or a thaw only when forced to do so by dire conditions that threaten the regime &apos;s survival . 
An atmosphere of mortal fear , mutual suspicion , and hatred among the Communist elite was the catalyst for Nikita Khrushchev &apos;s post-Stalin thaw . 
For Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980 &quot; s , the catalyst for his perestroika was the USSR &apos;s growing economic paralysis . 
For both men , the goal of clinging to power was a top priority . 
Changing the system and easing their grip on power was a risky move that could undermine their authority . 
In the end , having opted for change , both were forced to leave their posts prematurely , against their will . 
As he revived centralized Kremlin control over Russian politics and public affairs , Vladimir Putin has been concerned primarily with minimizing challenges to state power , which he concentrated in his own hands . 
To this end , he stripped the political system of competition , emasculated state institutions , marginalized the opposition , and basically eliminated public participation . 
His power-building project was facilitated by high oil prices , but came at the cost of a steady deterioration in the quality of governance and abandonment of the goal of modernization . 
With policymaking fully nontransparent and reduced to a very closed circle , and implementation delegated to an unaccountable bureaucracy , the inevitable result of Putin &apos;s political model was pervasive corruption . 
The desire to avoid public discontent and ensure social stability led to a suspension of reform . 
Instead of creating incentives that would unleash public energies , the government pushed citizens farther and farther from politics and policymaking , thereby deepening social apathy and atomization . 
Moreover , the opportunity provided by the oil boom was wasted . 
Indeed , today Russia risks lagging even further behind the developed countries . 
Its economy remains undiversified and uncompetitive , and its contribution to global technological progress is minuscule . 
Worse still , economic growth based on exports of natural resources has proved unsustainable . 
When oil prices were high and growing , the government could compensate for poor performance by throwing money at problems . 
Today , with oil prices dramatically reduced , this largesse is no longer available , and economic experts agree that the growth potential of Russia &apos;s petro-economy has been exhausted . 
Despite all this , the situation is not sufficiently dire to push Russia &apos;s leaders to open at least some channels of genuine public participation and yield any of their power . 
The price of oil , at around $ 70 a barrel , may be half of what it was a year ago , but up from around $ 40 earlier this year . 
Nor does the Russian economy &apos;s contraction and the expected deepening of poverty ( the World Bank &apos;s report released in late June was grimmer about Russia than its previous report ) presage an immediate catastrophe . 
So the government will prefer to muddle through the crisis , rather than risk any decisive reform . 
The goal of clinging to power remains the priority , and risk-aversion the main guideline . 
The ruling elite are known to be torn by disputes and rivalries . 
Just recently , two of Putin &apos;s deputies gave interviews to two Western media outlets offering what sounded like starkly opposite visions for Russia &apos;s development . 
But such disputes never spill over into the broad public sphere ; members of the elite are primarily concerned about social and political stability and would not stir the public by seeking support for an alternative policy course . 
These delaying tactics are enabled by a lack of pressure from below . 
Russians may be concerned by growing unemployment and reduced incomes , but this is not manifesting itself in any drive to organize or try to effect political change . 
The public below , just like the leaders above , cherish political stability ; the popularity ratings of both Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitri Medvedev remain above 70 % . 
Disgruntlement over the increasingly authoritarian governance may be common among business circles , elements of the neutered political opposition , liberal intellectuals , and even part of the bureaucracy . 
The current government &apos;s tactic of muddling through without changing the political system or the structure of the economy is fraught with the risk of gradual decline . 
To the Kremlin &apos;s rulers , this may seem an acceptable cost for retaining power , but postponing reform will only aggravate Russia &apos;s countless problems . 
Besides , muddling through may prove unaffordable even in the short run , if oil prices decline again . 
A dramatic curtailment of state resources may eventually push the government toward modernization , but it might also produce an uglier shift - toward harder political crackdown , economic nationalism and an essentially isolationist course .
