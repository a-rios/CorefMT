Stop Paying the Polluters 
BRUSSELS - &quot; When the winds of change blow , &quot; says an old Chinese proverb , &quot; some build walls , and others build wind mills . &quot; 
These same words closed the meeting in March of the Climate Parliament , a forum in Brussels that brought together legislators from around the world who are committed to the fight against climate change . 
Parliamentarians , United Nations representatives , and the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) alike agreed that ending dependency on fossil fuels is one of the most urgent steps needed to combat it effectively . 
The voices from the Climate Parliament join a growing crescendo of influential actors who are speaking out about the need to clean up our energy habits . 
During January &apos;s World Economic Forum in Davos , Lord Nicholas Stern , author of a well-known report outlining the measures that the world should take to avoid runaway climate change , admitted that the planet is on track to warm by four degrees Celsius this century . 
Looking back , Stern said , his report could have been more insistent about the need to take determined action to avoid the catastrophic risks that this level of warming implies . 
Stern &apos;s sentiment was echoed by Christine Lagarde , Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund , who pleaded in favor of stronger climate action to prevent future generations being &quot; roasted , toasted , fried , and grilled . &quot; 
And World Bank President Jim Yong Kim announced that his institution would prioritize the fight against climate change and focus on promoting , among other measures , the elimination of subsidies doled out to the fossil-fuel industry . 
With this pledge , the World Bank joined an expanding list of international bodies , including the UN , the IMF , and the OECD , that are calling for an end to such subsidies . 
Globally , we are on track to reach an international climate deal . 
Harnessing the existing broad consensus against fossil-fuel subsidies is possible even in the absence of a legal agreement , and could quickly have a significant positive impact . 
According to the IEA , fossil-fuel subsidies rose by almost 30 % , to $ 523 billion , in 2011 . 
Meanwhile , the UN Environment Program reports that global investment in renewable energy totaled only $ 257 billion in 2011 . 
In other words , we are doing exactly the opposite of what we should be doing . 
Support for energy efficiency and renewable energy sources is lagging , while governments around the world spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing an incipient catastrophe . 
This must change . 
As European Commissioner for Climate Action , I am particularly keen to see three international financial institutions - the European Investment Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , and the World Bank - join with their EU and OECD partners to take a lead role in eliminating public support for fossil fuels . 
Together , these three institutions lend more than â‚¬ 130 billion ( $ 168 billion ) annually for projects in Europe and beyond , and maintain a strong advisory role in beneficiary countries . 
This year provides an especially important opportunity to use this potential for action . 
All three institutions have announced reviews of their lending policies for the energy sector . 
The outcome will underpin their lending over the next 4-6 years , and send a strong political and financial signal about worldwide commitment to addressing climate change . 
Four to six years is also the interval over which climate scientists predict that greenhouse-gas emissions must peak and start to be reduced if the world is to have any hope for a decent future . 
Multilateral lenders can lead by example by restricting conditions for public financing of coal , the most damaging fossil fuel , and by pressing for greater transparency in reporting on emissions . 
Encouraging investments in renewable energy and increased energy efficiency will have the added benefit of boosting long-term self-reliance and resilience against the volatility of fossil fuel prices . 
More broadly , international financial institutions should guide public and private investments alike away from a short-term logic . 
Supported by a stable , long-term climate-policy framework , public financing can drive the decarbonization of our energy system and our economies . 
Instead of offering unsustainable and environmentally damaging subsidies for fossil fuels , public finance should encourage the development of new industries and businesses that are emerging in the course of the low-carbon transition . 
The industries of the future , which will create jobs that last , are those that will use scarce resources efficiently , and that can pay the real environmental and health costs of the resources that they use .
