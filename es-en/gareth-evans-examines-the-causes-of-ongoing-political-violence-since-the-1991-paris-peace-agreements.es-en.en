Cambodia &apos;s Violent Peace 
CANBERRA - Cambodia &apos;s government has been getting away with murder . 
Not the kind of genocidal slaughter conducted by the Khmer Rouge in the 1970 &quot; s . 
On January 3 , five striking garment workers were shot dead in Phnom Penh while peacefully demanding a minimum livable wage . 
Many others were severely injured by gunfire and beatings . 
More than 20 have been detained without trial . 
This followed deadly violence against unarmed demonstrators protesting last year &apos;s deeply flawed national election , won , yet again , by Prime Minister Hun Sen &apos;s ruling Cambodian People &apos;s Party , which has dominated political life for more than three decades . 
The recent killings repeat a pattern of political violence that has recurred all too often at crucial moments in Cambodia &apos;s history - even after the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements , which were intended to bring not only peace , but also democracy and human-rights protection to the country &apos;s long-suffering people . 
No country in the world deserved all three more , ravaged as it was for two decades by massive United States bombing , civil war , a genocidal reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge , invasion by Vietnam , and more civil war - with some two million dead as a result . 
Hopes were high that Cambodia had been set on a transformative path by the success of the United Nations peace plan , the huge peacekeeping operation that followed , and the remarkably peaceful election of 1993 ( in all of which Australia played a leading role during my time as Foreign Minister ) . 
In some respects , those hopes have been realized . 
The Khmer Rouge did wither away , and with it the lingering threat of renewed civil war . 
The Cambodian economy - strongly supported in recent years by aid and investment from China - has grown steadily ( though it lags behind most of its regional neighbors , and concerns about corruption and political instability are preventing it from reaching its full potential ) . 
But Cambodia &apos;s record on democracy and human rights since the Paris Peace Agreements has not been a good one . 
A grenade attack on an opposition rally led by Sam Rainsy in March 1997 killed 16 people and injured more than a hundred . 
That July , after an uneasy period of sharing power with Prince Norodom Ranariddh &apos;s royalist party , Hun Sen launched a bloody coup in which his opponents were exiled , arrested , tortured , and in some cases summarily executed . 
Neither episode generated much international reaction : Hun Sen still had enough political capital from his fight against the Khmer Rouge and his cooperative role in the peace process , while Sam Rainsy was regarded as deeply flawed , and the royalist leadership as feckless . 
Cambodia-fatigue among policymakers also played a role . 
At the time , I wanted to believe that these reverses would be temporary , and there were too many like me . 
Since then , while preserving a democratic fa√ßade , Hun Sen has ruled , for all practical purposes , as an autocrat , showing scant regard for rights of free expression and association - and resorting to violent repression whenever he has deemed it necessary to preserve his and his party &apos;s position . 
This has been accompanied by staggering levels of corruption , with Cambodia ranked 160th by Transparency International , out of 175 countries . 
There are stories , unverifiable but plausible , that 20 or more of Hun Sen &apos;s closest associates have each amassed more than $ 1 billion through misappropriation of state assets , illegal economic activity , and favoritism in state procurement and contracting . 
There has also been political patronage bordering on parody , with one recent count putting the government &apos;s size at 244 ministers and secretaries of state . 
For far too long , Hun Sen and his colleagues have been getting away with violence , human-rights abuses , corruption , and media and electoral manipulation without serious internal or external challenge . 
A credible new opposition party - the Cambodia National Rescue Party - has emerged under Sam Rainsy ( who looks a little more like a national leader now than just a monochromatic anti-Vietnamese crusader ) , gaining significant popular support . 
A large number of social-media-savvy young voters have been turning out in the streets demanding a change of government . 
Internationally , too , some pressure has been building , but not enough . 
Ed Royce , Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee , has called on Hun Sen to resign ; condemnatory resolutions have been passed in a number of parliaments ; and many states entered criticisms of one kind or another into the record when the UN Human Rights Council reviewed Cambodia &apos;s human-rights record in Geneva a few weeks ago . 
But the tone of too many of these statements has been muted . 
Australia &apos;s statements have been typical - falling over backward to avoid giving offense , and too anxious to balance criticism with praise . 
Officials are &quot; concerned &quot; about &quot; recent disproportionate violence against protesters &quot; but &quot; welcome the Government &apos;s stated commitment to undertake electoral reforms . &quot; 
Australia &apos;s new foreign minister , Julie Bishop , has talked , as foreign ministers often do , of the need to avoid unproductive &quot; megaphone diplomacy &quot; and to &quot; engage , not enrage &quot; her counterparts . 
There is a place for quiet diplomacy that relies on genuine engagement to encourage significant behavioral change . 
I know Hun Sen and worked well with him in the past . 
I have resisted strong public criticism until now , because I thought there was hope for both him and his government . 
It is time for Cambodia &apos;s political leaders to be named , shamed , investigated , and sanctioned by the international community .
