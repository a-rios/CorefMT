Ukraine &apos;s Path Not Taken 
BRUSSELS - Sometimes history can be too ironic . 
This week , as Ukraine marked the 80th anniversary of the Holodomor , Stalin &apos;s engineered famine in Ukraine , President Viktor Yanukovych &apos;s government announced that it would not sign a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Union at a summit in Vilnius on November 28 . 
Just like that , Ukraine &apos;s chance to transcend its tortured history appears to have been thrown away . 
The ostensible issue that forced Yanukovych to balk was the EU &apos;s demand that former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , now serving a seven-year prison sentence , be permitted to travel to Germany for medical treatment . 
Though the European Court of Human Rights has ruled her imprisonment politically motivated , Yanukovych - whose power to pardon is absolute - has refused to countenance her release , desiring above all to prevent her candidacy in the Ukrainian presidential election due in 2015 . 
Perhaps Yanukovych &apos;s retreat from Europe should have been foreseen , given behavior - like locking up his political opponents - that has been difficult to reconcile with European values and democratic norms . 
But it was his recent series of secret meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin that sealed the fate of the agreement with the EU . 
Former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski once observed that in Russian eyes , Russia without Ukraine was a normal nation-state , but Russia with Ukraine was an empire . 
But Russians who believe that Yanukovych &apos;s retreat from Europe represents a great victory should think again . 
Just as Putin &apos;s gross mismanagement of the economy has led even the economics minister to predict stagnation for the rest of this decade , his geopolitical nostalgia is poised to saddle Russians with the same dysfunctional empire that impoverished them under the Soviets . 
Worse still , it seems that only the same system - in which siloviki ( secret policemen ) are in charge - appears capable of holding together such a ramshackle economic empire . 
Putin can preen , but the fact remains that Ukraine &apos;s economy is in far worse shape than Russia &apos;s . 
A demographically declining empire of crony capitalists , from which the most talented and educated flee - some 300,000 left Russia last year alone - is hardly likely to be a serious strategic challenger to either the United States or China . 
On the contrary , China covets much of eastern Russia , lands taken from it during its years of &quot; humiliation &quot; in the nineteenth century . 
Having recently traveled to Armenia , Georgia , and Ukraine , I saw firsthand the splits in the political class and in public opinion concerning whether these countries should hitch their economies and security to Europe and the US , or submit to Russia through membership in its Eurasian Economic Community ( EurAsEC ) . 
The Russian system vaguely resembles Imperial Japan &apos;s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in both its rhetoric and its aim of subordinating neighbors . 
Armenia was the first ex-Soviet state to succumb to Putin &apos;s pressure and shun the EU Eastern Partnership . 
After four years of negotiations , Putin warned President Serzh Sargsyan that the price of Russian gas would be doubled , Russian security guarantees would be withdrawn ( Armenia is locked in a bitter dispute with oil-rich Azerbaijan ) , and the large Armenian diaspora in Russia would no longer be as welcome to work and live in the country as before . 
Similar attempts to bully Georgia were made , and former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili talked about joining Putin &apos;s customs union . 
But , following the overwhelming defeat of the overtly pro-Russia candidate Nino Burjanadze in the recent presidential election , the ruling Georgian Dream party decided to stay the Euro-Atlantic course , particularly as Georgia &apos;s Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions remain under Russian occupation . 
( Russia has also tried heavy-handed tactics on Moldova by threatening to ban the country &apos;s wine exports to Russia and to recognize the independence of the breakaway territory of Transnistria . ) 
The West can diminish the force of Russian bullying by assuring ex-Soviet countries that the Eastern Partnership is not dead , and that something short of the envisioned free-trade areas will emerge . 
The EU can also continue to work for greater access to visas and , eventually , full visa-free travel . 
It can remain engaged on cooperation agreements affecting aviation , trade , academic exchanges , transport , infrastructure , tourism , and agriculture and rural development . 
Moreover , it can provide renewed help for democratic institution-building : assisting judicial reform , raising anti-corruption awareness , and encouraging prosecution of even high-ranking offenders , as well as supporting engagement by civil-society groups . 
Perhaps most critically , countries such as Austria , where members of the Yanukovych clique have created obscure companies to hide their ill-gotten assets , can stop turning a blind eye to the plundering of countries like Ukraine . 
Unfortunately , in an era of budgetary austerity and lingering eurozone fragility , EU member states were unable to neutralize Russia &apos;s economic threats against Ukraine , particularly the loss of the Russian market . 
Perhaps a more radical solution to Russian bullying might have been to match Russia &apos;s recent arbitrary ban on Ukrainian chocolate exports with a ban on Russian vodka exports to the EU . 
In the end , it may be the oligarchs who have bankrolled Yanukovych &apos;s career - particularly Rinat Akhmetov , Ukraine &apos;s richest man - who will make the ultimate decision about Ukraine &apos;s fate . 
As Ukraine &apos;s European prospects diminish , the economy - and thus the oligarchs &quot; fortunes - will be exposed to the Russian siloviki &apos;s untender mercies . 
Perhaps once Akhmetov and his ilk comprehend the long-term risks to their businesses and wealth , they will induce MPs that are beholden to them to switch sides and unite with pro-EU forces to restore Ukraine &apos;s European future .
