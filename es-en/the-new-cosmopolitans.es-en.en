The New Cosmopolitans 
As globalization proceeds , with the help of ever-faster communications , faster travel , and more powerful multinational corporations , a new , cosmopolitan social class seems to be emerging . 
These citizens of the world are developing loyalties to each other that cross national boundaries . 
I was at a dinner the other night with Yale World Fellows , a carefully selected group of professionals , representing every major country of the world , who spend a semester here . 
It was an unusual experience , because I began to feel that none of these people were really foreign to me . 
It seemed they were probably easier to talk to than the local Americans who were waiting on us as and serving food . 
Of course , a cosmopolitan class is hardly new . 
In fact , 50 years ago , in his classic book Social Theory and Social Structure , the late sociologist Robert K. Merton described the results of a case study of influential people in a typical American town , Rovere , New Jersey . 
As a sociologist , he chose this tiny town to study how people relate to each other and influence each other , just as biologists study tiny worms with only a few hundred cells so that they can study how each cell relates to an organism as a whole . 
Merton discovered a strong pattern . 
Rovere &apos;s influential people seemed to be sharply divided into &quot; cosmopolitan influentials , &quot; who habitually orient themselves with respect to the world at large , and &quot; local influentials , &quot; who orient themselves with respect to their own town . 
As he and his assistants interviewed people , the division between the two groups became more intriguing , and significant , in his mind . 
Merton did not say that the cosmopolitan influentials were influential outside Rovere - apparently none of them was . 
What stood out instead was their habitual frame of reference , which was tied to their personal identities . 
When Merton engaged people in conversation , any topic would remind the cosmopolitan influentials of the world at large , while local influentials were reminded of things in their own town . 
Cosmopolitan influentials , Merton said , tended to hang their success on their general knowledge , whereas locals relied on their friendships and connections . 
The cosmopolitan influentials were often uninterested in meeting new people in town ; the locals wanted to know everyone . 
The cosmopolitan influentials tended to take positions in local government that reflected their broad expertise : board of health , housing committee , or board of education . 
The local influentials tend to be in positions that they got through their local popularity : street commissioner , mayor , or township board member . 
The cosmopolitan influential in the town is like the medical specialist ; the local influential is like the family doctor . 
Merton concluded : &quot; It appears that the cosmopolitan influential has a following because he knows , the local influential because he understands . &quot; 
The local influentials , Merton discovered , spoke affectionately of their town , as if it were a unique and special place , and often said they would never leave . 
The cosmopolitans spoke as if they might leave any day . 
What was true in Merton &apos;s day is becoming even more starkly true in today &apos;s globalized economy . 
What I find particularly striking is the sense of loyalty developing among cosmopolitans . 
After the World Fellows Dinner , the Fellow from Namibia was extolling to me , in impeccable and relaxed English , the beautiful vacation homes I might find ( and even buy ) there . 
I felt as if I could perhaps fall into a relationship with him that might work against the interests of the locals in Namibia . 
I could picture doing that , and he and I would be natural allies , if I let it happen . 
I was left wondering why this is happening on such a scale now . 
Obviously , improved communications technology plays a role . 
But how much does that explain the impression that the division between cosmopolitans and locals is so much wider now ? 
One must realize that individuals choose whether to play the role of cosmopolitan or local , and how much to invest in that role . 
People make a conscious choice to become either cosmopolitans or locals , depending on their own personal talents and the perceived returns from making the choice . 
In the twenty-first century , the new information age creates opportunities not just to be cosmopolitan in spirit and orientation , but to forge strong connections with other cosmopolitans . 
The cosmopolitans have shared experiences : they are directly communicating with each other across the globe . 
Many cosmopolitans around the world now also share the English language , the new lingua franca . 
The term &quot; global village &quot; was first popularized in the late 1960 &quot; s by Canadian communications maven Marshall McLuhan in response to the already powerful communications media of that day . 
But McLuhan could not have anticipated the cosmopolitan class , because he could not have anticipated the immense development of direct interpersonal communications media that allow cosmopolitans around the world to form friendships . 
The cosmopolitans tend to be increasingly wealthy , and their wealth helps mark them as cosmopolitan . 
Thus , economic inequality is felt differently in today &apos;s world . 
Perhaps it is accepted resignedly , as the cosmopolitan class is too amorphous and ill-defined to be the target of any social movement . 
There is no spokesperson for the cosmopolitan class , no organization that could be blamed for what is happening . 
I fear for the future . 
How will the cosmopolitan class behave as their role in the world economy continues to strengthen ? 
How unfeeling will they come to be about the people who share their neighborhoods ? 
Most importantly , if resentment by the locals emerges , what political consequences will result ?
