Has Iran Changed ? 
RIYADH - As 2014 begins , there is no more important question in world diplomacy than this : Has Iran changed ? 
Since his election in June , Iran &apos;s new president , Hassan Rouhani , has signaled a more moderate stance in his country &apos;s international relations . 
But caution is in order - now and in the years ahead . 
The world &apos;s second-largest oil producer , and self-proclaimed leader of Shia Islam and anti-Western Muslim revolutionaries everywhere , remains a danger not just to Saudi Arabia but also to peace and stability in the Middle East and beyond . 
Saudi Arabia has two large concerns about the Islamic Republic : its quest for nuclear weapons and its interference in its neighbors &quot; affairs . 
For starters , Iran &apos;s efforts to develop nuclear weapons pose a huge danger , and , if left unchecked , are likely to trigger a wave of proliferation across the Middle East . 
Faced with a nuclear-armed Iran , the Gulf Cooperation Council members , for example , will be forced to weigh their options carefully - and possibly to acquire a nuclear deterrent of their own . 
While all countries have the right to develop a civilian nuclear program - we Saudis have our own - Iran &apos;s attempt to pursue nuclear weapons has brought nothing but hardship to the country . 
Unfortunately , the international community &apos;s increasingly severe economic sanctions have so far failed to deter its leaders &quot; ambitions . 
If Rouhani proves unwilling or unable to engineer a change of course , what else might be done ? 
A unilateral military strike would carry potentially dire consequences . 
Alas , given US President Barack Obama &apos;s lamentable handling of the crisis in Syria , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu may conclude that he has no option but to go it alone . 
Indeed , Iranian hardliners may welcome an Israeli strike , and even seek to provoke it , as a means of rallying the Iranian population behind them . 
There is a better way to prevent the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the region : a &quot; WMD-free zone , &quot; built on a system of incentives that include economic and technical support for countries that join , as well as security guarantees from the United Nations Security Council &apos;s permanent members . 
The zone should also enforce economic and political sanctions on states that choose to remain outside , and - again , supported by the Security Council &apos;s permanent members - impose military sanctions on those that try to develop WMDs . 
Iran &apos;s acquisition of nuclear weapons would only heighten Saudi Arabia &apos;s second major concern : the Iranian government &apos;s policy of destabilizing its neighbors . 
Iran has been using such tactics since 1979 , when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power and began exporting his Islamist revolution across the Muslim world . 
The regime has specifically targeted countries with Shia majorities , such as Iraq and Bahrain , and those with significant Shia minorities , such as Kuwait , Lebanon , and Yemen . 
Iran also occupies three Emirati islands in the Gulf ( a policy that it refuses to discuss ) and has in effect launched an invasion of Syria . 
The irony is that Iran is the first to assert the principle of non-intervention when it suspects other countries of meddling in its internal affairs . 
It should practice what it preaches . 
Iran has no right to meddle in other countries , least of all Arab states . 
The impact of this policy has been devastating . 
In the aftermath of the US-led invasion , Iraq , a country of highly capable and diverse people that could one day return to its pivotal role in the Arab community , has become a playground for Iranian influence . 
Too many Iraqis are now completely beholden to the Islamic Republic . 
We know , for example , that a certain Iranian general was negotiating on behalf of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for the support of Shia and Kurdish groups . 
This influence bodes ill for Iraq &apos;s future as an ethnically and religiously diverse country , and it cannot be allowed to continue . 
Indeed , it is one reason why Saudi Arabia maintains an equal distance from all Iraqi factions , and why we are the only country not to have sent a permanent ambassador . 
Iran &apos;s influence in Bahrain , our closest neighbor , is similarly destructive . 
Hezbollah in Bahrain , created by Khomeini , has long been a source of Iranian propaganda in broadcasts beamed at the country . 
Indeed , Iranian officials often declare that Bahrain is a province of Iran . 
Saudi Arabia has supported peaceful negotiations with street protesters in Bahrain , and has provided the country with considerable economic aid to improve life there , but we will never accept an Iranian takeover . 
The picture is even worse in Syria , where , from the outset of the country &apos;s civil war , Iranian support for President Bashar al-Assad has amounted to a criminal act for which Iran &apos;s leaders should be tried at the International Criminal Court . 
And Syria &apos;s western neighbor , Lebanon , is increasingly coming under Iran &apos;s sway , as the Iranian-backed Hezbollah there pushes the country to the brink of another civil war . 
The main question now is whether Rouhani can be trusted . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s King Abdullah welcomed Rouhani &apos;s election and wished him well , in the hope that this might allow him to escape the clutches of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei &apos;s extremist entourage and the Revolutionary Guard . 
But the forces of darkness in Iran are well entrenched . 
The legacy of Khomeini &apos;s expansionist ambitions is as powerful as ever . 
Even if Rouhani &apos;s intentions are genuine , his efforts , like those of two previous would-be reformers , Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , may be thwarted by the hardline ideology that continues to dominate in Tehran . 
We are prepared for either eventuality .
