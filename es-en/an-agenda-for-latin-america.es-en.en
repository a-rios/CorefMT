An Agenda for Latin America 
During the last three years , Latin America has experienced an economic boom without precedent . 
Growth has been strong , inflation is under control , and international reserves have increased steadily . 
The 2004-2006 period has been the best three years for Latin America &apos;s economies since the early 1960 &quot; s . 
This bonanza has largely been the result of an extraordinarily positive international environment . 
Commodity export prices are at record levels , global liquidity has been ample , and international interest rates have been low . 
Yet , despite this good news , the continent &apos;s politics have turned upside down , calling into question whether economic success can be sustained . 
An increasing number of Latin American countries have elected left-wing presidents who criticize market reforms and globalization . 
Colombia recently bucked this trend , and it now appears that the leftist candidate in Mexico &apos;s presidential election , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , was narrowly defeated . 
But voters have catapulted left-wing politicians to power in Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Costa Rica , Ecuador , Peru , Venezuela , and Uruguay , while López retains the ability - and perhaps the will - to mobilize his supporters . 
The main concern is that left-wing politicians will implement populist policies that will generate large fiscal deficits , high inflation , and , eventually , currency collapses . 
External crises have a long history in the region . 
Since the 1970 &quot; s , Latin American countries have experienced , on average , 1.6 balance of payments crises per decade ; some of the better known include the Mexican crisis of 1994-95 , the Brazilian crisis of 1999 , and the Argentine crisis of 2001-2002 . 
The economic consequences of these crises have been gigantic . 
On average , each of them cost the Latin American countries 12 % of GDP . 
However , concern about populist policies is not fully justified . 
The current crop of left-wing political leaders is different from the populist &quot; 
Moreover , in recent years , Latin American economies have gone through important economic transformations that have increased their resilience . 
Chief among these changes has been the adoption , in most countries , of flexible exchange rates and reduction of external debt , particularly government debt . 
These structural changes have put most Latin American economies on a sound footing , reducing their vulnerability to external shocks , such as deceleration in world economic growth , higher international interest rates , and lower commodity prices . 
But greater macroeconomic stability does not mean that everything is fine . 
The main weakness of Latin America &apos;s economies is that they will be unable to generate the type of rapid and sustained growth required to create jobs and reduce inequality and poverty . 
Generating the rapid long-term economic growth that Latin American countries need requires that they fulfill three conditions . 
First , they must accumulate capital , which implies a high savings rate that will help pay for new machines , equipment , and infrastructure . 
Second , they need to use their workforces efficiently , which requires modern labor legislation that encourages employment of women , the young , and senior citizens . 
Finally , they need to attain a rapid rate of productivity growth , which can be achieved only by ensuring a high-quality , broadly accessible educational system . 
The vast majority of Latin America countries do not fulfill any of these requirements . 
At 19 % of GDP , national savings rates are very low - indeed , much lower than in Asia - and labor legislation is antiquated , discouraging efficient use of human capital , while productivity growth is meager . 
Indeed , students from Latin American countries consistently score at the very bottom of international achievement tests such as the Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) and the Third International Math and Science Survey ( TIMSS ) . 
The main challenge for Latin America &apos;s new leaders , whether of the left or the right , is to implement reforms that will accelerate growth . 
The continent needs measures that are designed to encourage savings and investment , improve labor utilization , and upgrade failed educational systems . 
Only if growth is significantly faster over the long run will living standards for the vast majority of the region &apos;s voters begin to rise .
