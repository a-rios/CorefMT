China &apos;s AIDS Crisis 
It is rare for a foreign doctor to get to China &apos;s rural areas , where its AIDS epidemic was born and takes a horrible toll . 
But recently , two nurses and I ventured into a poor farming area , Nizui in Hubei Province , as part of a Medecins Sans Fronti√®res ( MSF ) team to visit the Liu family and evaluate their 7-month-old baby . 
The child was the size of a two month old , but his eyes held the gaze of an 80-year-old man long acquainted with extreme suffering . 
The baby was dying of AIDS . 
The Liu family is one of thousands of poor farming families in China &apos;s interior who contracted HIV through contaminated blood donations during the 1990 &quot; s , when under-regulated for-profit blood banking companies reused needles and transferred blood from infected donors to clean donors after extracting the plasma . 
The Chinese Health Ministry recently put the total number of HIV / AIDS cases at 840,000 , although most experts believe that the true number is much higher . 
Some believe that by 2010 , the number of infected Chinese may reach 10 million . 
After years of taking a passive , low-profile approach to the epidemic , health officials have stepped up their anti-HIV campaign . 
Since 80 % of HIV / AIDS patients reside in the countryside , greater access to health care in these areas has become a priority . 
This past July , during the highly publicized 15th International AIDS Conference in Bangkok , Premier Wen Jiabao declared all-out war against the burgeoning epidemic . 
Earlier this year , the government promised blood-products screening , free voluntary HIV testing , and free medicine for the poor . 
This new anti-HIV / AIDS campaign , which the international community has lauded , is more open and proactive than before . 
But it must still operate in the context of a closed society , where government control over the media limits the flow of information necessary to deal with any public health epidemic . 
Moreover , it is unclear how care will be delivered to the rural front lines , where the old system of clinics based in Peoples &quot; Communes collapsed with the de-collectivization of agriculture . 
To be effective , clinics in areas where HIV / AIDS is prevalent must provide patients with the same standard of care that is offered for other health conditions . 
Unfortunately , the door to such access remains largely closed , partly because China was initially reluctant to allow overseas groups into their hinterlands to assist . 
Nonetheless , local and foreign NGO &apos;s are now starting to play a role in filling the gap between government policies and front-line healthcare delivery . 
In May 2003 , MSF was authorized to set up an HIV / AIDS clinic in Xiangfan , Hubei Province . 
On my recent visit , I met Mr. Du , a thin-framed , HIV-positive farmer who lost his wife to AIDS last year and was desperate to prevent his infected 7-year-old son from meeting the same fate . 
He had been taking the boy all over China by train , bus , and truck in search of help . 
Last month alone , they visited five large cities without success . 
The chance that Mr. Du , and those like him , will find help in China is slim ; at present , most clinics and hospitals are not adequately prepared to treat HIV-infected patients . 
Treatment is extremely limited where it is available . 
For example , Xiangfan &apos;s Infectious Diseases Hospital is the prefecture &apos;s only health facility where HIV / AIDS patients can be admitted . 
On paper , the hospital appears well staffed and adequately equipped , but on my rounds there , I found the halls and wards deserted and barren . 
Few therapeutic and diagnostic options were available . 
Even a basic test like a CAT scan would require transport to another regional hospital . 
But under-equipped hospitals may not be the greatest obstacle to controlling China &apos;s AIDS crisis . 
Equally harmful are the government &apos;s sensitivity to its own policy failures and the stigma attached to a disease that is often sexually transmitted . 
Indeed , information is so limited and the stigma so strong that ordinary people - and sometimes medical personnel - often ostracize AIDS patients . 
Patients who do receive care are often treated with substandard , even harmful , medicine . 
According to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations , patients in China can have a 40-50 % chance of being sold fake over-the-counter remedies and an even higher chance of being sold fake prescription drugs . 
Some of these counterfeit products contain toxic ingredients . 
Foreign NGOs such as MSF insist on using medications that are up to World Health Organization standards , but the Chinese government insists that such restrictive measures are excessive . 
Although MSF uses its own drug supply , Chinese patients still often buy medicine with unknown ingredients and efficacy on the street . 
Safety regulations must , at a minimum , be applied to the prescription of the anti-retroviral medications that fight HIV , because such drugs are extremely sensitive to dosage changes and interactions with other medicines . 
Improper use of these medicines fosters HIV resistance and provides little therapeutic value for patients . 
There is no quick-fix solution to ending China &apos;s AIDS crisis . 
Officials there must focus not only on developing a pragmatic , realistic healthcare infrastructure in rural areas , but also on bringing about greater openness in China &apos;s media in order to spread life-saving public information . 
Like all epidemics , HIV / AIDS in China is a public health crisis that can only be solved with the mass dissemination of accurate information . 
Transforming promises and policies into patient rights , awareness , and effective health care will undoubtedly take time , especially for a country as massive and lacking in transparency as China . 
For the hundreds of thousands of HIV sufferers , this is likely to be more time than they have left .
