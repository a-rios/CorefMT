A Special Moment for Special Drawing Rights 
NEW YORK - The recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Lima , Peru , were dominated by talk of the weakness of several emerging and developing economies . 
Much more will be said next month at the IMF board , though what the Fund will do remains an open question . 
The problem that emerging and developing economies are facing stems from the fact that their capital inflows follow a strongly pro-cyclical pattern . 
When they were growing rapidly - especially compared to the advanced economies - they attracted massive amounts of capital . 
After all , the US is set to raise interest rates , and the dollar has appreciated against virtually all of the world &apos;s currencies . In the past , this pattern has always ultimately led to a correction , with America &apos;s growing current-account deficit eventually bringing about a dollar depreciation . 
But such corrections - in 1979-1980 , 1990-1991 , and 2007-2008 - have also always been associated with a global slowdown or crisis . 
This highlights the problem inherent in using the US dollar , a national currency , as the global economy &apos;s primary international-reserve currency . 
The Belgian economist Robert Triffin first identified this problem - dubbed the &quot; Triffin dilemma &quot; - in the 1960s , emphasizing the fundamental conflict between national objectives , such as limiting the size of the external deficit , and international imperatives , such as creating enough liquidity to satisfy demand for reserve assets . 
Moreover , this system subjects the world economy to cycles of confidence in the US dollar , while placing the world economy at the mercy of a national authority - one that often makes decisions with scant regard for their international implications . 
This was the idea behind John Maynard Keynes &apos;s proposal in the 1940s to create a supranational currency , called the &quot; bancor . &quot; 
And it was the motivation behind the 1969 creation of the IMF &apos;s Special Drawing Right ( SDR ) , which was supposed to become &quot; the principle reserve asset in the international monetary system . &quot; 
General SDR allocations are to be based on &quot; a long-term global need to supplement existing reserve assets , &quot; with decisions made for successive periods of up to five years . 
So far , such allocations have been made only three times , in 1970-72 , in 1979-81 , and in 2009 , with the latter allocation , amounting to $ 250 billion , being part of the recovery package adopted by the G-20 to manage the global financial crisis . 
The SDR has been in the news again lately , owing to debate about whether the IMF should add the Chinese renminbi to the basket of currencies that determine the unit &apos;s value . 
Given the renminbi &apos;s growing international role , it seems abundantly obvious that the currency should be part of the SDR basket . 
Now , the discussion should focus on how to enable the SDR to reach its potential as an instrument of international cooperation . 
The first step toward making SDRs a more active force in global finance would be to remove the division between SDR accounts and normal IMF operations . 
As long as that partition remains in place , SDRs will function , at best , like a credit line that can be used unconditionally by the holder - a kind of overdraft facility , not a true reserve asset . 
A better approach would be to allow countries to &quot; deposit &quot; unused SDRs in the Fund , so that they can be used to finance IMF lending operations . 
In other words , issuing more SDRs would enable the IMF to finance more lending . 
If those SDRs were issued during crises , like the one that emerging and developing economies are confronting today , the result would be a truly counter-cyclical global monetary policy . 
This could even be taken one step further , with SDRs being allocated according to a new formula that accounts not just for IMF quotas , but also for demand ( or need ) for foreign-exchange reserves . 
The current formula would have the countries most in need of foreign reserves - that is , middle- and low-income countries ( excluding China ) - receiving just over one-third of the total allocation . 
That is not enough . 
Even without this change , the SDR can and should gain a more prominent position in global reserves . 
Some five decades after Triffin first identified the problems with the US dollar &apos;s reserve-currency status , the SDR &apos;s moment has , one hopes , finally arrived .
