Asia &apos;s Democratic Security Diamond 
TOKYO - In the summer of 2007 , addressing the Central Hall of the Indian Parliament as Japan &apos;s prime minister , I spoke of the &quot; Confluence of the Two Seas &quot; - a phrase that I drew from the title of a book written by the Mughal prince Dara Shikoh in 1655 - to the applause and stomping approval of the assembled lawmakers . 
In the five years since then , I have become even more strongly convinced that what I said was correct . 
Peace , stability , and freedom of navigation in the Pacific Ocean are inseparable from peace , stability , and freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean . 
Developments affecting each are more closely connected than ever . 
Japan , as one of the oldest sea-faring democracies in Asia , should play a greater role in preserving the common good in both regions . 
Yet , increasingly , the South China Sea seems set to become a &quot; Lake Beijing , &quot; which analysts say will be to China what the Sea of Okhotsk was to Soviet Russia : a sea deep enough for the People &apos;s Liberation Army &apos;s navy to base their nuclear-powered attack submarines , capable of launching missiles with nuclear warheads . 
Soon , the PLA Navy &apos;s newly built aircraft carrier will be a common sight - more than sufficient to scare China &apos;s neighbors . 
That is why Japan must not yield to the Chinese government &apos;s daily exercises in coercion around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea . 
True , only Chinese law-enforcement vessels with light weaponry , not PLA Navy ships , have entered Japan &apos;s contiguous and territorial waters . 
But this &quot; gentler &quot; touch should fool no one . 
By making these boats &quot; presence appear ordinary , China seeks to establish its jurisdiction in the waters surrounding the islands as a fait accompli . 
If Japan were to yield , the South China Sea would become even more fortified . 
The naval assets of the United States , in addition to those of Japan , would find it difficult to enter the entire area , though the majority of the two China seas is international water . 
Anxious that such a development could arise , I spoke in India of the need for the Indian and Japanese governments to join together to shoulder more responsibility as guardians of navigational freedom across the Pacific and Indian oceans . 
I must confess that I failed to anticipate that China &apos;s naval and territorial expansion would advance at the pace that it has since 2007 . 
The ongoing disputes in the East China Sea and the South China Sea mean that Japan &apos;s top foreign-policy priority must be to expand the country &apos;s strategic horizons . 
Japan is a mature maritime democracy , and its choice of close partners should reflect that fact . 
I envisage a strategy whereby Australia , India , Japan , and the US state of Hawaii form a diamond to safeguard the maritime commons stretching from the Indian Ocean region to the western Pacific . 
I am prepared to invest , to the greatest possible extent , Japan &apos;s capabilities in this security diamond . 
My opponents in the Democratic Party of Japan deserve credit for continuing along the path that I laid out in 2007 ; that is to say , they have sought to strengthen ties with Australia and India . 
Of the two countries , India - a resident power in East Asia , with the Andaman and Nicobar Islands sitting at the western end of the Strait of Malacca ( through which some 40 % of world trade passes ) - deserves greater emphasis . 
Japan is now engaged in regular bilateral service-to-service military dialogues with India , and has embarked on official trilateral talks that include the US . 
And India &apos;s government has shown its political savvy by forging an agreement to provide Japan with rare earth minerals - a vital component in many manufacturing processes - after China chose to use its supplies of rare earths as a diplomatic stick . 
I would also invite Britain and France to stage a comeback in terms of participating in strengthening Asia &apos;s security . 
The sea-faring democracies in Japan &apos;s part of the world would be much better off with their renewed presence . 
The United Kingdom still finds value in the Five Power Defense Arrangements with Malaysia , Singapore , Australia , and New Zealand . 
I want Japan to join this group , gather annually for talks with its members , and participate with them in small-sized military drills . 
Meanwhile , France &apos;s Pacific Fleet in Tahiti operates on a minimal budget but could well punch above its weight . 
That said , nothing is more important for Japan than to reinvest in its alliance with the US . 
In a period of American strategic rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region , the US needs Japan as much as Japan needs the US . 
Immediately after Japan &apos;s earthquake , tsunami , and nuclear disaster in 2011 , the US military provided for Japan the largest peacetime humanitarian relief operation ever mounted - powerful evidence that the 60-year bond that the treaty allies have nurtured is real . 
Deprived of its time-honored ties with America , Japan could play only a reduced regional and global role . 
I , for one , admit that Japan &apos;s relationship with its biggest neighbor , China , is vital to the well-being of many Japanese . 
Yet , to improve Sino-Japanese relations , Japan must first anchor its ties on the other side of the Pacific ; for , at the end of the day , Japan &apos;s diplomacy must always be rooted in democracy , the rule of law , and respect for human rights . 
I firmly believe that , in 2013 and beyond , the Asia-Pacific region &apos;s future prosperity should rest on them as well .
