Ethiopia &apos;s Struggle for Democracy 
When we in Ethiopia &apos;s political opposition agreed to participate in the election that the government called in June , we were under no illusion that the process would be faultless . 
After all , Ethiopia has never known democracy . 
The dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam was Africa &apos;s most blood-curdling Marxist regime , and was replaced by today &apos;s ruling EPRDF , whose &quot; Revolutionary Democracy &quot; is but a more subtle variation on the same theme . 
So we knew that there would be problems with the election , that voting would not be clean in the way Western countries take for granted . 
Many Ethiopians appear to have agreed with this strategy . 
The government did make some media available and engaged in more than 10 live televised debates . 
So , at least at first , there seemed to have been some intention on the government &apos;s part to open up the process - if not completely , then somewhat . 
Now , however , it appears that the authorities wanted only a small , managed opening , on the assumption that they could control the outcome . 
About a month before the election , the government began to shut down the political space it had opened . 
Its election campaign took on a vilifying tone , charging that the opposition was bent on destroying ethnic groups through genocide . 
Indeed , it called the opposition &quot; interahamwe , &quot; invoking the memory of the Hutu militia that slaughtered 800,000 Rwandan Tutsis in 1994 . 
The government also began to harass opposition parties , especially in rural areas . 
This was unpleasant , but tolerable . 
But things became nastier a week before the vote . 
At that point , the government realized that its democratic opening was slipping out of its control . 
Two days before the vote , our poll watchers and supporters were searched , arrested , and given one-day trials , with most sentenced to one or two months in jail . 
We feared that the voting would take place without the presence of our poll watchers . 
Although the government met neither of these demands , the early results clearly showed that the opposition was gaining a large number of seats . 
It became obvious that we were winning in many constituencies and that we had won in Addis Ababa , as well as in most of the major cities and the rural areas . 
What was surprising was the magnitude of the victory . 
In Addis Ababa , top government officials , including the ministers of education and capacity building , lost , as did the speaker of the House of People &apos;s Representatives . 
In rural constituencies , opposition candidates defeated such EPRDF heavyweights as the ministers of defense , information , and infrastructure , along with the presidents of the two largest regions , Oromia and Amhara . 
The government wasted little time in responding : the next day , it declared itself the winner , with not even half of the constituencies reporting their results . 
No surprise , then , that the public erupted in anger . 
When university students protested , the police moved in , killing one . 
In demonstrations the following day , 36 more people were killed . 
Soon after , our office workers were detained , and Hailu Shawel , Chairman of the CUD , and senior CUD official Lidetu Ayalew were put under house arrest . 
One hundred staff members were taken from our head office in Addis Ababa alone , and many more from regional offices . 
Up to 6,000 people were jailed - CUD members and even ordinary citizens . 
My fear is that the will of Ethiopia &apos;s people will be stifled by government hard-liners . 
Doubts about the authenticity of the final results will create a danger of instability . 
Everyone - the government , the opposition , and the public - must commit themselves to a peaceful resolution . 
To restore calm before a recount can be held , confidence-building measures are needed . 
The military must be taken off the streets . 
The ban on public demonstrations must be lifted . 
Those in jail must be released or given a fair trial . 
Those held simply because they do not support the government must be freed and allowed to participate in the democratic process . 
The government-controlled media must be open to diverse opinions ; in particular , opposition access must be guaranteed . 
Equally important , the international community must send observers - and thus a clear signal to the government that any attempt to maintain power by force or intimidation is unacceptable . 
The world must keep watching , just as it watched in Georgia , Ukraine , Lebanon , and Palestine . 
For the first time in our ancient history , we Ethiopians have voted our conscience . 
Our people have played their part with courage and discipline . 
They deserve the opportunity to build a genuine democratic political system . 
That is their only guarantee to live in peace and to achieve prosperity .
