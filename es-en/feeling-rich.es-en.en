Feeling Rich 
Who is richer , you or I ? 
As long as we both have enough to live comfortably , it shouldn &apos;t matter much . 
Many of us try not to let it matter . 
But sometimes such comparisons gnaw at us . 
In an era of globalization , with rapid economic growth in some areas and stagnation in others - and with television and the internet allowing us to see how others live - these comparisons are an increasingly important factor in the world economy . 
The late social psychologist Leon Festinger argued that interpersonal comparisons of success , whatever our moral qualms about them , constitute a fundamental - and thus irrepressible - human drive , one that is present in every society and all social groups . 
Festinger argued that for any measure of success , whether wealth , ability , or merely personal charm , people tend to be most concerned about comparisons with others whom they see regularly and who are at a similar level of attainment . 
We tend not to be bothered by people who are either vastly more successful or vastly less successful . 
We consider them so different from us that we just don &apos;t care . 
Harvard professor Benjamin Friedman &apos;s important new book The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth details what the feelings generated by these comparisons mean for social harmony and the success of our economies . 
Friedman argues that comparisons of wealth are more dangerous to a society if it appears that the rich are members of a different race or ethnic group . 
In that case , the comparisons become politicized , contributing to social conflict and thus tending to reduce economic success . 
For example , South Korea &apos;s spectacular economic growth in recent decades owes much , according to Friedman , to the country &apos;s ethnic homogeneity , which dampens resentment of others &quot; relative progress . 
By contrast , economic development in Sri Lanka , with a standard of living 40 years ago that was similar to that of Korea , was stymied by its Tamil minority &apos;s perception that their opportunities and advancement were blocked by the Sinhalese majority . 
The resulting ethnic violence has left real per capita income at just one-fifth the level of Korea today . 
The economist Albert Hirschman once likened a society with recognizably distinct groups to a multilane highway where people are unable to change lanes . 
If traffic is stalled for hours and no one else is making progress , we tend to relax and accept the situation resignedly . 
If the traffic then starts moving in another lane , everyone will greet the change with elation . 
Even if we are still stopped , we sympathize with those getting ahead , imagining that we , too , will soon be moving forward . 
But if the other lane keeps moving and we do not , our elation is eventually replaced by annoyance and anger . 
The same is true of economies that are starting to grow rapidly . 
People must feel that their own social group , however they define it , will eventually benefit . 
A key insight in Friedman &apos;s book is the fundamental importance of two kinds of comparisons that people make when judging their own success : comparisons with their own ( or their own family &apos;s ) past experience and comparisons with others that they see around them . 
When economic growth falters and people no longer see improvement over their past experience , the first comparison becomes more important - and comes to be shared by millions of people . 
But when the downturn affects distinct groups differently , especially when members of some groups are ( rightly or wrongly ) perceived as doing better than the others , the second comparison gains significance as well . 
Consider the rampant anti-Semitism - some of it ultimately genocidal - that arose during the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Of course , that is the most extreme example , and Friedman does not show that a decline in economic growth rates necessarily leads to social turmoil . 
Indeed , many historical episodes of diminished or even negative growth have gone by without any unusual social problems . 
Historical forces are complex ; they defy any simple economic theory . 
Friedman is right that social comparison drives human anxieties , if not conflict , but this is equally true when economies are growing . 
In some parts of the world , rising expectations , if unfulfilled , could make the kinds of effects that Friedman describes especially strong . 
For example , many people in China today feel great psychological pressure to live up to the expectations created by all the talk about their country &apos;s &quot; economic miracle &quot; - and the sight of others in their midst with significant wealth - and they express anxiety about their own individual success . 
As growth and development in emerging economies like China continues , people will increasingly compare themselves to the richer people in their countries &quot; urban centers . 
These countries &quot; successful people will increasingly compare themselves to people in other countries who are perceived as even more successful . 
If Festinger and Friedman are right , little can be done about this , because such comparisons are a part of human nature . 
But , regardless of whether these comparisons occur in an economy that is growing or contracting , the anxiety that they engender clearly represents a potential risk of unrest and instability . 
So the question is whether anything can be done to minimize that risk . 
Obviously , a measured pace of economic growth in the developing world - neither so high that it sets the stage for later collapse nor so low that it weakens the public &apos;s sense of solid progress towards a better life - would help ensure social and political stability , thereby fostering further growth . 
But , perhaps more importantly , people must believe that they live in a society that allows them to change lanes and move ahead faster when the route is clear .
