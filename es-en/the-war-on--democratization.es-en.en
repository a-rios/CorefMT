The War on &quot; Democratization &quot; 
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza constitute a grave threat to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean . 
These wars are inflicting heavy punishment on precisely those peoples who have held fully free and fair elections in the region , while eroding the legitimacy of Israel &apos;s democracy . 
At the time of its &quot; Cedar Revolution &quot; last year , Lebanon was held up as the best example so far of democratization in the Arab world . 
The enthusiasm with which the international community welcomed those changes now seems all but forgotten , which is also true of recent elections in Palestine - another longstanding international demand . 
The signal being sent is clear : it is preferable that Israel , the only state in the region that abides by the rule of law , be surrounded by authoritarian regimes where political outcomes are predictable than by democratic states where Islamists may well rise to power . 
It happened in Palestine , and it could well happen in Egypt if free and fair free elections were held . 
As a result , Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and vindicated in repressing all domestic opposition , particularly the swelling Islamist movements . 
But it should now be clear to everyone that democratization in the southern Mediterranean cannot bypass Islamist movements , and that the success of that process largely depends on the degree to which their full participation in the political arena is ensured . 
Of course , this requires their renouncing violence as a means of achieving power . 
Repressing political Islam , or attempting to &quot; erase &quot; Islamists militarily with total disregard for national political processes ( not to mention human life ) , is not the answer , because it won &apos;t persuade electorates to turn away from Islamist movements . 
The efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have been dealt a severe blow . 
Democracies have long known that extreme and indiscriminate punishment - which by definition affects friend and foe , combatant and civilian alike - is a grave violation of international law , as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , Louise Arbour , has pointed out . 
They also know that such action fuels radicalism , leading to the kind of tragic consequences that are all too familiar nowadays . 
Hezbollah is , after all , a creature of Lebanon &apos;s resistance to Israel &apos;s 1982 invasion , now trying to reassert its influence at home and in the wider region by portraying itself as a champion of the Arab-Islamic cause , namely in Palestine . 
Any reinforcement of its power will necessarily weaken Lebanon and the region &apos;s democratic forces . 
The prolonged absence of the United States from truly active engagement in the Middle East peace process is partly to blame for the current situation . 
For almost six years , there has been no significant US diplomatic initiative to resolve the Palestinian question or to pursue the Syrian track ( Israel still occupies the Golan Heights ) . 
Moreover , just when we were beginning to think that the Iraqi tragedy had made the limits of unilateralism and preemptive military strategies clear to all , the Bush administration encourages Israel &apos;s military action - this time against a country that has painfully been attempting to consolidate democratic reform and to reafirm its sovereignty in relation to Syria . 
Bush &apos;s most promising initiative , promoting democracy across the Middle East , was already dealt a crippling blow by US intervention in Iraq and the ensuing civil war there . 
Now the project is buried under the weight of America &apos;s inability to protect Lebanon &apos;s fragile democracy and Palestine &apos;s democratic experiment . 
The European Union &apos;s feeble response to the warfare in Gaza and Lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate use of force by Israel ( described as &quot; ten eyes for one &quot; by the Finnish presidency ) , thereby betraying its dependence on the US to end the violence . 
Europeans will have learned nothing from the damaging disunity , and thus weakness , that they displayed during the Iraq war if this conflict does not compel them to speak with one voice . 
What is needed is a European initiative that is backed by a credible military deterrent , consisting of forces from the EU , Turkey , and Arab countries , to be dispatched under a UN mandate to Lebanon and Gaza . 
Europe must not only put forward a clear demand for an immediate cease-fire and the end to Syrian and Iranian meddling in Lebanon , it must also provide the means to enforce it as well as massive support for Lebanon &apos;s reconstruction . 
The EU should decisively back the end of the embargo on Palestine and the urgent creation of a Palestinian state . 
A common European front could persuade the US to give Lebanon and Palestine enough time to consolidate their national democratic processes , thus isolating the radical elements of Hamas and steering Hezbollah to dissolution of its private army . 
With the US project in ruins , a credible European policy to delegitimize war and support democratization in its neighborhood has become essential .
