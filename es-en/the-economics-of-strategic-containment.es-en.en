The Economics of Strategic Containment 
NEW DELHI - At their recent summit in Cannes , the G-20 shelved , if not buried , the World Trade Organization &apos;s moribund Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations . 
Crisis-weary Europe and America face a rising tide of protectionism at home , and are trying to find ways to blunt the edge of China &apos;s non-transparent trade competitiveness . 
Turning his attention from the Atlantic to the Pacific , US President Barack Obama - with his eye , once again , trained on China - has now unveiled a new regional trade initiative . 
Why was the US unwilling to move forward on the Doha Round , but willing to pursue a regional free-trade agreement ? 
The answer lies in the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , launched by Obama and the governments of eight other Pacific economies - Australia , Brunei , Chile , Malaysia , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore , and Vietnam - is not just about trade . 
While Obama chose to stick to the economic factors driving the TPP , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , on the eve of the just-concluded Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Hawaii , laid out the initiative &apos;s wider strategic context . 
&quot; The United States will continue to make the case that .... &#91; the region &#93; must pursue not just more growth , but better growth , &quot; which &quot; is not merely a matter of economics , &quot; Clinton said . 
&quot; Openness , freedom , transparency , and fairness have meaning far beyond the business realm , &quot; she continued . 
&quot; Just as the United States advocates for them in an economic context , we also advocate for them in political and social contexts . &quot; 
Following up on these remarks , Obama drew attention to persistent US concern about China &apos;s exchange-rate policy , inadequate protection of intellectual property , and impediments to market access . 
&quot; For an economy like the United States - where our biggest competitive advantage is our knowledge , our innovation , our patents , our copyrights - for us not to get the kind of protection we need in a large marketplace like China is not acceptable , &quot; Obama observed . 
The TPP initiative should be viewed against this background , and not just in the context of the collapse of the Doha Round . 
The TPP &apos;s nine sponsors have resolved &quot; to establish a comprehensive , next-generation regional agreement that liberalizes trade and investment and addresses new and traditional trade issues and twenty-first-century challenges . &quot; 
These leaders also agreed to fast-track the TPP initiative , and to consider opening it to other members - most importantly Japan , a late convert to the idea of a Pacific region free-trade agreement . 
The TPP &apos;s agenda is divided into three categories : core , cross-cutting , and emerging issues . 
The core agenda is to stitch together a traditional free-trade agreement focused on industrial goods , agriculture , and textiles . 
The agreement would also have provisions for intellectual-property protection and what are dubbed the social and environmental issues . 
In short , the TPP &apos;s core agenda will offer the region a &quot; Doha Round-type &quot; agreement that includes the social and environmental agenda that developing economies have been resisting within the WTO . 
Going beyond the core , the cross-cutting issues include investor-friendly regulatory systems and policies that enable &quot; innovative &quot; or &quot; employment-creating &quot; small and medium-size enterprises to operate freely across borders within the TPP region . 
Finally , the TPP seeks to bring into the ambit of a trade and investment agreement &quot; new and emerging &quot; issues . 
These include &quot; trade and investment in innovative products and services , including digital technologies , and ensuring state-owned enterprises compete fairly with private companies and do not distort competition in ways that put US companies and workers at a disadvantage . &quot; 
In short , the US has moved to bring together all of the economies in the region that are worried about China &apos;s beggar-thy-neighbor trade and exchange-rate policies . 
For the US , the eight other TPP countries , with a combined population of 200 million , constitute its fourth largest export market , behind only China , the European Union , and Japan . 
If Japan joins , the TPP &apos;s importance would rise dramatically . 
While the economics of the TPP is important , the strategic component is even more so . 
This is the second leg of America &apos;s new &quot; Pacific offensive , &quot; aimed at offering nations in the region an alternative to excessive and rapidly growing dependence on a rising China . 
The first leg of the offensive was the idea of the &quot; Indo-Pacific &quot; region , which Clinton developed a year ago and followed up this year with an essay called &quot; America &apos;s Pacific Century . &quot; 
There , she defines the new region of US strategic engagement as &quot; stretching from the Indian subcontinent to the western shores of the Americas . &quot; 
Extending east from the Indian Ocean and west via the Pacific , the US is creating a new strategic framework for the twenty-first century . 
The TPP is just one of the pillars of that new edifice .
