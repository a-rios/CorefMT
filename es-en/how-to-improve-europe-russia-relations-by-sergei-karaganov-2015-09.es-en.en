A Eurasian Solution for Europe &apos;s Crises 
MOSCOW - More than 18 months after former President Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power ( and into exile ) , the crisis in Ukraine is at a stalemate . 
Crimea has been reabsorbed by Russia ( in what many consider an annexation ) ; much of eastern Ukraine is held by pro-Russia rebels ; and relations between the West and Russia are more tense than at any time since the early days of the Cold War . 
But can anyone claim an advantage ? 
Those who wanted to see Ukraine anchored in the West , or imagined that sanctions on Russia would incite regime change in the Kremlin , by palace coup or popular uprising , have seen their hopes dashed : President Vladimir Putin &apos;s popularity is as high as ever . 
In Russia , those who predicted the immediate collapse of Ukraine and the establishment in its eastern and southern provinces of a pro-Russian &quot; Novorossia &quot; have been similarly disappointed . 
The tragedy is that the price of these illusions has been extraordinarily high in human terms - the ceasefire-defying death toll in eastern Ukraine has risen to more than 6,000 since April 2014 - and dangerously high in geostrategic terms as well . 
It looks like both sides are ready to fight &quot; to the last Ukrainian . &quot; 
As I have long argued , Russia was never likely to yield . 
After being pushed to the wall by more than two decades of Western expansion - be it European Union or NATO enlargement - into a part of Europe that it considers vital to its national security , Russians believe that they have the moral high ground in defending their interests . 
The danger now , with both sides trading accusations in an atmosphere of mutual distrust , is that the current stalemate will lead to a much deeper crisis between Russia and the West . 
Both sides need to find a solution ; yet , despite emerging victorious from the Cold War , the West seems not only to have lost the peace , but is on the verge of re-dividing Europe . 
It is also happening at a time when both parts of Europe are in search of a new geopolitical , or even spiritual , identity . 
While the EU wrestles with problems of migration and integration , Russia is drifting away from a Eurocentric cultural and economic course toward a Eurasian alternative . 
And the United States - at least under President Barack Obama - has retreated into a kind of semi-isolation , leaving behind troubling zones of instability and unresolved crises . 
So what will happen next ? 
With both Western and Eastern Europe beset by political conflict and economic stagnation , the five centuries of European global dominance are drawing to an end . 
The reality now , following the end of the bipolar supremacy of the US and the Soviet Union and a brief &quot; unipolar &quot; phase following the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , is that we are now in a &quot; multipolar &quot; world . 
This , too , may prove temporary as two new geopolitical macro-blocs gain strength in the twenty-first century . 
One centers on the US and its ambition to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) . 
The second macro-bloc is &quot; Greater Eurasia , &quot; featuring China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Iran , and possibly India . 
Strong foundations for this project were established with the May 2015 agreement between Russia and China to coordinate the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union ( EEU ) with President Xi Jinping &apos;s &quot; Silk Road &quot; initiative , which aims to bind Central Asia &apos;s economies and those farther to the west closer to China &apos;s . 
The question is whether this Greater Eurasia can help Europe find a way through its current security impasse . 
Some in Europe will doubtless prefer to strengthen the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe - but the truth is that the OSCE , burdened by its Cold War history and its failure to secure the post-Cold War peace , is too tarnished to play a decisive role . 
An alternative might be a dialogue between the EU and the EEU , but that would be tricky as the EEU pursues a closer relationship with China and its Silk Road allies . 
A better approach would be to invite - sooner rather than later - China and Eurasian states to create over time a common economic space from Shanghai to Lisbon . 
There is obvious potential for the EU to engage constructively with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( created in 2001 by China , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan , with India and Pakistan set to join next year ) . 
The failure of the old framework demands an effort to create a new one , beginning with a dialogue on Eurasian development cooperation and security that involves China and both Eurasian and European countries . 
None of this will render the OSCE or NATO redundant , and that should be no one &apos;s goal . 
What matters in resolving today &apos;s conflicts , be they active or supposedly &quot; frozen , &quot; is to build a broader framework of cooperation and dialogue between the EU and what I term Greater Eurasia . 
The remaining question in such a scenario concerns the role of the US . 
Does it really want to remain in semi-isolation , hoping to be called back to center stage at some unlikely &quot; unipolar moment &quot; in the future ? 
Let us hope for an America ready to act as a responsible player in a fairer world .
