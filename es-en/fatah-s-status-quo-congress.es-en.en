Fatah &apos;s Status Quo Congress 
HERZLIYA - The Sixth Fatah Congress , held recently in Bethlehem , was an important event for the future of the Arab-Israeli conflict and for the Palestinian movement . 
But a careful look at the results of the Congress &apos;s elections to Fatah &apos;s Central Committee yields a picture that is quite different from what many will conclude about the meeting . 
The Congress seemed to demonstrate three main points : Fatah has moved toward peace with Israel ; it has adopted democratic procedures ; and a new generation , or even a specific group called the Young Guard , has assumed leadership . 
But this interpretation is in large part wrong . 
In terms of its approach to peace , the new Central Committee is roughly the same as the old one . 
Of the 18 elected members ( Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas will appoint four more later ) , no more than two ( Nabil Shaath and Muhammad Shtayyeh ) are really moderate . 
At least four ( Muhammad al-Ghuneim , Salim al-Zanoun , Abbas Zaki , and Nasser Kidra ) are hardliners , and most of the rest follow pretty much the traditional Fatah line . 
As for democracy , while the Congress was certainly a step forward from the past ( when Fatah leader Yasir Arafat could handpick Fatah &apos;s leadership ) , real limits remain . 
Depending on one &apos;s definition , Abbas chose between one-third and one-half of the delegates . The majority of the Central Committee , not surprisingly , are Abbas &apos;s close associates and supporters . 
The fact that only one out of 18 members will be from the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip , which contains about half of all the Palestinians that Fatah governs , also skews the results . 
But there is one aspect of this election so dangerous that it might outweigh everything else . 
The candidate who came in first , with two-thirds of the vote , was Abd al-Mahir Ghuneim , who is increasingly being spoken of as Abbas &apos;s successor . Ghuneim is an unrepentant hardliner and an open opponent of the Oslo agreement , much less of a negotiated peace agreement with Israel . 
If he becomes Fatah &apos;s leader ( and hence leader of the PA and the PLO as well ) , any compromise with Israel would become unimaginable . 
What about the transfer of power to a new generation ? 
This is accurate in purely chronological terms - old leaders inevitably get older , after all . 
Yet , while almost all the old members of the committee were not reelected , at least 15 of the 22 members will be old-style leaders ( presuming Abbas will appoint such people to the four seats that he controls ) . 
Many of the newly elected members , moreover , are veteran Fatah bureaucrats . 
The most interesting additions to the Central Committee are three younger men , though they have played leading roles in the organization for 20 years or more . 
Marwan Barghouti , the leader of Fatah &apos;s grassroots group on the West Bank , is now in an Israeli prison for organizing the bloody uprising that began in 2000 , and for direct involvement in planning the killings of many Israeli civilians . 
While some will point to Barghouti &apos;s election as a victory for the younger generation , not one of his followers will join him . 
The other two younger men , Muhammad Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub , built political bases of their own as commanders of security forces in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank , respectively . 
But Rajoub has many enemies , and Dahlan was responsible for Fatah &apos;s humiliating defeat by Hamas in the fight that led to the expulsion of Fatah from Gaza . 
In addition , all three of the younger men are rivals , not allies . 
In other words , there is no unified Young Guard . 
Indeed , far from being an electoral revolution , only two of those elected - Barghouti and Muhammad Shtayyeh , who has headed PECDAR , the Palestinian agency that promotes transparency and economic development - can be considered at all critical of the Fatah establishment . 
But , while the election did not usher in a leadership eager for peace with Israel and a Palestinian state achieved by compromise , nor was it a prelude to a renewal of violence . 
There are several individuals in the new leadership who have many Israeli contacts , and who can pick up a phone and call or be called by their Israeli counterparts . 
It is also extremely important that most of Fatah &apos;s new leaders have a strong distaste for Hamas , which makes rapprochement between the two groups unlikely . 
Still , if Ghuneim takes over as the PA &apos;s and Fatah &apos;s leader , which could happen next year , a breakdown of negotiations with Israel and a new round of fighting would not be surprising . 
The other interesting new face , though he has no chance of becoming a major leader , is Shtayyeh . 
A successful businessman , he could become an ombudsman and whistle-blower , which would be a real innovation . 
But , while it will be interesting to see whether he speaks out or is shut up , one shouldn &apos;t read too much into his election : he finished last among those elected , beating by a single vote Tayib Abu Rahman , one of Arafat &apos;s most trusted lieutenants and an old-school hardliner . 
There is a wide range of views in the new Palestinian leadership . 
This is neither a group that will make peace with Israel nor one that will ally itself with Hamas . 
In other words , it is a group with which Israel can work on status quo issues , though not on a comprehensive agreement . 
But if Muhammad al-Ghuneim does indeed become the new leader , the prospects for any peace at all look grim .
