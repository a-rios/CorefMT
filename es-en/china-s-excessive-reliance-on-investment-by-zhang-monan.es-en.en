Breaking China &apos;s Investment Addiction 
BEIJING - China &apos;s economic growth model is running out of steam . 
According to the World Bank , in the 30 years after Deng Xiaoping initiated economic reform , investment accounted for 6-8 percentage points of the country &apos;s 9.8 % average annual economic growth rate , while improved productivity contributed only 2-4 percentage points . 
Faced with sluggish external demand , weak domestic consumption , rising labor costs , and low productivity , China depends excessively on investment to drive economic growth . 
Although this model is unsustainable , China &apos;s over-reliance on investment is showing no signs of waning . 
In fact , as China undergoes a process of capital deepening ( increasing capital per worker ) , even more investment is needed to contribute to higher output and technological advancement in various sectors . 
In 1995-2010 , when China &apos;s average annual GDP growth rate was 9.9 % , fixed-asset investment ( investment in infrastructure and real-estate projects ) increased by a factor of 11.2 , rising at an average annual rate of 20 % . 
Total fixed-asset investment amounted to 41.6 % of GDP , on average , peaking at 67 % of GDP in 2009 , a level that would be unthinkable in most developed countries . 
Also driving China &apos;s high investment rate is the declining efficiency of investment capital , reflected in China &apos;s high incremental capital-output ratio ( annual investment divided by annual output growth ) . 
In 1978-2008 - the age of economic reform and opening - China &apos;s average ICOR was a relatively low 2.6 , reaching its peak between the mid-1980 &quot; s and the early 1990 &quot; s . 
Since then , China &apos;s ICOR has more than doubled , demonstrating the need for significantly more investment to generate an additional unit of output . 
As the accumulation and deepening of capital accelerate growth , they perpetuate the low-efficiency investment pattern and stimulate overproduction . 
When production exceeds domestic demand , producers are compelled to expand exports , creating an export-oriented , capital-intensive industrial structure that supports rapid economic growth . 
But if external demand lags , products accumulate , prices decline , and profits fall . 
While credit expansion can offset this to some degree , increased production based on credit expansion inevitably leads to large-scale financial risk . 
Thus , a combination of investment , debt , and credit is forming a self-reinforcing risky cycle that encourages overproduction . 
In the wake of the global financial crisis , Chinese banks were instructed to extend credit and invest in large-scale infrastructure projects as part of the country &apos;s massive monetary and fiscal stimulus . 
As a result , China &apos;s credit / GDP ratio rose by 40 percentage points in 2008-2011 , with most of the lending directed toward large-scale investment by state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . 
In the last two years , bank credit has become the main source of capital in China - a risky situation , given the low quality and inadequacy of bank capital . 
Meanwhile , strong currency demand has led China &apos;s M2 ( broad money supply ) to increase to 180 % of GDP - the highest level in the world . 
The massive wall of liquidity that has resulted has triggered inflation , sent real-estate prices soaring , and fueled a sharp rise in debt . 
Given that it is in local governments &quot; interest to maintain high economic-growth rates , many are borrowing to fund large-scale investment in real estate and infrastructure projects . 
The active fiscal policy adopted during the financial crisis enabled the rapid expansion of local official financing platforms ( state-backed investment companies through which local governments raise money for fixed-asset investment ) , from 2,000 in 2008 to more than 10,000 in 2012 . 
But , as local-government debt grows , Chinese banks have begun to regard real estate and local financing platforms as a major credit risk . 
Likewise , with key industries facing overproduction and slowing profit growth , firms &quot; deficits are growing - and their debts are becoming increasingly risky . 
Indeed , the proportion of deficit spending among enterprises is on the rise , and the accounts-receivable turnover rate is falling . 
By the third quarter of 2012 , industrial enterprises &quot; receivables totaled 8.2 trillion renminbi ( $ 1.3 trillion ) , up 16.5 % year on year , forcing many to borrow even more to fill the gap , which has driven up debt further . 
According to GK Dragonomics , corporate debt amounted to 108 % of GDP in 2011 , and reached a 15-year high of 122 % of GDP in 2012 . 
Many heavily indebted companies are SOEs , and most of the new projects that they initiate are &quot; super-projects , &quot; with the return on investment taking longer than creditor banks expect . 
Indeed , some highly indebted firms &quot; capital chains may well rupture in the next two years , when they reach their peak period for debt repayment . 
As a result , China &apos;s financial system is becoming increasingly fragile . 
The expansion of infrastructure investment - which , according to some reports , exceeds 50 trillion renminbi , including highway and high-speed railway construction - will lead to the expansion of banks &quot; balance sheets . 
The investment loans and massive debts among local financing platforms , together with the off-record credit channeled through the &quot; shadow &quot; banking system , are increasing the risk that non-performing loans will soon shake the banking sector . 
To reach the next stage of economic development , China needs a new growth model . 
Reliance on investment will not enable China to achieve stable , long-term growth and prosperity ; on the contrary it may well inflict serious long-term damage on economic performance .
