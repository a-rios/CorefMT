Latin America &apos;s Calm Before the Storm 
MEXICO CITY - The perpetual seesaw in Latin American geo-politics is more vibrant than ever . 
The so-called &quot; Americas-1 &quot; countries - those that are either neutral in the confrontation between the United States and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez ( and Cuba ) , or openly opposed to the so-called &quot; Bolivarian &quot; governments of Bolivia , Cuba , Ecuador , Nicaragua , and Venezuela - are slowly advancing . 
The &quot; Americas-2 &quot; radical left is receding moderately , yet it can still maintain its positions and defeat any attempts to roll back its influence . 
But the relative quiet in the ongoing ideological , political , and diplomatic conflict between the two groups of countries is only temporary . 
If anything , it is the calm before an approaching storm . 
The tide has turned in part because voters in recent elections seem to have shifted from the center left to the center right , or at least re-confirmed their more conservative convictions . 
In Chile , the businessman and center-right democrat Sebastián Piñera put an end to more than twenty years of center-left Concertación rule . 
The main change is in foreign policy , where , at least nominally , Piñera has clearly transferred Chile from one camp to another . 
In Colombia , the situation is similar . 
The likely winner in the June 26 run-off election , Juan Manuel Santos , will pursue most of outgoing president Alvaro Uribe &apos;s domestic policies , but might change course slightly in foreign affairs . 
He will probably be more aggressive in responding to neighboring Venezuela &apos;s challenges , both on the border and throughout the region . 
Uribe has tended to walk back from the brink every time Chávez has provoked Colombia , and has never wanted to go after FARC guerrilla sanctuaries in Venezuela . 
Santos may be less willing to avoid confrontation , if only because the personal antipathy between the two leaders is immense . 
He will probably be more forceful at regional meetings in responding to Chávez , believing that Venezuelan support for the FARC guerrillas is too blatant to be overlooked , and that it is wiser to confront him sooner rather than later . 
Meanwhile , Nicaragua is too small and poor to represent a threat to anyone , but always generates problems beyond its size . 
President Daniel Ortega is seeking to remain in office more or less perpetually , and seems ready to perpetrate every type of stratagem , from electoral fraud to dissolving Congress and the judiciary , in order to achieve his aims . 
Sooner or later , this will constitute a major challenge to the hemispheric community . 
Is it willing to look the other way while a small nation destroys its democracy , violates human rights , and breaches its international covenants ? 
If so , that hemispheric community will prove to be remarkably inconsistent , given a second conundrum : Honduras . 
Indeed , the Organization of American States ( OAS ) suspended Honduras last year because of the coup d &quot; état that deposed and deported then-President Manuel Zelaya . 
Chávez and even the US went as far as imposing economic sanctions on the interim government in view of the interruption of democratic rule . 
As recently as June 7 , the Bolivarian countries were able to block Honduras &quot; re-instatement into the OAS , despite the essentially free and fair elections that were held there last November . 
So , which is it going to be ? 
Disregard the imminent democratic implosion of Nicaragua , and the absence of any type of democracy in Cuba ? 
Or apply the same standard to Nicaragua , Cuba , and Venezuela that has been applied to Honduras ? 
Unfortunately , the only two countries that could play a role in reforming the inter-American system and defusing the growing tensions between Colombia and Venezuela will , for different reasons , remain passive . 
Mexico is consumed by its failed drug war , which has cost more than 25,000 lives and , according to just published US government statistics , has deterred Colombian cocaine traffickers , but has fostered dramatic increases in Mexican production of heroin , marijuana , and methamphetamines . 
Mexican President Felipe Calderón has never wanted to entangle himself in Latin American disputes and ideological confrontations . 
As his term winds down ( the next presidential elections are two years away ) , he will be even less inclined to involve Mexico in foreign adventures . 
Brazil is similarly paralyzed , partly because of its presidential election campaign , which is currently in full swing and will conclude only at the end of the year , and partly because of recent diplomatic setbacks . 
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to catapult his country onto the world stage as an emerging power , but he has not fared well . 
His chief goal - obtaining a permanent seat for Brazil on the United Nations Security Council - is more distant than ever , and his more modest aims have not met with greater success . 
Lula &apos;s attempt , together with Turkey , to broker a deal between Iran and the West failed when the US convinced Russia and China , along with countries such as Mexico , to approve a new round of UN sanctions against Iran . 
Brazil ended up alone with Turkey voting against the sanctions , and without anything to show for its mediating efforts . 
Brazil has always been reluctant to involve itself in its neighbors &quot; domestic conflicts . 
Now that it ventured to the other side of the world and fared poorly , it is unlikely to want to pursue other futile projects , such as reforming the OAS , deterring further confrontation between Venezuela and Colombia , or ensuring free and fair elections in Nicaragua . 
So , while Latin America may continue to weather the global economic storm rather well , the region &apos;s diplomatic peace and quiet is deceptive . 
Any number of rising tempests could end it .
