The Putinization of Mexico 
MEXICO CITY - Prior to Mexico &apos;s just-concluded presidential election , public disaffection with the state of affairs in the country was palpable . 
Mexicans from all walks of life seemed concerned about spiraling violence , anemic economic growth , and the lackluster rule of the National Action Party ( PAN ) . 
With 60,000 people killed in the war on drugs , Mexicans - like Russians following the first chaotic years of democratic transition under Boris Yeltsin - opted for political regression , underpinned by nostalgia for rule by a firm , if corrupt , hand . 
With democracy now associated with anarchy , chaos , and insecurity , the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , which ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000 , stood to benefit . 
The PRI promised to reestablish order and predictability , and to reduce the violence inflicted by the drug cartels , even if that means reaching a modus vivendi with them . 
Mexicans responded accordingly , punishing the PAN for overseeing an economy that has grown only 1.5 % per year on average over the last 12 years , as well as for a level of insecurity that Mexico has not witnessed since its revolution 100 years ago . 
But , perhaps most importantly , the PRI reaped the benefits of the best investment it has made in recent years : the permanent publicity campaign that turned its candidate and now President-elect , Enrique Peña Nieto , into Mexico &apos;s most popular political figure . 
Peña Nieto is a product of the two television networks that groomed him for power and then propelled him to the presidency . 
The PRI &apos;s political strategy was essentially the &quot; golden boy &quot; model : handsome face , cartloads of money , and the support of the television networks and Mexico &apos;s dinosaur elite , which yearned for a return to power . 
In other words , Peña Nieto &apos;s rise represents an alliance of oligarchs , vested monopolistic interests , the forces of order , and a population that has become disillusioned with electoral democracy . 
For many Mexicans , the restoration to power of a party that governed in an authoritarian manner and returns without having had to modernize itself , is a cause for neither insomnia nor even concern . 
They regard the PRI &apos;s return as if it were a symptom of democratic normalcy , of &quot; kicking the bums out . &quot; 
The oracles of optimism predict that the PRI will be forced to enact the structural reforms that it has blocked time and again over the years . 
It would indeed be fortunate for Mexico if a new era of PRI presidencies were a sign of healthy rotation in power rather than a regrettable step backwards . 
But any reasonable analysis of the current PRI does not support that prediction , and reveals it to be based on little more than wishful thinking . 
As Tom Friedman has argued , three groups coexist in Mexico today : &quot; The Narcos , the No &apos;s , and the NAFTA &apos;s . &quot; 
These are , respectively , the drug lords , the beneficiaries of the status quo , and middle-class Mexicans who want prosperity . 
The PRI is , by definition , the party of &quot; No . &quot; 
It opposes necessary structural reforms in order to defend its clients &quot; rent-seeking practices ; rejects citizen candidacies in favor of unaccountable party elites ; recoils from union modernization , owing to the corporatist practices that it implemented ; and refuses to dismantle the monopolies that it established . 
The PRI and Peña Nieto are &quot; veto centers , &quot; because they constitute the main opposition to any change that would entail opening , privatizing , confronting , or remodeling the system that they conceived and now , once again , control . 
The PRI demonstrated in this election that it had more money , unity , discipline , and hunger for success than its adversaries . 
Unfortunately , it continues to be a clientelist , corporatist , corrupt organization that does not believe in citizen participation , checks and balances , competition , accountability , or scrutiny of public-sector unions . 
Yet the country that the PRI is now poised to govern again has changed , slowly but surely . 
Its youth are less conformist and more demanding , less passive and more pluralistic . 
It is now the task of all Mexicans who marched and mobilized and recently took Peña Nieto to task on the streets to ensure that Putinization remains a Russian phenomenon .
