The Keynesian Cure 
BERKELEY amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; 
It is not yet foredoomed that the world economy will undergo a substantial recession in the next three years or so : we might still escape . 
But governments should play it safe by starting to take more steps now to cushion , soften , and shorten the period of high unemployment and slow or negative growth that now looks very likely . 
It is a fact of nature - human nature , at least - that prudent and appropriate policies now will later seem excessive . 
At some point , the world economy will begin expanding rapidly again . 
But it would be most imprudent to assume that the turning point is right now , and that things are as bad as they will get . 
Perhaps the best way to look at the situation is to recall that three locomotives have driven the world economy over the past 15 years . 
The first was heavy investment , centered in the United States , owing to the information technology revolution . 
The second was investment in buildings , once again centered in the US , driven by the housing boom . 
The third was manufacturing investment elsewhere in the world - predominantly in Asia - as the US became the world economy &apos;s importer of last resort . 
For 15 years , these three locomotives kept the world economy near full employment and growing rapidly . 
When the high-tech boom ended in 2000 , the Federal Reserve orchestrated its replacement by the housing boom , while investment in Asia to supply the US market was chugging along at an increasing pace . 
Many today are complaining about Alan Greenspan &apos;s monetary stewardship , which kept these three locomotives stoked : &quot; serial bubble-blower &quot; is the most polite phrase that I have heard . 
But would the world economy really be better off today under an alternative monetary policy that kept unemployment in America at an average rate of 7 % rather than 5 % ? 
Would it really be better off today if some $ 300 billion per year of US demand for the manufactures of Europe , Asia , and Latin America had simply gone missing ? 
The first locomotive , however , ran out of fuel seven years ago , and there is no clear technology-driven alternative leading sector , like biotechnology , that can inspire similar exuberance , rational or otherwise . 
The second locomotive began sucking fumes two years ago , and is now coasting to a halt , which means that the third - the US as importer of last resort - is losing speed as well : the weak dollar accompanying the housing finance crash makes it unprofitable to export to the US . 
The world economy , as John Maynard Keynes put it 75 years ago , is developing magneto trouble . 
What it needs is a push - more aggregate demand . 
In the US , the weak dollar will be a powerful boost to net exports , and thus to aggregate demand . 
But , from the perspective of the world as a whole , net exports are a zero-sum game . 
So we will have to rely on other sources of aggregate demand . 
The first source is the government . 
Fiscal prudence is as important as ever over the medium and long term . 
But for the next three years , governments should lower taxes - especially for the poor , who are most likely to spend - and spend more . 
The second source is private investment . 
The world &apos;s central banks are already cutting interest rates on safe assets , and will cut them more as the proximity and magnitude of the likely global slump becomes clear . 
But low interest rates are entirely compatible with stagnation or depression if risk premia remain large - as the world learned in the 1930 &quot; s , and as Japan relearned in the 1990 &quot; s . 
The most challenging task for governments is to boost the private sector &apos;s effective risk-bearing capacity so that businesses have access to capital on terms that tempt them to expand .
