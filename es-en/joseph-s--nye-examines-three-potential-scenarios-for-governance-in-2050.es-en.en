Governance in the Information Age 
ABU DHABI - As the year comes to an end , it is only natural to ask what might lie ahead . 
What will governance look like in 2050 ? 
That is what the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) asked at a recent meeting in Abu Dhabi that focused on the future of governance under three potential scenarios arising from the ongoing information revolution . 
With that revolution already marginalizing some countries and communities - and creating new opportunities for others - the question could hardly be more timely . 
The first scenario that participants considered is a world ruled by so-called &quot; megacities , &quot; where governance is administered largely by major urban agglomerations . 
The second possibility is a world in which strong central governments use big data to fortify their control . 
And , in the third scenario , central governments are fundamentally weak , with markets - and the enterprises that dominate them - providing almost all services . 
Each of these scenarios is an extrapolation of a current trend . 
While all of them could be beneficial in some respects , they also have features that , if left unchecked , could lead to dystopian outcomes . 
Policymakers should already be implementing policies aimed at guiding trends like urbanization , the rise of big data , and the grouping of people into narrow communities , often based on their relationship to the market . 
The goal should be to take advantage of these trends &quot; potential benefits , while ensuring that they do not undermine other critical aspects of governance . 
For example , although megacities have the potential to create new opportunities for workers and businesses , they cannot solve universal problems like climate change or manage the production and protection of national and global public goods . 
Likewise , while the use of big data has substantial problem-solving potential , important questions remain about who owns , who controls , and who regulates the use of the data . 
The notion of a &quot; datocracy &quot; incites fear of an Orwellian &quot; e-1984 . &quot; 
Indeed , the recent revelations about National Security Agency surveillance programs barely scratch the surface of the issue . 
After all , the use of big data is not confined to governments and corporations ; anonymous criminal groups can easily abuse the information , too . 
Finally , while individual choice within markets is often the most efficient way to allocate resources , markets do not produce a sufficient supply of public goods . 
Indeed , there are some goods that the private sector is simply unable to provide . 
This system may seem acceptable to those within the &quot; gated communities &quot; that benefit from it , but what about all those left outside ? 
The WEF &apos;s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Government , of which I am a part , has considered ways in which information technology can improve governance and reduce feelings of alienation among the governed . 
The most effective initiatives , the council observed , often arise from partnerships between government and the private sector . 
For example , in Kenya , a private company developed a mobile-payments system that allows users to transfer money using cell phones , effectively creating a banking system much more quickly than the government could have done . 
Once the system was privately created , the government was able to use it to provide additional services . 
As a result , a Kenyan farmer in a remote district can now obtain information about crop prices or transfer funds , without having to travel long distances and wait in lines . 
While such initiatives cannot solve the problem of inequality , they can help to relieve some of its most damaging effects . 
At a time of rapid social change and relentless technological advancement , efforts to improve governance - at the local , national , or international level - will require careful thought and experimentation , in order to determine how to balance inclusive decision-making with the ever-evolving needs of markets . 
As the American diplomat Harlan Cleveland once asked , &quot; How will we get everybody in on the act , and still get some action ? &quot; 
Consider international institutions . 
Today , the world is organized into some 200 countries ; in all likelihood , it will be in 2050 as well . 
Many have advocated the use of &quot; double majorities &quot; - which require a majority of votes according to two separate criteria , population and economic output - to elicit action from a manageable number of states while enhancing weaker states &quot; influence in decision-making . 
But , though the G-20 has moved in this direction , the approach to setting a global agenda remains flawed . 
Indeed , it seems to be most effective in times of crisis ; in more normal times , as we have seen , the G-20 struggles to get things done . 
Moreover , even if the double-majority system helps to empower some weaker states , it does not account for the role of the world &apos;s smallest countries in global decision-making processes . 
Although these countries represent a small share of the global population , they comprise a significant majority of the total number of countries . 
One potential solution would be for states to represent each other , as occurs in the International Monetary Fund . 
World leaders have not yet figured out how to reconcile the moral conviction that all people are equal with the simple fact that all countries are not . 
In a global information age , governance systems capable of addressing fundamental issues like security , welfare , liberty , and identity will require coalitions that are small enough to function efficiently and a decision concerning what to do about those who are underrepresented . 
Obviously , all of this calls for a lot more investigation . 
Exploring potential future scenarios , as the WEF has done , is an important step in the right direction .
