Trading Up from Poverty 
WASHINGTON , DC - A long-held tenet of international-trade theory is that , in the long run , increased trade correlates with faster GDP growth . 
But the challenge - which my institution , the World Bank , is working to overcome - is to ensure that trade-driven growth benefits the poor . 
That is why the heads of seven multilateral institutions , including the World Bank , strongly supported the push for the trade-facilitation agreement that was reached earlier this month at the World Trade Organization &apos;s ministerial conference in Bali . 
To be sure , the incidence of poverty worldwide has reached an historic low , with the extreme-poverty rate ( the share of the population living on less than $ 1.25 a day , in purchasing-power-parity terms ) falling in 2010 by more than half since 1990 . 
But that still leaves more than one billion people worldwide living in extreme poverty . 
Moreover , progress has been uneven , with poverty rates having declined far more in East Asia and Latin America than in Sub-Saharan Africa . 
In order to cope with this changing global context , the World Bank has introduced a new objective to guide its poverty-reduction efforts : promoting sustainable , shared prosperity by monitoring the income growth of the poorest 40 % of every country &apos;s population . 
Indeed , we are rethinking how we define success in development and how we provide trade-related support to developing countries . 
Trade &apos;s relationship with poverty is variable and complex . 
Increased trade benefits consumers by reducing the prices of goods and services . 
It gives the poor access to a wider variety of commodities , while providing firms with a more diverse selection of inputs . 
But increased trade can also eliminate low-skill factory jobs and reduce agricultural prices - outcomes that disproportionately hurt the poor . 
In India , for example , poverty has declined more slowly in areas where farmers face increased foreign competition . 
Given constraints on inter-sectoral labor mobility , stemming from barriers to skills acquisition and rigid labor-market regulations , the poorest workers have few options when such changes occur . 
As a result , increased trade may demand difficult adjustments in the short term . 
Individuals may need to change their consumption habits ; labor may have to be reallocated across sectors ; and some workers may have to adjust to lower wages , at least temporarily . 
Some firms will grow , while others will contract . 
Experience has demonstrated that , with forward-looking policies , governments can enhance trade &apos;s benefits and mitigate its negative impact on the poor . 
Policymakers can promote retraining programs for displaced workers and remove regulatory obstacles that impede their flow into thriving , export-oriented sectors . 
And , in order to protect farmers , they can eliminate export restrictions and ensure that timely , accurate market information is accessible . 
With such policies in place , the World Bank &apos;s efforts to bolster developing countries &quot; trade linkages could facilitate substantial poverty reduction . 
For example , we help developing-country governments connect firms , farmers , and households to markets and supply chains , thereby fostering increased investment and boosting economic activity . 
Furthermore , we support infrastructure-development projects , enabling countries to build the roads , bridges , and ports that link traders to markets . 
For example , a $ 1.8 billion highway project in Kazakhstan is facilitating trade-related transport across the country , stimulating the economies of the country &apos;s poorest provinces , and creating more than 30,000 jobs . 
In Nepal , the Bank is financing reconstruction of the steep , dangerous , and busy road that carries most of the country &apos;s exports to India , and it is supporting the government &apos;s efforts to connect some of the country &apos;s remotest districts to the main road network . 
The World Bank also helps countries to establish clear customs rules that more effectively protect traders from inconsistent treatment or solicitations for bribes . 
And we are working to address costly border inefficiencies . 
For example , we are helping to simplify and modernize trade procedures through Cameroon &apos;s Douala port , and we have helped the government of Laos to establish an online portal that provides traders with access to all relevant laws , procedures , schedules , and forms from border-management agencies . 
Moreover , since 2010 , the International Finance Corporation , the Bank &apos;s private-sector lending arm , has been promoting the integration of small and medium-size enterprises into global supply chains by increasing their access to capital . 
The $ 500 million Global Trade Supplier Finance program , a joint investment and advisory initiative , is currently providing short-term finance to thousands of emerging-market SMEs . 
In order to maximize the impact of such initiatives , world leaders should cooperate to build and maintain an open trading system . 
The WTO &apos;s Bali conference provided an important opportunity to develop a new trade-facilitation agreement that expedites the movement , release , and clearance of goods at border stations ; clarifies and improves trade-related rules ; enhances technical assistance ; and encourages cooperation among border-control agencies . 
But the agreement that was reached in Bali cannot succeed unless wealthy countries and donors agree to support developing countries &quot; efforts to enact related policies and reforms . 
Given this , it is crucial that developed-country policymakers recognize that a more efficient , better integrated , and more inclusive global trade regime will benefit all countries . 
With genuine commitment from the international community and the appropriate domestic policies in place , trade can be a powerful force for poverty reduction .
