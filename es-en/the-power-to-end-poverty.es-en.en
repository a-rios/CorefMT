The Power to End Poverty 
NEW YORK - Growing up as a child during the Korean War , I knew poverty first hand . I saw it around me every day ; 
I lived it . 
One of my earliest memories is walking up a muddy track into the mountains to escape the fighting , my village burning behind me and wondering what would happen to my family and me . 
The answer was the United Nations and other international agencies . 
With the help of many countries and friends , my country was able to get back on its feet and carry on after that terrible and devastating conflict . 
Thanks to decades of hard work and sacrifice by millions of Koreans , the Republic of Korea rose from desperate poverty to prosperity in less than a half-century . 
As Secretary-General of the UN , I am still living that story . 
Every day , I work to help end the extreme poverty that traps nearly a billion of the world &apos;s people . 
You may imagine , then , the powerful memories that I felt when I visited the Mwandama Millennium Village in the deeply impoverished southern African country of Malawi . 
As in my youth , I saw once again the challenges and hardship of rural poverty . 
Yet I also saw , once again , the power of community spirit to overcome it - the same sense of solidarity and determination that launched Korea &apos;s rural modernization five decades ago . 
In 2000 , the world &apos;s leaders committed to achieve major reductions in poverty , hunger , and disease by 2015 . 
These targets , endorsed by all UN member countries , comprise the eight Millennium Development Goals . 
The Millennium Village Project , a partnership of academia , business , and UN agencies , aims to show how these goals can be achieved in even the poorest communities in the world . 
Like South Korea &apos;s own experience in fighting poverty , Millennium Villages in Africa , and similar projects elsewhere , are now surging ahead in food production , children &apos;s health , and in forging a sustainable pathway out of poverty itself . 
At the same time , I was impressed with one crucial difference between Korea &apos;s efforts in the 1960 &quot; s and what is possible today . 
Touring the Mwandama Village , I saw the potential of modern technologies - smart phones and mobile broadband , improved seed varieties , the latest in drip irrigation , modern diagnostic tests for malaria , and low-cost solar-energy grids - to advance human well-being in ways that simply were not feasible even a few years ago . 
I saw a community health worker using a smart phone to manage malaria treatment within a household . 
The worker used a low-cost diagnostic kit to confirm the malaria diagnosis , circumventing the need for a microscope and laboratory ; a smart phone to key in the test results and receive advice from an &quot; expert system &quot; designed by public-health specialists ; and state-of-the-art combination drug therapy to cure the illness . 
The child was cured within the home ; a few years ago , that same child would have faced a high risk of death unless he was somehow brought to a distant clinic in time . 
I saw other breakthrough changes in daily life . 
In a community that once could not feed itself , a giant warehouse was almost bursting with tons of surplus grain . 
By using high-yield seeds , better soil management , and proper row planting , the community has more than tripled its crop production , and villagers who previously were hungry grain buyers are now food-secure grain sellers . 
That surplus , in turn , has contributed directly to improved education , as families donate a portion of their surplus to the school &apos;s mid-day meal program . 
Now the students get a nutritious bowl of porridge and fruits , giving them the energy to pursue their studies throughout the school day . 
As so many schools have discovered , mid-day meals lead to an end-of - year jump in performance on national exams . 
This month , the Millennium Villages Project launches its second five-year stage on the way to the MDGs target date of 2015 . 
Around Africa , and now around the world , governments are scaling up the lessons from this particular project and others like it : empower communities , help them to invest in their futures using cutting-edge technologies , and thereby end extreme poverty . 
The MDGs might once have seemed to be merely a set of hopes and aspirations . 
Now we know that they are actually a practical roadmap out of poverty . 
The world leaders who met at the UN in September for the annual General Debate all agreed on a central point : the importance of fighting poverty , hunger , and disease is crucial for our collective survival . 
They know that extreme poverty threatens the lives of hundreds of millions of people who lack reliable access to adequate nutrition , potable water , health care , and education . 
They also know that the dangers don &apos;t stop at the edge of the village or slum ; today &apos;s hunger hotspots all too frequently become tomorrow &apos;s violent hotspots . 
Regardless of whether we are rich , poor , or in between , we share an overwhelming interest in the MDGs &quot; success , so that every region trapped in extreme poverty can break free , grow , and prosper .
