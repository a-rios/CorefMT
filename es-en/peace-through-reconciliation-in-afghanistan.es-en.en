Peace Through Reconciliation in Afghanistan 
NEW YORK - It may or may not be coincidental , but as US President Barack Obama &apos;s military offensive in Afghanistan gets underway , Afghan President Hamid Karzai has at long last embarked on a serious effort at national reconciliation . 
The prime focus of this process is to find some means to reintegrate at least parts of the Taliban into society and into productive activities . 
In order to qualify for reintegration , members of the Taliban will need to lay down their weapons , renounce their connection with Al Qaeda , and agree to respect Afghan laws . 
This policy change is a necessary parallel to the military action now taking place . 
It is also a belated recognition that the &quot; development as usual &quot; policies followed in Afghanistan up to now have failed . 
Indeed , as has been painfully demonstrated , the old policies were never going to be enough to galvanize Afghan public support , particularly for a new military &quot; surge . &quot; 
Eight years ago , Afghanistan embarked on four distinct transitions : a security transition away from violence and insecurity ; a political transition toward a society based on participatory government and the rule of law ; a social transition from tribal and ethnic confrontations toward national reconciliation ; and an economic transition to transform a war-torn and unstable economy into a viable one in which people can make a decent and legal living . 
Because economic reconstruction takes place amid this multi-pronged transition , what has been happening in Afghanistan is fundamentally different from normal development processes . 
The current Afghan situation reflects the failure until now to make national reconciliation - rather than optimal development policies - the bedrock priority of the government and the international community . 
War-torn countries that have embarked on transitions of this type since the end of the Cold War have a dismal record : roughly half revert to conflict within a few years . 
Of the other half , most end up highly aid-dependent - indeed an unsustainable position in the present financial context . 
Afghanistan has an infamous record on both grounds : it has reverted to conflict , and it is not being weaned off its high aid-dependence . 
El Salvador , following the end of its civil war , managed to avoid reverting to conflict or becoming aid-dependent , owing mainly to its emphasis on efforts to reintegrate former combatants from both sides and other war-affected people into the national security forces , the political process , or economically productive activities . 
The &quot; arms-for-land &quot; program that the Salvadoran government pursued was the main venue for productive reintegration , providing beneficiaries with a viable livelihood and a stake , however tiny , in the country &apos;s wealth . 
Because the main short-term challenge in any transition to peace is national reconciliation , the political objective of peace should prevail at all times over the economic or financial objective of development if the two ever clash , as they often do . 
Peace-related activities - particularly reintegration and other reconciliation programs - need to be given priority in budget allocations . 
Failure to do so has proved a major factor in countries &quot; relapse into war , because , in the absence of peace , there can be no sustainable development . 
So success in Afghanistan demands reintegration of the Taliban . 
But reintegration will require a carrot-and-stick approach . 
Incentives probably can be found to induce a large number of the rank and file to abandon the insurgency and join the Afghan armed forces or police , play a role in local politics , join the national civil service , or find agricultural or other private-sector employment . Cash payments should be minimized to immediate short-term needs , but an active policy of job creation urgently needs to be implemented . The situation regarding Taliban commanders is , however , more problematic . 
The rewards will have to be larger , as they were in the case of the Salvadoran programs for FMLN commanders . 
In the case of Afghanistan , it may also require a sharp reduction in Taliban financing from drug-related activities , as well as targeted military operations to destroy insurgency hideouts in both Afghanistan and Pakistan . 
Two serious problems make reconciliation in Afghanistan particularly challenging . 
First , the Karzai government must overcome credibility issues related to the broken promises it made in the past to former Taliban who laid down their weapons . 
Second , the $ 140 million pledged by donors at the London Conference for the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund is blatantly insufficient for effective reintegration . 
To paraphrase John Maynard Keynes , the economic price of establishing peace is large , but it is indeed a good investment . 
That investment would save thousands of lives , and it would be a pittance compared to the hundreds of billions of dollars spent by the international community in military and peacekeeping expenditures since the so-called &quot; war on terror &quot; began in 2001 .
