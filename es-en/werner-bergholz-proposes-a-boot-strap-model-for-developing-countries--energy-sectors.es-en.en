Power to the Poorest 
BREMEN - An estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide , including 550 million in Africa and 400 million in India , have no access to electricity . 
Most live in rural areas where the population is sparse and incomes are low , making it uneconomical to connect homes and businesses to a grid . 
Nor is it feasible to generate power locally with a diesel unit , owing to high fuel costs and the need for substantial initial investment . 
A stable supply of affordable electricity is a prerequisite for economic development . 
In fact , the consequences for people living without electricity can be dire : they may be deprived of adequate health care , or be unable to store fresh food . 
But one solution , based on the local use of renewable energy , requires minimal initial investment and can be expanded over time . 
This &quot; boot-strap &quot; approach is based on the use of photovoltaics - a simple , universal , and scalable technology that is easy to maintain . 
Typically , in the first stage of this process , consumers would use a renewable energy source such as LED lighting , selling any surplus until they save enough money to buy lamp oil ( on which Africans spend around $ 20 billion annually ) . 
The additional revenue might initially come from selling small electricity surpluses to local farmers to recharge their mobile phones ( thereby allowing them to work out the optimal prices for their crops ) , or to help them irrigate farmland using small electric pumps . 
This is a new opportunity . 
Until three or four years ago , photovoltaics were prohibitively expensive . 
But advances in the industry and over-production have reduced their price by as much as 75 % . 
The cheapest system , generating two watts of power , can cost as little as $ 10-20 and be expanded to almost any level , depending on the size and number of photovoltaic ( PV ) modules and the size of the battery storage unit . 
It is simple , too . 
A residential solar-power system consists of just three components : the PV modules , a battery storage unit , and a charge controller . 
Such a system can supply low-voltage DC electric power at five volts for mobile phones , and 12V for LED lighting , pumps for outdoor use , and electrical appliances such as computers and televisions . 
When single-phase or three-phase 230V AC power is needed ( say , to power larger machines ) , an inverter must be used . 
This makes sense only for systems that are larger than a kilowatt of peak power and that have sufficient battery capacity . 
Local systems in one building could be connected to local low-voltage DC or 230V AC grids to improve the security of supply . 
One major challenge to the boot-strap approach is developing cheap and durable batteries . 
Many residential systems break down after 3-5 years when the battery dies , undermining confidence in the system among owners who assumed that they had a lifetime supply of energy . 
But it is not a complicated process to demonstrate how to extend a battery &apos;s life to as much as ten years . 
Indeed , getting the most out of a battery may require only that its owner fully charges it at least once every two weeks and never discharges it to less than 50 % capacity . 
In addition , our own research team is currently exploring ways to rejuvenate old solar or car batteries - without requiring any chemical treatment or disassembly - for re-use in a residential solar-power system . 
Once such technologies have been perfected , we can turn our attention to developing a boot-strap business model . 
We believe that existing distribution , sales , and maintenance networks for other goods and services could be adapted to supply and provide customer support for solar-power systems as well . 
For example , bicycle mechanics , who are plentiful in Africa and rural India , or small shop and kiosk owners could be trained to install and maintain these systems . 
The combination of low-investment electricity generation for households and the ability to sell surpluses , scale up output , and access pre-existing distribution and maintenance networks bridges a crucial gap in the energy market . 
It is a simple idea that would allow millions of people in poor , rural areas worldwide to integrate their activities with the wider economy , accumulate capital , and improve their lives .
