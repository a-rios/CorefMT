Meeting Medvedev 
LONDON - In 2001 , George W. Bush claimed that he had looked into Vladimir Putin &apos;s eyes and found a soulmate for the West . 
Putin then proceeded to restore authoritarian rule in Russia . Today , Western leaders may well be about to repeat the same mistake with Dmitry Medvedev . 
Sunday &apos;s election was a coronation rather than a competition . 
Medvedev &apos;s only opponents were has-beens from the 1990 &quot; s like Vladimir Zhirinovsky , who long ago converted himself from proto-fascist into a Kremlin loyalist , and Andrey Bogdanov , an ersatz &quot; democrat &quot; permitted to run by the Kremlin in order to dupe the West into thinking that a real contest was taking place . 
It is therefore surprising that Medvedev should be hailed by so many in the West as a &quot; liberal . &quot; 
Is this just because we have been maneuvered into fearing someone worse , a sabre-rattling silovik ( past or present member of the security services ) , like former Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov ? 
Or does Medvedev represent a genuine opportunity to unfreeze the current mini-Cold War between Russia and the West ? 
Medvedev is indeed personable . 
Putin &apos;s background was in the KGB , while Medvedev is a lawyer who has attacked Russia &apos;s &quot; legal nihilism &quot; and denounced the fashionable concept of &quot; sovereign democracy . &quot; 
Medvedev is familiar to the business world after seven years as Chairman of the Board of Gazprom . 
He can talk the talk at Davos . 
He wears nice suits . 
He does not look like an archetypal post-Soviet bureaucrat or KGB agent . 
He is a big fan of 1970 &quot; s rockers Deep Purple . 
But we need to understand the system that made Medvedev before rushing to embrace a new face that may turn out to be only a cosmetic improvement . 
Russia &apos;s problem is not that it is an imperfect democracy , but that its governance is corrupted by so-called &quot; political technology . &quot; 
Political technology means secretly sponsoring fake politicians like Bogdanov , setting up fake NGO &apos;s and &quot; patriotic &quot; youth movements like Nashi ( Ours ) to prevent a Russian version of Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution , and mobilizing voters against a carefully scripted &quot; enemy . &quot; 
In 1996 , the enemy was the Communists ; in 1999-2000 , the Chechens ; in 2003-04 , the &quot; oligarchs . &quot; 
Now it is us - the supposedly hostile West and the threat posed by &quot; color revolutions &quot; to Russia &apos;s hard-won stability . 
Medvedev himself may find some or all of this distasteful , but Russia now has an entire industry of political manipulation that is hardly likely to disappear overnight . 
We also need to understand the mechanics of Russian succession politics . 
In the Russian context , &quot; liberal &quot; does not mean little more than opposing the siloviki . 
It means being in a different clan , at a different part of the feeding trough . 
The uncertainties of the succession have created a covert war for property and influence between a handful of different clans , but the system cannot afford an outright winner . 
In recent months , the most powerful clan , led by Deputy Head of Kremlin Administration Igor Sechin , whose company , Rosneft , received the biggest chunk of Yukos in 2004 , has threatened to engulf the others . 
Another company , Russneft , worth an estimated $ 8-9 billion , seems to be heading its way , after its owner , Mikhail Gutseriyev , was evicted by the same recipe of legal threats and tax liens that was used against Yukos , and after the mysterious death of his son in a car crash . 
There are rumors that Sechin &apos;s clan has designs on Russia &apos;s Stabilization Fund , which soaring energy prices have pumped up to over $ 140 billion . 
In other words , rebalancing the system , not any sudden desire to reverse the increasingly illiberal course Russia has taken since 2003 , was the key reason for choosing Medvedev . 
Putin &apos;s ambition to stay in power as prime minister is also rooted in this rebalancing act . 
He needs to stay on as Medvedev &apos;s &quot; minder &quot; to keep any one clan from dominating the others . Medvedev and the siloviki heartily dislike each other . 
Sechin and Ivanov will be watching him closely for any signs of weakness . 
Medvedev will not become his own man until he can cut free . 
Putin himself honored his succession deal with Boris Yeltsin for about three years . 
It is often forgotten that Yeltsin loyalists like Alexander Voloshin and former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov survived in office until the Yukos affair of 2003-04 . 
Medvedev may one day have his own Yukos moment , but we should not assume that he is an independent player until he does . 
European governments can therefore welcome Medvedev &apos;s election , but their response should be carefully calibrated to the real changes he will be able to make . 
Europe should avoid repeating the over-reaction of many leaders when Putin succeeded the ailing Yeltsin in 2000 . 
There should be no race to be Medvedev &apos;s new best friend , and no staring into his eyes and speculating about his soul . 
We should concentrate on what Medvedev does , not on what he says , because there can be no real transition in Russia unless and until he begins to define the system rather than being defined by it .
