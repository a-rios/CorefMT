A Survival Strategy for the Eurozone 
NEW YORK - After the Greek and Irish crises and the spread of financial contagion to Portugal , Spain , and possibly even Italy , the eurozone is now in a serious crisis . 
There are three possible scenarios : &quot; muddle through , &quot; based on the current approach of &quot; lend and pray &quot; ; &quot; break-up , &quot; with disorderly debt restructurings and possible exit of weaker members ; and &quot; greater integration , &quot; implying some form of fiscal union . 
The muddle-through scenario - with financing provided to member states in distress ( conditional on fiscal adjustment and structural reforms ) , in the hope that they are illiquid but solvent - is an unstable disequilibrium . 
Indeed , it could lead to the disorderly breakup scenario if institutional reforms and other policies leading to closer integration and restoration of growth in the eurozone &apos;s periphery are not implemented soon . 
The crisis started with too much private debt and leverage , which became public debt and deficits as crisis and recession triggered fiscal deterioration and private losses were mostly socialized via bailouts of financial systems . 
Then , distressed sovereigns that had already lost market access - Greece and Ireland - were bailed out by the International Monetary Fund and the European Union . 
But no one will bail out these super-sovereigns if the sovereigns prove to be insolvent . 
Thus , the current strategy of kicking the can down the road will soon reach its limits , and a different plan will be needed to save the eurozone . 
The first institutional reform takes the form of a larger envelope of official resources , which would mean a quasi-fiscal union . 
Official resources currently are sufficient to bail out Greece , Ireland , and Portugal , but not to prevent a self-fulfilling run on the short-term sovereign and financial liabilities of Spain and other potentially distressed eurozone members . 
So , even if these countries were to implement the necessary fiscal and structural reforms , an increase of official resources would nonetheless be needed . 
Because nervous investors don &apos;t want to be last in line in case of a run , a disorderly rush to the exits is likely when official resources are insufficient . 
Short of full fiscal unification - or a variant of it in the form of eurozone bonds - this increase in official resources would occur through a much-enlarged European Financial Stability Facility and a much greater commitment by the European Central Bank to long-term bond purchases and liquidity operations to support banks . 
Since quasi-fiscal union implies that the eurozone &apos;s core economies could end up systematically bailing out those on the periphery , only a formal loss of fiscal sovereignty - a credible commitment by the peripheral countries to medium- and long-term fiscal discipline - could overcome the current political resistance of Germany and others . 
But even a larger envelope of official resources is not sufficient to stem the insolvency problems of Greece , Ireland , and , possibly , Portugal and Spain . 
Thus , a second set of policies and institutional reforms requires that all unsecured creditors of banks and other financial institutions need to be &quot; treated &quot; - that is , they must accept losses ( or &quot; haircuts &quot; ) on their claims . 
This is needed to prevent even more private debt being put on government balance sheets , causing a fiscal blowout . 
If orderly treatment of unsecured senior creditors requires a new cross-border regime to close down insolvent European banks , such a regime should be implemented without delay . 
Similarly , super-sovereigns cannot continue to bail out distressed sovereigns that are insolvent rather than illiquid . 
Thus , in addition to an orderly resolution regime for banks , Europe must also implement early orderly restructurings of distressed sovereigns &quot; public debt . 
Waiting until 2013 to implement these restructurings , as German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposes , will destroy confidence , as it implies a much larger haircut on residual private claims on sovereign borrowers . 
Thus , orderly market-based restructurings via exchange offers need to occur in 2011 . 
Such exchange offers can limit private creditors &quot; losses if they are done early . 
That way , formal haircuts on the face value of debt can be avoided via new bonds that include only a maturity extension and an interest-rate cap that is set below today &apos;s unsustainable market rates . 
Waiting to restructure unsustainable debts would only lead to disorderly workouts and severe haircuts for some private creditors . 
Finally , Europe needs policies that restore competitiveness and growth to the eurozone &apos;s periphery , where GDP is either still contracting ( Greece , Spain , and Ireland ) or barely growing ( Italy and Portugal ) . 
Without growth , it will be difficult to stabilize public and private debts and deficits as a share of GDP - the most important indicator of fiscal sustainability . 
Moreover , without growth , the social and political backlash against painful belt-tightening will eventually undermine austerity and reform . 
Unfortunately , fiscal austerity and structural reforms are - at least in the short run - recessionary and deflationary . 
So other policies are needed to restore growth . 
The ECB should pursue a much looser monetary policy to jump-start growth , with a weaker euro to help boost the periphery &apos;s competitiveness . 
In addition , Germany should delay its fiscal consolidation ; if anything , it should cut taxes for a couple of years to boost its own growth and - via trade - that of the periphery . 
In the next few months , it will become clear whether European policymakers can compromise and implement reforms that dampen the threat of a eurozone breakup . 
Either the EU moves in the direction of a more stable equilibrium of closer integration , or the risk of an unstable and disorderly breakup scenario will rise significantly .
