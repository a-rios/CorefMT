Soviet Lessons for Chinese Purges 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - On August 1 , China &apos;s People &apos;s Liberation Army celebrated its 88th anniversary . 
On the eve of the anniversary , the PLA &apos;s former top general , Guo Boxiong , was unceremoniously booted out of the Communist Party and handed over to military prosecutors to face corruption charges , including allegations that he took large bribes from fellow PLA officers in exchange for promotions . 
Guo , a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission , was in charge of the military &apos;s day-to-day affairs from 2002 to 2012 . 
His arrest follows that of General Xu Caihou , who served on the commission from 2007 to 2012 , in June of last year . 
Guo and Xu are not the only senior officers to have fallen since their commander-in-chief , President Xi Jinping , launched his war on corruption at the end of 2012 . 
Based on official data , 39 generals ( including Guo &apos;s son , a major general ) have already been arrested . 
That is precisely the message Xi sent to the military in a recent speech to the 16th army group , for which Xu served as political commissar in the early 1990s . 
After vowing to eradicate Xu &apos;s influence , &quot; ideologically , politically , and also in terms of organization and work style , &quot; Xi stressed that disobedience to the Party leadership would not be tolerated . 
The army must , Xi declared , &quot; resolutely conform to orders from the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission . &quot; 
Anyone who has been watching Xi over the last two and a half years could discern his goal of consolidating Communist Party rule in China by strengthening his personal authority , reinvigorating domestic repression , and pursuing an assertive foreign policy . 
To achieve this goal , Xi needs to secure the PLA &apos;s unimpeachable loyalty - and that requires the purge of unreliable or corrupt officers . 
On a personal level , the PLA &apos;s loyalty is vital to make up for Xi &apos;s lack of an institutional power base . 
By contrast , when former President Jiang Zemin became General Secretary of the Communist Party following the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 , he was able to rely on capable and loyal officials in Shanghai to run the bureaucracy ; he then expanded his support base by co-opting other factions in the 1990s . 
And Jiang &apos;s successor , Hu Jintao , hailed from the Communist Youth League , which has alumni at all levels of the party-state . 
While Xi will work to build a strong power base by gradually appointing his supporters to key positions , he needs the PLA to defend his political authority in the interim . 
The most efficient way for Xi to secure the PLA &apos;s loyalty is to replace its top generals - most of whom were promoted by previous presidents - with his own supporters . 
It seems that the lesson from the fall of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1964 was not lost on Xi . 
Had the Red Army been completely loyal to Khrushchev , the conspirators would not have succeeded . 
But Xi &apos;s plans extend beyond his personal authority - and so do the lessons of the Soviet Union . 
Shortly after Xi &apos;s assumption of power , he lamented to local officials in Guangdong that when the Soviet Union collapsed , the elite had lost the will to fight . 
At a time when the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s political monopoly is increasingly being challenged , Xi will not make that mistake . 
To avoid the Soviet Union &apos;s fate , Xi and his colleagues have re-imposed ideological control and curtailed civil liberties . 
While the Party has so far employed only the police and Internet censors ( and now wants to embed secret policemen within all Internet companies ) , its longer-term survival is inconceivable without a loyal PLA , especially if protests like that in Tiananmen Square in 1989 erupt again . 
The final pillar of Xi &apos;s strategy for solidifying the Communist Party &apos;s authority is to replace Deng Xiaoping &apos;s cautious foreign policy with a muscular one . 
Should China have to back its aggressive tactics in , say , the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait with force , its military must not be led by venal and perfidious generals . 
If Xi &apos;s efforts to root out corruption in the PLA can accomplish these three objectives , one must grudgingly admit that it will be a stroke of political genius . 
Stalin annihilated the Red Army &apos;s officer corps on the eve of Nazi Germany &apos;s invasion . 
Xi cannot afford to make the same mistake .
