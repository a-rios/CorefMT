The Middle East &apos;s Lost Decade 
BERLIN - The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda &apos;s terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 : against Al Qaeda , in Afghanistan , and in Iraq . 
The first two were forced upon the US , but the third was the result of a willful , deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush , taken on ideological grounds and , most likely , for personal reasons as well . 
Had Bush , former Vice President Dick Cheney , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and their neocon allies been forthright about their intentions - to bring down Saddam Hussein by means of war , thereby creating a new , pro-Western Middle East - they never would have received the support of Congress and the American public . 
Their vision was both naive and reckless . 
So a threat - Iraqi weapons of mass destruction - had to be created . 
As we now know , the threat was based on lies ( aluminum tubes for a nuclear-weapons program , for example , meetings between the 9 / 11 plot leader , Mohamed Atta , and Iraqi officials in Prague , and even glaring forgeries like supposed Iraqi orders for yellowcake uranium from Niger ) . 
Such were the justifications for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 US soldiers and more than 100,000 Iraqis . 
Add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes , as well as the destruction of one of the world &apos;s oldest Christian communities . 
For this , the US alone spent up to $ 3 trillion . 
Bush &apos;s war against Saddam did radically change the Middle East , though not as he envisaged . 
For starters , if the US had set out to destabilize Iraq , its efforts could hardly have been more successful : ten years later , the country &apos;s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt . 
With Saddam gone , Iraq &apos;s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war , leaving Iraq &apos;s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy . 
The Kurds in the north cleverly and adeptly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to seize de facto independence , though the key question of control over the northern city of Kirkuk remains a ticking time bomb . 
And all are fighting for as large a share of Iraq &apos;s enormous oil and gas reserves as they can get . 
Taking stock of &quot; Operation Iraqi Freedom &quot; a decade later , the Financial Times concluded that the US won the war , Iran won the peace , and Turkey won the contracts . 
I can only agree . 
In political terms , Iran is the big winner of Bush &apos;s war . 
Its number-one enemy , Saddam , was dispatched by its number-two enemy , the United States , which presented Iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 1746 . 
Bush &apos;s war , with its poor strategic vision and worse planning , increased Iran &apos;s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own . 
The war enabled Iran to assert itself as the dominant power in the Gulf and the wider region , and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambitions . 
The losers in the region are also clear : Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states , which feel existentially threatened , and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column . 
They have a point : with the Shia in power in Iraq , Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims . 
This is what is fueling Bahrain &apos;s domestic turmoil , beyond the Shia majority &apos;s local grievances . 
Leaving aside the lies , fictions , and questions of morality and personal responsibility , the critical mistake of America &apos;s war against Iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to enforce a Pax Americana in the Middle East . 
America was powerful enough to destabilize the existing regional order , but not powerful enough to establish a new one . 
The US neocons , with their wishful thinking , grossly underestimated the scale of the task at hand - unlike the revolutionaries in Iran , who quickly moved in to reap what the US had sowed . 
The Iraq war also marked the beginning of America &apos;s subsequent relative decline . 
Bush squandered a large part of America &apos;s military strength in Mesopotamia for an ideological fiction - strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later . 
And there is no alternative to be seen without America . 
While there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010 , their implications have combined in a malign manner . 
Since the war , the bitter enmities between Al Qaeda and other Salafist and Sunni Arab nationalist groups have given way to cooperation or even mergers . 
This , too , is a result brought about by the American neocon masterminds . 
And the regional destabilization triggered by the Arab revolutions is increasingly converging on Iraq , mainly via Syria and Iran . 
Indeed , the gravest current danger to the region is a process of national disintegration emanating from the Syrian civil war , which is threatening to spread not only to Iraq , but also to Lebanon and Jordan . 
What makes Syria &apos;s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces . 
As a result , the Middle East is at risk of becoming the Balkans of the twenty-first century - a decline into regional chaos that began with , and was largely the result of , the US-led invasion ten years ago .
