Who Lost Turkey ? 
PARIS - &quot; Who lost Turkey ? &quot; 
That question , often raised in the past , has been heating up in the aftermath of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s emotional outburst during the recent World Economic Forum 2009 in Davos , when he abruptly left a panel he was sharing with Israeli President Shimon Peres . 
And the Turkish question matters greatly , because it touches on some of the most unstable and unsettling of the world &apos;s diplomatic disputes . 
If Turkey has indeed been &quot; lost , &quot; those responsible include the European Union , the United States , Israel , and Turkey itself . 
The EU &apos;s growing reservations about Turkey &apos;s membership have been expressed unambiguously by French President Nicolas Sarkozy . 
In the US , former President George W. Bush gets some of the blame because of the war in Iraq . 
Israel , too , has played its part in Turkey &apos;s alienation from the West , as a result of the Lebanon war of 2006 and its recent military operations in Gaza . 
All of these events have disturbed and disoriented Turkey , and are magnified by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 1930 &quot; s . 
Of course , Turkey &apos;s secular , pro-Western elites may still consider the EU and the US important , if not indispensable , allies and partners , and they may consider Islamic fundamentalism , Hamas , Hezbollah , and Iran real or at least potential threats . 
Yet they are also convinced that Europe has behaved improperly toward Turkey , through a combination of short-term populist reflexes and the absence of a long-term strategic vision . 
The Turkish question is , of course , complex . 
Turkey &apos;s geography is predominantly Asian , Turkey &apos;s emotions are increasingly Middle Eastern , i.e. , Muslim on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , and yet Turkey &apos;s elites remain resolutely pro-Western and pro-European . 
But for how long ? 
At the beginning of the twenty-first century , when dialogue with the Islamic world is one of the Western world &apos;s key challenges , Europe would commit a historic strategic blunder if it were to close its doors to Turkey . 
To do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian , Muslim , and Middle Eastern historical trajectory . 
In the question of Turkish accession to the EU , the journey matters more than the destination . 
The reforms that Turkey has already implemented in a very short period of time , thanks to its EU candidate status , are impressive . 
Should we in Europe really put at risk that progress by expressing an all-too-audible &quot; no &quot; ? 
The EU desperately needs a strategic and diplomatic partner that can significantly reinforce its clout in the Middle East . 
Europe also needs the dynamism of a youthful Turkey . 
Above all , it needs the message of reconciliation sent to Islam that Turkey &apos;s entrance into the Union would represent . 
Of course , to want Turkey &quot; in &quot; is an act of will , if not an act of faith that is in many ways counterintuitive . 
Most Europeans do not perceive Turkey as a &quot; European Other &quot; but as a &quot; non-European Other . &quot; 
Even in Istanbul , the most Westernized of Turkish cities , as soon as one leaves the main arteries , one seems to be immersed in a Middle Eastern or Asian culture . 
Israel is not in the European Union , but it , too , is in great danger of losing Turkey . 
Far from reinforcing Israel &apos;s security , its last two military adventures , in Lebanon and now in Gaza , have caused further self-isolation and loss of world sympathy . 
Nowhere has this phenomenon been stronger than in Turkey , where those military escapades have strained the two countries &quot; strategic alliance almost to the breaking point . 
It is too early to speak of Obama &apos;s policy towards Turkey ; suffice it to say that in his willingness to open a respectful dialogue with Islam , he is the only Western leader to move in the right direction . 
But can positive American gestures towards Turkey , a key NATO member , be sufficient to offset Israel &apos;s insensitive , if not reckless , policies ? 
The answer is unclear . 
Turkey , too shares some of the responsibility for this mounting process of estrangement . Erdogan &apos;s behavior in Davos was , at the very least , irresponsible . 
He may have gained popularity back home , but in today &apos;s difficult economic times , the temptations of cheap populism are more dangerous than ever . 
One does not play lightly with matches next to a pile of dry wood .
