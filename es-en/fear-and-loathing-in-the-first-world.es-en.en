Fear and Loathing in the First World 
Within the last few years , people throughout the world &apos;s most advanced economies have become acutely worried about the economic prowess of China , India , and other emerging countries with large low-wage populations . 
They fear for their own jobs and for their children &apos;s future in a world where they must compete alongside the world &apos;s poorest . 
Those fears are testing political leaders in the world &apos;s richest countries . 
Newspaper stories are an indicator of this rising concern . 
I searched the Lexis-Nexis database of English-language newspaper stories around the world that contained all three of the words &quot; outsourcing , &quot; &quot; jobs , &quot; and &quot; India . &quot; 
In 1999 , Lexis-Nexis produced only 39 stories ; by 2003 , there were 749 stories . 
In the first six months of 2004 , there were already 1208 stories . 
The results were much the same when I searched &quot; outsourcing , &quot; &quot; jobs , &quot; and &quot; China . &quot; 
I found similar growth in the use of these three terms together when I searched in French , German , Italian , and Spanish : 90 % of the stories were in 2003 and 2004 . 
Why this explosion of concern ? 
After all , advanced countries have been losing manufacturing jobs to less developed countries for more than fifty years . 
One reason is that the expanding development and use of new information technology , notably cell phones and the Internet , shrinks the world and makes competition from abroad more plausible . 
In fact , new technologies are probably the most important reason why globalization is advancing at a rapid pace . 
Cell phones and the Internet link the minds of many people in different countries effortlessly and efficiently , encouraging trade in intellectual creations . 
At the same time , the new information technology makes us more aware that the kinds of jobs that are migrating to India and China are high-quality jobs , the jobs for educated and skilled people . 
Over the last fifty years , people in advanced countries have increasingly sought university education and specialized training to protect them from an unforgiving labor market . 
Now First-Worlders are uncertain whether even this will protect their economic status . 
Increased fear of competition from emerging countries is also a natural consequence of the collapse of the speculative bubble in equities in 2000 ; stock markets in some countries fell to less than half their peak value . 
Once we saw our exaggerated hopes for our investments failing , we began to consider our other sources of income and wealth , only to confront the worldwide economic slowdown that began in 2001 . 
Increased economic anxiety has , unsurprisingly , fueled increasing unease about foreign competition . 
Earlier this year , I surveyed people who recently bought homes in four American cities . 
My questionnaire asked : &quot; Do you worry that your ( or your household &apos;s ) ability to earn as much income in future years as you expect might be in danger because of changes in the economy ( someone in China competing for your job , a computer replacing your job , etc . ) ? &quot; 
Of 442 respondents , 11 % answered , &quot; Yes , I worry a lot , &quot; 36 % replied , &quot; Yes , I worry a little , &quot; and 52 % said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t worry at all . &quot; 
Thus , while most respondents said they were not worried , nearly half expressed some worry . 
I asked this question of recent homebuyers on the theory that fear of job loss might help explain the remarkable boom in home prices in the US ( as well as many other advanced countries ) . 
After all , people who fear losing their jobs may seek greater economic security by investing in real property in their own wealthy country , bidding up prices in the process . 
My survey &apos;s results lend some support to this theory . 
Although 81 % of the respondents said fear of job loss had no effect on their decision to buy a house , of those who said it did , the number who said it encouraged home purchase outnumbered those who said it discouraged home purchase by a margin of two to one . 
Growing fear of foreign competition ought to explain a lot of things in the future . 
People used to feel insulated from economic problems that occurred beyond their country &apos;s borders . 
No more . 
Fear of competition from abroad is now fundamental , and will change the political process in advanced and relatively advanced emerging countries throughout the world . 
It helps explain the rise of protectionism , and the failure of the WTO trade talks in Cancun last September to improve emerging countries &apos; access to advanced-country markets . 
As a professor , I find that my students often ask me for career advice with a different tone than in the past . 
What I hear is a fundamental lack of confidence that they will do well in any chosen career . 
They want to figure out how they can compete with Chinese or Indian workers who have the same , or better , education . 
Despite bravado about American superiority , the students themselves do not seem to feel superior , and wonder if they will be living emerging-country lives of their own in coming years . 
This sudden fear of emerging countries presents a major dilemma . 
The fear is real and visceral , and politicians ignore it at their peril . 
Its further increase could lead to counterproductive protectionist measures . 
We must not let this happen . 
The emerging countries are doing nothing more blameworthy than working towards their place as equals alongside advanced countries . 
It is morally and practically vital that they succeed .
