Impotent America ? 
JERUSALEM - Israel &apos;s 60th anniversary has come and gone . 
Amidst the celebrations and the soul-searching , no meaningful breakthrough in the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is visible . 
There are immediate reasons why this is so : Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s government is weak and unpopular , mainly due to the botched 2006 war against Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
The Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas is even weaker , having lost control of Gaza to Hamas after a violent putsch last year . 
On the Palestinian side , this is part of a deeper phenomenon : a longstanding failure to create the institutional structures necessary for nation building . 
For example , in 1936-1939 , a Palestinian uprising against British rule deteriorated into a bloody civil war , in which more Palestinians were killed by their brethren than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces . 
This is repeating itself now in Gaza . 
Looking back at 60 years of American involvement in the region , one can discern two scenarios in which the United States can bring the local players to an agreement . 
Absent these conditions , the US is ultimately powerless . 
The first scenario is when a real war threatens to spill over into a wider conflict , destabilizing the region and Great Power relations . 
At such times , resolute American steps can stop the fighting and impose a cease-fire , if not peace . 
In 1973 , at the end of the Yom Kippur War , Israel was poised to encircle the entire Egyptian Third Army in Sinai . 
Its troops were on the road to Cairo , threatening to inflict a major defeat on Egypt . 
Soviet intervention became a real threat . 
A few tough messages from President Richard Nixon stopped the Israelis in their tracks and enabled the Americans to start a lengthy process of de-escalation that led to a number of interim agreements . 
Likewise , in 1982 , during the invasion of Lebanon , Israeli troops were about to enter Muslim West Beirut after Syrian agents assassinated the pro-Israeli Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel . 
This would probably have brought Syria into the war . 
A few tough calls from President Ronald Reagan to Prime Minister Menachem Begin prevented this . 
During the first Gulf War in 1991 , when Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israeli civilian targets and US forces failed to stop the Iraqi attacks , Israel was set to strike Iraqi targets , which would have split the US-Arab anti-Iraq coalition . 
The US warned Israel not to get involved , and Israel was forced to comply . 
In all these cases , American involvement was swift and focused on a clear aim , and compliance was verifiable within days , if not hours . 
In such dramatic situations , US power is at its greatest . 
The other scenario is when the two sides have already engaged in bilateral peace talks , paid the domestic political price , and reached agreement on most issues , though some matters remain unresolved and threaten to derail the process . 
In such cases , America can step in and , by using both carrot and stick , make both sides go the extra mile . 
After Anwar Sadat &apos;s visit to Jerusalem in 1977 , Israel and Egypt negotiated for a year and reached agreement on most issues : peace , diplomatic relations , and full Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Egyptian territory in Sinai . 
At this point , President Jimmy Carter - who initially opposed the process - invited both sides to Camp David to hammer out a peace treaty . 
In 1993 , in secret bilateral negotiations in Norway ( unknown to the Americans ) , Israel and the PLO reached an agreement about mutual recognition and the creation of a provisional Palestinian Autonomous Authority . 
Yet some issues remained unresolved . 
President Bill Clinton stepped in , and prevailed upon the two sides to work out their remaining disagreements . 
When either of these two scenarios is lacking , American initiatives are stillborn . 
This happened to Clinton at Camp David in 2000 , when he failed to bring Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to an agreement , and to Bush &apos;s Road Map in 2003 , when both sides agreed in principle to its general guidelines , but did little to implement them . 
Absent local political will , and when confronted with a peace-making project that may take years to complete , the US is virtually powerless . 
It is extremely successful as a fire brigade or as a midwife , but not as an initiator . 
What applies to the US is even truer for the European Union , whose &quot; soft power &quot; is no match for its lack of local credibility . 
The same dynamic can be seen elsewhere : for all its power , the US has failed to resolve the conflicts in Cyprus , Bosnia , or Kosovo . 
The Annan Plan failed in Cyprus because of one party &apos;s opposition ; progress now ( the minor but symbolically important opening of the Ledra Street crossing in downtown Nicosia ) reflects internal political changes on the Greek Cypriot side . 
Similarly , if Belgrade will change its obstreperous position on Kosovo , this will be due not to US or EU pressure , but to internal political changes in Serbia . 
Recognizing the limits of US power doesn &apos;t mean that America is irrelevant : it can stabilize a conflict , help bring about confidence-building measures , and negotiate interim agreements . 
But at the end of the day , in the case of Israel-Palestine , as in any conflict between two national movements , the key is in the hands of the local players . 
No national conflict has ever been solved by outside powers , however well intentioned they may be .
