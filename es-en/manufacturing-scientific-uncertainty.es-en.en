Manufacturing Scientific Uncertainty 
For decades , the tobacco industry manufactured more than just cigarettes . 
While aggressively marketing tobacco products , they also waged a successful public relations campaign designed to create uncertainty about the destructive and lethal characteristics of their products . 
Though discovery of these efforts has come too late for many tobacco smokers , documents unearthed in lawsuits have revealed concerted efforts to avoid the imposition of government regulation by attacking public health science and scientists . 
There are few scientific challenges more complex than understanding the causes of disease in humans . 
Scientists cannot feed toxic chemicals to people , for example , to see what doses cause cancer . 
Instead , scientists must harness the &quot; natural experiments &quot; in which exposures have already occurred . 
To be sure , in the laboratory , scientists use animals in controlled experimental conditions to investigate the workings of toxic agents . 
But , like epidemiological evidence , laboratory studies have many uncertainties , and scientists must extrapolate from study-specific evidence to make judgments about causation and recommend protective measures . 
Absolute certainty is rarely an option . 
Nevertheless , much scientific &quot; uncertainty &quot; about the causes of disease is not real , but manufactured . 
Years ago , a tobacco executive unwisely committed to paper the perfect slogan for his industry &apos;s disinformation campaign : &quot; Doubt is our product . &quot; 
For 50 years , tobacco companies employed a stable of scientists to assert ( sometimes under oath ) that they did not believe there was conclusive evidence that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer . 
Less well known , but following the same pattern , are efforts being mounted to question studies documenting the adverse health effects of exposure to lead , mercury , vinyl chloride , chromium , beryllium , benzene , and a long list of pesticides and other toxic chemicals . 
Polluters and manufacturers of dangerous products hire experts in what they call &quot; product defense &quot; to dissect every study whose findings they oppose , highlighting flaws and inconsistencies . 
In many cases , they won &apos;t deny that a relationship exists between the exposure and the disease , but are quick to proclaim that &quot; the evidence is inconclusive . &quot; 
These industries have learned that by focusing the debate on uncertainties in the science ( and the need for more research ) , it is possible to avoid a debate on public policy . 
This can delay for years the expenditures required to protect people &apos;s health and the environment . 
Nowadays , the most well known ( and probably best financed ) campaign to manufacture scientific doubt is being waged by the fossil fuel industry in an effort to impugn scientists &quot; work on issues related to climate change . 
When confronted by an overwhelming worldwide scientific consensus on the contribution of human activity to global warming over the past century , the industry and its political allies follow the tobacco road . 
Evidence of this surfaced when Frank Luntz , a leading Republican political consultant , sent a strategy memo to his clients in 2002 . 
Luntz asserted that &quot; The scientific debate remains open . Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming in the scientific community . 
Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled , their views about global warming will change accordingly . &quot; 
In parallel to their attempts to delay or prevent regulation through assertions of scientific uncertainty , polluters and manufacturers of hazardous products have promoted the &quot; junk science &quot; movement , which attempts to influence public opinion by ridiculing scientists whose research threatens powerful interests , irrespective of the quality of that scientist &apos;s research . 
&quot; Junk science &quot; advocates allege that many scientific studies ( and even scientific methods ) used in the regulatory and legal arenas are fundamentally flawed , contradictory , or incomplete . 
Every first-year public health student is taught how John Snow stopped a cholera epidemic in London . 
During a ten-day period in September 1854 , during which more than 500 Londoners died from the disease , Snow used a city map to mark the location of each household with a case of cholera . 
He determined that Londoners who drank from one particular water source were at the highest risk for the disease , and he recommended removal of the handle from the pump supplying drinking water from that source . 
By using the best evidence available at the time , hundreds of additional deaths were avoided . 
If government officials in London had demanded absolute certainty , the epidemic might have continued for another 30 years until the cholera bacterium was identified . 
The manufacturing of scientific uncertainty endangers the public &apos;s health , as well as programs to protect public health and to compensate victims . 
It is time to return to first principles : use the best science available , but do not demand certainty where it does not exist .
