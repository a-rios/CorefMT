The Right Weights for Mortgage Risks 
ABU DHABI - Ever since hunter-gatherers started to build their own dwellings some 14,000 years ago , homeownership has been a mark of high social and economic status . 
Today , the United States has built a mammoth financial bureaucracy to promote homeownership , and economists , bankers , politicians , and of course homeowners themselves keenly follow house-price indicators . 
But , as we have recently witnessed , unless mortgage risks are properly calculated , the dream of homeownership can all too easily become an economic nightmare . 
Mortgage debt has become households &quot; biggest liability throughout the developed world . 
In the decade preceding the financial crisis , US mortgage debt increased almost threefold , while the real economy grew by only one-third . 
The six major banking crises in the advanced economies since the mid-1970s were all associated with a housing bust . 
A real-estate price crash has also been a key cause of emerging-market crises , such as the 1997-98 Asian collapse . 
Research shows that lost output during recessions accompanied by a housing bust is double or triple what it might otherwise have been had real-estate prices held up . 
Moreover , housing busts tend to prolong recessions by almost three years . 
Given the enormous social and economic costs when high levels of mortgage debt meet a crash in house prices , one would expect regulators to be fully engaged on the issue . 
Although the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , the primary global benchmark for bank regulations , proposed reforms after the 2008 crisis that are aimed at strengthening the financial system , mortgage regulations have changed little . 
The key to mortgage regulation is the concept of &quot; risk weight , &quot; a measure that increases with the probability that a borrower will default . 
For example , a loan to AAA-rated Microsoft has a 0 % risk weight , meaning that it is virtually risk-free . 
A loan to the Indian government will have a risk weight of 50 % , and one to a riskier Argentina will be weighted at 150 % . 
When it comes to mortgages , the standard risk weight is 35 % ( down from 50 % a decade ago ) . 
But banks can use internal mathematical models to calculate their own risk weights . 
This is akin to marking one &apos;s own exam paper ; unsurprisingly , banks &quot; risk scores are usually on the safe side . 
Consider , for example , a $ 200,000 bank loan to buy a $ 235,000 home . 
If the bank attaches a 10 % risk weight to the loan , the risk-weighted equivalent is $ 20,000 . 
If the amount of bank capital needed to protect that risk-weighted equivalent is 10 % , then the bank requires just $ 2,000 of its own capital to fund the mortgage , $ 198,000 of which the bank itself borrows . 
All it takes to wipe out the bank &apos;s own money is a 16 % drop in the house &apos;s price ( from $ 235,000 to below $ 198,000 ) . 
US house prices - as measured by the S P / Case-Shiller National Home Price Index - fell by more than 30 % from June 2006 to March 2009 , while European countries , including Spain , Ireland , and the United Kingdom , experienced similar or greater declines . 
The problem is that banks continue to offer big mortgages while having little of their own &quot; skin in the game . &quot; 
The IMF estimates that the average mortgage risk weight in Europe and Asia was 14 % and 15 % , respectively , with some banks using a risk weight as low as 6 % . 
Recently , some regulators have become suspicious of banks &quot; do-it-yourself risk weights . 
In 2012 , the UK authorities asked banks to apply a temporary minimum 15 % risk weight to their mortgage portfolios , though that guidance expired in July . 
The Swedish regulator has recommended that mortgage lenders raise their risk-weight floor from 15 % to 25 % . 
Although welcome , these steps may still be too little ; more important , they lack flexibility . 
A better option would be to implement time-varying , pro-cyclical floors , forcing banks to hold more capital during housing booms . 
And , whereas a single , fixed floor might push banks toward riskier loans that offer higher returns for the same amount of capital , a dynamic system would allow lower floors for the lowest-risk mortgages and require higher floors for riskier loans . 
Moreover , while risk weight is an important macro-prudential lever , it must be used in conjunction with regulators &quot; other tools . 
It is important to calibrate the impact of risk weights on housing-market cycles relative to other measures , not least because excessive and overlapping intervention could itself fuel dangerous cycles . 
The reliance of modern banking regulation on risk weighting is nowhere more important than in the mortgage market . 
If regulators get it wrong , the entire edifice could collapse - yet again .
