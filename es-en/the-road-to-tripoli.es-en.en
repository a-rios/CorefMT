The Road to Tripoli 
BENGHAZI - In the days since the February 17 revolution against Libyan leader Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi , opposition forces in Benghazi have formed a Transitional National Council ( TNC ) and a Crisis Team ( CT ) to serve as an interim government . 
The two groups are drawn from a cross-section of society . 
Some members held senior posts in Qaddafi &apos;s government ; others were social activists . 
Both groups are now quite popular among the population in rebel-controlled parts of Libya . 
But if rebel troops are unable to advance toward the capital of Tripoli , and instead remain deadlocked with Qaddafi &apos;s forces between the towns of Ajdabiyya and Brega , the opposition will face a serious dilemma . 
A military impasse could erode their support and even delegitimize them . 
When forming the councils , the opposition sought to achieve a balance between government experience , technical expertise , and tribal support . 
Thus , while some members , such as former Justice Minister and TNC Chairman Mustafa Abdel-Jalil , were affiliated with Qaddafi &apos;s government , others , such as CT Economic and Finance chief Ali Tarhouni , have lived outside of Libya for almost 30 years . 
And powerful clans from Tobruk have succeeded in placing their members in key military positions . 
The councils are , moreover , largely a regional affair , with members mostly coming from eastern Libya . 
Those with roots in the western regions are mainly dissidents who have lived abroad for decades . TNC officials admit that some council members are based in western Libya , but have refused to identify them for security reasons . 
The two bodies are far from uniform and monolithic . 
Conflicts have already erupted between TNC members as well as between members of the military leadership . Bolstered by his high profile as Justice Minister , Jalil has emerged as an interim leader . But once the TNC makes the transition toward becoming an elected body , the more charismatic CT Director Mahmoud Jibril and the astute council spokesman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga may emerge as the rebels &quot; true leaders . 
On the military side , simmering tensions between two officers are frustrating combat strategy . Colonel Khalifa Hifter , a close Qaddafi supporter before he deserted following his capture by Chadian forces in 1987 during Libya &apos;s war with its southern neighbor , has proved unwilling to fall into line behind the chief of staff , former Interior Minister Abdul Fatah Younis . Such political and military spats are likely to continue as officials attempt to consolidate their positions . 
The two groups are hard-pressed to formulate a clear political and social platform . 
TNC and CT members are largely unified in their desire to end Qaddafi &apos;s 41-year rule and redistribute the country &apos;s wealth to the country &apos;s long-neglected eastern region . 
As a result , they have not articulated a coherent vision of a post-Qaddafi Libya . 
And , though the two councils are certainly staffed by people with the technical credentials needed to manage the economy , few members have any real political skills or experience overseeing bureaucratic bodies . 
So far , these shortcomings have not prevented the TNC from achieving widespread support in the rebel-controlled east . 
Inhabitants of Benghazi praise Abdul Jalil and his colleagues . 
Municipal councils in Bayda , Darna , and Tobruk have pledged their support for the TNC , and fighters who battled American forces in Iraq have lined up behind the body &apos;s military leaders . 
People here are content to be free from Qaddafi &apos;s erratic policies and pervasive security services . 
&quot; Anyone but Qaddafi , &quot; one man in Tobruk told me . 
This partly explains why Libyans are willing to embrace dissidents who lived abroad for decades , about whom they know little . 
This warm welcome contrasts with Iraqi distrust of the political exiles who returned on the coattails of the American overthrow of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime in 2003 . 
But support for the TNC is largely skin deep - it is neither grounded in knowledge of how the opaque council functions , nor based on an understanding of its goals . 
As such , once the initial euphoria dissipates , Libyans are likely to turn against the TNC if it cannot deliver battlefield successes . 
With the rebels lacking professional military training and discipline , such gains look increasingly unlikely . 
To ensure that the rebels have a fighting chance against Qaddafi &apos;s better-equipped troops , Western countries will have to move beyond air strikes and offering the TNC diplomatic recognition . They will need to provide medium-range rockets and light armored vehicles to anti-regime forces , in addition to training them to use their weapons properly . Such a mission will require sending hundreds more military specialists to Libya than the few dozen that Britain , France , and Italy have pledged . 
Without a large influx of instructors and weapons , the rebels will not be able to advance toward the capital , Tripoli , in the coming months . Such a stalemate is likely to leave Libyans frustrated with the council . 
And the vague slogans that its leaders are currently offering will likely be viewed as hollow promises . 
Since the council &apos;s legitimacy stems exclusively from Libyan good will and blind faith , rather than from success at the ballot box , this could be devastating . 
In a few short weeks , the Libyan opposition has been able to win the support of the population in the east without accomplishing much more than forming a provisional political body . 
To maintain that support , however , opposition leaders must ensure that they can respond to their constituents &quot; demands . 
And , above all , that means piling up military victories on the road to Tripoli .
