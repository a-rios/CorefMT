The Periphery &apos;s Purgatory 
ATHENS - German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s upcoming visit to Athens will be a far less tense affair than her earlier journeys here during Europe &apos;s long financial crisis . 
Of course , Greeks have little love for Merkel ; but , thanks to Europe &apos;s modest economic recovery , some of the poison has been drawn from Germany &apos;s relations with Europe &apos;s most damaged and distressed economies . 
Indeed , Europe is no longer considered a risk to global financial stability . 
The eurozone &apos;s core economies are showing signs of revival , and financial conditions in the over-indebted periphery are improving as well . 
But , given capital shortages , depressed demand , and the slow pace of reform in the eurozone periphery , continued progress is far from certain . 
In the eurozone economies that were hit hardest by the global economic crisis , the output and employment losses have been huge and persistent . 
Real ( inflation-adjusted ) per capita income in the eurozone as a whole hovers around its 2007 level ; in Greece and Italy , however , it has sunk to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997 , respectively . 
Meanwhile , the eurozone &apos;s overall unemployment rate is 12 % , and it is much higher in the periphery . 
In Spain , more than 25 % of the labor force is jobless , while Italy &apos;s youth unemployment rate stands at 42 % . 
In Greece , where the overall unemployment rate has climbed to 28 % , some 60 % of the country &apos;s young people are unemployed . 
Recovering from such crippling employment losses will not be easy , and will require a speedy return to high and sustainable growth rates . 
Consider Greece , where the government is planning a return to the capital markets in the coming months to finance the country &apos;s long-term borrowing needs , even though securing such financing would require paying unsustainably high interest rates . 
The fact that the government seems willing to do so translates clearly its desire to move beyond the influence of the &quot; troika &quot; ( the International Monetary Fund , the European Commission , and the European Central Bank ) . 
Indeed , since 2008 , Greece &apos;s GDP has shrunk by almost 25 % . 
Recovering lost capacity will require large amounts of capital , but there are five reasons why such financing is unlikely , under present conditions , to be forthcoming : 
· As a result of austerity , public investment as a share of GDP continues to fall and has now reached a record low . 
Having already committed substantial rescue funds , eurozone authorities do not seem inclined to inject fresh capital . 
· Sources of domestic private capital are limited , because the recession and the related near-collapse of asset prices , along with a sharp increase in taxation - particularly on high incomes and on capital - significantly weakened balance sheets . 
· Bank lending has slowed drastically , as a result of Greek banks effectively defaulting in the wake of the troika-imposed losses on sovereign creditors and the nationalization of the country &apos;s banks . 
A record-low level of deposits and the recession-related rise of non-performing loans have weakened Greek banks &quot; capital position further . 
( Today , companies in the eurozone periphery borrow at substantially higher rates than their counterparts in the core . 
· Greece &apos;s unsustainable debt position is discouraging foreign private investment . 
The assumptions about primary surpluses , private-sector involvement , and GDP growth underlying the government &apos;s commitment to reduce its debt level , which currently exceeds 170 % of GDP , to 124 % of GDP by 2020 cannot be realized , given Germany &apos;s opposition to restructuring the official financing that replaced the defaulted private loans . 
Some easing of loan conditionality - via extended maturities and reduced interest rates ‒ will be agreed later this year , but it will not be enough to calm fears of a new default . 
· Trust between foreign and Greek investors is lacking , and it will not be restored until debt sustainability is achieved . 
But Germany and the other core eurozone countries consistently block any proposal that contemplates debt mutualization or fiscal union . 
Ideas such as Eurobonds , a single European finance ministry , and increased capitalization of Europe &apos;s common rescue funds ( the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism ) are not even being contemplated . 
Along with inadequate capital supply , Greece is suffering from a demand shortfall , as the troika continues to squeeze the country with harsh austerity . 
If these policies are not relaxed or offset by more expansionary policies in the eurozone core , demand will remain depressed , discouraging further investment . 
Finally , on the reform front , time is running out . 
For the last few years , rather than confronting the special interests - state-protected businesses , public-sector trade unions , and lobbies - that inhibit reform , Greece has spread its economic misery horizontally through blanket spending cuts . 
Reforms such as privatizing state-owned enterprises , opening up closed professions , abolishing restrictive business practices , and reducing the size of the public sector have been undertaken very slowly and inefficiently , and they will not significantly alter growth prospects . 
As it stands , Greece is unlikely to meet the recovery challenge - and other peripheral economies will probably falter , too . 
Sufficient reforms and capital are lacking , while the social rifts resulting from austerity increase the risk of potentially devastating political instability . 
Should financial turbulence return and herald a new eurozone crisis , the monetary union &apos;s sustainability will again be called into question . 
To prevent this outcome , Greece and the eurozone &apos;s other peripheral economies must limit austerity , buttress demand , undertake reform , increase investment support , and pursue fiscal union . 
Unfortunately , these keys to ensuring a cohesive and prosperous eurozone are likely to be left unturned - until , perhaps , the next crisis occurs .
