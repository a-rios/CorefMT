Marketing Nationalism in China 
Explanations abound for the fevered anti-Japanese protests that broke out across China last month . 
From the Chinese perspective , of course , the blame falls on the Japanese government for its reluctance to apologize for the crimes Japan committed in WW II . 
But the Chinese media also played an ignominious role , publishing slanted articles on Japan that helped to fan the fire . 
Nationalism has been a prominent element in Chinese media in recent years . 
Strident articles critical of the United States , Japan , and Taiwan appear with increasing frequency and receive ever more prominent placement . 
Many see the government &apos;s hand behind this trend , but focusing on official influence risks overlooking how market pressures have pushed China &apos;s media in this direction . 
Before China began opening its economy in 1978 , all newspapers and magazines were &quot; Party newspapers &quot; and &quot; Party magazines . &quot; 
Media bosses were appointed and controlled by the government . 
Journalists and editors were , in effect , government officials . 
Needless to say , all operating costs were born by the Communist Party and the state , and nobody was much concerned about making money . 
The main concern was not attracting readers , listeners , and viewers , but avoiding political mistakes . 
For newspapers and magazines , circulation was guaranteed by the government , which urged people to &quot; study the Party newspapers &quot; and forced work units to buy them . 
Radio and TV enjoyed the same built-in audience . 
In the 30 years following the establishment of the People &apos;s Republic of China , no media outlet ran even a single commercial advertisement . 
As Deng Xiaoping &apos;s reforms evolved , and especially after Deng &apos;s &quot; tour of the South &quot; in 1992 , when he signaled permission for high-speed marketization of the economy , China &apos;s media changed beyond recognition . 
Whereas in 1978 there were only 186 newspapers and a handful of magazines and broadcast outlets , today China has roughly 2,200 newspapers , 9,000 magazines , 1,000 radio stations , and 420 TV stations , plus a growing proliferation of cable TV outlets . 
Most of these outlets no longer receive full financial support from the government and must rely on advertising revenue to survive and grow . 
What topics do consumers most care about ? 
One is government corruption . 
As economic inequities and social conflict in China have grown more acute , ordinary people have become increasingly angry . 
In these circumstances , many on the business side of the Chinese media regard critical reports on crime and official corruption as a powerful weapon in the fight for greater market share and profitability . 
Owing to great sensitivity about stories that cast China &apos;s leadership in a bad light , these popular reports are frequently banned , editors are fired , and media outlets that publish or broadcast them are often punished . 
In some cases , they are shut down . 
Prevented from criticizing the country &apos;s leaders and reporting fully and objectively on domestic affairs , China &apos;s media often finds it expedient to turn its critical gaze outwards . 
This is politically safe , since , in one sense , to criticize the outside world , especially countries such as Japan and the US , is to praise China &apos;s government . 
It is also profitable . 
Even as China &apos;s position in the world continues to rise and its people become more self-confident , China &apos;s history of weakness before the Western powers and Japan sustains a &quot; victim culture &quot; that leaves most Chinese sensitive to any foreign challenge . 
Publishing jingoistic , anti-foreign articles plays to national sensitivities that always simmer , and thus can easily be brought to a boil , with obvious benefits for the bottom line . 
A personal anecdote serves to illustrate how the market , as much as government censorship by the Department of Propaganda and the Press and Publications Administration , is often responsible for this type of editorial decision . 
A few years ago , the editors of a Beijing-based weekly with which I am acquainted were deadlocked over which article to put on their front page . 
The choice was between a minor story critical of Taiwan and a larger piece about a domestic issue of potentially historic significance . 
Unable to get his staff to reach a consensus , the chief executive decided to ask the newspaper &apos;s distributor for his opinion . 
The distributor had not graduated from high school , but he knew readers &quot; tastes well . 
&quot; Condemn Taiwan , of course , &quot; he said . 
The chief executive issued his order accordingly . 
While reports that cater to the sometimes virulent nationalist sentiments of readers , viewers , and listeners can succeed in garnering a larger market share - as in any other capitalist country - they can also mislead . 
The media may make money , but as the recent anti-Japan protests suggests , an excess of such market-driven jingoism can damage a nation &apos;s interests and international standing . 
As the old Chinese expression goes , qihu , nanxia : &quot; Once one gets on the back of a tiger , it is hard to get off . &quot;
