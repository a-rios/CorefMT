Oiling Russia \ u0027s Finances 
The global oil situation is particularly interesting at the moment . 
At around $ 30 a barrel , oil prices are remaining high even though a soft global economy means that world demand is low . 
The previously fashionable view that the American seizure of Iraqi oil resources would break OPEC and send the price of oil plummeting has turned out to be nonsense . 
Even with improved security , it will take five years to get Iraq oil fully on stream . 
With the American economy now recovering strongly , the price of oil should stay high , or even rise further , in the foreseeable future . 
So the announcement by Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin that Russia will start an oil stabilization fund comes at a good moment . 
It means that the fund can look forward to several years of surpluses . 
This is both an opportunity and a danger . 
An oil fund should be seen as an instrument of macroeconomic stabilization , segregated from normal revenue streams . 
Today most of the world &apos;s finance ministers are committed to balancing the budget over the business cycle . 
Government revenues are set to equal government spending when the economy is growing normally . 
If output grows above trend , the budget is in surplus ; if it grows below trend , the budget is in deficit . 
Surpluses are applied to repaying debt , and borrowing finances deficits . 
If the finance minister gets his sums right , the national debt remains the same over the cycle , with no tendency to grow or contract . 
A constant debt-GDP ratio is thus a key indicator of fiscal sustainability . 
In a country like Russia , half of whose budget revenues are derived from taxes on oil , setting up an oil fund is the equivalent of a commitment to balance the budget over the cycle . 
Only in this case , it is an oil price cycle . 
This strategy is dictated by the fact that oil prices are more volatile - and therefore more destabilizing for the budget - than fluctuations in GDP . 
Government taxes and spending are set to balance at the average oil price over a period of years . 
The oil fund accumulates surpluses and incurs deficits when the price of oil is above or below the average . 
Surpluses are used to pay off debt , and the deficits are financed by acquiring debt , leaving the debt-GDP ratio constant over the cycle . 
A fund that works like this sends a strong signal that the government is committed to sound long-term finance . 
The key to success is to realize that an oil fund is a limited instrument for a specific purpose . 
The danger is that officials will be tempted to use it to solve other problems , which will destroy its usefulness as a stabilising mechanism . 
The first danger is that politicians will spend the surpluses on vote-winning social programmes . 
This happened in Venezuela . 
The best way to guard against this is to open a special account with an independent central bank , where the fund can be kept safely out of the reach of politicians . 
This is what Norway does . 
A more subtle danger is that the fund will be seen as a direct means to combat the so-called &quot; Dutch disease . &quot; 
This is a situation where earnings from oil exports drive up the value of the currency , reducing the competitiveness of other domestically produced products . 
Investing fund surpluses in foreign securities would counteract the tendency for the exchange rate to rise . 
This is true , but the same result can be achieved by paying off foreign debt , which is a better policy , especially at the outset , when the fund is trying to build up credibility . 
Of course , it is important that Russia becomes less dependent on energy exports . 
Properly used , an oil fund can contribute to this aim , but it should do so indirectly , by promoting domestic financial stability . 
This will enable low real interest rates , which ( together with bank reform ) is the main condition for the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises needed to diversify the economic structure and ensure a more stable pattern of growth .
