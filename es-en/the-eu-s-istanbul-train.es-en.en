The EU \ u0027s Istanbul Train 
The Islamic and non-Islamic worlds now seem locked in a vicious circle of hatred , one that is convincing many moderates on both sides that the cultural and political divide is too large to bridge . 
This fatalistic vision is tragic and could become a self-fulfilling nightmare . 
In this context , Europe &apos;s dickering over Turkey &apos;s possible membership in the European Union takes on a special significance for the world . 
Turkey &apos;s membership will likely be discussed at December &apos;s Copenhagen summit of EU leaders . 
Since the 1960s , there has been loose talk in Western Europe that Turkey might one day become a member of the European Community , now the EU . 
But no practical steps towards membership took place as Europe regularly - and rightly - pointed out that Turkey had failed to fulfill many conditions for membership , especially in regard to respect for human rights and the rule of law . 
Yet lurking beneath those specific issues is a more general worry : whether Europe would accept Turkey , an Islamic society , into the European fold under any conditions . 
Anti-Islamic feelings run deep across Europe , reflecting 1,000 years of rivalry , war , and cultural clashes . 
Many Turks fear that their country &apos;s exclusion from the EU has nothing to do with specific policies or institutions , but rather with Europe &apos;s permanent hostility to Islamic societies . 
With eastward enlargement of the EU now poised to happen , it is no surprise that deeply felt and dangerous notions are rising to the surface . 
Former French President Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing , currently the President of the Convention on the Future of Europe , recently declared that &quot; Turkey is not a European country , &quot; and that Turkey &apos;s admission to the EU would be &quot; the end of Europe . &quot; 
Advocates of Turkey &apos;s admission , he continued , are &quot; the adversaries of the European Union . &quot; 
As both an admirer of the EU and a supporter of Turkey &apos;s accession to the EU , I believe Giscard wrong in his crude characterization . 
Yet I know that he reflects a deep-seated viewpoint , though one far from claiming a majority in Europe . 
Several years ago , I heard another leading public figure in Europe explain in a public lecture that Europe is a Christian society and therefore can never admit an Islamic member . 
Giscard &apos;s outburst was provocative for another reason . 
Turkey has just demonstrated the vibrancy of its democratic credentials by holding national elections despite a deep economic crisis . 
The winner was the Justice and Development Party . 
The new Prime Minister , Abdullah Gul , immediately declared gaining accession to Europe a priority . 
&quot; Our aim is to show the world that a country which has a Muslim population can also be democratic , transparent , modern , and cooperative with the world . &quot; 
To now rule out Turkish membership in the EU would be needlessly provocative . 
The founder of the modern Turkish state , &quot; taturk , &quot; accomplished an enormous amount three-quarters of a century ago to bring Turkish political , cultural , and economic institutions into line with those of Europe . 
After World War II , Turkey was a recipient of Marshall Plan aid , joined the Council of Europe in 1949 , joined NATO in 1952 , became an associate member of the European Union in 1964 , applied for membership in the European Community in 1987 , and completed a customs union with Europe in 1995 . 
So its quest for EU membership has deep roots . 
If Europe conducts serious negotiations with Turkey over eventual accession , the results will benefit both parties and also the wider world . 
On the economic front , the move towards membership would force Turkey to continue to upgrade its institutions and to enhance the rule of law , thus adding long-term institutional stability to Turkey &apos;s political institutions , which will in turn help stabilize North Africa and the Middle East . 
Each accession to the EU over the past quarter century , such as Spain and Portugal &apos;s drive before 1986 , and more recently the efforts of the Central European postcommunist candidates , has spurred institutional modernization and contributed to stability and moderation in domestic politics . 
The &quot; prize &quot; of European membership has helped to forge political consensus within candidate countries , and the same would happen with Turkey . 
By spurring this institutional reform , moreover , economic prospects also brighten , not least by Turkey &apos;s ability to attract larger flows of foreign direct investment . 
On the political front , the worldwide demonstration effect of Turkey &apos;s membership in the EU would have huge consequences . 
The claims of the Islamic fundamentalists - that the West is anti-Islamic - would be proven wrong . 
Turkey itself could serve as a stronger bridge to the unstable Turkic societies of Central Asia , from Azerbaijan to Kyrgyzstan , countries now at risk of destabilization from the war on terrorism and struggles over oil and other natural resources . 
Fortunately , when Giscard voiced his dangerous sentiments , many in the European Commission and throughout Europe declared that the former French President spoke only for himself . 
Now the European Union must make that point more forcefully by demonstrating its good faith in rising to the historic challenge of negotiating Turkey &apos;s membership in the EU .
