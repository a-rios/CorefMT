The Fed Trap 
NEW HAVEN - As the US Federal Reserve attempts to exit from its unconventional monetary policy , it is grappling with the disparity between the policy &apos;s success in preventing economic disaster and its failure to foster a robust recovery . 
To the extent that this disconnect has led to mounting financial-market excesses , the exit will be all the more problematic for markets - and for America &apos;s market-fixated monetary authority . 
The Fed &apos;s current quandary is rooted in a radical change in the art and practice of central banking . 
Conventional monetary policies , designed to fulfill the Fed &apos;s dual mandate of price stability and full employment , are ill-equipped to cope with the systemic risks of asset and credit bubbles , to say nothing of the balance-sheet recessions that ensue after such bubbles burst . 
This became painfully apparent in recent years , as central banks , confronted by the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 , turned to unconventional policies - in particular , massive liquidity injections through quantitative easing ( QE ) . 
The theory behind this move - as espoused by Ben Bernanke , first as an academic , then as a Fed governor , and eventually as Fed Chairman - is that operating on the quantity dimension of the credit cycle is the functional equivalent of acting on the price side of the equation . 
That supposition liberated the Fed from fear of the dreaded &quot; zero bound &quot; that it was approaching in 2003-2004 , when , in response to the collapse of the equity bubble , it lowered its benchmark policy rate to 1 % . 
If the Fed ran out of basis points , the argument went , it would still have plenty of tools at its disposal for supporting and guiding the real economy . 
But this argument &apos;s intellectual foundations - first laid out in a 2002 paper by 13 members of the Fed &apos;s Washington , DC , research staff - are shaky , at best . 
The paper &apos;s seemingly innocuous title , &quot; Preventing Deflation : Lessons from Japan &apos;s Experience in the 1990s , &quot; makes the fundamental assertion that Japan &apos;s struggles were rooted in a serious policy blunder : the Bank of Japan &apos;s failure to recognize soon enough and act strongly enough on the peril of incipient deflation . 
( Not coincidentally , this view coincided with a similar conclusion professed by Bernanke in a scathing attack on the BOJ in the late 1990s . ) 
The implication was clear : substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus is critical for economies that risk approaching the zero bound . 
Any doubt as to what form that &quot; substantial stimulus &quot; might take were dispelled a few months later , when then-Fed Governor Bernanke delivered a speech stressing the need for a central bank to deploy unconventional measures to mitigate deflationary risks in an economy that was approaching the zero bound . 
Such measures could include buying up public debt , providing subsidized credit to banks , targeting longer-term interest rates , or even intervening to reduce the dollar &apos;s value in foreign-exchange markets . 
A few years later , the global financial crisis erupted , and these statements , once idle conjecture , became the basis for an urgent action plan . 
But one vital caveat was lost in the commotion : What works during a crisis will not necessarily provide sufficient traction for the post-crisis recovery - especially if the crisis has left the real economy mired in a balance-sheet recession . 
Indeed , given that such recessions clog the monetary-policy transmission mechanism , neither conventional interest-rate adjustments nor unconventional liquidity injections have much impact in the wake of a crisis , when deleveraging and balance-sheet repair are urgent . 
That is certainly the case in the US today . 
QE may have been a resounding success in some ways - namely , arresting the riskiest phase of the crisis . 
But it did little to revive household consumption , which accounts for about 70 % of the US economy . 
In fact , since early 2008 , annualized growth in real consumer expenditure has averaged a mere 1.3 % - the most anemic period of consumption growth on record . 
This is corroborated by a glaring shortfall in the &quot; GDP dividend &quot; from Fed liquidity injections . 
Though $ 3.6 trillion of incremental liquidity has been added to the Fed &apos;s balance sheet since late 2008 , nominal GDP was up by just $ 2.5 trillion from the third quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of this year . 
As John Maynard Keynes famously pointed out after the Great Depression , when an economy is locked in a &quot; liquidity trap , &quot; with low interest rates unable to induce investment or consumption , attempting to use monetary policy to spur demand is like pushing on a string . 
This approach also has serious financial-market consequences . 
Having more than doubled since its crisis-induced trough , the US equity market - not to mention its amply rewarded upper-income shareholders - has been the principal beneficiary of the Fed &apos;s unconventional policy gambit . 
The same is true for a variety of once-risky fixed-income instruments - from high-yield corporate &quot; junk &quot; bonds to sovereign debt in crisis-torn Europe . 
The operative view in central-banking circles has been that the so-called &quot; wealth effect &quot; - when asset appreciation spurs real economic activity - would square the circle for a lagging post-crisis recovery . 
The persistently anemic recovery and its attendant headwinds in the US labor market belie this assumption . 
Nonetheless , the Fed remains fixated on financial-market feedback - and thus ensnared in a potentially deadly trap . 
Fearful of market disruptions , the Fed has embraced a slow-motion exit from QE . 
By splitting hairs over the meaning of the words &quot; considerable time &quot; in describing the expected timeline for policy normalization , Fed Chair Janet Yellen is falling into the same trap . 
Such a fruitless debate borrows a page from the Bernanke-Greenspan incremental normalization script of 2004-2006 . 
Sadly , we know all too well how that story ended .
