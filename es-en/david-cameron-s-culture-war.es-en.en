David Cameron &apos;s Culture War 
NEW YORK - British Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s government has announced some of the most draconian public-sector cuts any developed country government has ever attempted . 
Indeed , his minister of education recently declared that funding for Britain &apos;s universities would be slashed by as much as 40 % . 
But the most shocking aspect of the move is that arts and humanities departments will be targeted more aggressively than science and engineering , which are supposedly better for business . 
The war against the arts and humanities is nothing new - though this is the first time that the fight has migrated so directly to Britain . 
Ever since , Republican governments in the US have slashed funding for ballet , poetry in schools , and sculpture , while demagogues like former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have gained political traction by attacking controversial visual arts . 
But the Cameron government &apos;s approach is more sinister than the old right-wing tactic of taking aim at disciplines that can be derided as effete . 
The British cuts reveal a push in developed countries - one that also started in the US - to target the kinds of education that lead to an open , vigorous civil society and a population that is hard to suppress . 
In the former Soviet bloc , it was the poets , dramatists , cartoonists , and novelists whose works encoded forbidden themes of freedom , and who were targeted by the secret police . 
Today , they are bullied , silenced , and tortured in places like Iran , Syria , China , and Myanmar . 
Obviously , neither the US nor Britain has reached that point . 
Indeed , the war against the arts and humanities in the US coincided with the emergence of an increasingly ignorant and passive population and a government that serves at the pleasure of corporate interests . 
Academics in the arts and humanities are notoriously bad at defending why their work has value . 
Who needs to read closely , seek evidence , and make a reasoned argument - skills that the study of poetry , the novel , history , and philosophy provide ? 
Who needs to study languages and comparative literature ? 
For Cameron , evidently , the answer is : no one of importance . 
Let us imagine , then , a Britain of tomorrow that includes parliamentarians who don &apos;t know what led to World War I , or what the Enlightenment was ; journalists who can &apos;t write compellingly ; attorneys and judges who can &apos;t figure out their cases ; and spies and diplomats who don &apos;t speak the languages or understand the cultures in which they work . 
That Britain will look more like the US of today . 
In a heartbeat , Cameron ( who himself studied philosophy , politics , and economics at Oxford , having previously attended that bastion of classical education , Eton ) has signed away Britain &apos;s global influence . 
Having lost its empire , Britain retains outsized global influence simply because of the power of its civilization and the education absorbed by its decision-makers . 
That allure is why foreign students from emerging countries around the world flock to Britain , putting millions of pounds annually into the coffers of its universities . 
By slashing the funding for the institutions which created that civilization , Cameron has guaranteed that tomorrow &apos;s Britain will be a nation not of world-class politicians , writers , and cultural innovators , but of wonky technocrats raised on bad TV , with little influence beyond their tiny island . 
If what has been cut is not restored , Cameron and his ideological heirs will create a nation of quiescent citizens who , like their US counterparts , are better suited to a society whose official policies are more directly aligned to the will of corporate interests . 
While the fiscal savings may appear attractive to Cameron in the short term , for the British people - and for the rest of the world , which benefits from Britain &apos;s liveliness , civilization , and tradition of democracy - the cost is far too high .
