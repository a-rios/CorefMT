A History Lesson for Koizumi 
Once again , protests against Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi &apos;s annual visit to the Yasukuni shrine are breaking out in China as well as South Korea . 
Koizumi &apos;s insistence on paying homage to the war dead interred at Yasukuni , where convicted war criminals from World War II are among the buried , has been damaging relations with Japan &apos;s neighbors for years . 
Indeed , Chinese President Hu Jintao continually affirms that he will not hold a summit with a Japanese prime minister who goes to Yasukuni , which most Chinese regard as a glorification of past Japanese aggression and colonialism . 
Even some in Japan are becoming critical of Koizumi . 
While the public remains negative about Chinese outbursts against Japan , a recent survey indicates that more than 70 % of Japanese view the current state of Japan-China relations as unacceptable . 
More people are not supporting Koizumi &apos;s annual pilgrimage to Yasukuni , with seven former prime ministers jointly demanding that he refrain from the visits . 
Yet Koizumi remains defiant . 
Moreover , Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzu Abe , the front-runner to succeed him , has openly declared that he will continue to visit the shrine as prime minister . 
Foreign Minister Taro Aso , another possible successor to Koizumi , has called for the Japanese Emperor to pray at Yasukuni . 
So pessimism appears to be settling in , and the deadlock over Yasukuni appears to be deepening . 
Even on the issue of Yasukuni , there are positive lessons to be learned . 
Consider Yasuhiro Nakasone , Koizumi &apos;s predecessor in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Both are master politicians who remained popular and served long terms in office . 
Both are conservative and nationalistic , advocating the revision of the constitution and an assertive political and military role for Japan abroad . 
Finally , both are pro-American , with Nakasone declaring Japan to be America &apos;s &quot; unsinkable aircraft carrier &quot; in East Asia and Koizumi sending troops to Iraq in support of the United States-led war effort . 
But a crucial difference between Nakasone and Koizumi is often overlooked : their handling of the Yasukuni controversy and relations with China . 
Nakasone broke the taboo by being the first prime minister to worship at the Yasukuni shrine in his official capacity on August 15 , 1985 , the fortieth anniversary of the end of World War II . 
The decision triggered a severe response from China , where students held demonstrations against his visit . 
Bilateral relations were frozen . 
But , instead of capitalizing on domestic resentment over China &apos;s criticisms , Nakasone decided not to visit Yasukuni again . 
He chose to mend relations with China by focusing on the positive aspects of bilateral ties . 
In 1986 , Nakasone went to Beijing at the personal invitation of Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang and laid the cornerstone for a Sino-Japanese Youth Exchange Center , promising to forge future friendships with China . 
This genuine embrace of reconciliation provided much-needed support to Chinese leaders , who were eager to control anti-Japanese sentiments . 
Hu praised Nakasone &apos;s courage and warned Chinese youth publicly that if they &quot; think merely of the well-being of their own country ... they are not sober-minded patriots . &quot; 
Nakasone emerged from the crisis and was recognized as a capable statesman in managing Japan &apos;s diplomacy with China . 
There was no accusation that Nakasone was &quot; selling out &quot; to Beijing . 
Nor were his conservative , nationalist , and pro-American credentials damaged . 
This episode suggests that Koizumi &apos;s hardline position isn &apos;t the only option . 
A Japanese prime minister can be strong without exploiting domestic resentment against the country &apos;s neighbors , and conservative , patriotic , and pro-American while forging a healthy working relationship with China . 
Indeed , the cessation of Yasukuni visits would likely open the door to the long-overdue Sino-Japanese summit , which in turn might strengthen moderate voices in China seeking a future-oriented relationship with Japan . 
Unfortunately , Koizumi and his allies are not prepared to move forward on the Yasukuni issue . 
As Foreign Minister Aso recently put it : &quot; The more China voices &#91; opposition &#93; , the more one feels like going there . 
It &apos;s just like when you &apos;re told &quot; Don &apos;t smoke cigarettes , &quot; it actually makes you want to smoke . &quot; 
No one expects the current Japanese and Chinese leaders to embrace , as Nakasone and Hu did two decades ago , but it is a sad state of affairs when the leaders of neighboring giants pretend not to see each other at international forums . 
If Nakasone , who now urges Koizumi to stop the Yasukuni pilgrimage , were to respond to Aso , he might simply extend the analogy : it is not in Japan &apos;s national interest to continue to inhale Koizumi &apos;s second-hand smoke .
