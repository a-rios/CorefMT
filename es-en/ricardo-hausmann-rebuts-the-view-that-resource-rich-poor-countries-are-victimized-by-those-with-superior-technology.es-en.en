The Open Drains of Latin America 
NEW YORK - Stories are most believable when they reaffirm our prior beliefs and assumptions . 
If not , we tend to find them implausible . 
A case in point is Eduardo Galeano &apos;s much-admired 1971 book The Open Veins of Latin America , which has sold more than one million copies in 12 languages and defined a generation &apos;s view of the region &apos;s tortured history . 
The late Hugo Ch치vez gave US President Barack Obama a copy when they met in 2009 in Trinidad . 
The book is commendable for its ability to describe five centuries of Latin American history with great coherence , something that only a work of fiction can achieve . 
History , unfortunately , is a bit more complex . 
A few weeks ago , Galeano , to the astonishment of many , distanced himself from his own book . 
He said he could no longer bear reading it , and that when he wrote it , he &quot; lacked sufficient knowledge of economics and politics . &quot; 
Why was the book so well received , and what accounts for its author &apos;s second thoughts ? 
Galeano &apos;s book interprets Latin America &apos;s history as the consequence of foreign plunder . 
Over the centuries , bad guys change nationality - say , from Spanish to American - but their intentions remain the same . 
Current problems are the result of evil deeds committed by foreign powers that came only to exploit . 
The poor are poor because they are victims of the powerful . 
Even the most distorted myths contain a kernel of truth . 
Throughout human history , those with superior technology have tended to displace or even annihilate their neighbors . 
That is why the Welsh and the Pygmies live in remote places , and why English , Spanish , and Portuguese are spoken in the Americas . 
In fact , recent scientific evidence indicates that the Neolithic Revolution - the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture - spread mostly because farmers displaced hunters , not because hunters learned from them . 
But , while technological superiority and confrontation can wipe out the weak side , technological diffusion across cultures can be mutually beneficial . 
It allows all to do more with less , thereby generating a surplus that can be distributed . 
As in any such relationship , all parties want to get the lion &apos;s share of the gain , but some get the short end of the stick . 
Yet , without the relationship , there would be no stick . 
The real challenge for a patriot is to obtain the largest amount of pie , not a large share of a small pie . 
Alas , those inspired by Open Veins , like Ch치vez ( and Fidel Castro before him ) , are bound to create very small pies . 
For example , while Ch치vez &apos;s intention was to double Venezuela &apos;s oil production to six million barrels per day by 2012 - a feasible goal , given that the country has the world &apos;s largest oil reserves - his penchant for expropriation and for firing able dissenters caused output to fall by one-fifth . 
While Venezuela remains mired in economic malaise , its allies - China , Russia , Brazil , and OPEC - have raised output by 14 million barrels per day , laughing all the way to the bank . 
But to tell the story of Latin America as one of foreign pillage is to ignore the benefits that the region has gained from foreign efforts , especially in Venezuela . 
So here is an alternative story . 
Once upon a time , in ancient Mesopotamia , oil was known to exist and it was peddled by some quacks for its medicinal powers . 
Around 1870 , John D. Rockefeller spearheaded the development of the modern oil industry to produce kerosene for lighting . 
Later , while he was in a ferocious confrontation with Thomas Edison , who was threatening Rockefeller &apos;s business with the electric bulb , unrelated technological developments led to the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine and to the idea of putting it on wheels . 
This soon made oil the preferred energy source for transportation , not lighting , and even for electricity generation . 
But to develop the oil industry , many more technological advances needed to occur . 
First , oil had to be found . 
All of that required a plethora of breakthroughs in geology , metallurgy , material science , chemical engineering , cars , roads , cities , rules , and other areas . 
It was this extraordinary technological revolution that made oil valuable . 
While this was happening , many of today &apos;s large oil producers - including Venezuela , Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Nigeria - were missing in action . 
For the most part , they did not know that they had oil or where it was . 
They did not know how to get it out . 
They did not know about seismic lines , drilling , pipelines , refineries , or tankers . 
More important , they did not do much to construct the complex ecosystem that makes oil valuable . 
They did , however , have the right to restrict access to their underground resources in order to extract rents , just as the despised agricultural landowners have done for centuries . 
They could become rentiers and live off the work and ingenuity of others . 
The chutzpah of Open Veins and Ch치vez is to describe their situation as victimhood , not good fortune . 
Similar stories can be told of other industries , even those that do not require natural resources but rely on global value chains instead . 
In developing countries , economic progress requires absorbing and adapting technology that exists in other places , which necessitates engaging with those that have it . 
By characterizing these interactions as pure exploitation , rather than as value-creating opportunities , the Open Veins mentality has been a real drain on the possibilities of so many in Latin America and elsewhere .
