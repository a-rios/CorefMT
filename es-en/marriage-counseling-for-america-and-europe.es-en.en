Marriage Counseling for America and Europe 
Disputes between the United States and Europe are nothing new , as past tensions over Korea , Suez , and Vietnam demonstrate . 
This context and framework disciplined transatlantic ties . 
Europeans and Americans alike recognized the need to limit and manage their differences in order to conserve their ability to deter and , if necessary , to defeat the Soviet Union . 
The Cold War &apos;s end changed everything . 
Can the winning alliance survive its own success ? 
The fundamental features of the post-Cold War geopolitical context are relatively clear . 
They include American strategic primacy ; massive and rapid cross-border flows of people , technology , goods , services , ideas , germs , money , arms , e-mails , carbon dioxide , and just about anything else ; and relatively peaceful relations among the major powers - the US , China , Japan , Russia , India , and an increasingly integrated and enlarged Europe . 
But if the geopolitical context is clear , the intellectual and political framework - the successor to containment - is not . 
The challenge for Europeans and Americans today could hardly be greater : to cooperate in a very different context than the one for which the relationship and its institutions were designed - and to do so without any agreement on a new strategic framework . 
Cooperation is possible . 
In 1990 , Europeans and Americans joined forces to reverse Iraq &apos;s invasion and occupation of Kuwait . 
Later in the decade , Europeans and Americans combined to stop ethnic conflict in Bosnia and Kosovo . 
Europeans and Americans also worked to enlarge NATO and collaborated against terrorism in Afghanistan . 
But recent rifts over a range of issues - including the International Criminal Court , the Kyoto Protocol , the ABM Treaty , and the role of the UN - are impossible to ignore . 
Europeans tend to believe that the US is uncritically supportive of Israel and insufficiently sympathetic to Palestinian rights . 
Even when Americans and Europeans agree in principle , such as on trade , this does not always translate into practice . 
Most pronounced have been disagreements over how to deal with what the US terms &quot; rogue actors &quot; - Iran , North Korea , Syria , Libya , and Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq . 
Europeans lean toward dialogue and incentives , the US toward isolation and penalties . 
Bridging these differences will not be easy , even though the US , for all its power , needs partners to fight terrorism , nuclear weapons proliferation , and global climate change . 
But Europe , too , has a stake in maintaining the transatlantic bond , for there is no guarantee that it will remain an island of stability and prosperity . 
European integration cannot become all-consuming ; a parochial Europe is vulnerable to unsettled regional conflicts and to globalization &apos;s challenges . 
Translating mutual recognition of this into reality will require intellectual honesty and political investment on both sides of the Atlantic . 
Europeans must shed their illusions about what they can accomplish in the world on their own . 
Loose talk about resurrecting a multi-polar world is just that - loose talk . 
It is neither feasible nor desirable for Europe to establish itself as a geopolitical equal or competitor of the US . 
Europe must develop greater military capabilities , not to become a major power on par with the US , but so that it can act as America &apos;s partner if it so chooses and to pursue its own goals . 
A division of labor whereby the US employs military force and Europe uses other policy instruments will gradually divide the US from Europe . 
Europeans also must admit that effective diplomacy requires not only dialogue and incentives , but credibility - a willingness to use sanctions and military force , if need be . 
Americans , for their part , must accept that a strong Europe will not be content to simply do America &apos;s bidding . 
The US should support European integration , because a strong Europe is at least a potential strategic partner , whereas a weak Europe is not . 
Indeed , the sort of troop-intensive nation-building exercises taking place in Iraq and Afghanistan are hardly unique ; they are sure to be repeated , and European contributions will be required . 
That American troops are being withdrawn from Korea and sent to Iraq is both unfortunate and revealing . 
But genuine consultation will be necessary . 
Consultation cannot consist of simply informing others of what has already been decided , not adapting policies , and yet still expecting support . 
Most importantly , the US and Europe must learn how to disagree . 
The best guideline is to not permit disagreements to spill over and complicate or infect the relationship . 
Such &quot; compartmentalization &quot; is as essential now as it was during the Cold War . 
In order to limit the consequences of disagreement , Americans should explain their position and offer alternatives when a proposed international arrangement is deemed undesirable . 
Likewise , the US must employ incentives as well as penalties - and not sequence its diplomacy so that a problem country must meet every requirement before it can receive meaningful benefits . 
Europeans , too , have special responsibilities . 
There is a profound difference between not supporting an undertaking deemed essential by the US and working actively to block it . 
The latter is inconsistent with being an ally . 
European leaders also must do more to stem rising anti-Americanism , so that they remain able to work with the US when they judge it to be desirable . 
We are entering a new and different era of US-European relations . 
There will be issues arising where Americans and Europeans see things differently and are attracted to different prescriptions .
