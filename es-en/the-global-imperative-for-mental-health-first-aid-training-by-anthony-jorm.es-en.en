Mental Health for All 
MELBOURNE - One spring evening in 1997 , when I was a mental-health researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra , I was discussing with my wife , Betty Kitchener , a registered nurse who taught first-aid courses for the Red Cross in her spare time , the inadequacy of conventional first-aid training . 
Such courses typically neglect mental-health emergencies , leaving participants poorly equipped to help people who are struggling with suicidal thoughts , panic attacks , post-traumatic stress , the effects of alcohol or drug abuse , or a diminishing grip on reality . 
Betty knew firsthand the potential consequences of this lack of knowledge . 
When she was 15 , she experienced an episode of severe depression , which culminated in a suicide attempt . 
But her family and teachers failed to recognize the problem , so she received no support or professional help . 
This lack of early treatment undermined her recovery , and she has continued to experience episodes of depression throughout her life . 
In order to help ensure that more people did not have to suffer alone as Betty had , we resolved to create a mental-health first-aid training course in our local community . 
Three years later , when Betty reduced her paid employment in order to develop Mental Health First Aid training , we were finally able to launch the course . 
The benefits of this initiative quickly became apparent , with evaluation studies showing that participants became more accepting of the health significance of mental illnesses , more confident in their ability to help others , and motivated to apply their knowledge after completing the course . 
Such positive results helped to drive the course &apos;s expansion . 
By 2005 , it was operating across Australia and in Scotland and Hong Kong , and has since spread to more than 20 other countries . 
Over 200,000 people in Australia alone - more than 1 % of the population - have now received the training . 
This rapid growth should not be surprising , given the prevalence of mental-health problems worldwide . 
In Australia , roughly one in five adults is affected by a diagnosable mental-health problem each year , but many of these people receive no professional help . 
The statistics are similar in other developed countries . 
This means that everyone will either be personally affected by a mental-health problem or have close contact with someone who is . 
Indeed , most people will have contact , whether they are aware of it or not , with someone who is suicidal . 
Research shows that whether or not a person obtains professional help is strongly influenced by the encouragement and attitudes of those close to them . 
People with strong support networks have a significantly better chance of recovery than those whose problems go undetected or are ignored or minimized . 
Given this , ensuring awareness and acceptance in communities , while enhancing people &apos;s ability to identify potential mental-health problems in others and to provide help , is vitally important . 
This need is particularly pressing for those - such as parents , teachers , youth workers , and sports coaches - who are in regular contact with young people . 
Mental-health problems tend to arise early in life , with the first episode occurring during adolescence or early adulthood - a critical phase of development , when people are completing their education , joining the work force , building key relationships , and forming health habits . 
Without a strong support system , mental-health problems can disrupt these developments , damaging the future prospects of those whom they affect . 
While the Mental Health First Aid course &apos;s rapid expansion has helped to improve the situation in many communities , there is much left to do . 
In the short term , all developed countries should aim to achieve 1 % participation rates in mental-health first-aid courses , as Australia has . 
In the longer term , countries should aim to match participation rates in conventional first-aid courses . 
In the last three years , 11 % of Australia &apos;s population has completed such a course , partly owing to requirements that people in certain positions , such as child-care workers , have a first-aid certificate . 
Requiring that people in particular occupations - including high-school teachers , nurses , and police officers - acquire a mental-health first-aid certificate would significantly enhance participation , thereby strengthening support for those who are struggling with mental-health problems . 
Such certifications are even more important in the developing world , given the limited availability of mental-health professionals . 
Pilot work in rural India shows that the mental-health first-aid approach can be successfully adapted to the needs of communities with limited resources . 
In developed and developing countries alike , the scope of the problem is too large to be left exclusively to mental-health professionals . 
Every member of the community must be empowered to protect and improve their own mental health , and that of those around them .
