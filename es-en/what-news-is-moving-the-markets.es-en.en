What News Is Moving the Markets ? 
Stock markets in much of the world have shown sharp cumulative declines since around May 10 , with most of the drop occurring in the two-week period to around May 23 , but with prices continuing to fall on average since then . 
Does trouble in the world &apos;s stock markets mean trouble for the world economy ? 
Let us look at the biggest declines . 
Of the major countries &quot; indexes , the biggest crash was in India , where stock prices fell 16.9 % from May 10 to May 22 . 
The debacle on the other side of the globe was almost as big and the peaks and troughs were within a day or two of those in India : in Argentina , stock prices fell 16.1 % , in Brazil , they fell 14.7 % , and in Mexico , they fell 13.8 % . 
European markets also suffered large losses . 
In Sweden , stock prices fell 15.2 % between May 9 and May 22 ; over nearly the same period , prices fell 9.7 % in Germany , 9.4 % in France and the United Kingdom , and 9.3 % in Italy . 
Likewise , in Asia , stock prices fell 11.5 % in Korea , 9.3 % in Hong Kong , and 8 % in Japan from their respective peaks to troughs over very nearly the same time period . 
Many commentators try to tie such events to developments the United States . 
But US stock prices fell only 5.2 % between May 9 and May 24 . 
Nor does China appear to be behind the global decline , since stock prices there actually rose during this period . 
Economists &quot; standard explanation revolves around monetary policy . 
In the wake of the great deflation scare of 2003 , central banks around the world cut interest rates , setting off speculative booms in both stock and housing markets . 
But now , according to this view , rising interest rates are beginning to bite , which portends further declines in asset prices . 
There is certainly an important element of truth in this argument . 
The US Federal Reserve did indeed raise rates on May 10 , and its chairman , Ben Bernanke , indicated then that there may be further rate increases in the future . 
Worsening US inflation data were reported on May 17 , suggesting that further monetary tightening is in store . 
Economists like to view the world as logical and manageable , which implies that they understand what is happening . 
But , in doing so , they often exaggerate central banks &quot; role . 
Indeed , the US rate increase was just one in a series of rate hikes - the 16th in a row . 
No other major central bank raised rates after the stock market drops began in May until June 7- 8 , when several did ( the European Central Bank , India , South Korea , South Africa , Thailand and Turkey ) 
Another factor is the price of oil , which rose 24 % from March 22 to May 2 , setting all-time records along the way . 
Surely , this was a major event that would plausibly affect stock markets all over the world . 
Oil price increases have been a culprit in virtually every economic recession since World War II . 
Still , the oil price increases do not correspond to the time interval in mid-May when stock market indexes fell most sharply . 
To argue that oil price increases caused the stock market declines presupposes a time lag of several weeks . 
But stock markets are not very logical , and there could be a lagged response to the oil price shocks . 
As with any other prices in financial markets , an increase attracts attention . 
When oil prices rise quickly , people watch the news related to oil prices and talk to each other more about oil prices , hence creating heightened sensitivity to this news . 
The crisis in the Middle East is tied to oil prices , and it dominated the news in May . 
Ominous signs and strong language used by various political figures were possibly amplified in investors &quot; minds by the oil price increases . 
On May 8 , Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres , reacting to hostile statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , said that &quot; the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map . &quot; 
Similarly , near the beginning of the May stock market tumble , Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia , the world &apos;s most populous country with a Muslim majority , and newspapers reported on May 13 that he had received a standing ovation from students at two of the country &apos;s top universities . 
This story might have been interpreted as evidence that Ahmadinejad &apos;s brinkmanship on the nuclear issue was paying off for him politically , fueling a perception that the tense situation in the Middle East might lead to even higher oil prices . 
These news stories may seem far more remote from the stock market than is monetary policy . 
But public reaction to them , together with recent oil price increases , may well account in good measure for the change in market psychology . 
Attitudes toward risks change over time , and events like Ahmadinejad &apos;s and Peres &apos;s remarks can precipitate such changes . 
So , while these things happen in ways that are hard to quantify , maybe analysts should pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad just as carefully as they do to those of Bernanke in trying to understand the direction of the world &apos;s stock markets . 
Economists might not like to focus on the public mindset and how it interacts with price changes , world news stories , and speculative dynamics . 
After all , doing so implies that economic events are less predictable ( and economists less omniscient ) than they like to imagine . 
But such a focus makes intuitive sense . 
What is really on investors &quot; minds ? 
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure ; 
Bernanke is not . 
Ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure ; 
Bernanke is not . 
And , perhaps most importantly , Ahmadinejad is a destabilizing influence ; 
Bernanke is not . 
Indeed , whatever their ultimate cause , the mid-May drops in stock prices throughout the world are indicative of unstable market psychology . 
It is difficult to believe that they were related only to opinions about likely monetary policy , and not to larger and deeper issues , including such things as energy and political tension , that underpin the performance of the world economy .
