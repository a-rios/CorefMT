Connecting the Solutions 
WASHINGTON , DC - The world does not need to be reminded of the urgency of this historical moment . 
We sense it every day in the news . 
One day a major bank , insurance company , or automaker announces a record loss . 
The next brings word about the impact on nations and peoples least able to cope with these blows - the poorest of the world &apos;s poor . 
During the last two years , I have dealt with many crises , from Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo to such global challenges as the food crisis and climate change . 
But the financial crisis is unique and potentially overwhelming . 
What was a purely financial crisis has become an economic crisis , spreading across the globe . 
Every projection of growth has been revised downward . 
And while there are signs that mature economies are recovering from the panic that froze credit markets , we are by no means beyond the danger zone . 
My greatest concern is that today &apos;s financial crisis evolves into tomorrow &apos;s human crisis . 
We need to recognize what Martin Luther King , Jr. called the &quot; fierce urgency of now &quot; if we are to safeguard millions of people &apos;s livelihoods and hopes for the future . 
Many financial experts have diagnosed the causes of the crisis . 
Policymakers have offered prescriptions for solving it . 
We hear talk of new banking regulations and even of a new global financial architecture . 
All this is desirable . 
Yet , while I welcome this debate and fully recognize the need for long-term measures , I am acutely conscious of time . 
Immediate problems require immediate responses . 
Nor can we allow the financial crisis to become a reason for neglecting other critical issues : unacceptable levels of poverty and hunger , the food crisis , climate change . 
For that will only exacerbate the already fragile political and security situation in many of the hardest hit countries . 
At the G-20 financial summit in Washington this weekend , I delivered four messages reflecting my conversations with various UN member states . 
First , we need a global stimulus package to turn this crisis around . 
The IMF recently projected that virtually all global growth in 2009 will come from emerging and developing economies . 
Large increases in public and private expenditures will therefore be required in many regions of the world to counteract falling demand . 
Second , these financial rescue and assistance packages cannot stop at the borders of the richest countries . 
Emerging markets and other developing countries will need oxygen in the form of credit lines and trade financing . 
And we must stand against protectionism . Without open trade , growth and development could break down entirely . 
Third , some part of our global stimulus should come from commitments that the international community has made on aid . 
In today &apos;s environment , fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) is more than a moral imperative . 
It is a matter of pragmatic economic necessity . 
Finally , inclusivity must be our watch-word . 
In our interdependent world , these tasks can be met only through reinvigorated multilateralism - one that is fair , flexible and responsive , with leaders coming from all quarters . 
While the G-20 nations whose leaders met in Washington account for nearly 80 % of world production , trade and investment , more than 170 other countries , representing one-third of the world &apos;s people , were not there . 
It is our responsibility to listen to their voices and respond to their concerns . 
The next few months will be crucial . 
Many of us will meet again in two weeks in Doha to review progress on financing for development . 
Six years ago , President George W. Bush and other leaders adopted the ambitious goals that constitute the core of the MDGs . 
History will judge us harshly if we fail to live up to these commitments . 
I therefore urge all nations , rich and poor , to send their highest-level representatives to Doha with full determination to do what must be done . 
In December , our climate change negotiators meet in Poland . 
We have one year until they meet in Copenhagen - one year to reach an agreement that all nations can embrace . 
The sooner we have such an agreement in place , the sooner we will see the green investments and green growth we so badly need . 
The great challenges before us are interrelated : the global economy , climate change , and development . 
We need solutions to each that are solutions to all .
