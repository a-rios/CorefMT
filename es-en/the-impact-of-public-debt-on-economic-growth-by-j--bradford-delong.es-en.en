When Is Government Debt Risky ? 
BERKELEY - A government that does not tax sufficiently to cover its spending will eventually run into all manner of debt-generated trouble . 
Its nominal interest rates will rise as bondholders fear inflation . 
Its business leaders will hunker down and try to move their wealth out of the companies they run for fear of high future corporate taxes . 
Moreover , real interest rates will rise , owing to policy uncertainty , rendering many investments that are truly socially productive unprofitable . 
And , when inflation takes hold , the division of labor will shrink . 
What once was a large web held together by thin monetary ties will fragment into very small networks solidified by thick bonds of personal trust and social obligation . 
And a small division of labor means low productivity . 
All of this is bound to happen - eventually - if a government does not tax sufficiently to cover its spending . 
But can it happen as long as interest rates remain low , stock prices remain buoyant , and inflation remains subdued ? 
I and other economists - including Larry Summers , Laura Tyson , Paul Krugman , and many more - believe that it cannot . 
As long as stock prices are buoyant , business leaders are not scared of future taxes or of policy uncertainty . 
As long as interest rates remain low , there is no downward pressure on public investment . 
And as long as inflation remains low , the extra debt that a government issues is highly prized as a store of value , helps savers sleep more easily at night , and provides a boost to the economy , because it assists deleveraging and raises the velocity of spending . 
Economists , in short , do not watch only quantities - the amount of debt that a government has issued - but prices as well . 
And , because people trade bonds for commodities , cash , and stocks , the prices of government debt are the rate of inflation , the nominal interest rate , and the level of the stock market . 
And all three of these prices are flashing green , signaling that markets would prefer government debt to grow at a faster pace than current forecasts indicate . 
When Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff wrote their influential study &quot; Growth in a Time of Debt , &quot; they asked the following question : &quot; Outsized deficits and epic bank bailouts may be useful in fighting a downturn , but what is the long-run macroeconomic impact of higher levels of government debt , especially against the backdrop of graying populations and rising social insurance costs ? &quot; 
Reinhart and Rogoff saw a public-debt &quot; threshold of 90 % of &#91; annual &#93; GDP , &quot; beyond which &quot; growth rates fall .... in &#91; both &#93; advanced and emerging economies . &quot; 
The principal mistake that Reinhart and Rogoff made in their analysis - indeed , the only significant mistake - was their use of the word &quot; threshold . &quot; 
That semantic choice , together with the graph that they included , has led many astray . 
The Washington Post editorial board , for example , recently condemned what it called the &quot; Don &apos;t worry , be happy &quot; approach to the US budget deficit and government debt , on the grounds that there is a &quot; 90 % mark that economists regard as a threat to sustainable economic growth . &quot; 
To be sure , The Washington Post editorial board has shown since the start of the millennium that it requires little empirical support for its claims . 
But the phrasing in &quot; Growth in a Time of Debt &quot; also misled European Commissioner Olli Rehn and many others to argue that &quot; when &#91; government &#93; debt reaches 80-90 % of GDP , it starts to crowd out activity . &quot; 
Reinhart and Rogoff , it is widely believed , showed that if the debt / GDP ratio is below 90 % , an economy is safe , and that only if the debt burden is above 90 % is growth placed in jeopardy . 
Yet the threshold is not there . 
It is an artifact of Reinhart and Rogoff &apos;s non-parametric method : throw the data into four bins , with 90 % serving as the bottom of the top bin . 
In fact , there is a gradual and smooth decline in growth rates as debt / GDP ratios increase - 80 % looks only trivially better than 100 % . 
And , as Reinhart and Rogoff say , a correlation between high debt and low growth is a sign that one should investigate whether debt is a risk . 
Sometimes it is : a good deal of the relationship comes from countries where interest rates are higher and the stock market is lower , and where a higher debt / GDP ratio does indeed mean slower growth . 
Still more of the relationship comes from countries where inflation rates are higher when government debt is higher . 
But some of it comes from countries where growth was already slow , and thus where high debt / GDP ratios , as Larry Summers constantly says , result from the denominator , not the numerator . 
So , how much room is left in the relationship between debt and economic performance for a country with low interest rates , low inflation , buoyant stock prices , and healthy prior growth ? 
Not much , if any . 
In the United States , at least , we have learned that there is little risk to accumulating more government debt until interest and inflation rates begin to rise above normal levels , or the stock market tanks . 
And there are large potential benefits to be gained from solving America &apos;s real problems - low employment and slack capacity - right now .
