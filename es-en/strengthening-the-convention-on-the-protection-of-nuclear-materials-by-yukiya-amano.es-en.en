Securing Nuclear Material 
VIENNA - World leaders have devoted increasing attention in recent years to the risk of terrorists obtaining nuclear or other radioactive material . 
That &apos;s the good news . 
But all of us need to act with greater urgency in translating good intentions into concrete action . 
The risk of nuclear or other radioactive material falling into the wrong hands is all too real . 
There have been embarrassing security lapses at nuclear facilities , and sensitive material is often inadequately secured . 
Indeed , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) records numerous cases of theft and other unauthorized activities involving nuclear and radioactive material every year . 
Most of these incidents are fairly minor , but some are more serious . 
Some material goes missing and is never found . 
An incident in Moldova two years ago involving highly enriched uranium - which can be used in a nuclear weapon - illustrates both the scale of the threat and the possibility of effective counter-measures if countries take the problem seriously . 
Police seized a quantity of the substance from an individual who was attempting to sell it . 
The smugglers had tried to evade detection by building a shielded container - a worrisome level of sophistication on their part . 
Fortunately , the Moldovan authorities had been working hard to improve their detection capabilities . 
They had also shared information with their counterparts in other countries . 
The uranium was seized in a sting operation . 
Arrests were made and several people received prison sentences . 
Most cases of attempted trafficking do not involve nuclear material ; rather , they involve radioactive substances of the type held in hospitals , factories , and other locations all over the world . 
These locations are generally not as well protected as nuclear facilities . 
Even a relatively small amount of material such as cobalt-60 - used in radiotherapy - could cause serious harm if combined with conventional explosives in a so-called dirty bomb ( or otherwise deliberately used to expose the public to dangerous radiation ) . 
Foreign and energy ministers will have an opportunity to strengthen the global nuclear security framework when they meet at the International Conference on Nuclear Security : Enhancing Global Efforts in Vienna on July 1-5 . 
This will be the first such event that is open to all countries . 
At the top of the agenda should be ratification of improvements to a crucial nuclear security instrument - theConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material . 
The proposed amendment would oblige countries to protect nuclear material when it is being used or stored , not just when it is being transported internationally , as is the case now . 
It would also require countries to protect nuclear facilities against acts of sabotage , which could have consequences similar to those of nuclear accidents . 
The proposed amendment was agreed in 2005 , but it still has not entered into force , because not enough countries have ratified it . 
That needs to change if major vulnerabilities are to be addressed successfully . 
Nuclear security is a matter of global concern , and global action is required . 
Efforts by just a handful of major players will not be sufficient to keep the world safe . 
We cannot afford to have weak links in our chain of defense . 
All countries must play their part . 
Even countries that do not possess nuclear or other radioactive material need to act . 
There is evidence that criminal and terrorist gangs have attempted to traffic material through countries perceived to have lax security . 
It is imperative that they do not succeed . 
One simple measure would make a big difference : All countries should allow peer reviews of their nuclear-security arrangements by international experts . 
Peer reviews have been shown to work - for example , in improving safety at nuclear power plants . 
Everyone benefits . 
Bringing experts in nuclear security together to share their experience is a no-brainer . 
More countries need to do it . 
Following Moldova &apos;s example , all countries should also ensure that law-enforcement officers are properly trained to respond to the menace of nuclear terrorism . 
Countries must invest in equipment and infrastructure and share information across borders . 
The fact that there has been no major nuclear terrorist attack should not lull us into a fall sense of security . 
The threat remains . 
We must seize the opportunity to ensure that our worst nightmare never becomes our waking reality .
