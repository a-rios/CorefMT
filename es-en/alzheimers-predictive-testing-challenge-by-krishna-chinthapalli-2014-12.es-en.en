Testing Times for Alzheimer &apos;s 
LONDON - Alzheimer &apos;s disease is by far the most common cause of dementia and one of the world &apos;s most feared disorders . 
By 2050 , there will be 135 million Alzheimer &apos;s sufferers worldwide , a threefold increase from today , with three-quarters of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries . 
Predicting the onset of Alzheimer &apos;s , let alone preventing or curing it , remains an immense challenge . 
Alzheimer &apos;s disease was identified more than a century ago from autopsy results that showed characteristic brain lesions called &quot; amyloid plaques . &quot; 
The disease is more difficult to diagnose in the living . 
Doctors rely on observation of memory loss and other thinking deficits ( such as reasoning or language comprehension ) - signs that plaques are already present in the brain . 
But any cure would have to be administered before the plaques form , and years before symptoms of dementia appear . 
Alzheimer &apos;s might be more predictable if scientists had the time and resources to conduct far-reaching longitudinal studies over many years . 
Such studies ideally would involve blood , imaging , memory , and medical tests , as well as detailed lifestyle questionnaires filled out by thousands of young and middle-aged people . 
Study participants would be followed over decades to see who developed the disease , and which tests proved positive before Alzheimer &apos;s was diagnosed . 
In fact , two famous longitudinal studies - the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts and the Kungsholmen Project in Sweden - have led to important progress in predicting the disease . 
These studies found that short-term memory may be impaired for up to ten years before an Alzheimer &apos;s diagnosis . 
Major advances have since been made in brain imaging , biochemical analysis , and , perhaps most important , genetic testing . 
Indeed , the risk of Alzheimer &apos;s doubles if a parent or sibling has it , probably due in large part to the presence of the ApoE gene . The risk triples for Europeans who inherit a particular type of ApoE , called ε4 ; inheriting two copies of ε4 increases the risk roughly tenfold . 
But genetic testing alone is unlikely to be an accurate predictor , because around half of Alzheimer &apos;s sufferers do not carry ε4 , and probably half of those with ε4 do not develop the disease . 
Moreover , though international studies of more than 70,000 people have found over 20 other genes linked to Alzheimer &apos;s , their impact is minimal . 
That said , a groundbreaking 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , analyzed a rare genetic mutation found in just 500 families around the world , which would lead to Alzheimer &apos;s before the age of 50 . 
The study showed which tests were able to predict the outcome most accurately decades ahead of onset . 
The research found that amyloid-beta - the substance that clumps together and forms amyloid plaques - becomes depleted in the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain as long as 25 years before the onset of dementia . 
Fifteen years prior to onset , a positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan showed amyloid-beta being deposited in plaques in the brain itself . 
These tests are now becoming part of clinical practice , and are available commercially . 
Memory and other cognitive tests can reveal whether one has minor problems with some aspects of thinking - a condition known as &quot; mild cognitive impairment &quot; that precedes Alzheimer &apos;s disease . 
The problem is that the tests must be administered by a trained neuropsychologist and take more than an hour to complete ; moreover , many people with mild cognitive impairment do not progress to dementia . 
Sampling cerebrospinal fluid via a lumbar puncture ( or &quot; spinal tap &quot; ) can predict which people with mild cognitive impairment will progress to dementia with over 80 % accuracy , but this still means a misdiagnosis for one in five patients . 
PET scans are slightly less accurate , while routine MRI brain scans can reveal with perhaps only 70 % accuracy subtle abnormalities in people with mild cognitive impairment . 
Scientists are therefore still searching for an accurate predictive test that is cheaper , quicker , and less invasive than PET scans or lumbar punctures . 
This year , two small studies of blood tests seemed to predict Alzheimer &apos;s 1-3 years before it occurred , but the tests are complicated and require the measurement of ten or more substances . 
Whichever predictive methods doctors use over the next few years will probably enable them to inform those patients with mild cognitive impairment about their chances of developing Alzheimer &apos;s in the short term . 
The trickier question is whether we will be able to predict Alzheimer &apos;s disease accurately in those with normal cognition and memory , or to predict it more than five years in advance . 
Even if accurate early prediction of Alzheimer &apos;s eventually is achieved , there are currently no drugs available to prevent or cure it before the amyloid plaques start destroying the mind . 
That will be our next great challenge .
