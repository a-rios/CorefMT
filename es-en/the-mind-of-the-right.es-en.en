The Mind of the Right 
Jean Marie Le Pen &apos;s stunning showing in the French presidential election stripped bare not only the malaise in traditional French politics , but also the deeper crisis facing Europe &apos;s traditional democratic Conservatives , who now confront rising xenophobic parties in the Netherlands , Denmark , Austria , Belgium , and Germany . 
Jürgen Rüttgers , a leading German Conservative , offers his diagnosis . 
Throughout Europe , conservatism is in crisis . 
Political parties that call themselves Conservative , and that are perceived as Conservative by voters , continue to win elections and assume power . 
But democratic Conservatism as a world view , as a conceptual framework , and as a way of behaving - whether in power or as a form of political opposition - is increasingly difficult to articulate . 
Indeed , hardly anyone nowadays can offer a satisfying definition of what being Conservative means . 
Part of the problem - at least as far as elections are concerned - is that the hopes projected by &quot; liberal &quot; and &quot; progressive &quot; parties are far more attractive and successful than a Conservative &apos;s natural skepticism . 
As the editor and political journalist Konrad Adam put it , &quot; Skepticism is a feeling , not a program . &quot; 
Yet mainstream European Conservative parties - often Christian Democrats - continue to attract voters . 
Is this mere inertia ? 
The historian Paul Nolte criticizes Conservatives for being strategically lazy . 
During the past two or three decades , he argues , Conservatives became complacent &quot; in the wake of the political , programmatic , and intellectual debates - and often enough , the self-laceration - of the Left . &quot; 
Conservatives sat back and benefited from the Left &apos;s implosion , but &quot; overlooked the fact that their own need for discussion was as urgent . &quot; 
The philosopher Panajotis Kondylis identified the root of the Conservative dilemma . 
As &quot; a concrete historical phenomenon accompanied by an ideology with sharp contours , &quot; Kondylis wrote , Conservatism was &quot; dead and buried . &quot; 
Call this capital- &quot; c &quot; Conservatism - a philosophy long understood to imply nationalism and vigorous defense of the established and entrenched legal and social order . 
But this &quot; historical &quot; Conservatism cannot survive in the age of globalization , because national-conservative thinking is anachronistic . 
As free trade and capital movements open up markets around the world , business interests have abandoned nationalism in favor of neo-liberalism . 
What was once needed to support the national state - ethnic limitations , traditional culture , and religious taboos - is no longer needed by business . 
The implications of this political sea change have not been entirely lost on Conservative parties ( with some possible exceptions , such as the nether reaches of the British Tories ) . 
Christian Democrats abandoned national sovereignty when they embraced European unification . 
But , as Kondylis argued , it is impossible to describe as Conservative &quot; political programs , parties , or governments that are committed to technological progress , social mobility , and the modern principle of a market-made world . &quot; 
Ironically , part of the Left - Greens and other environmentalists - adopted historical Conservatism &apos;s critique of technology and uneasiness with modernity . 
The Left &apos;s emphasis on law and order , particularly since the September 11 th terrorist attacks , muddies the ideological waters even more . 
In the face of terrorism , there is little room for political debate on the use of state power to maintain order and ensure individuals &apos; security . 
But whereas Conservatism sought to de-couple the state &apos;s enforcement of social order from explicit welfare guarantees , today &apos;s Conservatives argue for larger farm subsidies . 
Can anything be salvaged from Conservatism to help modern-day Conservatives define their goals and communicate the values that underlie them ? 
Much is changing , and there is little time to adapt . 
Barely four years ago , former US President Bill Clinton remarked that human knowledge doubles every five years . 
Now we hear that it doubles every two years . 
Globalization speeds this process up - a consequence of the shift from an industrial to a knowledge society . 
Obviously , no modern Conservative philosophy can thrive by identifying itself with nationalism and protectionist policies . 
Globalization as a world-encompassing process is largely beyond the determination of national politics , and societies and nations must adapt . 
But they are not helpless . 
The shift to a knowledge society creates new opportunities and opens new courses of action . 
It enables not only higher economic competitiveness , but also greater freedom , justice , and solidarity . 
Conservatives must accept that a knowledge society pushes the individual - with his or her wealth of talents and abilities , interests and ambitions - to the center . 
Much more cultural space will open up for alternative world views and lifestyles . 
Yet this must not mean that modern Conservatism ends up surrendering its central belief that man is not absolute . 
The greatest lesson of the last century is that hubris leads us to adopt ideologies that make us &quot; un-free &quot; and that eventually oppress . 
We learned that a state that attempts to determine everything violates our independence and responsibility as individuals . 
These core principles - humility , liberty , and self-help - must continue to guide Conservatives , because they were not molded by Conservatism &apos;s ideologically &quot; sharp contours . &quot; 
They transcend historical Conservatism &apos;s specific and parochial concerns . 
Moreover , they project hope for revitalizing communal and public institutions as we confront the main challenge of accelerated change : ensuring that the knowledge society protects and preserves the dignity of man .
