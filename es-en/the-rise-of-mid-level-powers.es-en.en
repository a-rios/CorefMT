The Rise of Mid-Level Powers 
The security environment since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States has clearly demonstrated the limits of the United Nations , or even the US as the world &apos;s sole military superpower , to maintain international security . 
However , like-minded mid-level powers with similar intentions could complement what the UN or the US lacks , effectively generating sufficient clout to stabilize the global security environment . 
Japan , Australia , Germany , or Canada might be just such powers . 
They share common values as free and democratic countries . 
Moreover , they are non-nuclear powers with no permanent seats in the UN Security Council . 
All are long time allies of the US . 
In fact , over recent years these countries have already had many opportunities to demonstrate their ability and willingness to contribute to international security if called for , for they all also share a recognition that global stability directly serves their own national interests . 
Nevertheless , subtle differences among these countries may influence their bilateral cooperation or coordination with the UN or the US . 
As a result , they must compliment each other &apos;s advantages , characteristics , and interests in order to optimize their role in promoting international security . 
For many years , Japan has been taking very cautious steps into this area , but substantial changes have occurred recently . 
In March 2007 , Japan agreed to enter a &quot; semi-alliance &quot; with Australia , and issued a &quot; Joint Communiqu√© on Japan-Australia Security Cooperation . &quot; 
In early June , the two countries &quot; defense and foreign ministers held the first regular security meeting ( the so-called &quot; 2 + 2 meeting &quot; ) in Tokyo , agreeing to promote defense cooperation in various fields , including international security . 
Under Japan &apos;s last two prime ministers , Japan has steadily been making practical contributions to the stabilization of the international security environment as a way to benefit its national and international interests . 
Japan is thus helping to create conditions to allow mid-level powers to act jointly and effectively to provide an essential international &quot; public good . &quot; 
Such practical proposals address key global issues , including international terrorism , strengthening of mechanisms for arms control , arms reduction , and non-proliferation , efforts to contain attempts by North Korea and Iran to develop nuclear weapons , encouraging transparency in China &apos;s military , restraining Russia &apos;s imperial ambitions , and building a global ballistic missile defense network against missiles that could be launched by rogue regimes . 
However , efforts to promote this kind of cooperation should not be confined to these mid-level powers . 
There are many other potential mid-level democratic countries that should take part . 
Various approaches may be available for building a coalition of such powers , including the use of the UN and seeking to influence US foreign policy . 
To advance such efforts , it may be necessary for mid-level powers such as Japan , Canada , Australia , and Germany to strengthen ties with other like-minded mid-level countries that possess nuclear weapons and hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council , such as the United Kingdom and France , or with smaller nuclear powers without permanent Security Council seats , such as India . 
Once such a coalition gains a sure footing , the next step would be to participate actively in the negotiation of major security issues , such as international arms control , arms reduction , and non-proliferation , while encouraging the involvement of China and Russia . 
The goal should be to build and exercise influence within the international community to the point that the coalition becomes tantamount to a permanent &quot; sixth &quot; member of the Security Council .
