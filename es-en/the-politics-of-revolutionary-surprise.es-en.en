The Politics of Revolutionary Surprise 
DURHAM - In setting himself ablaze following a humiliating encounter with the police , the university-educated Tunisian vegetable seller Mohamed Bouazizi triggered a wave of protests across the Arab world . 
Several Arab dictators who had held power for decades have already been ousted or forced to announce that they will retire . 
But protesters in Cairo , Tunis , and Sana want much more . 
They also seek efficient governance , economic reforms to stimulate growth , the ouster of collaborators , democratic rights , freedom of religion ( and perhaps also from religion ) - in short , a comprehensive social transformation . 
Everywhere , incumbent regimes have mounted resistance . 
The unforgettable scene of camel- and horse-riding Mubarak supporters beating tech-savvy Egyptian protesters signals that the old order will not yield without a fight . 
The revolts themselves caught seasoned observers , even Arab leaders , off guard . 
Had the United States known what lay ahead , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would not have remarked , after demonstrations broke out in Egypt , that the Egyptian government was &quot; stable . &quot; 
Arab leaders now showering their key constituencies with pay raises and food subsidies would have done so earlier , thus avoiding the impression of vulnerability . 
Longtime regime opponents , too , were caught off guard . 
For days after Egypt erupted , the Muslim Brotherhood did not know how to react , making it seem out of touch with the &quot; Arab street . &quot; 
For decades , most Arabs , however unhappy , kept their political grievances private , for fear of persecution if they turned against their leaders publicly . 
Through private discussions with trusted friends , everyone sensed that discontent was common , yet no one knew , or could know , the extent of it . 
Even harder to gauge was what it would take for the disaffected to say &quot; enough is enough &quot; and begin challenging their regime openly , defiantly , and in concert . 
If a sufficient number of Arabs reached that threshold at the right time , the long-docile Arab street would explode in anger , with each group of new protesters encouraging more to join in , giving people elsewhere in the Arab world the courage to initiate protests of their own . 
That much was understood widely by entrenched Arab dictators , who saw to it that their intelligence and security corps extinguished any flame before it could spread . 
History will record that the match Bouazizi lit on December 17 , 2010 , became the fortuitous spark that ignited an Arab prairie fire . 
The fire spread so fast that by the time Arab leaders understood what it would consume , it was beyond anyone &apos;s control , and in more than one country . 
The overthrown Tunisian dictator must now regret that his security forces did not arrest Bouazizi and lock him up , rather than allow his public self-immolation . 
As it turned out , by the time the seriousness of the rebellion became clear , fear was already changing sides even within the halls of Tunisian power . 
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali &apos;s aides had started worrying more about being caught on the wrong side of Tunisian history than about facing the wrath of their beleaguered boss . 
Fissures within the Egyptian regime suggest that in Hosni Mubarak &apos;s entourage , too , fear is in flux . 
The mechanisms underlying this political unpredictability are not unique to the Arab world . 
Unforeseen uprisings are possible wherever repression keeps people from expressing their political preferences openly . 
In 1989 , the fall of repressive East European regimes in quick succession stunned the world , including dissidents who had long recognized communism &apos;s vulnerabilities . 
Just before the Iranian Revolution of 1979 , a CIA report characterized the Iranian monarchy as an &quot; island of stability . &quot; 
A month before the Russian Revolution of February 1917 , Lenin predicted that his country &apos;s great explosion lay in the distant future . 
All of these cases involved the mushrooming of public protest by long-quiescent constituencies with no prior record of coordinated action . 
The aftermath of an unanticipated revolution will itself present surprises . 
In Egypt , Tunisia , and Yemen , no one knows where power will lie in the months to come . 
As in Iran in 1979 , demonstrators united in opposition to the old regime have wildly differing goals . 
Their biggest demands - secure jobs , faster growth , low food prices - are not necessarily compatible , and they may require policies that inflict pain . 
Divisions within the opposition movements are thus inevitable . 
If the Arab societies now in turmoil had democratic traditions , they could be expected to find compromises peacefully , through open and honest debate . 
Alas , given their histories of autocratic rule , giant leaps forward to full-blown democracy are unlikely . 
Though steps toward democracy are possible , when the euphoria of the moment passes , political contenders will realize that , if only in self-defense , they must restrict their opponents &quot; freedoms . 
Adding to the complexity of the situation are the Islamists , who have so far kept a low profile . 
They themselves are divided , with preferences ranging from Sharia rule in one form or another to a &quot; Turkish model &quot; involving mild Islamism capable of achieving mass support through the ballot box . 
Several things are certain . 
The Arab street has changed the calculus of fear not only in the countries that have witnessed major protests , but also in the rest of the Arab world , where rulers are on notice that discontent need not remain submerged forever . 
Arab leaders old and new will implement policies designed to alleviate popular dissatisfaction . 
They will consider both easing repression , in order to gain sympathy , and tightening it , in order to prevent uncontrollable protests .
