Who &apos;s Afraid of the Big Bad Debt ? 
CAMBRIDGE - It has been a while since a debate among academic economists attracted so much interest from the mainstream press as has the row between Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , on one side , and Paul Krugman , on the other . 
In fact , it has even become fodder for television comedy shows . 
At issue is an influential 2010 paper by Rogoff and Reinhart that purports to show that high levels of public debt are associated with lower long-term economic growth . 
A new paper by Thomas Herndon , a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , and two of his professors , Michael Ash and Robert Pollin , questioned this finding , and Krugman made their work famous . 
Herndon , Ash , and Pollin argue that the results obtained by Reinhart and Rogoff are based on coding errors and questionable methodological choices . 
But , after all their quibbles , their paper weakens but does not refute the Reinhart / Rogoff paper &apos;s main result . 
So why all the fuss ? 
The debate is considered important because it is supposed to have implications for the choice between cutting the deficit and stimulating the economy now . 
Instead , the paper needs to be understood in the context of the debate between Keynesians and ( as Krugman calls them ) &quot; Austerians &quot; - those who propose fiscal austerity to stem spiraling government debt . 
The Keynesian prescription is simple : If the economy is weak , fiscal policy should be used to stimulate it ; if it is overheating , spending cuts or tax hikes should be used to cool it down . 
Public-debt levels will rise and fall , but policymakers should not pay too much attention . 
After all , look at the United States and the United Kingdom : despite high deficits and rising debt , inflation remains subdued and long-term interest rates are at historic lows . 
Why not use this opportunity to stimulate the economy and invest in its future ? 
Interestingly , Reinhart and Rogoff broadly agree with this recommendation ( at least for the US ) , and they even support heterodox policies such as writing down mortgages and targeting a higher inflation rate . 
But their paper is really about a different subject . 
It is about the long-term effects of high levels of public debt , which they argue are deleterious to growth . 
That conclusion implies that Krugman is wrong to claim that one can be blas√© about the debt level . 
Krugman would argue that , if the economy remains weak , interest rates will remain low , despite high and rising public debt . 
Fear of a speculative attack by so-called &quot; bond vigilantes &quot; is unwarranted , he would claim , as the US and the UK show . 
The Reinhart / Rogoff paper provides worldwide evidence in favor of the view that high public debt can become a problem , and that countries should beware of putting themselves in a vulnerable position . 
But the ensuing debate sheds no light on the question of whether policymakers should disregard debt levels when their economies are depressed , as Krugman recommends . 
There really is a big bad debt wolf , and the world is full of examples in which it has emerged from its lair to create havoc . 
Consider Spain . 
When the 2008 crisis erupted , the G-20 convened that November to coordinate a Keynesian response . 
All member countries were supposed to fight the coming recession by stimulating their economies through simultaneous fiscal expansion . 
Pedro Solbes , Spain &apos;s finance minister at the time , quickly ordered an acceleration of public investment and spending . 
By the spring of 2009 , however , Solbes was forced to reverse course . 
With tax revenue collapsing and expenditure ballooning , the government found itself running such large deficits that the markets were spooked - government-bond prices collapsed , interest rates soared , and the country found itself unable to finance its deficit . 
Where were the rock-bottom interest rates that are supposed to characterize periods of weak growth and high unemployment ? 
Financial history is full of similar examples : Mexico in 1994 , Russia in 1998 , Ecuador in 1999 , Argentina in 2001 , Uruguay in 2002 , the Dominican Republic in 2003 , and even the UK in 1976 . 
All were battling recession and high unemployment , only to find themselves unable to finance their deficits . 
In fact , when a country is in this predicament , fiscal contraction may end up being expansionary to the extent that it reestablishes financial confidence and lowers sky-high interest rates . 
As much as Krugman has made of the Reinhart / Rogoff paper , the debate between &quot; Austerians &quot; and Keynesians has limited relevance outside of the US . 
Krugman does not mention issues that he knows are central to fiscal choices . 
The level of debt does matter , and its currency composition matters even more . 
The US is in the enviable position of issuing debt in its own currency . 
The Federal Reserve can create as many dollars as it sees fit in order to buy government debt . 
Moreover , as the world &apos;s reserve currency , the dollar plays a very particular role in the global economy . 
Japan , too , can finance its deficits , despite astronomical public debt , because it borrows in yen - and overwhelmingly from Japanese institutional investors . 
By contrast , Spain &apos;s debt is in euros , a currency that it cannot print , and is held mostly by foreigners . 
And many emerging-market countries are in a similar position . 
In a recent paper with Ugo Panizza of the Graduate Institute of Development Studies in Geneva , we show that in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis , emerging-market countries that could run the kind of counter-cyclical Keynesian policies espoused by Krugman had low levels of foreign-currency debt . 
It is only because they were &quot; Austerians &quot; before the crisis that they could afford to be Keynesians afterwards . 
Whatever weaknesses one finds in the Reinhart / Rogoff paper , it does not follow that countries in recession should always disregard deficits and debt levels and focus on stimulus . 
That might be the right recommendation for the US today , but as a universal rule of thumb , it is just plain wrong .
