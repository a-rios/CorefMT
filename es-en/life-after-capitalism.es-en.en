Life after Capitalism 
LONDON - In 1995 , I published a book called The World After Communism . 
Today , I wonder whether there will be a world after capitalism . 
That question is not prompted by the worst economic slump since the 1930 &quot; s . 
Capitalism has always had crises , and will go on having them . 
Rather , it comes from the feeling that Western civilization is increasingly unsatisfying , saddled with a system of incentives that are essential for accumulating wealth , but that undermine our capacity to enjoy it . 
Capitalism may be close to exhausting its potential to create a better life - at least in the world &apos;s rich countries . 
By &quot; better , &quot; I mean better ethically , not materially . 
Material gains may continue , though evidence shows that they no longer make people happier . 
My discontent is with the quality of a civilization in which the production and consumption of unnecessary goods has become most people &apos;s main occupation . 
This is not to denigrate capitalism . 
It was , and is , a superb system for overcoming scarcity . 
By organising production efficiently , and directing it to the pursuit of welfare rather than power , it has lifted a large part of the world out of poverty . 
Yet what happens to such a system when scarcity has been turned to plenty ? 
Does it just go on producing more of the same , stimulating jaded appetites with new gadgets , thrills , and excitements ? 
How much longer can this continue ? 
Do we spend the next century wallowing in triviality ? 
For most of the last century , the alternative to capitalism was socialism . 
But socialism , in its classical form , failed - as it had to . 
Public production is inferior to private production for any number of reasons , not least because it destroys choice and variety . 
And , since the collapse of communism , there has been no coherent alternative to capitalism . 
Beyond capitalism , it seems , stretches a vista of ... capitalism . 
There have always been huge moral questions about capitalism , which could be put to one side because capitalism was so successful at generating wealth . 
Now , when we already have all the wealth we need , we are right to wonder whether the costs of capitalism are worth incurring . 
Adam Smith , for example , recognized that the division of labor would make people dumber by robbing them of non-specialized skills . 
Yet he thought that this was a price - possibly compensated by education - worth paying , since the widening of the market increased the growth of wealth . 
This made him a fervent free trader . 
Today &apos;s apostles of free trade argue the case in much the same way as Adam Smith , ignoring the fact that wealth has expanded enormously since Smith &apos;s day . 
They typically admit that free trade costs jobs , but claim that re-training programs will fit workers into new , &quot; higher value &quot; jobs . 
This amounts to saying that even though rich countries ( or regions ) no longer need the benefits of free trade , they must continue to suffer its costs . 
Defenders of the current system reply : we leave such choices to individuals to make for themselves . 
If people want to step off the conveyor belt , they are free to do so . 
And increasing numbers do , in fact , &quot; drop out . &quot; 
Democracy , too , means the freedom to vote capitalism out of office . 
This answer is powerful but na√Øve . 
People do not form their preferences in isolation . 
Their choices are framed by their societies &quot; dominant culture . 
Is it really supposed that constant pressure to consume has no effect on preferences ? 
We ban pornography and restrict violence on TV , believing that they affect people negatively , yet we should believe that unrestricted advertising of consumer goods affects only the distribution of demand , but not the total ? 
Capitalism &apos;s defenders sometimes argue that the spirit of acquisitiveness is so deeply ingrained in human nature that nothing can dislodge it . 
But human nature is a bundle of conflicting passions and possibilities . 
It has always been the function of culture ( including religion ) to encourage some and limit the expression of others . 
Indeed , the &quot; spirit of capitalism &quot; entered human affairs rather late in history . 
Before then , markets for buying and selling were hedged with legal and moral restrictions . 
A person who devoted his life to making money was not regarded as a good role model . 
Greed , avarice , and envy were among the deadly sins . 
Usury ( making money from money ) was an offense against God . 
It was only in the eighteenth century that greed became morally respectable . 
It was now considered healthily Promethean to turn wealth into money and put it to work to make more money , because by doing this one was benefiting humanity . 
This inspired the American way of life , where money always talks . 
The end of capitalism means simply the end of the urge to listen to it . 
People would start to enjoy what they have , instead of always wanting more . 
One can imagine a society of private wealth holders , whose main objective is to lead good lives , not to turn their wealth into &quot; capital . &quot; 
Financial services would shrink , because the rich would not always want to become richer . 
As more and more people find themselves with enough , one might expect the spirit of gain to lose its social approbation . 
Capitalism would have done its work , and the profit motive would resume its place in the rogues &quot; gallery . 
The dishonoring of greed is likely only in those countries whose citizens already have more than they need . 
And even there , many people still have less than they need . 
The evidence suggests that economies would be more stable and citizens happier if wealth and income were more evenly distributed . 
The economic justification for large income inequalities - the need to stimulate people to be more productive - collapses when growth ceases to be so important . 
Perhaps socialism was not an alternative to capitalism , but its heir . 
It will inherit the earth not by dispossessing the rich of their property , but by providing motives and incentives for behavior that are unconnected with the further accumulation of wealth .
