Why Wealth Taxes Are Not Enough 
CAMBRIDGE - Should advanced countries implement wealth taxes as a means of stabilizing and reducing public debt over the medium term ? 
The normally conservative International Monetary Fund has given the idea surprisingly emphatic support . 
The IMF calculates that a one-time 10 % wealth levy , if introduced quickly and unexpectedly , could return many European countries to pre-crisis public debt / GDP ratios . 
It is an intriguing idea . 
The moral case for a wealth tax is more compelling than usual today , with unemployment still at recession levels , and with deep economic inequality straining social norms . 
And , if it were really possible to ensure that the wealth levy would be temporary , such a tax would , in principle , be much less distortionary than imposing higher marginal tax rates on income . 
Unfortunately , while a wealth tax may be a sound way to help a country dig out of a deep fiscal pit , it is hardly a panacea . 
For starters , the revenue gains from temporary wealth taxes can be very elusive . 
The economist Barry Eichengreen once explored the imposition of capital levies in the aftermath of World Wars I and II . 
He found that , owing to capital flight and political pressure for delay , the results were often disappointing . 
Italy &apos;s armada of Guardia di Finanza boats would hardly forestall a massive exodus of wealth if Italians see a sizable wealth tax coming . 
Over- and under-invoicing of trade , for example , is a time-tested way to spirit money out of a country . 
( For example , an exporter under-reports the price received for a foreign shipment , and keeps the extra cash hidden abroad . ) 
And there would be a rush into jewelry and other hard-to-detect real assets . 
The distortionary effects of a wealth levy would also be exacerbated by concerns that the &quot; temporary &quot; levy would not be a one-off tax . 
After all , most temporary taxes come for lunch and stay for dinner . 
Fears of future wealth taxes could discourage entrepreneurship and lower the saving rate . 
In addition , the administrative difficulties of instituting a comprehensive wealth tax are formidable , raising questions about fairness . 
For example , it would be extremely difficult to place market values on the family-owned businesses that pervade Mediterranean countries . 
Wealth taxes that target land and structures are arguably insulated from some of these concerns , and property taxes are relatively underused outside the Anglo-Saxon countries . 
In theory , taxing immobile assets is less distortionary , though taxes on structures obviously can discourage both maintenance and new construction . 
So what else can eurozone governments do to raise revenue as their economies recover ? 
Most economists favor finding ways to broaden the tax base - for example , by eliminating special deductions and privileges - in order to keep marginal tax rates low . 
Broadening the income-tax base is a central element of the highly regarded Simpson / Bowles proposals for tax reform in the United States . 
In Europe , efficiency would be enhanced by a unified VAT rate , instead of creating distortions by charging different rates for different goods . 
In principle , low-income individuals and families could be compensated through lump-sum transfer programs . 
Another idea is to try to raise more revenue from carbon permits or taxes . 
Raising funds by taxing negative externalities reduces distortions rather than creating them . 
Though such taxes are spectacularly unpopular - perhaps because individuals refuse to admit that the externalities they themselves create are significant - I regard them as an important direction for future policy ( and I intend to suggest other ideas along these lines in future columns ) . 
Unfortunately , advanced countries have implemented very little fundamental tax reform so far . 
Many governments are giving in to higher marginal tax rates rather than overhauling and simplifying the system . 
In Europe , officials are also turning to stealth taxes , particularly financial repression , to resolve high public-debt overhangs . 
Through regulation and administrative directives , banks , insurance companies , and pension funds are being forced to hold much higher shares of government debt than they might voluntarily choose to do . 
But this approach is hardly progressive , as the final holders of pensions , insurance contracts , and bank deposits are typically the beleaguered middle class and the elderly . 
There is also the unresolved question of how much the periphery countries really should be asked to pay on their debilitating debt burdens , whatever the tax instrument . 
Although the IMF seems particularly enthusiastic about using wealth taxes to resolve debt overhangs in Spain and Italy , some burden sharing with the north seems reasonable . 
As the economists Maurice Obstfeld and Galina Hale recently noted , German and French banks earned large profits intermediating flows between Asian savers and Europe &apos;s periphery . 
Unfortunately , arguing over burden sharing creates more scope for delay , potentially undermining the efficacy of any wealth tax that might finally be instituted . 
Still , the IMF is right - on grounds of both fairness and efficiency - to raise the idea of temporary wealth taxes in advanced countries to relieve fiscal distress . 
However , the revenues will almost certainly be lower , and the costs higher , than calculations used to promote them would imply . 
Temporary wealth taxes may well be a part of the answer for countries in fiscal trouble today , and the idea should be taken seriously . 
But they are no substitute for fundamental long-term reform to make tax systems simpler , fairer , and more efficient .
