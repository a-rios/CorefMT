The Next Liberation of France 
Ségolène Royal has turned the tables on the Socialist Party to become its standard bearer in next year &apos;s election . 
But her triumph is only part of an intense political debate of the sort France has not seen for decades . 
With parliamentary and presidential elections next year , the stakes are as high as at any previous turning point in modern French history . 
A unique feature of today &apos;s debate is its cohort of public intellectuals like Jacques Marseille , Nicolas Baverez , Elie Cohen , and Stephane Rozes , none of whom subscribe to the hoary notion of French uniqueness ( the so-called exception française ) . 
Their thinking is at the forefront of a widening recognition that France must face the world &apos;s challenges as they really are , not as the French want them to be . 
That means accepting and dealing with globalization . 
France certainly has the tools to cope . 
With only 1 % of the world &apos;s population , France is the sixth largest economy , ranking fourth in international trade and third in exports of goods and services . 
More than 40 % of the largest companies quoted on the Paris stock exchange are in foreign hands . 
Indeed , one in seven workers is employed by a foreign company , compared to one in ten in the UK and one in 20 in the United States . 
Productivity is relatively high , at $ 33 per hour , compared to $ 27 for the UK . 
Moreover , France will enjoy large gains from exports to the fast-growing emerging world , since it produces more competitive high value-added goods than , for example , southern European countries , whose exports are closer to those of the leading emerging countries . 
France could handle globalization , if not for the French state . 
Its relatively poor business environment was highlighted by the World Bank &apos;s latest Doing Business survey . 
The section &quot; Starting a business , &quot; which identifies the bureaucratic and legal hurdles to incorporating and registering a new firm , ranks France in 35th place , whereas the UK ranks sixth and the US ranks third . 
But the worst damage done by state policies is unemployment . 
If there is an exception française , it is that for the past 30 years , the unemployment rate has never fallen below 8.5 % . 
If you exclude the cosseted army of public-sector workers , the rate approaches 15 % . 
Youth unemployment , including the female population , averages 23 % , while in deprived suburbs with concentrated immigrant populations , the rate hits 70 % . 
Much of the political class and public opinion blames globalization - outsourcing and company relocations to cheaper labor markets - for unemployment . 
But the chief culprit is France &apos;s own labor code - a forest of regulations that offers the strongest employment protection anywhere in the world . 
In the section &quot; Employing workers &quot; of Doing Business , France ranks 134th , compared to 17th for the UK and first for the US . 
With employers unwilling to hire workers that they cannot easily fire , French young people are right to feel uncertain about their future . 
Joblessness is the main cause of poverty . 
The primary protection against poverty is earned income - for which even France &apos;s generous unemployment benefits and other welfare payments are an inadequate substitute . 
Much of the high tax burden required to finance them falls on companies in the form of payroll taxes ( employers &quot; social security contributions ) , which further deter companies from taking on more staff . 
Successive French governments have let this situation fester . 
Dominique de Villepin &apos;s government turned away from this challenge in favor of &quot; economic patriotism &quot; - that is , protecting supposed national champions from foreign takeover . 
Despite comical episodes such as classifying the dairy company Danone as a national security asset to head off a possible bid from Coca Cola , France &apos;s foreign investment regime is no less restrictive than other developed countries , including the US . 
This scapegoating of globalization reflects another key problem . 
Successive governments , not companies , are responsible for the most damaging outsourcing in France - that of responsibility . 
Instead of proposing reforms to the electorate and then implementing them on the strength of a clear democratic mandate , the few serious reforms in the past 20 years have been presented as being externally imposed - mainly to comply with European Union requirements . 
As a result , reform has come to seem illegitimate , which has strengthened resistance to it . 
Breaking the impasse requires restoring political legitimacy by electing a president who , having promised reform , gains a mandate to deliver it . 
Both leading contenders in the 2007 presidential election , Ségolène Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy , share relative youth ( compared to the geriatrics of recent decades ) and have their fingers on the pulse of public opinion . 
Their common approach is to enter into a real dialogue with the French people based on an understanding that the only viable basis for reform is a strong political contract between government and citizens . 
This stands in sharp contrast to the reigns of François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac , with their elitism , arrogance , paternalism , and stagnation . 
Whatever the election &apos;s outcome , the return of political will and legitimacy to France will come not a moment too soon .
