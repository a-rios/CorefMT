G-8 Movie Night 
Many people rightly regard the annual G-8 ( Group of Eight ) presidential summit as the closest thing we have to a functioning world government . 
So it is a shame that these meetings tend to be so scripted and dull , with so little room for the informality needed to make genuine progress on tough issues involving world peace and prosperity . 
True , this year is a bit better thanks to having Russia &apos;s Vladimir Putin as host ; there is simply too much tension between him and his Western counterparts to keep all emotions under wraps . 
But if these meetings are ever to be really effective , we need a change in format to spice things up . 
I have a suggestion . 
Why not have George W. Bush , Putin , and the other leaders share a G-8 movie night , and then discuss their reactions over drinks afterwards ? 
That should get a conversation going ! 
Of course , there is the question of which movie to pick . 
This year , the clear first choice has to be the 1963 James Bond spy thriller &quot; From Russia with Love . &quot; 
The name itself makes it a winner , and the presidents can enjoy watching the fireworks between suave British spy Bond ( Sean Connery ) and his fetching Russian KGB counterpart Tatiana ( Daniela Bianchi ) . 
In case you are worried that the Bond-Tatiana affair would spark too many off-color remarks from the collective eminences , the presence of German Chancellor Angela Merkel should keep things under control . 
Perhaps after a couple drinks , Putin might spill the beans on whether , as a real-world KGB agent , he ever directed any remotely similar operation . 
And Bush , while of course having no such experience of his own , could retell some of his father &apos;s stories when he was the head of the CIA in the 1970 &quot; s . 
Not to be left out , Europeans could use the film &apos;s romantic shots of Istanbul to open up about whether Turkey will ever join their club . 
There are countless other possibilities . 
It would be a bit awkward , but the esteemed guests could also view &quot; An Inconvenient Truth , &quot; narrated by Al Gore , the man Bush narrowly defeated in the 2000 US presidential election . 
Gore &apos;s deeply earnest film plots the relentless , and potentially disastrous , warming of the earth during the industrial era . 
He attributes , debatably , the entire problem to higher carbon emissions from cars , power plants , etc . 
Gore &apos;s film would give the Europeans , always in danger of being marginalized at these meetings , the chance to boast about how they , unlike the Americans and Russians , are already doing their part by heavily taxing gas consumption . 
Bush &apos;s reaction is less predictable . 
On the one hand , his new star Treasury Secretary , Hank Paulson , the former chairman of Goldman Sachs , has long been deeply committed to environmental causes . 
Paulson &apos;s appointment presumably shows that Bush is far more concerned about environmental issues than is commonly believed . 
But , on the other hand , some of Bush &apos;s more intemperate Republican colleagues might have told him that global warming will lift ocean levels to the point where many of the coastal &quot; blue &quot; states , which tend to vote for the opposition Democrats , will be washed away , leaving only &quot; red &quot; Republican states in the center of the country . 
Putin &apos;s position on global warming would be less ambivalent . 
With his country so totally - indeed , embarrassingly - dependent on oil and gas revenues , he is hardly likely to want to spark a big push towards energy conservation . 
One could go on forever with possible films , but clearly G-8 movie night might rekindle life in the organization &apos;s moribund framework , and keep it going for many years to come . 
And there are so many other advantages . 
Consider the dubious results from the G-8 summit in Gleneagles , Scotland , in 2005 . 
Desperate to capture some of the star power of the rock star-driven campaign to reduce poor countries &quot; debt , the leaders agreed to forgive Third World debt that no one ever expected to be repaid . 
Rather than making really substantive improvements in the quantity and quality of aid delivery , not to mention finding a path towards better governance in Africa , they chose a desperate plea for photo ops with Bono and Angelina Jolie . 
With a movie night , there would be a ready-made excuse for inviting glitterati to attend G-8 events to help spark discussions . 
Don &apos;t we all want to know how Bond ( oops , I mean Sean Connery ) would deal with Iran or North Korea ? 
To be sure , there could be glitches . 
What if Russia were to inadvertently use a copy of the film that was pirated , as one imagines is true of most copies floating around in Russia ? 
That would hardly look good given all the bashing China takes for not enforcing intellectual property rights more vigorously . 
Or what if , after a few years , the whole thing devolves into an empty exercise in political correctness ? 
Still , I say let &apos;s give G-8 movie night a chance . 
It would certainly be more entertaining that the current framework , and , who knows , it might even inspire better policy .
