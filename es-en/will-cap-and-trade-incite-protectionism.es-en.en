Will Cap-and-Trade Incite Protectionism ? 
CAMBRIDGE Â­ - There is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap-and-trade legislation to limit carbon-dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures . 
While aimed at reducing long-term environmental damage , cap-and-trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future . 
Scientific evidence appears to indicate that the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels ( primarily coal , oil , and natural gas ) - mainly in electricity production , transportation , and various industrial processes - contributes to gradual global warming , with long-term adverse effects on living conditions around the world . 
It is with this in mind that representatives of more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet in Copenhagen in December to discuss ways to reduce CO2 emissions . 
A common suggestion is to impose a tax on all CO2 emissions , which would be levied on companies that emit CO2 in production , or that sell products like gasoline that cause CO2 emissions when used . 
Such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their CO2 emissions , as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay . 
The higher cost of production incurred to reduce emissions - and of any emissions tax still due - would , of course , be included in the price charged to consumers . 
Consumers would respond to the tax-induced increase in the cost of the emissions-intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of CO2 emissions . 
A carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding CO2 to the atmosphere . 
That uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements , such as automobile mileage standards , production technology standards ( e.g. , minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation ) , etc . 
Yet we do not see carbon taxes being adopted . 
Although governments levy taxes on gasoline , they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of taxation . 
Governments have therefore focused on a cap-and-trade system as a way of increasing the cost of CO2-intensive products without explicitly imposing a tax . 
In a cap-and-trade system , the government sets total allowable national emissions of CO2 per year and requires any firm that causes CO2 emissions to have a permit per ton of CO2 emitted . 
If the government sells these permits in an auction , the price of the permit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax - and with the same resulting increases in consumer prices . 
The cap-and-trade system thus imposes a carbon tax without having to admit that it is really a tax . 
A cap-and-trade system can cause serious risks to international trade . 
Even if every country has a cap-and-trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national CO2 emissions , the resulting permit prices will differ because of national differences in initial CO2 levels and in domestic production characteristics . 
Because the price of the CO2 permits in a country is reflected in the prices of its products , the cap-and-trade system affects its international competitiveness . 
When the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions , there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices . 
Such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products ( being higher on more CO2-intensive products ) and among countries ( being higher for countries with low permit prices ) . 
Such a system of complex differential tariffs is just the kind of protectionism that governments have been working to eliminate since the start of the GATT process more than 50 years ago . 
Worse still , cap-and-trade systems in practice do not rely solely on auctions to distribute the emissions permits . 
The plan working its way through the United States Congress ( the Waxman-Markey bill ) would initially give away 85 % of the permits , impose a complex set of regulatory policies , and allow companies to buy CO2 offsets ( e.g. , by paying for the planting of trees ) instead of reducing their emissions or buying permits . 
Such complexities make it impossible to compare the impact of CO2 policies among countries , which in turn would invite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher tariff levels . 
There is no easy answer to this problem . 
But before rushing to impose tariffs , it is important to remember that cap-and-trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competitiveness . 
Better roads , ports , and even schools all contribute to a country &apos;s competitiveness . 
No one attempts to use tariffs to balance those government-created differences in competitiveness , and there should be no such attempts if a cap-and-trade system is introduced . 
If an international agreement to impose a cap-and-trade scheme is adopted in Copenhagen , the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce offsetting tariffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade .
