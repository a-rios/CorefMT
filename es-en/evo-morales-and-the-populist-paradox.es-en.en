Evo Morales and the Populist Paradox 
LA PAZ - Evo Morales succeeded in amending the Bolivia &apos;s constitution and being re-elected President . 
And , backed by his parliamentary majority , he was recently able to fill vacant judicial posts , making him the most powerful president in Bolivia &apos;s contemporary history . 
According to his opponents , Morales is reproducing the tradition of caudillismo , concentrating power in his hands and turning government institutions into mere formalities . 
But his immense popularity over the past five years suggests that most Bolivians do not seem very worried in putting their country &apos;s democracy at risk . 
Morales &apos;s success rests largely on the paradox of populism . 
Although he claims to oppose economic liberalism , he is a product of the political liberties that it promotes and feeds on the benefits generated by the market economy . 
Morales was born into a peasant household on the Andean altiplano and later established himself in Chapare at the beginning of the coca boom . 
His career as a union leader took him away from agriculture and into politics , where he stood out for his criticism of the United States , whose anti-drug crusade meant the eradication of a cash crop for poor peasants . 
By defending the coca leaf , consumed for centuries in the Andean world and the raw material for cocaine , Morales was able to link his opposition to America &apos;s anti-drug policy with the defense of native cultural tradition and the economic rights of the poor . 
Thus , Morales &apos;s leadership brought together three strongly symbolic dimensions : nationalist sentiment , concern for the poor , and emerging ethnic pride among Bolivia &apos;s native peoples . 
But the making of Morales as a leader able to combine these three dimensions reflects two institutional reforms in the 1990 &quot; s that expanded social participation and opened up opportunities for new leaders and political movements . 
The division of the country into municipalities transferred tax resources and decision-making capabilities to communities , thereby enabling agricultural unions to control several towns and assume management responsibilities . 
This led to the formation of new political parties , and the creation of regional councils in 1997 made it possible for leaders with strong local roots - like Morales - to reach Bolivia &apos;s congress without any major party &apos;s backing . 
Once situated at the center of the political scene , Congressman Morales took advantage of his constitutional immunity to intensify his union activities and his fight against anti-drug policies . 
In the 2002 elections , Morales received an unexpected boost from the US ambassador , who , by declaring himself against Morales , stirred up nationalist sentiment . 
Morales went on to win the 2005 presidential election with an absolute majority . 
The other parties made it easier for him by discrediting each other , failing even to defend their own achievements over the previous 20 years . 
Two other factors that made Morales &apos;s rise possible were the revival of Bolivia &apos;s oil industry and the creation of mechanisms for distributing the income that oil produces . 
Both now sustain his rule . 
Private investment in the mid-1990 &quot; s , moreover , increased output of natural gas . 
Soon gas was being exported - very profitably - to Brazil . 
Thus , when Morales came to power , Bolivia &apos;s economy was in a position to take advantage of the global price boom for raw materials . 
As a result , revenues increased , despite his government &apos;s nationalist and statist policies , which drove away investment and hindered access to new markets . 
Since 2005 , Bolivian exports have increased six-fold , along with fiscal revenue . 
This money is distributed automatically to local governments , according to the model established by Morales &apos;s predecessors , carrying resources to the farthest reaches of the country . 
But it is not only local governments that have benefited ; through cash transfers created during the so called neo-liberal years , families have gained as well , most importantly through a universal and non-contributive old-age pension benefit given to persons over 60 , which reaches slightly more than 30 % of households . 
In recent years , aid for students at public schools and maternity assistance for pregnant women at health centers have been created , but these have a greater political than economic impact . 
Indeed , Morales &apos;s economic initiatives usually turn out to be empty , such as his deals with Venezuela for hydrocarbon supplies and with India for iron . 
His plan to exploit and industrialize the country &apos;s gas fields remains just a promise . 
The Bolivian economy has grown moderately under Morales &apos;s management , owing to international demand and cash transfers from the state to local governments and individuals . 
These not only increase household spending , but also offer opportunities for trade , in both the formal and informal sectors , making it the most successful policy in the fight against poverty . 
Thus , despite official speeches intended to support state intervention , Morales &apos;s government benefits mainly from the workings of the market . 
The failure of state plans and projects is overlooked because of the small but expanding internal market , which is invigorated by de facto economic liberalism involving the growth of smuggling and drug traffic . 
These illicit activities are not intended , but they increase the income of peasants , transporters , builders , and businessmen . 
This is the paradox of twenty-first-century socialism : economic liberalism is the foundation for a policy that aspires to replace it . 
This might also be its greatest limitation as a political project .
