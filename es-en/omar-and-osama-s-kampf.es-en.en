Omar and Osama \ u0027s Kampf 
History possesses many stories like this : a political party emerges , and most people think it a bad or sick joke . 
Everyone tries to ignore it ; that is , when they are not laughing at it . 
Suddenly , the economy becomes bad or an external threat looms and that party marches toward power . 
When it seizes the government - think of Hitler , Lenin , Mussolini , even of Mullah Omar in Afghanistan - all laughter stops . 
In Poland , a &quot; joke &quot; party of malignant intentions is emerging . 
Called &quot; Self-defense , &quot; it voices ( it says ) the discontents of poor farmers and those displaced and radically dissatisfied with politics here . 
The leader of &quot; Self-defense &quot; is a shrill primitive named Andrzej Lepper . 
A thuggish guttersnipe more akin to Aleksander Lukashenka , the dictator of Belarus , than to the great dictators , Lepper nonetheless represents a hideous post-modern form of irrational politics . 
For this reason , I cannot laugh at him . 
Hitler , Lenin , and Mussolini sought power in order to use the state to impose their will and their programs . 
Today &apos;s anti-democrats , however , view the state as an obstacle . 
They want to gut state power so that jackals like themselves can feed on the corpse . 
&quot; Self-defense &quot; has participated in several parliamentary elections but never received more than 2 % of the vote before this year . 
Three weeks before last September &apos;s elections , opinion polls gave it 7-8 % of the vote . 
Everyone thought this an exaggeration , but when the balloting ended , &quot; Self-defense &quot; had secured nearly 11 % of the vote and was parliament &apos;s third largest party . 
Everyone was shocked . 
So Lepper became parliament &apos;s deputy speaker ( one of four ) . 
Because he is provocative , political commentators and TV and newspaper interviewers were drawn to him . 
Not for long . 
Lepper sought to reclaim their attention by calling the foreign minister a traitor , and threatening violence if his program was not enacted . 
Ideas about civilizing &quot; Self-defense &quot; ended . 
Parliament evicted Lepper from his deputy speakers &apos;s position . 
In Lepper &apos;s last speech as deputy speaker he accused many famous politicians of taking bribes , naming the amounts , times , and places where the bribery took place . 
Now Lepper seems unable to prove his accusations or offer any substantiation of them . 
No matter : he kept his profile high by asking to meet America &apos;s Ambassador , saying that he knew of a Polish role in the events of September 11 th . 
I wish that I could say that by discrediting himself , Lepper self-destructed . 
This is what should happen in a democracy . 
After all , the American demagogue Joe McCarthy imploded when he failed to prove his charge that there were hundreds of Soviet spies infesting the US State Department . 
But Lepper is no empty windbag like McCarthy . 
He is not a nationalist like France &apos;s Le Pen ; he is neither rightist nor leftist . 
Instead , he loathes the political system and wants to overturn and replace it with a nothingness in which feral politicians run amuck . 
Lepper &apos;s supporters are not the poor and excluded , but are remnants of the lower Communist nomenclatura ( the apparatchiks too stupid to steal as Communism collapsed ) and those who made money during the grey period of 1989-1991 , when state controls were practically nonexistent and when all that you needed to make money was a truck and enough petrol to drive to Berlin . 
You smuggled and you became relatively rich . 
Lepper &apos;s people are nostalgic for the profitable anarchy of a crippled state . 
So who is their enemy ? 
Not the Jews , masons or gypsies who were the traditional targets of lumpen anti-democrats . &quot; Self-defense &quot; loathes , instead , democratic government . 
They repudiate not only parliament and its necessary compromises , but the rule of law itself . 
Parliamentary democracy was born centuries ago by Europeans sickened by domestic ( mainly religious ) wars . 
Indeed , parliamentary democracy &apos;s greatest enemy remains domestic war . 
I do not want to exaggerate the threat that Lepper poses , but I believe he represents a poisonous model of irrational politics . 
From Indonesia to Afghanistan , from Georgia to Ukraine , Lepper &apos;s movement is part of a new nihilism that seeks to make countries ungovernable . 
As a political philosopher , I find democracy &apos;s internal enemies a true intellectual problem . 
Law , I believe , cannot be democracy &apos;s only defense , because even if Lepper &apos;s countless lies are proven false and he is jailed , his followers ( and their rage ) will remain . 
Like Hitler , he will likely emerge from prison even more beloved by them . 
You cannot win domestic wars ( even non-violent ones ) through legal processes alone . 
America could not defeat Osama bin Laden &apos;s terrorists through arrests , indictments , and trials . 
Political means are not the only tools that can be employed against political dangers . 
All the ordinary - and the extraordinary - weapons that democracy possesses must be employed . 
We must - to repeat the idea of the German political philosopher Carl Schmitt ( no friend of democracy himself ) - treat enemies as enemies . 
When democracy is at stake you must defend it , to borrow a line from Malcolm X , &quot; by any means necessary . &quot; 
This may be difficult for liberals to understand ; more difficult for democratic-minded peoples to accept . 
But hard choices are inevitable if democracy is to prevail .
