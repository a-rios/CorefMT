Japan \ u0027s Leadership Muddle 
OSAKA - Having seen a new prime minister every year for five consecutive years , Japan has just narrowly avoided having its third in 2010 . 
Prime Minister Naoto Kan has been elected President of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) , surviving a challenge from Ichiro Ozawa , the DPJ &apos;s most potent behind-the-scenes power broker . 
Had Nan lost to Ozawa , he would have lost the premiership to him as well . 
With DPJ lawmakers almost equally split , Kan &apos;s victory is being attributed to the support of general and associate party members . 
Their vote was more in line with recent public-opinion polls , which showed popular support running at seven-to-two in favor of Kan over Ozawa . 
Only three months ago , Kan was chosen as the DPJ &apos;s top leader to restore its public image , which had been severely tarnished by political-financing scandals involving his predecessor as prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , and a separate scandal involving Ozawa . 
Hatoyama &apos;s mismanagement of Japan &apos;s relations with the United States , centered on the relocation of a Marine base in Okinawa , had also dented the DPJ &apos;s standing . 
From the moment the DPJ took power in 2009 , Kan was tacitly slated to be Hatoyama &apos;s successor , given that he was concurrently Hatoyama &apos;s deputy prime minister and treasury minister . 
In these posts , Kan avoided involvement with the two issues that wrecked Hatoyama &apos;s premiership : the controversial base relocation issue , and debates over budget cuts . 
Consequently , he was aloof from the DPJ &apos;s feud with Japan &apos;s powerful bureaucratic mandarins , who are desperately trying to safeguard the longstanding bureaucratic / cabinet system in which the once-ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) passed mandarin-drafted , cabinet-sponsored bills and budgets , almost continuously , for five decades . 
Surprisingly , Kan , who entered politics to dismantle the old system , now has switched to the mandarins &quot; side . 
The DPJ suffered a bitter defeat in this summer &apos;s upper-house election , after Kan abruptly proposed a significant increase in the highly unpopular consumption tax . 
That increase would enable Treasury mandarins to maintain their latitude in setting fiscal policy , while making it unnecessary to streamline special-account budget financing for gargantuan public corporations , into which retiring bureaucrats parachute for lucrative jobs . 
Moreover , Kan &apos;s approach to the base relocation issue revived the old LDP plan , which the DPJ had previously denounced . 
Kan &apos;s retreat means that the mandarins continue to hold the reins of foreign and defense policy . 
Even if Kan had failed to win the upper-house election , the mandarins would have faced a weakened DPJ . 
Either way , they won . 
Small wonder , then , that Hatoyama advocated replacing Kan with Ozawa , even though Hatoyama insisted that Ozawa resign when he was forced from the premiership three months ago . 
Both are openly opposed not only to the tax increase , but also to the continuing presence of the US Marine base on Okinawa . 
While committed to the bilateral US-Japan alliance , Ozawa has said that Japan &apos;s security requires the continued presence only of the US Seventh Fleet , not of US ground troops . 
Evidently , he is trying to redefine the relationship , probably with a view to enhancing Japan &apos;s freedom of maneuver in foreign and security policy . 
Despite his confusing signals , Ozawa &apos;s stance is neither pro-China nor anti-American , given that he most recently emphasized Japan &apos;s sovereignty over the Senkaku islands as an integral part of its territory - a position that China strongly disputes . 
Logically , Ozawa &apos;s approach involves a significant military buildup , but he remains silent about how to maintain effective deterrence once the US Marines leave Okinawa . 
Kan &apos;s status quo approach to alliance management won &apos;t hold up long , because Hatoyama &apos;s bungling has inflated Okinawans &quot; expectations about evicting the Marines . 
The current governor will likely block any construction to relocate a base on the island , exercising a de facto veto , particularly with the gubernatorial election due in late November . 
Only by equivocating about the relocation plan could Kan appease both the governor and US President Barack Obama , who is scheduled to meet Kan in Tokyo the same month . 
Japan and America can now agree only on what will not be implemented . 
The DPJ is caught between a rock and a hard place , and Kan &apos;s premiership will surely reach a stalemate . 
Because the DPJ has neither an upper-house majority nor the two-thirds lower-house majority needed to override upper-house votes , his government will be unable to pass budget and / or appropriation bills by the end of the current fiscal year , March 31 , 2011 . 
Ozawa , had he become prime minister , would inevitably have been subjected to not only similar obstruction in Diet sessions but also to interrogation about his financing scandal , while fearing prosecution . 
An Ozawa government might be stable only if he could form a grand coalition . 
Yet , given strong public sentiment against Ozawa , that is impossible . 
Meanwhile , Ozawa &apos;s electoral challenge has left the DPJ more divided than ever . 
In order to ride out the hung Diet , Kan will have to reconstruct party unity by replacing at least the incumbent anti-Ozawa party chief or Chief Cabinet Secretary , and , possibly , by appointing a pro-Ozawa Justice Minister - i.e. , someone who can block Ozawa &apos;s prosecution in the financing scandal . 
Appeasing Ozawa , however , is contrary to public sentiment and detrimental to the DPJ &apos;s hopes of regaining popular support . 
For the moment , Japan &apos;s political situation is stable , but that will last for the next six months , at most . 
The time is fast approaching when the public becomes entirely disillusioned with both the LDP and the DPJ , which comprise a two-party system in name only , in which legislators shift allegiance for reasons centered on attachment to or enmity against the LDP . 
Without a grand reorganization of the major political parties along ideological lines , Japan &apos;s domestic and foreign policies - including relations with the US - will remain a muddle .
