Keeping the Climate-Finance Promise 
LONDON - In 2009 , the world &apos;s rich countries pledged to mobilize $ 100 billion a year by 2020 to help poor countries tackle climate change . 
Since then , that promise has come to be regarded as a key test of the developed world &apos;s resolve to do its part in the fight against global warming . 
Reaching the $ 100 billion target is important . 
Poor countries must believe that rich countries will honor their pledges . 
Fortunately , there are encouraging signs that the commitment will be honored . 
According to the OECD and the Climate Policy Initiative , developed countries collectively mobilized $ 52.2 billion in 2013 and $ 61.8 billion in 2014 to help poor countries reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and build resilience against the effects of climate change that can no longer be avoided . 
While it is important to note that this figure is only an estimate , it represents a preliminary but credible indicator of climate finance , based on information provided by developed countries . 
If one assumes greater leverage for private-sector investment , the number would be higher . 
Similarly , conservative assumptions about how much &quot; genuinely extra &quot; money is being spent to fight climate change through overseas aid and the multilateral development banks might have produced a lower figure . 
In reaching their estimate , the researchers took into account major investments by both the public and private sectors in a wide range of projects . 
Examples include the funding of small-scale renewable energy projects in Uganda by the United Kingdom , Germany , Norway , and the European Union , as well as the African Risk Capacity - supported by the UK and Germany - which offers insurance to governments against drought and other natural disasters . 
What the report reveals is the relatively low level of investment by the private sector in projects that will increase poor countries &quot; resilience ( though the authors acknowledge that limited information might mean that the true amount is higher ) . 
This is both a challenge and an opportunity ; with the right incentives , a sharp rise in private investment that enhances resilience could go a long way toward meeting the $ 100 billion target . 
Reaching that goal will require increased confidence in the policies and institutions of the countries in which the money is to be spent . 
In this effort , development banks and bilateral aid institutions have much to offer . 
It is crucial that this new climate finance be used to complement the even-larger investments in sustainable development that will be necessary over the next few decades . 
A central aim for climate financing should be to establish and implement the policies , regulations , and frameworks that will create the appropriate incentives for investors . 
According to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , some $ 90 trillion will need to be spent on infrastructure over the next 15 years , mostly in developing and emerging economies that are experiencing rapid growth and urbanization . 
If that infrastructure locks in dependence on fossil fuels , it will be very difficult to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases . 
However , if countries invest wisely in the transition to a low-carbon economy , they will stimulate innovation and generate decades of sustainable growth . 
Thus , it is important that climate finance be used to foster public and private investment in low-carbon infrastructure and technologies , particularly to lower the cost of capital , which is crucial to scale up projects and encourage renewable-energy adoption . 
Furthermore , climate funding provided by rich countries should help improve resilience to climate change in the most vulnerable countries . 
And it should boost innovation and break new ground for climate action , including novel ways for the public and private sectors to work together , such as projects on carbon capture and storage . 
Some of the $ 100 billion will be channeled through the newly created Green Climate Fund ; but the existing multilateral development banks should also play a central role , along with national aid agencies and departments . 
Money spent on sustainable development and climate action should be mutually reinforcing . 
And finance ministries in developing countries should reaffirm that , in addition to fostering growth and poverty reduction , wise action to mitigate climate change can lower levels of air pollution and raise energy efficiency . 
Success will ultimately depend on rich countries &quot; willingness to live up to their promises . 
Their leaders must recognize that financial support for action against climate change in developing countries is not only morally right ; it is also in the interest of their constituencies and , indeed , the world community .
