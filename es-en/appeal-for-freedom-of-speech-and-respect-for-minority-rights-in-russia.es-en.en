Appeal for freedom of speech and respect for minority rights in Russia 
We were taken aback and dismayed by reports of actions directed against ethnic Georgians in Russia . 
These include accounts in the international media that Moscow police have asked schools to draw up lists of pupils with Georgian surnames as part of their search for illegal immigrants , and verifiable cases where Georgian businesses in Russia have been closed . 
Knowing the importance to poor families of remittance to Georgia , we are also concerned at reports of measures to block bank transfers . 
We feel obliged to emphasize that disputes between governments are not grounds for actions against the civilian population . 
We would hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will affirm the rights of ethnic minorities ; refrain from hostile rhetoric and actions against Georgians ; and ensure that our common democratic values and respectful relations between neighbours are upheld .
