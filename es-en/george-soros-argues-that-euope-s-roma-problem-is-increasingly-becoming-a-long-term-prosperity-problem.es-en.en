Empowering Europe &apos;s Roma 
BUDAPEST - Across Europe , millions are suffering from unemployment and the prospect of a long period of economic stagnation . 
There are more than ten million Roma living in Europe , mostly concentrated in the Balkans and in the European Union &apos;s newest member states , especially Romania , Bulgaria , Slovakia , and Hungary . 
What is truly shocking is that their living conditions have actually deteriorated since many of them became EU citizens . 
At the same time , the majority population &apos;s attitude has become more hostile almost everywhere in Europe . 
The two trends are mutually reinforcing : marginalization breeds contempt , and vice versa . 
The only escape from this trap is investment in education , which would pay enormous social dividends . 
Consider , for example , that Roma represent more than 20 % of new entrants into the labor force in the above-mentioned countries . 
The good news is that we know how to prepare Roma children to be productive members of society . 
My foundations have been active in educating Roma for more than 25 years . 
Over that period , we have educated a small cohort of young Roma who retain their identity and yet can break the hostile stereotypes held by those with whom they interact . 
Together with the World Bank , we established the Roma Education Fund in 2005 . 
The REF is ready to help national education authorities across the EU improve their performance in educating Roma children . 
Indeed , its programs currently reach more than 100,000 students each year , including more than 1,600 university students who receive scholarships . 
But these numbers are woefully inadequate relative to the magnitude of the problem . 
Half of the Roma are of school age , and the population is growing faster than the capacity of the REF . 
The Fund &apos;s annual budget is only â‚¬ 12 million ( $ 16.3 million ) , of which my foundations cover nearly half , and we find it difficult to secure additional funds . 
That is unacceptable . 
The programs developed by the REF ought to be scaled up by governments , with the help of the EU , and made available to all Roma children in Europe . 
The European Commission has played a very helpful role through its structural funds , which cover up to 80 % of the additional costs involved in integrating the Roma . 
Unfortunately , the remaining 20 % is difficult to mobilize , owing to widespread anti-Roma sentiment throughout Europe . 
To break the negative stereotypes , Roma children must be educated to celebrate and take pride in their Roma heritage . 
That is what the REF has done . 
As it is , educated Roma do not fit the stereotypes , so they can easily blend into the majority population , but the majority &apos;s hostility remains . 
If the approach developed by the REF were generally adopted , it would go a long way toward breaking the stereotypes . 
But education is not enough . 
The Roma must also be able to find employment . 
A lasting solution requires Europe to build a Roma working class . 
Here the private sector also has a role to play . 
Experts from the European Commission and from my foundations are developing a demonstration project to make private-sector internships available to Roma youth enrolled in vocational schools . 
Romania already has a similar program for the majority population , and Minister of Education Remus Pricopie has pledged to open it up to the Roma . 
Let &apos;s be honest : There is a Roma problem in Europe , and it is getting worse . 
But both the problem and its worsening reflect a toxic combination of deep-seated hostility and persistent neglect . 
But solving it will take more than a generation , and Europe cannot afford to wait for economic recovery . 
On the contrary , given the increase in its Roma population , Europe &apos;s long-term prosperity depends on reversing current trends - and getting started right away .
