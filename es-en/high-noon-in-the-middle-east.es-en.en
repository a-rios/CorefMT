High Noon in the Middle East 
Jerusalem - As a result of misguided American policy , the threat of another military confrontation hangs like a dark cloud over the Middle East . 
The United States &quot; enemies have been strengthened , and Iran - despite being branded as a member of the so-called &quot; axis of evil &quot; - has been catapulted into regional hegemony . 
Iran could never have achieved this on its own , certainly not in such a short time . 
A hitherto latent rivalry between Iran and Israel thus has been transformed into an open struggle for dominance in the Middle East . 
The result has been the emergence of some surprising , if not bizarre , alliances : Iran , Syria , Hezbollah , Hamas , and the American-backed , Shia-dominated Iraq are facing Israel , Saudi Arabia , and most of the other Sunni Arab states , all of which feel existentially threatened by Iran &apos;s ascendance . 
The danger of a major confrontation has been heightened further by a series of factors : persistent high oil prices , which have created new financial and political opportunities for Iran ; the defeat of the West and its regional allies in proxy wars in Gaza and Lebanon ; and the United Nations Security Council &apos;s failure to induce Iran to accept even a temporary freeze of its nuclear program . 
Iran &apos;s nuclear program is the decisive factor in this equation , for it threatens irreversibly the region &apos;s strategic balance . 
That Iran - a country whose president never tires of calling for Israel &apos;s annihilation and that threatens Israel &apos;s northern and southern borders through its massive support of proxy wars waged by Hezbollah and Hamas - might one day have missiles with nuclear warheads is Israel &apos;s worst security nightmare . 
Politics is not just about facts , but also about perceptions . 
Whether or not a perception is accurate is beside the point , because it nonetheless leads to decisions . 
This applies in particular when the perception concerns what the parties consider to be threats to their very existence . 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s threats of annihilation are taken seriously in Israel because of the trauma of the Holocaust . 
And most Arab governments share the fear of a nuclear Iran . 
Earlier this month , Israel celebrated its 60th birthday , and President George W. Bush went to Jerusalem to play a leading part in the commemoration . 
But those who had expected that his visit would mainly be about the stalled negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians were bitterly disappointed . 
Bush &apos;s central topic , including his speech to Israel &apos;s parliament , was Iran . 
Bush had promised to bring the Middle East conflict closer to a resolution before the end of his term this year . 
But his final visit to Israel seems to indicate that his objective is different : he seems to be planning , together with Israel , to end the Iranian nuclear program - and to do so by military , rather than diplomatic , means . 
Anyone following the press in Israel during the anniversary celebrations and listening closely to what was said in Jerusalem did not have to be a prophet to understand that matters are coming to a head . 
Consider the following : 
· &quot; Stop the appeasement ! &quot; is a demand raised across the political spectrum in Israel - and what is meant is the nuclear threat emanating from Iran . 
· While Israel celebrated , Defense Minister Ehud Barak was quoted as saying that a life-and-death military confrontation was a distinct possibility . 
· The outgoing commander of the Israeli air force declared that the air force was capable of any mission , no matter how difficult , to protect the country &apos;s security . 
The destruction of a Syrian nuclear facility last year , and the lack of any international reaction to it , are viewed as an example for the coming action against Iran . 
· The Israeli wish list for US arms deliveries , discussed with the American president , focused mainly on the improvement of the attack capabilities and precision of the Israeli air force . 
· Diplomatic initiatives and UN sanctions are seen as hopelessly ineffective . 
· With the approaching end of the Bush presidency and uncertainty about his successor &apos;s policy , the window of opportunity for Israeli action is seen as potentially closing . 
The last two factors carry special weight . 
While Israeli military intelligence is on record that Iran is expected to cross the red line on the path to nuclear power between 2010 and 2015 at the earliest , the feeling in Israel is that the political window of opportunity is now , during the last months of Bush &apos;s presidency . 
Although it is acknowledged in Jerusalem that an attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities would involve grave and hard-to-assess risks , the choice between acceptance of an Iranian bomb and an attempt at its military destruction , with all the attendant consequences , is clear . 
Israel won &apos;t stand by and wait for matters to take their course . 
The Middle East is drifting towards a new great confrontation in 2008 . 
Iran must understand that without a diplomatic solution in the coming months , a dangerous military conflict is very likely to erupt . 
It is high time for serious negotiations to begin . 
The most recent offer by the six powers - the UN Security Council &apos;s five permanent members plus Germany - is on the table , and it goes very far to accommodate Iran &apos;s interests . 
The decisive question , however , will be whether it will be possible to freeze the Iranian nuclear program for the duration of the negotiations to avoid a military confrontation before they are completed . 
Should this newest attempt fail , things will soon get serious . 
Deadly serious .
