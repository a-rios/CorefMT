Science under Siege 
Three centuries after the Enlightenment first linked human freedom with the progress of science and technology , both are under growing attack - despite their spectacular triumphs . 
Fundamental discoveries about nature expanded our creative power over the structure and transformations of the inanimate and living world . 
Breakthroughs in physics and chemistry enabled the extraordinary development of electronics and materials that dramatically shortened time and distance , ushering in an information age of fast , secure communication and transport . 
Advances in biological sciences and technologies , meanwhile , are increasing our ability to control disease and aging , boost food production , and manage pollution . 
In short , scientific research - and its implementation through new technologies - made possible new freedoms , new ways of life , and new means of practical human action . 
But more and more we hear that our ability and willingness to manipulate natural processes is itself unnatural  - an indictment that reflects our ambivalent relationship with nature . 
We are , as the French writer Jean Bruller-Vercors put it , animaux dénaturés , or &quot; denatured animals , &quot; living in nature but simultaneously able to observe , investigate , and question it from a distance , conscious of our separateness . 
This ambivalence gives rise to a diffuse anxiety : there are certain things that should not be touched , basic mysteries in nature that we tamper with at the risk of unleashing uncontrollable forces . 
The birth of electricity and automotive power was accompanied by this apprehension , and it has grown stronger the further science has penetrated the natural world , unlocking the secrets of the atom and of our own genetic makeup . 
Indeed , fear of our own awesome power explains the appeal of environmentalism , with its vision - particularly in its fundamentalist , quasi-religious variant , so-called &quot; deep ecology &quot;  - of an intrinsically &quot; pure &quot; Nature whose harmony is supposedly disrupted by man . 
But nature is entirely indifferent to man ; it has no moral standing and it contains no moral code . 
Nature just is . 
My own field , chemistry , plays a primordial role in our ability to act upon natural phenomena , to modify them , and to invent new expressions of them . 
A natural substance , however , has no reason to be less toxic than a synthetic one . 
In fact , synthetic compounds may be safer than natural ones . 
For example , genetic engineering has eliminated the prion which causes Creutzfeld-Jakob disease , from naturally occurring human growth hormone , and has enabled blood transfusion without risk of HIV infection . 
Let us be clear : science is the result of evolution , which has led to a being - man - that has progressively become able to take charge of itself and its surroundings . 
We humans will inevitably end up controlling our own evolution , and , because our power is emergent from nature we will make use of this acquired capacity sooner or later , for better or worse . 
Man modifying man ( and man &apos;s environment ) is contained in man . 
What of the &quot; sanctity &quot; of life ? 
We humans embrace the axiom that life is sacred in order to preserve what allowed that axiom to be formulated in the first place : consciousness and thought . 
No natural law commands that life respect itself - and , indeed , it does not ; living species feed on each other . 
The basic value that life is sacred rests only on our ability to transcend and question our own making , even if this foundation is necessarily a product of life . 
It is thus our fate to continue the quest for knowledge . 
It is also our obligation . 
We do not have the right to decide that we have reached a sufficient level of scientific progress , because we cannot consult future generations - and we are fortunate that our predecessors could not consult us . 
Science and technology , after all , are not responsible for the careless and wasteful behavior that environmentalists rightly condemn . 
On the contrary , the scientific spirit offers our only hope of developing new processes and products that minimize the risks attendant on human progress , while technology transfers promise to minimize poor countries &apos; reliance on natural resource-intensive industries . 
Providing a &quot; development shortcut &quot; that leads directly to photovoltaic or nuclear electricity generators , not coal-fired power stations , high-performance materials , not steel mills , and cellular telephone networks , not expensive fixed-line systems , would clearly benefit us all . 
Zero risk does not exist . 
Risk appears with life . 
Zero risk is a dead world . 
So risk is inherent in every decision we make . 
Attempting to eliminate risk by ruling certain areas of research off limits would stifle human freedom as well . 
We must distinguish between the dangerous and the merely disagreeable . 
A glass that is half-full to some people , is half-empty to others ; but from the half-full half , you can drink , whereas with the empty half you cannot do much ( except try to fill it ) ! 
Unfortunately , it is not always possible to assess risks accurately , and science alone cannot provide all the answers . 
Decisions concerning the uses of scientific discoveries are typically based on criteria that have nothing in common with science . 
A factory may function without emitting disagreeable fumes that are not dangerous , but only if we are prepared to pay for it . 
Of course , technological choices entail more than economic criteria . 
Installing a solar-powered water pump in a developing country may destroy a traditional social structure based on control of the water supply . 
Similarly , sexual cohabitation before fertilization may , according to recent research , generate an immunological response in women that markedly decreases health risks linked to pregnancy , such as hypertension and convulsive eclampsia . 
Such findings - like the development of safe , effective contraceptive methods - clearly threaten long-held religious proscriptions . 
The scientist &apos;s first responsibility is to the pursuit of new knowledge , not to any narrow vision of society . 
Ethics and rules of justice change and have to adapt , as they have since the Enlightenment &apos;s ideals began breaking down the barriers of superstition , obscurantism , and demagogy that limited the realm of human freedom . 
History cannot be rewritten , and we must resist the irrational urge - whether it originates from the abyss of our ignorance or from the specter of our crises - to stop it in its tracks . 
We must walk the path to the tree of knowledge if we are to control our destiny .
