Europe and Anti-Europe 
BERLIN - Since 2008 , when the global financial crisis erupted , the European Union has been confronted by a succession of crises : the escalating Greek crisis ; 
These crises have stretched the EU &apos;s powers and institutions up to - and beyond - their limits , which is why Europe &apos;s response has been so mortifyingly weak . 
The ineffectiveness of existing institutions and structures in the face of today &apos;s threats is now jeopardizing the EU &apos;s legitimacy , because Europe &apos;s citizens are calling for solutions that the EU obviously is unable and partly unwilling to provide . 
One consequence is erosion of support for the EU among its member states &quot; electorates . 
And the pace of erosion could accelerate in the next two years . 
The United Kingdom now seems certain to hold , by 2016 , a referendum on remaining in the EU , and a far-left party - determined , as in Greece , to escape the rigors of economic reform - could win Spain &apos;s general election next autumn . 
Certainly , events could turn out positively , with the UK remaining part of the EU , and Spain opting for the status quo or a more moderate vision of change than Greece &apos;s Syriza-led government has embraced . 
Should such a perfect storm occur , the EU &apos;s very existence would be in doubt , because other member countries would consider or begin planning their own post-EU futures . 
Indeed , all of the Euroskeptic and nationalist forces in the EU &apos;s member states would strive , with increasing success , to make their respective countries &quot; withdrawal from the EU the central issue in domestic political debate and election campaigns . 
In other words , nearly 60 years of European integration - the entire European project - could be undone . 
Europe need not go down this path ; but , given EU leaders current failure to acknowledge and rise to the challenges they confront , it seems realistic to assume that it could happen . 
The combination of Grexit and Brexit , and its consequences not just for the stability of the eurozone , but for the continued existence of the EU , is probably the greatest danger that Europe has faced since the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Moreover , Europe &apos;s internal crisis is playing out in a dangerous , unstable geopolitical environment . 
Though external threats may bolster strategic cooperation among the EU member states , this may not be enough to keep the Union intact , particularly given Russia &apos;s effort to divide Europe by strengthening its nationalist , Euroskeptic , and xenophobic forces . 
Preventing the EU from falling apart will require , first and foremost , a strategic solution to the Greek crisis . 
Greece needs both money and reforms - rapidly and within the eurozone and the EU . 
The governments in Athens , Brussels , and even Berlin cannot live with Greece as a failed state and economy . 
The continuing poker game between the Greek government and the troika ( the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) hurts all parties involved - and Europe most of all . 
It can ultimately end only with a renewed bailout of Greece or with Europe &apos;s plunge into disaster . 
If Grexit is to be averted ( which should be the EU &apos;s highest priority ) , the challenge posed by Brexit would already look significantly less daunting , given that here the risks are spread much more evenly between the Union and the UK . 
In fact , the risks are greater for British Prime Minister David Cameron , because it is almost certain that Scotland will not accept a Brexit , placing the UK &apos;s own future in jeopardy . 
So , despite Cameron being in a largely self-dug hole , the EU should show some flexibility in its negotiations with Britain over questions that do not concern the Union &apos;s basic principles . 
The UK could be offered additional opt-outs from EU policies ( such as it now enjoys from the euro ) . 
If , in addition to dealing effectively with the risks of Grexit and Brexit , the EU can strengthen its unity and determination in addressing the Ukraine crisis and confronting today &apos;s revisionist Russia , it will have succeeded in fending off today &apos;s existential threats . 
Indeed , it could even emerge from its coming tests stronger than before . 
That is not the likeliest scenario today , but it could become so if Europe decides - sooner rather than later - that the consequences of failure must be avoided at nearly any cost .
