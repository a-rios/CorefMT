Western Politics &quot; Locust Years 
NEW YORK - Since my teenage years , I have been fascinated by the permutations and machinations of national politics . 
Today , I find myself focusing on broader political trends that also help to explain global economic issues . 
One such trend is the political fragmentation and polarization evident in Western democracies . 
Fringe movements , some operating within established political structures , and others seeking to create new ones , are placing pressure on traditional parties , making it difficult for them to mobilize their supporters , and , in some cases , causing them real damage . 
Desperate not to appear weak , long-established parties have become wary of cooperating across the aisle . 
The resulting refusal to work together on the major issues of the day has had a dramatic impact on economic policies . 
Once formulated through negotiations conducted at the political center , where Western democracies have long been anchored , policymaking is increasingly shaped by stubborn forces on the extreme left and right . 
This approach has , it must be said , yielded the occasional breakthrough - sometimes good , sometimes bad . 
But the overall result has been policy paralysis , with even the most basic elements of economic governance ( such as actively passing a budget in the United States ) suffering as a result . 
Needless to say , the greater the governance and policy challenges at home , the more difficult regional and global cooperation becomes . 
The Tea Party in the US is a case in point . 
After its success on the national stage in the 2010 midterm congressional election , many Republican lawmakers became so concerned about securing their party &apos;s &quot; base &quot; for future re-election bids that they no longer felt comfortable pursuing the type of bipartisan cooperation that underpin effective economic policymaking . 
But the Tea Party &apos;s impact did not end there . 
By contributing to a shutdown of federal-government operations and repeatedly raising the threat of a technical default , it risked undermining an already-fragile US economic recovery . 
While the movement has evolved and no longer threatens to hold the economy hostage , it continues to contribute to overall policy paralysis . 
Europe now seems to be headed down a similar path , as non-traditional parties - many of them driven by single issues - become increasingly influential . 
Movements like France &apos;s anti-immigration National Front are making leading mainstream parties more likely to pander to extremists in order to preserve their support . 
Of course , their fear is not irrational , as Pasok , a long-established left-wing party in Greece , found out when the far-left , anti-austerity Syriza Party surged to victory in January . 
But that does not change the fact that parties &quot; need to address their electoral fears is causing serious damage to national policymaking . 
Indeed , most established parties are so busy playing defense that they have little inclination to engage in the type of forward-looking strategic thinking that is needed to re-energize exhausted growth models , anchor financial stability , and ensure that technological innovation enables broad-based prosperity . 
As a result , Western economies are running chronically below their potential - and risk undermining their future potential . 
That is why future generations will likely remember this as a time of lost economic opportunities . 
Instead of bowing to polarization and paralysis , policymakers should be promoting growth- and productivity-enhancing infrastructure investments , funded at exceptionally low interest rates , scaling up labor-market reforms , and working to address the growing income and wealth inequality that is increasingly limiting access to economic opportunity . 
Likewise , policymakers should be revamping incoherent and inconsistent tax structures that are riddled with unfair exemptions . 
And they should be pursuing immigration reform to overhaul a system that penalizes talent , encourages malfeasance , and , as illustrated by the thousands of migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea in recent years while trying to reach Europe , often leads to human tragedy . 
Despite widespread dissatisfaction with political institutions in many Western countries - the US Congress , for example , has very low approval ratings - it is difficult to see what will break the current logjam . 
Within established parties , forces promoting rejuvenation are weak and uneven . 
Add to that an increasingly polarized and quasi-tribal news media , which can amplify divisions in society , and the scope for collaborative transformation is extremely limited . 
For their part , many of the fringe parties , despite their rising popularity , are struggling to achieve power , a challenge illustrated in the recent British election . 
And those that succeed , such as Syriza , quickly become frustrated by the largely immovable systems in which they must operate - a situation that their lack of governing experience makes all the more difficult . 
Over time , Western political systems will evolve to meet the needs of their economies . 
But , in the interim , the vast majority of companies and households will have to cope with systems that do relatively less to help them reach their potential , placing them at a disadvantage vis-Ã -vis competitors operating in more supportive systems . 
To some extent , technological innovation will pick up the slack , as it empowers individuals and companies to live more self-directed lives , creating pockets of excellence and wellbeing . 
But , while this is good news for some , it is inadequate to arrest the rising inequality of income , wealth , and opportunity - or to unleash the inclusive prosperity that Western economies can and should be generating .
