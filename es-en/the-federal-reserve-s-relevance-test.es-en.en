The Federal Reserve &apos;s Relevance Test 
NEW YORK - With interest rates near zero , the US Federal Reserve and other central banks are struggling to remain relevant . 
The last arrow in their quiver is called quantitative easing ( QE ) , and it is likely to be almost as ineffective in reviving the US economy as anything else the Fed has tried in recent years . 
Worse , QE is likely to cost taxpayers a bundle , while impairing the Fed &apos;s effectiveness for years to come . 
John Maynard Keynes argued that monetary policy was ineffective during the Great Depression . 
Central banks are better at restraining markets &quot; irrational exuberance in a bubble - restricting the availability of credit or raising interest rates to rein in the economy - than at promoting investment in a recession . 
That is why good monetary policy aims to prevent bubbles from arising . 
But the Fed , captured for more than two decades by market fundamentalists and Wall Street interests , not only failed to impose restraints , but acted as cheerleaders . 
In 2001 , lowering interest rates seemed to work , but not the way it was supposed to . 
Rather than spurring investment in plant and equipment , low interest rates inflated a real-estate bubble . 
The best that can be said for monetary policy over the last few years is that it prevented the direst outcomes that could have followed Lehman Brothers &quot; collapse . 
Indeed , business lending - particularly to small businesses - in both the US and Europe remains markedly below pre-crisis levels . 
The Fed and the European Central Bank have done nothing about this . 
They still seem enamored of the standard monetary-policy models , in which all central banks have to do to get the economy going is reduce interest rates . 
The standard models failed to predict the crisis , but bad ideas die a slow death . 
So , while bringing down short-term T-bill rates to near zero has failed , the hope is that bringing down longer-term interest rates will spur the economy . 
The chances of success are near zero . 
Large firms are awash with cash , and lowering interest rates slightly won &apos;t make much difference to them . 
More relevant is the availability of loans . 
With so many banks in the US fragile , lending is likely to remain constrained . 
Moreover , most small-business loans are collateral-based , but the value of the most common form of collateral , real estate , has plummeted . 
The Obama administration &apos;s efforts to deal with the real-estate market have been a dismal failure , perhaps succeeding only in postponing further declines . 
In short , QE - lowering long-term interest rates by buying long-term bonds and mortgages - won &apos;t do much to stimulate business directly . 
It may help , though , in two ways . 
One way is as part of America &apos;s strategy of competitive devaluation . 
Officially , America still talks about the virtues of a strong dollar , but lowering interest rates weakens the exchange rate . 
Whether one views this as currency manipulation or as an accidental by-product of lower interest rates is irrelevant . 
The fact is that a weaker dollar resulting from lower interest rates gives the US a slight competitive advantage in trade . 
Meanwhile , as investors look outside the US for higher yield , the flood of money out of the dollar has bid up exchange rates in emerging markets around the world . 
Emerging markets know this , and are upset - Brazil has vehemently expressed its concerns - not only about the increased value of their currency , but that the influx of money risks fueling asset bubbles or triggering inflation . 
The normal response of emerging-market central banks to bubbles or inflation would be to raise interest rates - thereby increasing their currencies &quot; value still more . 
US policy is thus delivering a double whammy on competitive devaluation - weakening the dollar and forcing competitors to strengthen their currencies ( though some are taking countermeasures , erecting barriers to short-term inflows and intervening more directly in foreign-exchange markets ) . 
The second way that QE might have a slight effect is by lowering mortgage rates , which would help to sustain real-estate prices . 
So QE would produce some - probably weak - balance-sheet effects . 
But potentially significant costs offset these small benefits . 
The Fed has bought more than $ 1 trillion of mortgages , the value of which will fall when the economy recovers - which is precisely why no one in the private sector wants to buy them . 
The government may pretend that it has not experienced a capital loss , because , unlike banks , it is not required to use mark-to-market accounting . 
But no one should be fooled , even if the Fed holds the bonds to maturity . 
It is good that the Fed is trying to make amends for its dismal pre-crisis performance . 
Regrettably , it is far from clear that it has changed its thinking and models , which failed to maintain the economy on an even keel before - and are certain to fail again . 
The Fed &apos;s previous mistakes proved extraordinarily costly . 
So will the new mistakes , even if the Fed strives to hide the price tag .
