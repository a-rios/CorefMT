The Power of China &apos;s Powerless 
LONDON - No sooner had I finished reading an article that eulogized VÃ¡clav Havel , the playwright turned dissident turned peaceful revolutionary turned president who had just died , than two subsequent news stories set Havel &apos;s extraordinary career in context : the death of Kim Jong-il , North Korea &apos;s pornography-addicted and nuclear-armed supreme leader , and the peaceful protests against land expropriation by the villagers of Wukan in Guandong province , southern China . 
If Havel ever had any moments of doubt about his lasting positive impact on the world , I hope he was able to see reports from Wukan before he died . 
In that fishing village of 6,000 , the &quot; power of the powerless &quot; that Havel promoted as a means to undermine totalitarian rule was demonstrated anew , and with such enormous dignity and discipline that it has galvanized China like no protest since those in Tiananmen Square in the spring of 1989 . 
Kim , in a sense , was the anti-Havel , lacking not only moral scruples , but even the usual dictatorial concern for how a country is managed . 
His death made me recall that of Mao Zedong , with all the mass hysteria - real and feigned - that accompanies the demise of a self-anointed god . 
But Mao &apos;s death did at least end the era of caesarism in China . 
Because he had no son to succeed him , Mao appointed a five-person politburo to do the job . 
Its members , which included his nephew , Mao Yuanxin , his mistress , Zhang Yufeng , and Jiang Qing , his last wife - were as incompetent at governing as Kim , but , following the disaster of the Cultural Revolution , antagonism to them in the military and other state institutions was too widespread for them to last . 
They , and the Gang of Four ( of which Jiang Qing was a member ) , were soon ousted . 
China &apos;s transit from caesarism to despotism , and then from Marxism to capitalism , has been fortunate for China &apos;s citizens . 
North Korea &apos;s bad luck is that , despite his incompetence , Kim Jong-il seems to have managed to bequeath the dynasty he inherited to his youngest son , Kim Jong-un . 
Given other North Korean institutions &quot; apparent indifference to the mess that the Kims have made of their country , there seems scant chance of any serious change of course being initiated from within . 
A fight for power , however , might yet spell the end of the regime . 
North Korea is a kind of looking-glass world to Havel &apos;s dictum that , to survive under totalitarianism , one must live in truth . 
Fortunately for Havel , Czechoslovakia &apos;s small-minded communist rulers were also small-minded in their lies . 
But when every aspect of society is built , as in North Korea , on a Big Lie , and then an Even Bigger Lie , it is probably hard to maintain one &apos;s sanity , let alone the ability to live in truth . 
In any case , Kim Jong-un &apos;s reign is unlikely to last or be as certifiably crazed as those of his father and grandfather . 
Communism , thanks to the lure of successful market economies and the example set by people like Havel , has put the system under such external strain that Kim III has nowhere to turn for effective help . 
Indeed , even the two regimes most eager to maintain the Kim dynasty - China &apos;s and Russia &apos;s - are feeling pressure from their disaffected but , it now seems , not-so-powerless populations . 
In Wukan , simple villagers were unafraid to challenge the might of the local party and police when officials stole their land for a development project . 
In Henan , policemen have gone into the streets demanding that human rights be protected . 
In Dalian , hundreds of thousands of people protested against the construction of petrochemical plant.Unlike what has happened so far in Wukan , the Dalian protest was crushed , but it - like the tens of thousands of other protests across China last year - signaled to the ruling party that ordinary Chinese are no longer interested only in the politically passive pursuit of material gain . 
In Russia , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin &apos;s situation is much the same . 
Following the sham elections in early December , massive protests erupted in Moscow and Saint Petersburg . 
And those marching were not the usual impoverished rabble-rousers , but Russia &apos;s new middle classes . 
Like the villagers of Wukan , they have simply had enough of official dishonesty . 
North Koreans have suffered coercion for a long time , and although they are brainwashed to be docile and loyal to Kim &apos;s dynasty , you just cannot imagine how they will remain at the beck and call of Kim Jong-un , who has no credentials , military or otherwise , to rule . 
Given its increasingly isolated international position in Asia , if North Korea &apos;s internal conflicts become acute , China may find it difficult to behave toward Kim Jong-un with anything but cold and anxiety-ridden indifference . 
And recall that it was indifference to the non-reforming East European communist regimes on the part of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union that ultimately sealed their fate and delivered Havel from a prison cell to Prague Castle . 
Havel , of course , was a beneficiary of such indifference , but he never practiced it , remaining a fighter for truth and freedom throughout his life . 
For Chinese concerned about how to live in truth , Havel remains our exemplar . 
The Charter 77 movement that he founded provided the template for men like the imprisoned Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo , who helped to found Charter 08 , which proclaimed that Chinese , too , could live in dignity and freedom . 
Kim Jong-il &apos;s demise reminds us that all people are equal before death . 
Havel &apos;s passing reminds us that the value of life will eventually gain respect .
