China &apos;s Borderline Belligerence 
NEW DELHI - In recent years , the People &apos;s Liberation Army has been taking advantage of its rising political clout to provoke localized skirmishes and standoffs with India by breaching the two countries &quot; long and disputed Himalayan frontier . 
The PLA &apos;s recent intensification of such border violations holds important implications for President Xi Jinping &apos;s upcoming visit to India - and for the future of the bilateral relationship . 
In fact , such provocations have often preceded visits to India by Chinese leaders . 
Indeed , it was just before President Hu Jintao &apos;s 2006 visit that China resurrected its claim to India &apos;s large northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh . 
Likewise , prior to Premier Wen Jiabao &apos;s trip to India in 2010 , China began issuing visas on loose sheets of paper stapled into the passports of Kashmir residents applying to enter China - an indirect challenge to India &apos;s sovereignty . 
Moreover , China abruptly shortened the length of its border with India by rescinding its recognition of the 1,597-kilometer ( 992-mile ) line separating Indian Kashmir from Chinese-held Kashmir . 
Now , China is at it again , including near the convergence point of China , India , and Pakistan - the same place last year &apos;s PLA encroachment triggered a three-week military standoff . 
This pattern suggests that the central objective of Chinese leaders &quot; visits to India is not to advance cooperation on a shared agenda , but to reinforce China &apos;s own interests , beginning with its territorial claims . 
Even China &apos;s highly lucrative and fast-growing trade with India has not curbed its rising territorial assertiveness . 
By contrast , Indian prime ministers since Jawaharlal Nehru have traveled to China to express goodwill and deliver strategic gifts . 
Unsurprisingly , India has often ended up losing out in bilateral deals . 
Particularly egregious was Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee &apos;s 2003 surrender of India &apos;s Tibet card . 
Vajpayee went so far as to use , for the first time , the legal term &quot; recognize &quot; to accept what China calls the Tibet Autonomous Region ( TAR ) as &quot; part of the territory of the People &apos;s Republic of China . &quot; 
That opened the way for China to claim Arunachal Pradesh ( three times the size of Taiwan ) as &quot; South Tibet &quot; and reinforced China &apos;s view of territorial issues : Whatever area it occupies is Chinese territory , and whatever territorial claims it makes must be settled on the basis of &quot; mutual accommodation and understanding . &quot; 
Vajpayee &apos;s blunder compounded Nehru &apos;s 1954 mistake in implicitly accepting , in the Panchsheel Treaty , China &apos;s annexation of Tibet , without securing ( or even seeking ) recognition of the then-existing Indo-Tibetan border . 
In fact , under the treaty , India forfeited all of the extraterritorial rights and privileges in Tibet that it had inherited from imperial Britain . 
As agreed in the pact , India withdrew its &quot; military escorts &quot; from Tibet , and conceded to the Chinese government , at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price , the postal , telegraph , and public telephone services operated by the Indian government in the &quot; Tibet region of China . &quot; 
For its part , China repeatedly violated the eight-year pact , ultimately mounting the trans-Himalayan invasion of 1962 . 
In short , China used the Panchsheel Treaty to outwit and humiliate India . 
Ansari was accompanied by Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman , who , during her stay , signed an agreement allowing China - without any quid pro quo - to establish industrial parks in India . 
The fact that the spotlight is now on China &apos;s Tibet-linked claim to Arunachal Pradesh , rather than on Tibet &apos;s status , underscores China &apos;s dominance in setting the bilateral agenda . 
Given India &apos;s dependence on cross-border water flows from Tibet , it could end up paying a heavy price . 
Embarrassed by China &apos;s relentless border violations - according to Indian Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju , there were 334 in the first 216 days of this year - India has recently drawn a specious distinction between &quot; transgressions &quot; and &quot; intrusions &quot; that enables it to list all of the breaches simply as transgressions . 
But word play will get India nowhere . 
The BRICS &quot; New Development Bank , it was announced , will be headquartered in Shanghai , not New Delhi ; 
Under pressure from an unyielding and revanchist China , India urgently needs to craft a prudent and carefully calibrated counter-strategy . 
For starters , India could rescind its recognition of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet , while applying economic pressure through trade , as China has done to Japan and the Philippines when they have challenged its territorial claims . 
By hinging China &apos;s market access on progress in resolving political , territorial , and water disputes , India can prevent China from fortifying its leverage . 
Moreover , India must be willing to respond to Chinese incursions by sending troops into strategic Chinese-held territory . 
This would raise the stakes for Chinese border violations , thereby boosting deterrence . 
Finally , India must consider carefully the pretense of partnership with China that it is forming through trade and BRICS agreements - at least until a more balanced bilateral relationship emerges . 
After all , neither booming trade nor membership in the BRICS club offers protection from bullying .
