Ireland Decides , Again 
Maynooth , Ireland - On October 2 , Irish voters go to the polls for a second time to decide whether to adopt the European Union &apos;s Lisbon Treaty . 
The mood in EU capitals is one of nervousness as polling day looms , with the future of the EU in the hands of Ireland &apos;s unpredictable voters . 
On two of the last three occasions that the Irish have been asked to vote on an EU Treaty , they have rejected the proposal . 
For the EU , the stakes could not be higher . 
The Lisbon Treaty was the compromise agreed by EU leaders in the aftermath of the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in popular referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005 . 
Much negotiating blood has been spilled on the Treaty , and its rejection a second time by Irish voters would leave the Union unable to ratify and implement its provisions ; this would inevitably lead to policy paralysis and institutional decay . 
The referendum campaign in Ireland has seen a resurgence of conflict between a familiar constellation of forces . 
On the Yes side are all of the main political parties , trade unions , the business community , and a broad network of civil-society groups . 
Their campaign has been more coordinated and intense than last time , with the aim of mobilizing the maximum number of supporters and ensuring a high turnout , which most commentators assume will assist the Yes side . 
On the No side : a disparate coalition drawn from both the far right and the far left , including ultra-Catholics and unreconstructed Marxists , has sought to whip up hysteria about supposed threats ranging from military conscription to euthanasia and abortion . 
The main reason for this is that Ireland has been traumatized by economic misfortune over the past year . 
The hubris of the Celtic Tiger years is a distant memory , owing to the worst recession in Ireland &apos;s history as an independent state . 
In 2009 , economists expect growth to contract by up to 8 % , with a further steep decline likely next year . 
The budget deficit is now the largest in the EU , and public debt has ballooned , as the government has struggled to compensate for the steep drop in revenues . 
The Irish banking system approached total collapse in September 2008 , and was only saved by a € 400 billion government guarantee of all bank deposits . 
More recently , the state assumed the liabilities of rogue property developers by setting up a &quot; bad bank &quot; which could potentially saddle Irish taxpayers with a mountain of debt for decades to come . 
The depth of the economy &apos;s plunge has helped the Irish government in its effort to secure a Yes vote . 
The European Central Bank has provided a monetary lifeline that has provided much needed liquidity within the financial system and helped the government to stem the crisis of confidence created by the banking collapse . 
Government ministers and EU representatives repeatedly cite the example of Iceland in pointing out what might have happened to Ireland if it had been outside the EU . 
Thus , the second referendum campaign has brought back into play the economic dimension of Ireland &apos;s EU membership , which was largely absent from the 2008 debate on the Treaty . 
Ireland has benefited disproportionately from EU largesse during its 35 years of membership , and , in 2008 , was still receiving a net sum of € 500 million from the EU budget . 
When voters are reminded of the potentially catastrophic cost of being excluded , not just from the Single Market area , but from the decision-making structures in the Council of Ministers and the European Central Bank , what is at stake in the referendum becomes clear . 
In addition , the Irish government secured legal guarantees from its EU partners on the issues that most concerned voters who voted No or abstained in the first referendum . 
These compromises state that nothing in the treaties will affect Irish prerogatives on abortion , military neutrality , and taxation . 
The government also secured EU-wide agreement that , rather than reducing the size of the European Commission , Ireland will be allowed to retain a permanent place at the Commission table . 
This negotiating success has provided the government with considerable breathing space in which to conduct a more effective referendum campaign . 
This combination of legal guarantees and changed economic circumstances is helping to mobilize a majority in favor of the Treaty . 
Opinion polls conducted in recent weeks indicate that the Yes side commands a strong majority of 62 % to 23 % , with 15 % of the electorate undecided . 
But the picture is far from clear-cut . 
Surveys indicate that the Irish are strong supporters of EU membership and the integration process . 
The problem is that these favorable attitudes vary considerably in intensity and constitute a &quot; soft bloc &quot; of support for the EU ; in the 2008 referendum , this soft bloc crumbled in the final week of the campaign . 
It seems clear that a second rejection of the Lisbon Treaty by the Irish electorate would plunge the EU into a renewed crisis and threaten to derail the considerable gains in both democratic legitimacy and collective decision-making capacity deriving from the new Treaty . Everything indicates that voters now look set to approve the Treaty . 
But nobody should take Irish voters for granted in the final days of the campaign .
