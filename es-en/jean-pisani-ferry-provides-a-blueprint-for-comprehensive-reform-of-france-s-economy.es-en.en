A French Cure 
PARIS - France is widely regarded around the world as a country that has failed to embrace globalization or to modernize its economic and social model . 
Its own citizens have been more pessimistic about its future than ever in recent decades . 
The question is , can the French map out a way forward , dispel the prevailing gloom , and rebuild prosperity ? 
The starting point must be a lucid diagnosis . 
In comparison to countries that enjoyed a similar level of development 25 years ago , France has underperformed economically . 
The gap is not wide - six percentage points of per capita GDP - but the trend is worrying enough to call for a correction . 
Unemployment , moreover , has remained at shamefully high levels . 
And , whereas France ranks higher for some social indicators related to health care , income inequality , and poverty prevention , the price for this performance has been a steady rise in public spending and debt . 
The reason for this state of affairs is not that France &apos;s economy lacks potential . 
It has weaknesses for sure - a relatively thin layer of medium-size companies , adversarial labor relations , and public-sector inefficiencies , to name some key shortcomings . 
But France can also build on remarkable assets : on average , its working-age population is much better educated than it was a quarter-century ago ; it is younger than most neighboring countries ; it is home to more global corporate champions than Germany or the United Kingdom ; and its infrastructure is outstanding . 
The causes of France &apos;s malaise lie elsewhere . 
For starters , it is much too uncertain about fundamental choices . 
French society is ambivalent about its own identity , the way ahead for its social model , its attitude toward globalization , its stance on Europe - and , increasingly , even about economic growth itself . 
Of course , all democratic societies feature spirited debate about collective preferences . 
But a key feature of the French is that they do not trust their own political institutions and leaders . 
Legitimate and accountable institutions and policymakers are what hold divided societies together and help them overcome dilemmas . 
France now lacks this glue . 
A second reason for France &apos;s underperformance is the way that it reforms itself . 
Each government does its bit of tinkering with regulations but generally falls short of a more ambitious overhaul of the aims and instruments of a given policy , merely paving the way for another reform five or ten years later . 
As a result , French citizens view each reform as partial , temporary , and possibly reversible . 
Half a reform , however , does not deliver half of the results . 
It often delivers much less , because it fails to provide clear and stable incentives for new behavior . 
The rules of the game that are supposed to provide guidance to individuals and firms lack clarity and stability . 
France needs to become much clearer about some key choices , and to act consistently . 
To begin with , the country needs to build a more agile , more open economy . 
It cannot rely on the same growth model that served it well in the past , but that has since lost effectiveness . 
French corporate champions like Safran and L &apos;Or√©al are an asset , but they cannot serve as a growth and export platform anymore . 
Rather , France must tap the innovation and growth potential of young firms . 
In order to unlock this potential , these firms should reach out to customers and suppliers worldwide . 
France should thus discard mercantilism and set itself the goal of both exporting more and importing more , so that its economy responds better to global trends . 
It also needs to broaden the scope for international trade - for example , by opening up higher education to internationalization . 
Moreover , French society remains too hierarchical and too segmented . 
The economic , political , and cultural elite is too thin , too uniform , and too closed . 
This is a recipe for frustration among an educated labor force that is too often denied the opportunity to fulfill its potential . 
This must change . 
Firms must adapt their management and governance with the aim of empowering their employees . 
The state also should open up and recruit senior managers from outside the civil service . 
To prepare for these changes , France should not only send more students abroad and welcome more foreign students ; in a country where a non-negligible share of each generation still struggles to master basic literacy and numeracy , public education must remain a key priority . 
Indeed , it is the one field in which public spending should be increased . 
Overall , cuts in public spending should continue beyond current plans ; but funds should also be reallocated to finance investment in primary education . 
Money alone , however , will not buy success . 
French civil servants must recognize that equality - that cardinal French value - does not mean uniformity , but rather more adaptability and decentralization . 
Schools and other public services in underprivileged neighborhoods should be endowed with the means and the autonomy that they need to serve common ends in the most suitable way . 
Finally , France &apos;s social model needs to be rethought . 
It was built for a vanished world in which workers often had the same employer for most of their career . 
Employment protection , lifelong learning , and social benefits should be rebuilt around the individual , not the job . 
The benefits system should be streamlined so that it becomes centered on the person , rather than being managed according to specific programs and categorical funding streams . 
This is an ambitious agenda . 
But the credibility gap in France nowadays is such that anything short of comprehensive reform is likely to be regarded with suspicion . This is a moment when broad objectives should be set out clearly and openly debated , so that French society can embrace common aims . 
This column builds on a report to the French president on what France can achieve in ten years , which was published on June 25 .
