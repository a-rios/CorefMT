If Fish Could Scream 
PRINCETON - When I was a child , my father used to take me for walks , often along a river or by the sea . 
We would pass people fishing , perhaps reeling in their lines with struggling fish hooked at the end of them . 
Once I saw a man take a small fish out of a bucket and impale it , still wriggling , on an empty hook to use as bait . 
Another time , when our path took us by a tranquil stream , I saw a man sitting and watching his line , seemingly at peace with the world , while next to him , fish he had already caught were flapping helplessly and gasping in the air . 
My father told me that he could not understand how anyone could enjoy an afternoon spent taking fish out of the water and letting them die slowly . 
These childhood memories flooded back when I read Worse things happen at sea : the welfare of wild-caught fish , a breakthrough report released last month on fishcount.org.uk. 
In most of the world , it is accepted that if animals are to be killed for food , they should be killed without suffering . 
Regulations for slaughter generally require that animals be rendered instantly unconscious before they are killed , or death should be brought about instantaneously , or , in the case of ritual slaughter , as close to instantaneously as the religious doctrine allows . 
Not for fish . 
There is no humane slaughter requirement for wild fish caught and killed at sea , nor , in most places , for farmed fish . 
Fish caught in nets by trawlers are dumped on board the ship and allowed to suffocate . 
Impaling live bait on hooks is a common commercial practice : long-line fishing , for example , uses hundreds or even thousands of hooks on a single line that may be 50-100 kilometers long . 
When fish take the bait , they are likely to remain caught for many hours before the line is hauled in . 
Likewise , commercial fishing frequently depends on gill nets - walls of fine netting in which fish become snared , often by the gills . 
They may suffocate in the net , because , with their gills constricted , they cannot breathe . 
If not , they may remain trapped for many hours before the nets are pulled in . 
The most startling revelation in the report , however , is the staggering number of fish on which humans inflict these deaths . 
By using the reported tonnages of the various species of fish caught , and dividing by the estimated average weight for each species , Alison Mood , the report &apos;s author , has put together what may well be the first-ever systematic estimate of the size of the annual global capture of wild fish . 
It is , she calculates , in the order of one trillion , although it could be as high as 2.7 trillion . 
To put this in perspective , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 60 billion animals are killed each year for human consumption - the equivalent of about nine animals for each human being on the planet . 
If we take Mood &apos;s lower estimate of one trillion , the comparable figure for fish is 150 . 
This does not include billions of fish caught illegally nor unwanted fish accidentally caught and discarded , nor does it count fish impaled on hooks as bait . 
Many of these fish are consumed indirectly - ground up and fed to factory-farmed chicken or fish . 
A typical salmon farm churns through 3-4 kilograms of wild fish for every kilogram of salmon that it produces . 
Let &apos;s assume that all this fishing is sustainable , though of course it is not . 
It would then be reassuring to believe that killing on such a vast scale does not matter , because fish do not feel pain . 
But the nervous systems of fish are sufficiently similar to those of birds and mammals to suggest that they do . 
When fish experience something that would cause other animals physical pain , they behave in ways suggestive of pain , and the change in behavior may last several hours . 
( It is a myth that fish have short memories . ) 
Fish learn to avoid unpleasant experiences , like electric shocks . 
And painkillers reduce the symptoms of pain that they would otherwise show . 
Victoria Braithwaite , a professor of fisheries and biology at Pennsylvania State University , has probably spent more time investigating this issue than any other scientist . 
Her recent book Do Fish Feel Pain ? shows that fish are not only capable of feeling pain , but also are a lot smarter than most people believe . 
Last year , a scientific panel to the European Union concluded that the preponderance of the evidence indicates that fish do feel pain . 
Why are fish the forgotten victims on our plate ? 
Is it because they are cold-blooded and covered in scales ? 
Is it because they cannot give voice to their pain ? 
Whatever the explanation , the evidence is now accumulating that commercial fishing inflicts an unimaginable amount of pain and suffering . 
We need to learn how to capture and kill wild fish humanely - or , if that is not possible , to find less cruel and more sustainable alternatives to eating them .
