Reengineering Government 
PARIS - Since the financial crisis erupted in 2008 , governments in advanced countries have been under significant pressure . 
In many countries , tax receipts abruptly collapsed when the economy contracted , income dwindled , and real-estate transactions came to a halt . 
The fall in tax revenues was in most cases sudden , deep , and lasting . 
Governments had no choice but to raise taxes or to adjust to leaner times . 
In some countries , the magnitude of the shock was such that a large tax increase could not fill the gap . 
In Spain , despite tax hikes worth more than 4 % of GDP since 2010 , the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 38 % in 2014 , compared to 41 % in 2007 . 
In Greece , tax increases amounted to 13 % of GDP during the same period , but the tax ratio increased by only six percentage points . 
Elsewhere , political limits to tax increases were reached before the gap could be filled . 
Willingly or not , priority is being given to spending cuts . 
Disillusion about future growth adds to the pressure . 
The productivity record has generally been weak over the last few years , and this suggests that growth in the years ahead could be slower than previously expected . 
Revenue growth thus looks insufficient to match the surge in age-related public spending on health and pensions . 
This is a very different crisis from those experienced in the 1980s and the 1990s . 
Back then , the main issue was political : the legitimacy and efficiency of public spending was under attack . 
In the words of US President Ronald Reagan , government was the problem , not the solution . 
By contrast , today &apos;s concerns are economic . 
Partisan disagreement about the proper scope of government remains , but there is no overall rejection of state intervention . 
Often , it is not interests or ideologies that make public spending cuts unavoidable - just facts . 
How can governments rise to the challenge ? 
The risk they face is clear enough : absent a profound reengineering , inertial spending - owing to entitlements and civil-service wages - is bound to crowd out spending on new priorities and new policies . 
Already , the countries that have been forced to cut the most have generally sacrificed public infrastructure investment . 
Research is another area at risk . 
Social investment in programs that pay off over the long term , such as pre-school child care , is suffering from financial constraints . 
National security is not given the priority it deserves , despite growing threats . 
Last but not least , makeshift solutions such as protracted wage freezes may eventually erode the quality of public services . 
Fortunately , there are a few things governments can do to mitigate the effects of inertial spending . 
For starters , they can simply systematize evaluations of the efficiency of public money . 
In most countries , such assessments are still rare and haphazard : Parliaments often enact policies without knowing whether they are worth the money , and it may take a very long time before ineffective or inefficient policies are terminated . 
That is why enabling legislation for spending programs should contain sunset clauses , with extensions subject to independent evaluation . 
Second , spending reviews , too , should be systematized . 
Setting priorities - whether to spend more on education and less on pensions , for example , or whether to invest in infrastructure or in research - entails hard choices that should be made explicit . 
In an ideal world , these choices would be the focus of electoral debates and parliamentary work . 
That is why structured spending reviews are useful : they force officials to bridge the gap between ends and means and encourage informed democratic decision-making . 
Third , governments should equip themselves with a reengineering budget . 
As private companies know , transformations - deep changes in the way things are done - often cost money before they bring savings . 
This may be because the changes require investment in new technology , retraining of employees , or simply buying stakeholders &quot; consent . 
Money earmarked in the budget for such reengineering of government programs would be a good investment . 
Fourth , governments should promote public-sector innovation . 
Contrary to popular prejudice , local governments and public agencies do innovate ; what is missing is a mechanism to select and disseminate innovations in the same way the market selects new products or cost-saving processes . 
A better way to deliver a public service may remain unknown for years . 
That might well change if governments took simple steps like allocating more funding on a project basis and organizing contests . 
For example , schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods should be allowed to tender for funds for educational innovation . 
Last but not least , people should be empowered . 
Citizens want a more nimble state that tailors its operations to local needs . 
In the digital age , they want it to meet new standards of speed , reliability , and personalization . 
They increasingly challenge the traditional view that efficiency and equality imply less individual choice . 
These are powerful forces for change , and embattled governments should harness them to the goal of achieving the reengineering they so urgently need . 
The alternative is to accept the deterioration of the quality of public services , which would lead only to a loss of government legitimacy and , with it , a diminishing willingness to pay taxes .
