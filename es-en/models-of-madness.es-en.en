Models of Madness 
Mental health services around the world are largely based on the assumption that being upset or disoriented is a sort of condition like medical illnesses . 
Here in Australasia , we imported this perspective from overseas , actively suppressing more holistic Maori and Aboriginal understandings about human distress . 
We did so despite numerous studies that show that recovery rates from &quot; mental illness &quot; in &quot; underdeveloped &quot; countries are far superior to those in &quot; advanced &quot; societies . 
Nowadays , more and more problems are being redefined as &quot; disorders &quot; or &quot; illnesses , &quot; supposedly caused by genetic predispositions and biochemical imbalances . 
Life events are relegated to mere triggers of an underlying biological time bomb . 
Thus , feeling very sad has become &quot; depressive disorder . &quot; 
Worrying too much is &quot; anxiety disorder . &quot; 
Being painfully shy has become &quot; avoidant personality disorder . &quot; 
Beating up people is &quot; intermittent explosive disorder . &quot; 
Excessive gambling , drinking , drug use , or eating are also illnesses . 
The same applies to having too little food , sleep , or sex . 
Our Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has 886 pages of such illnesses . 
Unusual or undesirable behaviors are called &quot; symptoms &quot; and the labels are &quot; diagnoses . &quot; 
Our children are labeled , too . 
Being bad at math has become &quot; mathematics disorder . &quot; 
Ignoring other people &apos;s feelings ( once called being naughty ) means that the child is suffering from &quot; conduct disorder . &quot; 
If this includes getting angry at grownups , he or she ( usually he ) has &quot; oppositional defiant disorder . &quot; 
A &quot; diagnosis &quot; frequently in the news is &quot; attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder . &quot; 
The &quot; symptoms &quot; include fidgeting , losing things , talking excessively , and difficulty playing quietly or taking turns . 
Of course some children sometimes have problems . 
But does anyone help them ? 
Perhaps it sometimes conceals the causes , while locating the problem entirely within the child , who is often stigmatized as a result . 
Indeed , making lists of behaviors , applying medical-sounding labels to people who manifest them , and then using the presence of those behaviors to prove that a person has the illness in question is scientifically meaningless . 
It tells us nothing about causes or solutions . 
How did this simplistic , certainly unscientific , and frequently damaging approach gain such dominance ? 
First , it is tempting to avoid facing the painful events in our lives that might be the cause of our difficulties . 
If we just accept the diagnosis on offer , nobody is to blame . 
Nobody needs do anything differently - except take the tablets . 
We were just unlucky enough to get the &quot; illness . &quot; 
Second , a model of individual pathology is invaluable to politicians . 
They don &apos;t need to spend money on prevention programs to address the psycho-social problems -overwhelming stress , poverty , discrimination , child neglect and abuse , and loneliness , to name but a few - that research has repeatedly demonstrated play a large role in undermining mental health . 
Third , exciting developments in technologies for studying our brains and genes have created the hope that we are about to discover the biological causes of , and solutions to , human misery and confusion . 
Finally , a new player has entered the nature-nurture debate . 
The pharmaceutical industry , fueled by our desire for quick fixes , has effectively deployed its considerable power to promulgate the notion of &quot; disorders &quot; and &quot; illnesses &quot; in all domains of our lives . 
The fundamental purpose of drug companies is to produce profits for shareholders . 
Naturally , they encourage us to diagnose eating , sleeping , or feeling too much ( or too little ) as illnesses requiring a chemical cure . 
Having listened for 20 years to people unfortunate enough to be labeled &quot; schizophrenic , &quot; considered to be the most extreme form of &quot; mental illness , &quot; and having subsequently researched the causes of hallucinations and delusions for ten years , I believe that the public understands madness better than we experts . 
Surveys of public opinion all over the world find that most people believe that emotional problems , including those deemed severe , such as hearing voices , are primarily caused by bad things happening to us rather than by faulty brains or genes . 
The public also favors psycho-social approaches , such as talking to someone and getting advice , or help finding friends or a job , rather than drugs , electro-shocks , or admission to psychiatric hospital . 
Some experts , however , dismiss these views as &quot; mental health illiteracy . &quot; 
They continue to insist that mental illness is an illness like any other , despite many studies showing that the more we adopt this medical model , the more prejudiced and frightened we become . 
Mental health services should offer something more than having our feelings chemically suppressed , or having our children &apos;s difficulties sitting still controlled by amphetamines ( which , apart from teaching children that problems are best solved with drugs , stunt growth by an average of one centimeter per year ) . 
A wide range of effective treatments are available that don &apos;t cause weight gain , sexual dysfunction , diabetes , memory loss , or addiction . 
Funders and policymakers who keep up with the relevant research are slowly beginning to introduce more talking therapies ( such as cognitive therapy and trauma-focused counseling ) , more alternatives to hospitalization , more culturally appropriate services , more family-focused therapy and , most importantly , more genuine consultation with service users about what actually works . 
If these new treatments aren &apos;t used more frequently , this isn &apos;t because they don &apos;t work . 
The main obstacle is that they won &apos;t increase the profits of drug companies , on which , in the absence of adequate government funding , our professional organizations , conferences , journals , research , and teaching institutions have become so dependent .
