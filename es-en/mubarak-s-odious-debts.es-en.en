Mubarak &apos;s Odious Debts 
NEW YORK - A glance at Egypt &apos;s public finances reveals a disturbing fact : the interest that the country pays on its foreign loans is larger than its budget for education , healthcare , and housing combined . 
Indeed , these debt-service costs alone account for 22 % of the Egyptian government &apos;s total expenditures . 
The impact has become impossible to ignore . 
With growing political uncertainty and a slowing economy , Egypt is likely to witness decreasing government revenues , increasing demands for urgent spending , and rising interest rates on government borrowing . 
This could lead to a fiscal catastrophe for the government at the very moment when the country is attempting a complicated political transition . 
Egypt &apos;s public debt is around 80 % of GDP , very close to the 90 % level that economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart identify as a harbinger of slower growth and heightened vulnerability to financial and fiscal crises . 
Egyptians need only glance north , at the European debt crisis , to understand they should sort out their debt problem now , rather than waiting until it reaches Greek proportions . 
This debt was incurred during the 30-year reign of the deposed president , Hosni Mubarak . 
In international law , debt that is incurred without the consent of the people , and that is not used to their benefit , is referred to as &quot; odious &quot; ; as such , it is not considered transferable to successor regimes . 
The reasoning is simple and logical : if someone fraudulently borrows money in my name , I am not expected to pay it back , and neither should a country &apos;s population when an unrepresentative leader borrows in their name and to their detriment . 
For three decades , Mubarak &apos;s borrowing only enriched him and his ruling clique while impoverishing and repressing the rest of Egypt . 
Corruption was rife , but not just the covert type : public money was openly used to support many businesses under flimsy pretexts like &quot; fostering economic growth &quot; and &quot; creating employment . &quot; 
Along with regulatory capture , this harmed competitiveness , market openness , and Egypt &apos;s small and medium-size businesses . 
The beneficiaries of this largesse are now mostly sitting in prison awaiting trial . 
The rest of Egypt , however , only felt this money in the form of an ever-expanding state apparatus that solidified Mubarak &apos;s rule , crushed dissent , and repressed millions . 
When Egyptians rose up against Mubarak in January , they were confronted by weapons paid for with borrowed money . 
Is it fair to expect Egyptians to continue paying for their previous repression and impoverishment at the hands of Mubarak and his cronies ? 
Since this money clearly benefited Mubarak but not his people , should it not be Mubarak , rather than his victims , who is held responsible for it ? 
The type of regime Mubarak was running had been clear for many years , and it was also clear how the money was being used . 
A prudent lender should have considered these facts before making the loans . 
So the banks and international institutions that lent money to Mubarak should bear the responsibility of their choice to bankroll his repressive regime . 
The new Egypt should make a clean break with Mubarak and his creditors , and let them sort out their business among themselves without involving the Egyptian people . 
The Egyptian government &apos;s only role should be to help liquidate Mubarak assets for repayment should the need arise . 
This would be not only fair , but it also would teach an important lesson to those who bankroll dictators - a lesson that is likely to have an immediate positive impact worldwide . 
Lenders to a repressive regime will no longer expect these debts to be repaid by its successors , immediately making lenders worldwide careful about lending to them . 
An Egyptian precedent would bring awareness and sobriety to an entire generation of lenders that is not accustomed to considering this type of risk , and that may even be unfamiliar with the doctrine of odious debt . 
Repressive regimes would find it harder to borrow , which would , in turn , make it harder for them to repress their people , and make it easier and cheaper for responsible and legitimate governments to secure important funding when they need it . 
Transferring liability for foreign debt to Mubarak should not have negative economic consequences for Egypt in the long run . 
This move should not be understood as a move towards fiscal recklessness , but as a one-time break from it . 
With a smaller debt burden and interest payments , Egypt &apos;s fiscal position would improve significantly , and threats to economic growth would recede . 
Foreign lenders &quot; resulting caution would prevent future Egyptian governments from irresponsibly saddling their populace with debt . 
Perhaps most importantly , the days of borrowing to build a large state security apparatus would be gone for good - worldwide . 
For the sake of Egyptians and people living under tyranny everywhere , Egypt &apos;s government must take a brave stand .
