Three Strikes Against the Drug War 
MEXICO CITY - The last two months have witnessed more far-reaching changes on the drug-policy scene in Latin America and the United States than in all previous decades combined . 
Three fundamental shifts have occurred , each of which would be important on its own ; taken together , they may be a game-changer that finally ends the hemisphere &apos;s failed war on drugs . 
First and foremost were the referenda on marijuana legalization in the US states of Colorado and Washington on November 6 . 
For the first time , voters in the country that is the world &apos;s largest consumer of illicit drugs in general , and marijuana in particular , approved propositions legalizing possession , production , and distribution of cannabis - and by relatively broad margins . 
While a similar initiative failed in Oregon , and Proposition 19 ( which called for limited legalization of cannabis ) was defeated in California in 2010 ( by seven percentage points ) , the outcome in Colorado and Washington sent a powerful message to the rest of the US . 
Just as important , however , was President Barack Obama &apos;s reaction to the Colorado and Washington votes - both states that he won easily in his re-election bid . 
The legal and political challenges implied are no minor matter : marijuana remains an illicit substance under US federal law and international conventions that America has adopted . 
On other issues - notably immigration - Obama rejects claims of states &quot; rights and insists on federal authority . 
Moreover , the topic remains highly sensitive : while public-opinion polls in 2012 indicate for the first time a small majority in favor of legalization , opponents remain vehement . 
Nonetheless , in an interview on December 14 , Obama made three path-breaking statements . 
First , he said that enforcing federal marijuana legislation in Colorado and Washington was not a priority of his administration ; he had &quot; other fish to fry . &quot; 
Second , he reiterated his own opposition to legalization , but then added : &quot; at this point . &quot; 
For the first time , a sitting US president hinted at a possible , perhaps even likely , change of future policy . 
Finally , Obama advocated holding a &quot; national conversation &quot; on the question of state versus federal legislation on such issues . 
The importance of these statements cannot be overestimated . 
The third change in recent months occurred in one of the world &apos;s largest drug-supplying countries : Mexico , through which practically all of the illegal drugs shipped to the US - cocaine , heroin , marijuana , and methamphetamines - must pass . 
On December 1 , Enrique Peña Nieto succeeded Felipe Calderón as President . 
As happens almost everywhere , the transition became a moment to scrutinize the outgoing government &apos;s policies , even if the new administration does not intend to modify those policies in the short term . 
Fortunately for Mexico , history seems to be judging Calderón &apos;s &quot; war on drugs &quot; severely . 
Indeed , The Washington Post reported in late November that internal government documents , made available to its Mexico City correspondent , showed that more than 25,000 people disappeared during Calderón &apos;s six-year term , in addition to the roughly 60,000 deaths directly linked to the drug war . 
The advocacy group Human Rights Watch wrote a public letter to the new president , asking what he intends to do about the thousands of missing Mexicans . 
Then , in a series of leaks and explicit statements , the new government pointed out the previous policies &quot; high legal , bureaucratic , and financial costs , and that many more crimes of all types were committed , despite sharply higher spending on law enforcement and security . 
In short , the most recent emblem of the traditional , internationally imposed drug-enforcement approach , based on punitive and prohibitionist policies , is turning out to be a catastrophic failure , costing Mexico dearly while producing no results for the country , the rest of Latin America , or the US . 
Proponents of a different strategy ( Presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Otto Peréz Molina of Colombia and Guatemala , respectively , among others ) , based on public-health premises and legalization , are gaining ground . 
Uruguay is expected to approve legislation fully legalizing marijuana in January ; the Organization of American States is scheduled to deliver a report to the region &apos;s heads of state at mid-year on alternative drug-enforcement strategies and existing &quot; best practices &quot; in other countries . 
And more US states will most likely either approve full-fledged marijuana legalization or its medicinal use ( 18 states already allow it ) . 
A sea change in drug policy seems to be in the making . 
It will not occur overnight , or everywhere , or in regard to all drugs . 
It &apos;s a pity it took so long .
