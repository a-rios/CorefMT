The Conundrum of Scientific Fraud 
Science , and the behavior of scientists , has never been perfect . 
Consider the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk , whose claim to have extracted stem cells from human embryos that he cloned turned out to be based on phony research . 
Hwang has just been fired by Seoul National University , and six of his co-workers have been suspended or had their pay cut . 
Hwang and his colleagues are hardly alone . 
In response to the recurrence of well-publicized and highly damaging scandals in recent years , many universities and some entire national research funding agencies now convene &quot; institutional review boards &quot; to deal with breaches of what has come to be known as &quot; research ethics . &quot; 
But are such boards necessary ? 
If so , in what spirit should they conduct their work ? 
From artists to scientists , all intellectual workers are preoccupied with the giving and taking of credit . 
Hiring , promoting , and rewarding academic staff is increasingly based on &quot; citation counts &quot; - the number of times someone receives credit in peer-approved publications . 
Even if someone &apos;s work is criticized , it must be credited properly . 
Credit is often given simply because someone has produced a creditable work . 
Sometimes fraud consists in plagiarism : the culprit takes credit for someone else &apos;s work . 
However , especially in the most competitive scientific fields , fraud often takes the form of forgery : the culprit fabricates data . 
Plagiarism is the sin of the classroom ; forgery is the sin of the laboratory . 
A useful simplification in addressing the potential work of research ethics panels is to consider two models of review : &quot; inquisitorial &quot; and &quot; accusatorial . &quot; 
Whereas the inquisitorial model presumes that fraud is rampant , but often undetected , the accusatorial model adopts a less paranoid stance , presuming that researchers are innocent until proven otherwise . 
The natural context for an inquisitorial system is a field where scientific integrity is regularly under threat because research is entangled with political or financial interests . 
Often , these entanglements are unavoidable , especially in the case of biomedical research . 
Here the inquisitors are part cost accountant , part thought police . 
They conduct spot-checks on labs to ensure that the various constituencies for scientific research are getting their money &apos;s worth . 
Inquisitors must be invested with the power to cut off funding to transgressors , perhaps even excommunicating them , by barring a scientist from practicing or publishing in the future . 
Hwang , for example , has lost his research license and has been banned from assuming another public post for five years . 
However , the credibility of such a system relies on the inquisitors &quot; ability to uphold standards of science that are genuinely independent from special interests both inside and outside the research community . 
Otherwise , inquisitorial ethics reviews could come to be regarded as nothing more than intellectual vigilantism . 
Consider the Danish Research Council &apos;s ominously named &quot; Committee on Scientific Dishonesty , &quot; which was convened in 2002 following complaints raised against the political scientist Bj√∏rn Lomborg , whose book The Skeptical Environmentalist purported to demonstrate that ecologists systematically biased their interpretation of data to support their political objectives . 
The Committee initially found Lomborg guilty of much the same error that he had alleged of the ecologists . 
However , the Committee refused to comment on whether his behavior was normal or deviant for the field in question . 
In the end , the Committee on Scientific Dishonesty was itself reorganized . 
In retrospect , the Committee probably should have refused the case , given that Lomborg &apos;s book was subject to intense public scrutiny , often by experts writing ( favorably ) in The Economist and ( unfavorably ) in Scientific American . 
His was a genuine case in which intellectual work was given a fair trial in the proverbial &quot; court of public opinion &quot; and required no further oversight . 
Indeed , Lomborg &apos;s case would seem to support the accusatorial model of ethics review , which assumes that scientists adequately regulate their own affairs through normal peer-review procedures . 
Here , scientific integrity is understood not as a duty to stakeholders - funders , companies , or , as with Hwang , politicians concerned about national prestige - but as a collective responsibility that is upheld by identifying and correcting errors before they cause substantial harm . 
The accusatorial system is designed for those relatively rare cases when error slips through the peer-review net , resulting in some concrete damage to health or the environment , or causing the corruption of later research that assumes the validity of fraudulent work . 
To lodge an accusation , the accuser must establish that some harm has been committed , which is then shown to have been the fault of the accused . 
The countervailing assumptions of the inquisitorial and accusatorial systems reflect the ambiguity of the concept of scientific fraud . 
Many so-called frauds are cases in which researchers claimed credit for work they have not really carried out , but that pointed in the right direction and was eventually completed by others . 
Strictly speaking , they are guilty more of confusing the potential and the actual than the true and the false . 
Indeed , by today &apos;s standards , Galileo and Mendel committed fraud , since they likely massaged their data to fit a neat mathematical formula . 
However , they remain scientific visionaries because others built so effectively on their &quot; work . &quot; 
Of course , in their cases , no money changed hands and no one &apos;s life was jeopardized . 
Perhaps , from the point of view of research ethics , that makes all the difference .
