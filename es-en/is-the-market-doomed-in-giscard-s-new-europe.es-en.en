Is the Market Doomed in Giscard \ u0027s New Europe ? 
The endgame to determine the European Union &apos;s final shape is underway . 
It began with the publication by the Praesidium of the Convention on the Future of Europe of a draft of the first sixteen articles of the &quot; Treaty to establish a Constitution for Europe . &quot; 
The text mostly replicates the structure of Convention Chairman Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing &apos;s &quot; skeleton &quot; Constitution , presented last November , and the conclusions reached by the Convention &apos;s working groups . 
The key word here is mostly . 
Such fidelity did not hold for economics . 
Where markets and business are concerned , the draft text stretches the &quot; economic governance &quot; working group &apos;s conclusions so as to propose a centralized approach , one strongly tilted to favor social , environmental , and consumer objectives , neglecting economic freedom and the market economy . 
Let &apos;s start with the sins of omission . 
The &quot; values &quot; of the Union ( Article 2 ) include peace , justice , equality of all before the law and solidarity . 
All fine and noble sentiments . 
But no mention is made of freedom of initiative and enterprise . 
Similarly , the &quot; fundamental objectives &quot; of the Union ( Article 3 ) indulge in promises to promote &quot; sustainable &quot; growth , social cohesion and social protection , gender equality , the environment , and consumer protection . 
The need for a free and well-functioning market economy is not included , though this is the fundamental pre-condition for the high standards of living and social protection that the document &apos;s authors advocate so resolutely . 
Moreover , the principle of &quot; subsidiarity &quot; is restricted to relations between member states and the Union , or &quot; vertical &quot; subsidiarity . 
But a richer alternative was available , one that would guarantee a broad right of private individuals ( and their associations and organizations ) to be protected from unnecessary interference by public powers . 
There would be a presumption against public intervention and the burden of proof on the need for it - at any level of government - would be shifted to its advocates . 
This &quot; horizontal &quot; subsidiarity would help ensure that the EU does not interfere unduly with market activity . 
But more than the draft &apos;s omissions are worrying . 
Article 11 provides that the Union &quot; shall have competence to coordinate the economic policies of the member states . &quot; 
As if this were not sufficient , Article 13 reiterates that &quot; the Union shall coordinate the economic policies of the member states , in particular by establishing broad guidelines for these policies . &quot; 
This language implies that member states will no longer be the masters of their broad policy orientations . 
Instead , these will be entrusted to the Union , presumably with formal Commission powers of initiative in their preparation . 
National parliaments are expected to surrender their powers graciously . 
The crucial surprise in the draft constitution concerns social policy , previously a closed preserve of individual nations . 
Article 12 places it among the &quot; shared &quot; competences of the Union ; 
This implies a fundamental reversal of the present approach , whereby social policies belong to member states and the Union has tightly circumscribed powers of intervention , which , in addition , can only be exercised with unanimity . 
Until now , European integration worked best when it reduced the role of public ( usually national ) intervention , thus opening up national markets . 
Today , it seems , some politicians are no longer satisfied with this so-called &quot; negative &quot; integration . 
They want much wider latitude to intervene . 
For example , the economic governance working group had agreed that monetary policy should be managed at Union level by an independent central bank , the ECB . 
Fiscal policies should be left with the member states , albeit under the constraints imposed by the EC Treaty ( the coordination procedures of Article 99 and the excessive deficits procedure of Article 104 ) . 
There was no consensus on including other macroeconomic policies among the Union &apos;s &quot; shared competences . &quot; 
Nor was there agreement on the proposal to grant the Euro-Group - the economic and finance ministers of the euro area - formal decision-making powers over the economic policies of EU members . 
But the text tabled by the Praesidium opens their way to doing just that . 
We are presented with the outline of a centralized Union endowed with strong powers to coordinate economic polices and impose a common social policy . 
The omission of the freedom of private initiative from the values and objectives of the new Europe will influence countless court judgements , which will cause legal doctrine to become biased towards an interventionist stance . 
Provisions to coordinate national economic policies are probably less of a danger because they are so vague that they could well remain a dead letter . 
But including social policy among the shared competences of the Union is potentially much more serious . 
Together with the emphasis on social values , it invites a process of harmonization of social protection . 
That will be disastrous for growth and employment , given the enormous and deeply rooted differences in productivity and living standards across the Union . 
The good news here is that these ideas are not carved in stone . 
But only a broad public outcry will convince the Praesidium to scrap this disastrous approach .
