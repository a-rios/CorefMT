Transforming Science Education 
CHICAGO - Throughout the West , declining standards in science education are threatening future prosperity . 
Since the mid-nineteenth century , the West has depended on technical innovation and scientific derring-do for its influence and growth . 
But the West now faces serious competition from the rising nations of Asia , where education in math and science is flourishing . 
In general , competition in science and technology is a blessing - the more advanced a nation is , the better a customer it is . 
And collaboration and exchange of people make for profitable businesses and higher standards of living . 
But it must be recognized that falling educational standards will eventually hit economic growth . 
The West , particularly the United States , has lived through such a moment of recognition before , when the USSR launched Sputnik in 1957 . 
The so-called &quot; Sputnik shock &quot; convinced America and the West of the need for radical reform of science education , particularly recruitment , training , and retention of teachers . 
One reform that demands priority today concerns high school science . 
Mathematics , the foundation for all science , depends on its concise language and logical ordering . 
Physics , once the subject most dependent on mathematics , provides knowledge about the structure of atoms , and the use of mathematics there has now spread to chemistry and biology . 
Essentially all phenomena in chemistry find explanations in the quantum atom , while chemistry and physics undergird molecular biology , which , since the discovery of DNA in the 1950s , dominates modern biology . 
All other sciences - geology , astronomy , neuroscience , oceanography , and myriad hyphenated subjects - depend upon overlapping combinations of biology , chemistry , and physics . 
Yet today , the vast majority of high schools start the study of science with biology . 
In America , the requirement is usually for three years of science study , and , today , most U.S. students take science in this order : biology , chemistry , physics . 
This sequence of study was devised in 1893 . 
I believe that it is obsolete , pedagogically disastrous , and ignores the tremendous scientific advances of the twentieth century . 
Other industrial nations may cycle through pieces of the disciplines , missing the essential coherence of the P-C-B sequence . 
Studying science should begin with physics , not biology . 
In studying physics , students study algebra simultaneously , motivating them with a sense of the power of mathematics . 
Moreover , physics begins with everyday phenomena requiring few new words ( as opposed to conventional ninth-grade biology ) : motion , velocity , acceleration , falling objects , a sense of gravity as a force , and some new concepts , e.g. mass , momentum , and energy , but with crisp definitions . 
Ninth-grade physics , unlike ninth-grade biology , illustrates the grand sweep of the laws of nature , and the power of an equation to describe a vast number of different phenomena can be taught at this level . 
Classroom experiments make use of simple laboratory devices : inclined planes , pulleys , springs , simple pendulums , but the rules that are revealed have validity out in the real world . 
The fall of a weight ( or an apple ! ) can be connected to the moon &apos;s orbit around the earth and even to the structure of galaxies holding billions of solar systems . 
Indeed , we can study , on a convenient classroom scale , the same forces that move atoms and planets . 
The last month or more of ninth-grade physics introduces atoms , invisible to the naked eye but with strong indirect support . 
Here physics introduces scales of distances , atoms to galaxies , scales of time , nanoseconds to centuries , and scales of energy from electron volts to megajoules . 
These orders of magnitude require metaphors and repetition , but they serve as crucial concepts in our world , especially in cosmology and in evolutionary biology . 
Tenth-grade chemistry makes use of ninth-grade physics , deepening and enriching the student &apos;s grasp , but no basic chemical or biological principles are required for ninth-grade physics . 
Instead , qualitative applications of physics to chemistry and biology heighten interest and emphasize the connections . 
Chemistry is largely a study of molecules , and when they are complex , there is the mysterious transition to life and biology . 
At all stages of the science curriculum , basic questions must be asked . 
How does something work ? 
How do we know ? 
What are the common laws ? 
It was not a physicist , but a biologist , Julius Meyer , who first proposed the law of conservation of energy from a study of biological energy processes . 
The chemist Dalton first gave a proof of the existence of atoms and the engineer Sadi Carnot first gave a proof of the Second Law of Thermodynamics . 
The sequence Physics-Chemistry-Biology implies that continuous collegial professional development for teachers is essential . 
Teachers ( including those in mathematics ) should meet regularly to plot the evolution of their courses , their essential coherence , and the inclusion of stories that illustrate how science works . 
Teachers need time to talk together . 
I know of more than 1,000 high schools that have implemented the P-C-B sequence . 
There is almost universal joy as students begin to grasp the whole picture . 
Elective science courses zoom up in popularity . 
Because this sequence is for all students , what will be retained in the future are the stories and , most importantly , a scientific way of thinking . 
There is no job , no profession , civic activity that will not profit from this kind of education . 
But to restore the vitality of science , we need to look at the entire educational system : teachers from pre-school through high school , state and national standards , productive and educationally reinforcing assessments , teaching materials and educational technology , and progress in the neurosciences , cognitive psychology , developmental biology , and nutrition . 
And leadership for this huge revolutionary effort will probably have to come from visionary business executives whose profits depend on education and rationality .
