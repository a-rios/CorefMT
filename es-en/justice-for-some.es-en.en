Justice for Some 
NEW YORK - The mortgage debacle in the United States has raised deep questions about &quot; the rule of law , &quot; the universally accepted hallmark of an advanced , civilized society . 
The rule of law is supposed to protect the weak against the strong , and ensure that everyone is treated fairly . 
In America in the wake of the sub-prime mortgage crisis , it has done neither . 
Part of the rule of law is security of property rights - if you owe money on your house , for example , the bank can &apos;t simply take it away without following the prescribed legal process . 
To some banks , this is just collateral damage : millions of Americans - in addition to the estimated four million in 2008 and 2009 - still have to be thrown out of their homes . 
Indeed , the pace of foreclosures would be set to increase - were it not for government intervention . 
The procedural shortcuts , incomplete documentation , and rampant fraud that accompanied banks &quot; rush to generate millions of bad loans during the housing bubble has , however , complicated the process of cleaning up the ensuing mess . 
To many bankers , these are just details to be overlooked . 
Most people evicted from their homes have not been paying their mortgages , and , in most cases , those who are throwing them out have rightful claims . 
We don &apos;t say that most people imprisoned for life committed a crime worthy of that sentence . 
The US justice system demands more , and we have imposed procedural safeguards to meet these demands . 
But banks want to short-circuit these procedural safeguards . 
To some , all of this is reminiscent of what happened in Russia , where the rule of law - bankruptcy legislation in particular - was used as a legal mechanism to replace one group of owners with another . 
Courts were bought , documents forged , and the process went smoothly . 
In America , the venality is at a higher level . 
It is not particular judges that are bought , but the laws themselves , through campaign contributions and lobbying , in what has come to be called &quot; corruption , American-style . &quot; 
It was widely known that banks and mortgage companies were engaged in predatory lending practices , taking advantage of the least educated and most financially uninformed to make loans that maximized fees and imposed enormous risks on the borrowers . 
( To be fair , the banks tried to take advantage of the more financially sophisticated as well , as with securities created by Goldman Sachs that were designed to fail . ) 
When it became clear that people could not pay back what was owed , the rules of the game changed . 
Bankruptcy laws were amended to introduce a system of &quot; partial indentured servitude . &quot; 
An individual with , say , debts equal to 100 % of his income could be forced to hand over to the bank 25 % of his gross , pre-tax income for the rest of his life , because , the bank could add on , say , 30 % interest each year to what a person owed . 
In the end , a mortgage holder would owe far more than the bank ever received , even though the debtor had worked , in effect , one-quarter time for the bank . 
When this new bankruptcy law was passed , no one complained that it interfered with the sanctity of contracts : at the time borrowers incurred their debt , a more humane - and economically rational - bankruptcy law gave them a chance for a fresh start if the burden of debt repayment became too onerous . 
That knowledge should have given lenders incentives to make loans only to those who could repay . 
With one out of four mortgages in the US under water - more owed than the house is worth - there is a growing consensus that the only way to deal with the mess is to write down the value of the principal ( what is owed ) . 
America has a special procedure for corporate bankruptcy , called Chapter 11 , which allows a speedy restructuring by writing down debt , and converting some of it to equity . 
It is important to keep enterprises alive as going concerns , in order to preserve jobs and growth . 
So America needs a &quot; homeowners &quot; Chapter 11 . &quot; 
Lenders complain that such a law would violate their property rights . 
When the 2005 bankruptcy law was passed , lenders were the beneficiaries ; they didn &apos;t worry about how the law affected the rights of debtors . 
Growing inequality , combined with a flawed system of campaign finance , risks turning America &apos;s legal system into a travesty of justice . 
Some may still call it the &quot; rule of law , &quot; but it would not be a rule of law that protects the weak against the powerful . 
Rather , it would enable the powerful to exploit the weak . 
In today &apos;s America , the proud claim of &quot; justice for all &quot; is being replaced by the more modest claim of &quot; justice for those who can afford it . &quot; 
And the number of people who can afford it is rapidly diminishing .
