Nature \ u0027s Warnings to the Johannesburg Summiteers 
Nature &apos;s awesome powers have been on frightening display lately . 
As world leaders gather in Johannesburg to discuss global environmental threats , many parts of the planet are battered by floods , droughts , harvest failures , massive forest fires , and even new diseases . 
Man &apos;s relationship to nature is a theme as old as our species , but that relationship is changing in complex ways . 
The most important result of the Johannesburg Summit should be a recognition that more scientific research and much more global cooperation is needed . 
Floods and droughts have been scourges from ancient times , yet the frequency , size , and economic impact of these disasters has grown in recent years . 
Insurance claims against natural disasters rose to unprecedented levels during the 1990s , suggesting that the social costs of environmental upheavals have intensified . 
Climate shocks such as the fierce El Nino of 1997-98 played a major role in recent economic upheavals . 
Indonesia and Ecuador , among other countries , succumbed to financial crises in 1997-98 that were linked ( in part ) to agricultural crises caused by the severe El Nino . 
Part of the growing climate effect results from our sheer numbers . 
Largely as a result of technological successes in the past 200 years , the human population has grown seven-fold since 1800 , from around 900 million in 1800 to more than 6 billion people today , crowding humanity into vulnerable spots throughout the world . 
More than 2 billion of the world &apos;s 6 billion people live within 100 kilometers of a coastline , and so are vulnerable to ocean storms , flooding , and rising sea levels due to global warming . 
Hundreds of millions more live in fragile habitats on the steep slopes of mountains , or in semi-deserts , or in rain-fed regions where crops fail regularly when rain doesn &apos;t arrive . 
Human beings are also changing the environment everywhere , often in ways that make societies more vulnerable . 
This is especially the case in impoverished countries . 
The increasing population density in rural Africa , with its intensification of farming , is leading to massive soil depletion . 
When drought comes to Southern Africa , as it has this year , tens of millions of impoverished peasant families struggle for survival . 
Because African poverty contributed to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS , the combination of climate shocks and epidemic disease is devastating . 
Millions of AIDS orphans in Southern Africa live with grandparents too old and weak to produce food or to secure it . 
Because of the onset of the El Nino , it &apos;s likely that the drought will continue into the coming year . 
The most remarkable feature of these environmental changes is that they are not limited to local environments . 
For the first time in human history , human society is undermining the environment at the global scale , through climate change , extinctions , and degraded ecosystems . 
Man-made global warming , caused mainly by fossil-fuel burning in rich countries , may well be a factor in the frequency and severity of major droughts , floods , and tropical storms . 
The frequency and intensity of the El Nino cycle in the past 25 years may also be the result of global warming . 
China &apos;s heavy floods in recent years are partly the result , it seems , of the excessive melting of mountain snows on the Tibetan Plateau , which was caused by higher temperatures . 
These growing environmental risks are complex . 
The effects of environmental change may occur only after many years and may be felt halfway around the world . 
Land use changes , say , can amplify the spread of infectious diseases by changing the mix of species or the ways that animals and humans interact . 
Politicians are inept at handling such problems , so environmental risks continue to grow without adequate changes in public policy . 
When disasters hit ( such as this year &apos;s droughts or floods ) , politicians cannot be held accountable for mistakes made over the course of many decades . 
The summit in Johannesburg can draw the world &apos;s attention to these pressing problems . 
Even if the summit produces few specific results , it can make a difference if three demands are made of the summiteers : 
we should insist that the world &apos;s politicians recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence that points to the major environmental perils humanity faces ; 
we should press these leaders to invest more public money in basic environmental research and in the development of new technologies to address environmental risks . 
For example , investments in research on alternative energy systems that can limit global warming are vital ; 
third , we should insist that our politicians agree to greater international environmental cooperation , lest the neglectful and shortsighted policies within each nation end up destroying the global ecosystem .
