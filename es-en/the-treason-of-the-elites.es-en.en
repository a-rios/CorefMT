The Treason of the Elites 
PARIS : Elites are insecure everywhere nowadays . 
Some , if not most , politicians are suspected of corruption . 
Corporate managers are blamed for seeking short-term and personal profit , not social prosperity . 
Union bosses are derided for backwardness , intellectuals for seeking fame instead of truth , journalists for pandering . 
These jibes , paradoxically , go hand-in-hand with efforts to appeal to and rely upon those very same elites . 
Democracies seem to need elites but find the idea of them offensive . 
France is a case study in this political schizophrenia . 
The old elitist French system is widely seen as the cause of a stunted economy , educational system , even democracy . 
Because a society does not become &quot; blocked &quot; on its own a small , isolated group that perceives all change as an attack on itself , is blamed . 
Examples of paralysis abound : the absence of serious external evaluations at universities ; 
Some call this &quot; Parisianism &quot; - rule by an intellectual elite closed to the world outside itself . 
Much of the press fawns over the power of this cramped intelligentsia , which of course undermines efforts to change it . 
An uninspiring ( but successful ) recent book entitled The French Omerta reflects society &apos;s voyeurism and impotent anger ; many people feel that empty and sterile political games are being played for the purpose of making certain that nothing changes . 
In the face of such helplessness , populism on the extreme right is now matched by protest from the extreme left , both signs of a general feeling of entrapment . 
This French pathology has its roots in two contradictory sins : the first is our long tradition of obedience ; the second an ultra-rationalism in the exercise of power . 
What results is an elite that assumes its power is the most natural thing in the world , yet feels compelled to produce ideological , not practical , reasons for its use . 
Obedience makes the inaccessibility of power and the elite &apos;s cult of secrecy possible . 
This secrecy and inaccessibility distort French democracy , as manifested in the long struggle to expose the corruption of the Gaullist mayor of Paris , Jean Tiberi , as well as that of President Mitterrand &apos;s friend and foreign minister , Roland Dumas . 
These distortions are also institutional , manifested in the ease with which governments stymie oversight by starving Parliament of information . 
Ultra-rationalism leads the elite to prefer words to actions , slogans to facts , advertising to results . 
Presentation is government &apos;s modern Maginot line . 
France &apos;s elite functioned well when the Cold War &apos;s ideological divide structured political life and when increasing national income , due to postwar reconstruction , delivered a feeling of real progress . 
Once ideologies vanished and economic realities dimmed , the unchanging nature of the elite left the population with a bitter feeling that the system was irresponsible , protected , closed , and secretive . 
The ideal of equality seemed profaned by the elite &apos;s rampant privileges . 
All public opinion polls attest to this - among listed grievances inequality always features high . 
The French system nowadays is one where responsibility is based not on a person &apos;s actions but on position ; it is one where accountability does not exist . 
Our self-selected elite , moreover , emphasizes the impossibility of great political change . 
Instead , the aim in politics is to maintain the status quo ; periodic redistributions of position , property , and income - all vital to democracy - are eliminated . 
Inequality ; the causes of social tension ; the very nature of government - they have become taboo subjects . 
Our elite imposes its vision of reality on all . 
These anti-intellectual tendencies within France &apos;s supposedly hyper-intellectual ruling classes are enhanced by the absence of links between universities , politics , administration , business , and media . 
In American , British , and even German &quot; think tanks &quot; outsiders and insiders meet , debate , and create policy options . 
Here the elite is sterile because there are no bodies with enough intellectual critical mass to challenge it . 
Small reforms will not solve these problems . 
A real democratic revolution is necessary to prevent populism from becoming the only solution to a system of contempt , carelessness , and narrow-mindedness . 
The first revolution must be institutional . 
Irresponsibility among cabinet members can be addressed by eliminating their bonuses . 
Immunity in the presidential office must be abolished , the executive must be separated from the courts , and conflicts of interest that undermine Parliament must be eradicated . 
Local authorities must be made truly independent and power divorced from personal interests . 
Appointments should be based on competence in a particular office , not membership in the elite . 
Beyond this , the mythic nature of the president of the republic must be cut down so as to more clearly define the executive &apos;s duties . 
This , in turn , will allow Parliament to perform its functions as supervisor and lawmaker . 
Without such changes , France will continue as a monarchical democracy riddled with underground intrigues . 
The second revolution is intellectual . 
Teaching to support critical thinking must be encouraged . 
The way to break a system of fawning and inaccessibility in our universities is to provide for international external evaluations . 
Encouraging foreign students , researchers , and teachers will help , as will cultivating international links . 
Open competition only increases the quality of thought . 
Finally , a social revolution must become a reality . 
No group chosen on the basis of success at university without reference to later actions should live in privilege . 
Protection without social responsibility is indefensible . 
Adequate responsibilities for every individual depending on his / her role in society - from company managers &quot; responsibility to shareholders , to bureaucrats &quot; responsibility to citizens - must be set . 
Related to this are rewards . 
Taxes must be adjusted to reward real merit and work , not connections . 
To truly reform , France must begin to synthesize the socialism it rhetorically embraces with the liberalism of which it has long been wary . 
For the spirit of justice and progress only works if propelled by the dynamics of free individuals .
