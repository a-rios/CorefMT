Corrupting the Fight Against Corruption 
At its recent annual meeting , World Bank officials spoke extensively about corruption . 
It is an understandable concern : money that the Bank lends to developing countries that ends up in secret bank accounts or finances some contractors &quot; luxurious lifestyle leaves a country more indebted , not more prosperous . 
James Wolfensohn , the Bank &apos;s previous president , and I are widely credited with putting corruption on the Bank &apos;s agenda , against opponents who regarded corruption as a political issue , not an economic one , and thus outside the Bank &apos;s mandate . 
Our research showed systematic relationships between corruption and economic growth , which allowed us to pursue this critical issue . 
But the World Bank would do well to keep four things in mind as it takes up the fight . 
First , corruption takes many forms , so a war on corruption has to be fought on many fronts . 
You can &apos;t fight the diversion of small amounts of money by weak and poor countries while ignoring the massive diversion of public resources into private hands of the sort that marked , say , Russia under Boris Yeltsin . 
In some countries , overt corruption occurs primarily through campaign contributions that oblige politicians to repay major donors with favors . 
Smaller-scale corruption is bad , but systemic corruption of political processes can have even greater costs . 
Campaign contributions and lobbying that lead to rapid privatizations of utilities - before appropriate regulatory frameworks are in place , and in a manner that produces only a few bidders - can impede development , even without direct kickbacks to government officials . 
Life is never black and white . 
Just as there is no &quot; one size fits all &quot; policy for economic development , there is no such policy for fighting corruption . 
The response to corruption needs to be as complex and variegated as corruption itself . 
Second , it &apos;s fine for the World Bank to deliver anti-corruption sermons . 
In fact , the Bank &apos;s procurement procedures are generally viewed around the world as a model to be admired . 
Indeed , some countries with large dollar reserves - hardly in need of World Bank credit - borrowed from the Bank at far higher interest rates than they were getting from the United States , believing that these procedures would help ensure high-quality projects free of corruption and become standard in other areas . 
But success in fighting corruption entails more than just good procurement procedures ( avoiding , for instance , single-source non-competitive bidding ) . 
Many other policies and procedures can be enacted that reduce incentives for corruption . 
For example , some tax systems are more corruption-resistant than others , because they curtail the discretionary authority of tax officials . 
Third , the World Bank &apos;s primary responsibility is to fight poverty , which means that when it confronts a poor country plagued with corruption , its challenge is to figure out how to ensure that its own money is not tainted and gets to projects and people that need it . 
In some cases , this may entail delivering assistance through non-governmental organizations . 
Finally , while developing countries must take responsibility for rooting out corruption , there is much that the West can do to help . 
At a minimum , Western governments and corporations should not be complicit . 
Every bribe that is taken has a payer , and too often the bribe payer is a corporation from an advanced industrial country or someone acting on its behalf . 
Indeed , one reason for the so called &quot; natural resource curse &quot; Â­ - the fact that resource-rich countries do not , on average , do as well as resource-poor countries - is the prevalence of corruption , too often aided and abetted by companies that would like to get the resources they sell at discount prices . 
The US under President Jimmy Carter made an important contribution in passing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , which made bribery by American companies anywhere in the world illegal . 
The OECD &apos;s Convention on Bribery was another step in the right direction . 
Making all payments to governments transparent would bring further progress , and Western governments could encourage this simply by tying this requirement to tax deductibility . 
It is equally important to address bank secrecy , which facilitates corruption by providing corrupt dictators with a safe haven for their funds . 
In August 2001 , just before the terrorist attacks on America , the US government vetoed an OECD effort to limit secret bank accounts . 
While the government has since reversed its stance on bank secrecy for terrorists , it has not done so for corrupt officials . 
A strong stand by the World Bank would enhance its credibility in the war on corruption . 
Those who criticize the Bank &apos;s stance on corruption do not do so because they favor corruption . 
Some critics worry about corruption in the corruption agenda itself : that the fight will be used as a &quot; cover &quot; for cutting aid to countries that displease the US administration . 
Such concerns have found resonance in the seeming incongruity of the Bank &apos;s tough talk on corruption and simultaneous plans to expand lending to Iraq . 
No one is likely to certify that Iraq is corruption-free - or even ranks low on corruption internationally . 
The most strident criticism , however , comes from those who worry that the World Bank is straying from its mandate . 
Of course , the Bank must do everything that it can to ensure that its money is well spent , which means fighting both corruption and incompetence . 
On the contrary , it might merely divert attention from other issues of no less moment for those struggling to lift themselves out of poverty .
