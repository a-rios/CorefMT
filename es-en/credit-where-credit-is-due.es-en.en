Credit Where Credit is Due 
In the old days , when communist central planning suffocated China &apos;s economy , fixed-asset investment was the regime &apos;s measure of economic progress . 
The more tons of steel produced , slabs of concrete poured , and gallons of crude oil pumped out of the ground the better . 
The consumption-based economy , to which the capitalist West had apparently succumbed , was written off as a paper tiger . 
On the surface , nothing much has changed . 
China remains obsessed with investing -construction of factories and infrastructure accounted for 41 % of GDP and around half of economic growth in 2005 . 
Moreover , the country &apos;s continuing high levels of fixed-asset investment make sense - building roads , water pipes , metro systems , telecommunication networks , and electronics factories is what a vast and rapidly modernizing country must do . 
But the Communist Party leadership has decided that in the next decade hairdressers , accountants , karaoke hostesses , tour guides , and movie directors will be the new pillars of economic performance . 
As investment growth slows and export markets endure their unpredictable business cycles and protectionist moods , China will increasingly rely upon consumption for creation of jobs and income - and the service industry is where most consumption occurs . 
There is only one problem : Chinese people do not seem to want to consume , at least according to commonly cited data . 
National savings amounted to roughly 50 % of GDP in 2005 , which apparently means that households are so afraid of hospital bills , school fees , and the down-payment on the new apartment they dream of that they save every penny they earn . 
But that savings number hides something very critical . 
Chinese households do save a lot , about one quarter of their income . 
Indeed , private consumption in China has been growing in real terms at an annual rate of around 10 % for the last seven years . 
This means that getting Chinese households to spend more is not a hopeless mission . 
According to the credit card provider MasterCard , by 2010 China &apos;s middle class will number 100 million , each with discretionary spending of $ 5,590 , and 7.5 million affluent people , each with $ 13,500 to spend . 
If a decent credit culture can be created , people can have access to tomorrow &apos;s income today . 
People in their twenties could borrow money to buy a house , start a family , and go on holiday , paying the money back when they are in their fifties and would much rather stay at home and enjoy their grandchildren . 
Consumer credit began in China only in the late 1990 &quot; s , with regulations allowing banks to offer mortgage loans , which now amount to about 10 % of total loans . 
According to a recent survey by the People &apos;s Bank ( the central bank ) , households in the ten largest cities spend about 35 % of their monthly income on average on mortgage repayments , which is comparable to other countries . 
Loans for education and car purchases are now also possible , and 2 % of households have credit cards , which is obviously still low compared to 75 % in the United States , but there were no such households just five years ago . 
Although debit cards remain far more common , banks like China Merchants Bank have been aggressive in issuing real credit cards . 
A key problem with the credit card rollout is that the payment system is not yet in place . 
UnionPay , the market leader , is expensive for retailers to install , and many shops prefer cash to avoid tax . 
However , outstanding credit on cards is growing , more than quadrupling year on year in 2004 , to 0.18 % of GDP , according to the consulting firm McKinsey . 
Several other obstacles must nonetheless be surmounted in order to boost consumption . 
First , banks still have few reliable means of checking borrowers &quot; creditworthiness , including previous loans from other banks . 
Educational loans should be booming in urban and rural China , but banks do not know to whom to lend , so they are not . 
Second , banks are vulnerable to non-repayment . 
The car loan market underwent a mini-boom in 2003-04 , but non-repayment rates in excess of 50 % forced banks to pull back . 
The difficulty of repossession ( where did the borrower park the car ? ) and sale ( the used-car market is still in its infancy ) meant that most of these bad loans had to be written off . 
There is also a dark cloud over the mortgage market following a judgment by the Supreme People &apos;s Court in 2003 that banned the repossession of homes that are a primary residence . 
A recent revision of that decision permits banks to repossess homes , but only if they help arrange alternative lower-cost housing - an administrative nightmare for lenders , particularly if a lot of people start defaulting at the same time . 
Third , consumers are generally not adept at dealing with interest-rate risk . 
Nearly all mortgages have floating rates that vary with the five-year loan rate set by the People &apos;s Bank . 
However , late last year , Everbright Bank and some others began offering fixed-rate mortgages . 
Take-up has been slow , but the April 2006 surprise hike in bank rates may help to sow greater public awareness of interest-rate risk . 
Finally , China needs a greater diversity of financial products . 
Until recently , banks could offer only simple savings accounts . 
Securities investment funds now account for roughly 30 % of tradable stock market capitalization , although this represents only 0.9 % of GDP , compared to more than 5 % in India . 
The economic significance of new financial products is likely to grow more rapidly as foreign banks enter the market . 
If China &apos;s regulators issue the right licenses , the financial sector will play a key role in nurturing and sustaining the consumer society of tomorrow .
