A Moral Theory &apos;s Immoral Outcome 
PRINCETON - Is it always wrong to take an innocent human life ? 
Many philosophical defenders of the Roman Catholic natural-law tradition argue that there are no exceptions to this prohibition , at least if we are talking about taking the life intentionally , and directly , rather than as a side effect of some other action . 
( These moral theorists also define &quot; innocent &quot; to exclude enemy combatants , as long as the war one is fighting is just . ) 
When this view is combined - as it typically is in Catholic teaching - with the claim that every offspring of human parents is a living human being from the moment of conception , the implication is that abortion is never permissible . 
But the case of a 22-year-old El Salvadorian woman , identified in the media only as Beatriz , makes the absoluteness of that view very difficult to defend . 
Beatriz , the mother of a young son , suffers from lupus , an autoimmune disease , and other complications . 
Her first pregnancy was very difficult . 
Then she became pregnant again , and her doctors said that the longer the pregnancy continued , the greater the risk that it would kill her . 
For most women , that alone would be sufficient grounds to terminate the pregnancy . 
But Beatriz had an additional powerful reason to do so : the fetus had anencephaly , a condition in which the cerebral cortex , the part of the brain associated with consciousness , is absent . 
Almost all babies with this condition die soon after birth ; the few survivors are incapable of responding even to their mother &apos;s smile . 
In countries with prenatal screening and liberal abortion laws , anencephaly has become very rare , because almost all women who are told that they are carrying an anencephalic fetus choose to terminate the pregnancy . 
While traditionally Roman Catholic European countries like Italy and Spain have liberalized their abortion laws , Latin America has remained true to the faith , maintaining some of the world &apos;s strictest legal prohibitions . 
Last year , in the Dominican Republic , a 16-year-old girl with cancer was , for several weeks , refused chemotherapy because she was pregnant and the doctors worried that the potentially life-saving treatment might induce an abortion . 
Although the girl was later allowed to begin treatment , both she and the fetus died . 
In El Salvador , abortion is prohibited without exception . 
In April , Beatriz &apos;s doctors asked the courts to allow them to terminate her pregnancy on medical grounds , but were refused . 
On May 29 , the Supreme Court denied Beatriz &apos;s appeal . 
To anyone concerned about human well-being - or , for that matter , human flourishing in general - such an outcome makes no sense . 
Aborting an anencephalic fetus ends a life that may be human , insofar as it is the life of a member of the species Homo sapiens ; but it is a life that will have zero well-being , for the infant ( if it lives ) will be incapable of enjoying anything . 
On the other hand , not permitting Beatriz to have an abortion would risk causing the death of a young woman who desperately wanted to live , and had much to live for . 
It would also risk depriving her one-year-old son of his mother . 
After the Supreme Court &apos;s decision , El Salvador &apos;s health minister , Maria Rodriguez , announced that Beatriz would be permitted to undergo a &quot; premature Caesarean section , &quot; which she said was not an abortion , but an &quot; induced birth . &quot; 
If that was supposed to be a better outcome than an earlier termination of the pregnancy , it is hard to see for whom it was better . 
It was certainly not better for Beatriz , who is still in intensive care , and for whom the long-term health impact of the pregnancy remains unclear . 
And how did it benefit the anencephalic infant to have another couple of months of life in utero , and then five hours of life outside ? 
One point overlooked in the discussion of Beatriz &apos;s case is that the same Catholic natural-law theory that insists that killing an innocent human being is always wrong also provides a basis for arguing that it is not wrong to kill an anencephalic fetus . 
In innumerable texts , Catholic philosophers , theologians , and bioethicists argue that it is always wrong to kill innocent human beings , because , in contrast to nonhuman animals , they have a &quot; rational nature . &quot; 
Proponents of this argument use that term to include beings that are not yet capable of rationality but will become so in the normal course of their development . 
The use of the term &quot; being with a rational nature &quot; is very broad , perhaps too broad even when applied to normal fetuses . 
To apply it to anencephalic fetuses requires a further , and much more dubious , step . 
Thomas Aquinas , for instance , did not think that a rational nature is present in every member of the species Homo sapiens . 
He believed that some degree of development is necessary for the human animal to become a being with a rational nature . 
In the case of an anencephalic fetus , no such development is possible . 
It cannot become a rational being . 
For that reason , even those who believe that it is always wrong intentionally to kill an innocent being with a rational nature should not have opposed permitting Beatriz to terminate her pregnancy . 
They should have embraced a humane solution that minimized the risk of a tragic ending to a story that was already sad enough .
