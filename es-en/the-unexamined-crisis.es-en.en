The Unexamined Crisis 
CHICAGO - Three years have now passed since the collapse of Lehman Brothers , which triggered the start of the most acute phase of the 2007-2008 financial crisis . 
Is the financial world a safer place today ? 
Within days after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 , the US had erected new and enormous security measures at airports throughout the country . 
Within a month , the US military was on the ground in Afghanistan . 
Within three years the US had an official report on the causes of the events of 9 / 11 ; the well-resourced expert commission that produced it identified the weaknesses of America &apos;s national-security agencies and provided recommendations for addressing them . 
But what do we have three years after the financial crisis began ? 
To be sure , America has the 2,000-page Dodd Frank Act to show for its efforts . 
Unfortunately , few of those pages address any problem suspected to have caused the financial crisis . 
Bond investors &quot; heavy reliance on credit-rating agencies , which tend to be laxer with powerful issuers , has not been fixed . 
The shadow banking sector &apos;s dependence on the official banking sector &apos;s liquidity and guarantees , and thus ultimately on the government , has not even been touched . 
And limits on financial institutions &quot; leverage will change only in the next decade . 
The list of shortcomings goes on and on . 
Money-market funds &quot; perverse incentives to take on excessive risk remain largely intact . 
The most highly touted change - the separation between proprietary trading and commercial banking ( also known as the &quot; Volker rule , &quot; after former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volker ) - has nothing to do with what caused the crisis , and most likely was approved because it was ineffective . 
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , chaired by Phil Angelides , did produce a report on the crisis - in fact , three reports . 
By contrast , the Rogers Commission , which investigated the causes of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster , produced just one report . 
The best minds of the time , including the Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman , were part of the investigation , and no stone was left unturned in finding the cause . 
Ultimately , the culprit was precisely identified as a defective O-ring that became too stiff at low temperatures and caused a leak . 
To convince the public , Feynman demonstrated that conclusion with a televised experiment . 
Economics is not as precise a science as physics , but this cannot justify the failure of the Angelides Commission . 
With sufficient data , we do have methods to identify the likely causes of an economic phenomenon . 
The major limits are imposed by the availability of data , not by our methodologies . 
But the data were not made available , because the interested parties were ( and remain ) afraid to share it , knowing full well what would be revealed . 
Unfortunately , the Commission - composed mostly of elected officials , rather than experts - wasted its time in political squabbles . 
Its members could not agree even on how to define subprime mortgages and calculate how many such mortgages there were in the United States at the time of the crisis . 
A subsequent investigation into the work of the Commission was more thorough than the Commission &apos;s investigation of the crisis . 
After reading through the emails , a congressional report found evidence that the Commission &apos;s work was guided by politics rather than fact-finding . 
After all , the fixes had already been decided and approved , before any fact was found ; the Commission &apos;s focus was on supporting or discrediting ( depending on the commissioner &apos;s political party ) the Dodd / Frank legislation , rather than on establishing the truth . 
It was a great opportunity lost . 
With its subpoena power , the Angelides Commission could have collected and made available to researchers the data needed to answer many crucial questions about the crisis . 
Did companies that compensated their traders ( and not just their CEOs ) more highly take more risk ? 
Was financial institutions &quot; assumption of excessive risk the result of incompetence or stupidity , or was it a rational response to the implicit guarantee offered by the government ? 
Did the market see the spread of lax lending standards and price the relevant pools of loans accordingly , or was it fooled ? 
Who were the ultimate buyers of these toxic products , and why did they buy them ? 
How important a role was played by fraud ? 
These are the questions that needed to be answered . 
Unfortunately , they are likely to remain unanswered without a major mandatory disclosure of data . 
Barring that , there is the risk that we will find out what caused this crisis after the next one .
