Latin America \ u0027s Locust Years 
The bad news keeps coming in Latin America these days . 
Economic conditions worsen almost everywhere , social cohesion unravels and political instability mounts . 
Little wonder , since much of Latin America spent the last twenty years going nowhere . 
Assets were sold and national debts ballooned , but almost nothing lasting and beneficial was gained . 
Truly , these were years that the locusts ate . 
Over the past 20 years , annual per capita GDP growth in Latin America averaged 0.35 % . 
At that pace , an economy would need 200 years to double in size . 
In Asia , the standard of living doubles every decade . 
With such anemic growth , how can Latin America expect to compete in world trade except through ever shrinking wages ? 
Profound misgovernance , not bad luck , is to blame for economic stagnation . 
If Latin America does not change , it may increasingly look like Africa - a region of weak states with large informal economies and widespread poverty . 
Four factors have put it on this path . 
First , in Latin America &apos;s privatization gold rush , everything from public utilities to manufacturing companies went on the auction block . 
For a short time , asset sales helped balance national budgets , and also provided resources for sustaining consumption . 
In the end , the income from privatization delivered little in the way of better infrastructure or more competitive exports . 
Worse still , the sell-off of state assets was accompanied by massive external borrowing . 
In some cases , notably Argentina , borrowing by domestic buyers exhausted all available lines of credit . 
Other countries did not drop to Argentina &apos;s level , but creditworthiness is an issue almost everywhere in Latin America . 
Second , because reform has not delivered prosperity , the region has grown sick of reform . 
Capital inflows produced a wealth effect , but only while they lasted . 
When the money stopped flowing in , the wealth dried up . 
No sane politician will commit to another decade of structural reforms that will test the patience of ordinary Latin Americans beyond the limits of electoral survival . 
But without more and deeper reforms , there will be too few of the preconditions for economic growth that lure investment - without which no growth is possible . 
This development dilemma points to the third factor : ineffectual politics . 
Governments that operated along technocratic lines , and that viewed economic growth as a rising tide that lifts all boats , have vanished . 
In Argentina one bumbling president succeeds the next . 
Institutions are torn down , property rights are called into question , and a random and ever more corrupt redistribution effort is underway . 
Peru and Venezuela hardly look better ; 
Brazil may soon follow the same course . 
The popularity of Lula Ignacia da Silva and his team , who lead opinion polls in the run-up to Brazil &apos;s presidential election , serves as a warning that much of the Latin American public is prepared to reject traditional governments . 
Lula and his party are so far outside the mainstream of economic thought and policy that capital has already begun fleeing - even though the election is months away . 
In Mexico , democratization has brought greater stability , but this could well prove ephemeral . 
The peso is now grossly overvalued . 
If the external balance deteriorates further , the economy will be in for a hard landing . 
For all the good news about Mexico &apos;s infant democracy , its president is beginning to justify the early fears about him : no vision , no Congress to work with , and no team that knows what to do . 
The last factor is the desperately low rate of saving that is endemic in the Americas . 
Indeed , this is the bottom line economically , for where there is little saving , there is little investment - and little basis for capital accumulation and productivity growth . 
Venezuela now pines for the fat OPEC years of the 1970s - which it missed , because it neglected to develop its oil industry . 
Argentina &apos;s wealth is now vacationing in Miami , perhaps for good . 
Brazil and Mexico are prime examples of countries that sold assets and borrowed rather than saved . 
The contrast with Asia is arresting . 
Consider China , where the saving and investment rates are near 40 % , where the current account is in surplus and there is no public debt . 
Government institutions are market friendly and the population is well educated , disciplined , and flexible in its learning . 
Rewards for risk taking and initiative are immediate and highly motivating . 
To be sure , China remains a poor country . 
Its per capita GDP is only half that of Brazil . 
But with growth in China &apos;s coastal region running at possibly 15 % per year , who can seriously doubt that in 15 years it will surpass Brazil ? 
In China , for all of its massive problems , things continue to go right not least because of huge inflows of foreign direct investment and the imminent benefits of WTO membership . 
In Latin America , things continue to fall apart : governments backtrack on reform and the economy loses ground to the rest of the world . 
Latin America did well when soft money flowed in , but those times are largely over . 
So we should expect more bad economic , social , and political news in the years ahead . 
Demagogues like Venezuala &apos;s Hugo Chavez or Carlos Menem - an Argentine presidential candidate once again - may seem like a bad joke , but anyone who cares about Latin America &apos;s fate should not laughing .
