After the Greek Default 
CAMBRIDGE - The Greek government , the European Commission , and the International Monetary Fund are all denying what markets perceive clearly : Greece will eventually default on its debts to its private and public creditors . 
The politicians prefer to postpone the inevitable by putting public money where private money will no longer go , because doing so allows creditors to maintain the fiction that the accounting value of the Greek bonds that they hold need not be reduced . 
That , in turn , avoids triggering requirements of more bank capital . 
But , even though the additional loans that Greece will soon receive from the European Union and the IMF carry low interest rates , the level of Greek debt will rise rapidly to unsustainable levels . 
That &apos;s why market interest rates on privately held Greek bonds and prices for credit-default swaps indicate that a massive default is coming . 
And a massive default , together with a very large sustained cut in the annual budget deficit , is , in fact , needed to restore Greek fiscal sustainability . 
More specifically , even if a default brings the country &apos;s debt down to 60 % of GDP , Greece would still have to reduce its annual budget deficit from the current 10 % of GDP to about 3 % if it is to prevent the debt ratio from rising again . 
In that case , Greece should be able to finance its future annual government deficits from domestic sources alone . 
But fiscal sustainability is no cure for Greece &apos;s chronically large trade deficit . 
Greece &apos;s imports now exceed its exports by more than 4 % of its GDP , the largest trade deficit among eurozone member countries . 
If that trade gap persists , Greece will have to borrow the full amount from foreign lenders every year in the future , even if the post-default budget deficits could be financed by borrowing at home . 
Eliminating or reducing this trade gap without depressing economic activity and employment in Greece requires that the country export more and import less . 
That , in turn , requires making Greek goods and services more competitive relative to those of the country &apos;s trading partners . 
A country with a flexible currency can achieve that by allowing the exchange rate to depreciate . 
But Greece &apos;s membership in the eurozone makes that impossible . 
So Greece faces the difficult task of lowering the prices of its goods and services relative to those in other countries by other means , namely a large cut in the wages and salaries of Greek private-sector employees . 
But , even if that could be achieved , it would close the trade gap only for as long as Greek prices remained competitive . 
To maintain price competitiveness , the gap between Greek wage growth and the rise in Greek productivity - i.e. , output per employee hour - must not be greater than the gap in other eurozone countries . 
That will not be easy . 
Greece &apos;s trade deficit developed over the past decade because Greek prices have been rising faster than those of its trading partners . 
And that has happened precisely because wages have been rising faster in Greece , relative to productivity growth , than in other eurozone countries . 
To see why it will be difficult for Greece to remain competitive , assume that the rest of the eurozone experiences annual productivity gains of 2 % , while monetary policy limits annual price inflation to 2 % . 
In that case , wages in the rest of the eurozone can rise by 4 % a year . 
But if productivity in Greece rises at just 1 % , Greek wages can increase at only 3 % . 
Any higher rate would cause Greek prices to rise more rapidly than those of its eurozone trading partners . 
So Greece faces a triple challenge : the fiscal challenge of cutting its government debt and future deficits ; the price-level challenge of reducing its prices enough to wipe out the current trade gap ; and the wage-productivity challenge of keeping future wage growth below the eurozone average or raising its productivity growth rate . 
Ever since the Greek crisis began , the country has shown that it cannot solve its problems as the IMF and the European Commission had hoped . 
The countries that faced similar problems in other parts of the world always combined fiscal contractions with currency devaluations , which membership in a monetary union rules out . 
A temporary leave of absence from the eurozone would allow Greece to achieve a price-level decline relative to other eurozone countries , and would make it easier to adjust the relative price level if Greek wages cannot be limited . 
The Maastricht treaty explicitly prohibits a eurozone country from leaving the euro , but says nothing about a temporary leave of absence ( and therefore doesn &apos;t prohibit one ) . 
It is time for Greece , other eurozone members , and the European Commission to start thinking seriously about that option .
