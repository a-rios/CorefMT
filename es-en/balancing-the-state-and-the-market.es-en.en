Balancing the State and the Market 
BERLIN - The financial and economic crisis that erupted in 2008 will , in retrospect , be regarded as a transformative moment , because it raised fundamental questions about the future shape of our economic systems . 
These questions are not so much about the end of capitalism - as some perceive or even desire - but rather about the different ways in which capitalism is understood in different countries . 
What we are witnessing today is a reversal of the debates of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Back then , Ronald Reagan used to joke : &quot; The nine most terrifying words in the English language are : I &apos;m from the government and I &apos;m here to help ! &quot; 
Now that governments have spent trillions of dollars , euros , yen , and pounds on stabilizing financial markets and the economy in general , those words seem far less terrifying . 
In fact , faith in the market has been dented , while trust in government and regulation is increasing . 
After decades of consensus that the state should set the rules and otherwise leave the private sector alone , the state is now widely seen as a beneficial force that should play an active role in the economy . 
This is happening despite the lack of a clear indication of the superiority of the state . 
On the contrary , the US government &apos;s heavy intervention in the American housing market is probably the most pertinent example of the state &apos;s shortcomings , one that no doubt contributed significantly to the crisis . 
I sense a growing willingness to forego the benefits of innovation - not least financial innovation - in exchange for a slower pace of change , which is assumed to be more controllable . 
This shift will not only impede future growth , but could bring other dangers as well . 
The first danger is that the state overextends itself . 
The fiscal balances of the G-20 economies will deteriorate dramatically as a result of the crisis . 
Deficits will improve somewhat as economies recover and support measures are withdrawn . 
But not all of the measures are temporary or economically reasonable . 
Most governments have used their stimulus packages to serve vested interests as well . 
The accumulated debt will constitute a lasting burden on public finances . 
Moreover , we must remember that budgets were already strained before the crisis , and that governments &quot; balances do not reflect all aspects of reality . 
In Germany , for example , overall debt jumps from the current 65 % of GDP to 250 % when pension liabilities are included . 
Interest payments account for an ever-larger share of budgets - and will continue to grow when interest rates start to rise again . 
In the absence of strong political commitment and credible plans for gradual fiscal consolidation , there is a distinct risk that at some point sovereign yields will rise markedly - with negative implications for the economy and politics . 
The second danger is that governments will continue to see it as their duty to decide which firms to save and which to let fail . 
A line must be drawn between a time of crisis , when emergency measures are needed to avert economic collapse , and normal circumstances , in which the full force of market mechanisms applies . 
The instinct of governments , however , may be to revert to the idea of protecting national champions or reasserting national sovereignty in some sectors . 
But instinct is not necessarily a sound basis for decision-making . 
And in times of globalization , distinguishing between &quot; national &quot; and &quot; foreign &quot; is neither appropriate nor feasible . 
In order to preserve the state &apos;s ability to act while avoiding competitive distortions between and within industries , we should establish criteria to guide future decisions in this area . 
As a matter of principle , companies that were in trouble prior to a severe economic crisis should not be eligible for state assistance of the type that the world recently witnessed . 
Moreover , aid must be limited , lest firms become addicted to it . 
Governments should also be aware of the long-term costs : large-scale state interference in market processes will produce its own set of corporate winners and losers . 
Structural change may be delayed , depriving us of the opportunities offered by the crisis to build more competitive and dynamic industries - and accelerating the relative global decline of mature economies . 
Indeed , the third danger is that greater state intervention in the economy entails a shift away from globalization , paving the way for various forms of national protectionism . 
We can see this in the financial industry , where increased state ownership has led to a distinct danger of re-nationalization and re-fragmentation of financial markets . 
Many financial institutions that received government funds have concentrated on their respective home markets and scaled back their activities abroad . 
Similarly , there is a risk that new regulation may , either deliberately or as an unintended side effect , lead to re-nationalization of markets . 
It is understandable that governments seek solace in the presumed safety of national markets . 
But the shelter that national markets provide is illusory : the only way to increase the resilience of financial markets and to ensure that recurrence of this kind of crisis becomes less likely is to build a regulatory framework that is commensurate with integrated markets . 
We need global ( or at least European ) rules , and we need strong institutional structures to enforce these rules - a requirement that is not necessarily limited to the financial markets . 
We must resist the temptation to believe that a meddling , paternalistic state is the way of the future . 
Not only business , but also society as a whole , would lose out if we moved in that direction . 
Or , as has been said by many : &quot; A government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have . &quot;
