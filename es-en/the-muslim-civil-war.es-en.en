The Muslim Civil War 
Is the Sunni-Shia divide in the Middle East now deeper than the antagonism between Israel and the Arabs ? 
You might think so given the response of some Arab governments to Hezbollah &apos;s decision to attack Israel . 
Even as Israeli bombs fell on Beirut and Tyre , Saudi Arabia , perhaps the most conservative Arab Muslim state of all , openly condemned the actions of the Shia Hezbollah in instigating conflict with Israel . 
Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has a state that considers itself a leader of the Arab Muslim peoples backed Israel so openly . 
Moreover , Saudi Arabia &apos;s breach with Hezbollah is not a one-time occurrence . 
Egypt and Jordan have also roundly condemned Hezbollah and its leader , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , for their adventurism . 
What is behind this stunning development ? 
Are we seeing a fundamental shift in relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic sectarianism ? 
Is Saudi Arabia &apos;s Sunni government more concerned and frightened by Shia Islam than it is committed to Arab unity and the Palestinian cause ? 
Arab denunciations of Hezbollah suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide , already evident in the daily violence in Iraq , is deepening and intensifying across the Middle East . 
President George W. Bush &apos;s desire to shatter the Arab world &apos;s frozen societies was meant to pit the forces of modernization against the traditional elements in Arab and Islamic societies . 
Instead , he appears to have unleashed the region &apos;s most atavistic forces . 
Opening this Pandora &apos;s Box may have ushered in a new and even uglier era of generalized violence , perhaps what can only be called a &quot; Muslim Civil War . &quot; 
The Shia-Sunni divide has existed from the dawn of Islam , but the geographical and ethnic isolation of non-Arab Shiite Iran , together with Sunni Arab countries &quot; dominance of their Shia minorities , mostly kept this rivalry in the background . 
These tensions further receded in the tide of the &quot; Islamization &quot; created by the Iranian revolution , for in its wake Arabs &quot; sectarian identity as Sunni was pushed further into the background as a generalized &quot; Islamic &quot; assertiveness appeared . 
That all changed when Al Qaeda , a Sunni terrorist force that draws heavily on Saudi Wahabbi ideology and personnel , launched its attacks on America in September 2001 . 
A specifically Sunni brand of militant Islam was now on the march . 
When the United States initiated wars on both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime , this new radical Sunni strain became even more emboldened . 
The region &apos;s newly assertive Sunni Arabs perceive Israel and the West as being only one threat , the other comprising the so-called &quot; Shia crescent &quot; - the arc of land extending from Lebanon to Iran through Syria and Iraq that is inhabited by the allegedly heretical Shia . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s rulers , as custodians of the Muslim faith &apos;s holiest places in Mecca and Medina , perhaps feel this threat most keenly . 
In Sunni eyes , the Shia not only dominate the oil-rich areas of Iran , Iraq , and the eastern region of Saudi Arabia , but are - through the actions of Hezbollah - attempting to usurp the role of &quot; protector &quot; of the central dream of all Arabs , the Palestinian cause . 
It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Islam and doubts the loyalty of its Shia population that the Kingdom has turned on Hezbollah . 
Ironically , it is America , Saudi Arabia &apos;s longtime protector , which made Shia empowerment possible by overthrowing Saddam Hussein and bringing Shiite parties to power in Iraq . 
The Bush administration seems to recognize what it has done ; as the Shia arc rises in the east of the Arab Muslim world , the US is attempting to strengthen its protection of the Sunni arc - Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia - in the region &apos;s west . 
Israel , the once implacable enemy of the Arab cause , now seems to be slotted into this defensive structure . 
But such a defensive posture is bound to be unstable , due to pan-Arab feelings . Today , ordinary Saudi citizens are glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow events in Gaza and south Lebanon . 
They see Arab ( not Shiite ) blood being shed , with only Hezbollah fighting back . 
In their eyes , Hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance . 
This is causing the Saudi state to deepen the Sunni-Shia schism . 
Following the Kingdom &apos;s official denunciation of Hezbollah , the Saudi state called on its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as Shiite deviants and heretics . 
Such condemnations can only sharpen sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and the region . 
As these antagonisms deepen , will the Sunni regimes come to believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner ? 
If that is what they conclude , they need not look far , for many such fighters have already have been trained - by Al Qaeda .
