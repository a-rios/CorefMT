How Iran Is Winning 
TEL AVIV - In 2003 , the United States - which , along with its NATO allies , had already occupied Afghanistan - toppled Saddam Hussein &apos;s government in Iraq and overran his army . 
Iran &apos;s leaders , alarmed that they were being encircled , lost no time in offering the West a grand bargain covering all contentious issues , from nuclear-weapons development - they halted their military nuclear program - to regional security , including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and their backing of Hezbollah and Hamas . 
The recent framework agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program has had the opposite effect . 
Though the deal does slow Iran &apos;s development of nuclear weapons , it does not restrain - or even address - the regime &apos;s hegemonic ambitions in the region , for which it has already spent billions of dollars and suffered crippling sanctions . 
As a result , the framework agreement is creating strategic chaos in an already dysfunctional region . 
A future in which regional powers like Turkey , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia ( which has worked closely with Pakistan on the nuclear front ) possess threshold nuclear capabilities is becoming more likely that ever . 
These are glorious days for Iran . 
After more than a decade of diplomatic isolation and economic sanctions , its status as a threshold nuclear state has been internationally legitimized . 
Moreover , it has managed to compel the US to abandon its dream of regime change , and to coexist - and even engage - with an Islamic theocracy that it finds repugnant . 
The regional balance of power is already tilting in Iran &apos;s favor . 
In Lebanon , Palestine , and Syria , Iranian proxies have prevailed over Saudi-backed groups . 
And the Iran-backed Houthis remain in control of Yemen , despite Saudi airstrikes . 
Iran &apos;s leaders can thank George W. Bush . 
Far from producing the outcome that they feared in 2003 , Bush &apos;s wars in the Middle East left Iran as the most influential actor in Iraq . 
As Saudi officials have observed , Iranian militias fighting the Islamic State in predominantly Sunni regions north and west of Baghdad hope to reinforce their country &apos;s control over Iraq . 
The perceived threat posed by the Islamic State has also caused the US to drop ousting Syria &apos;s Bashar al-Assad , Iran &apos;s main regional ally , from its agenda . 
Indeed , the US has ended up indirectly allied with Hezbollah , a key Iranian proxy , which is fighting alongside Assad &apos;s troops against foreign jihadi forces . 
Meanwhile , America &apos;s relationship with its traditional Arab allies - the region &apos;s conservative Sunni regimes - is faltering , owing largely to US President Barack Obama &apos;s failure to respond effectively in the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings . 
Obama &apos;s offers of security guarantees and &quot; nuclear umbrellas &quot; have not been able to restore their trust . 
( Such security guarantees are , after all , implicit . ) 
For Iran &apos;s enemies , the message of the framework agreement is clear : protect your own vital interests , rather than waiting for the US . 
And that is precisely what countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia are doing , having established a joint Arab military force to fight Iranian influence in the region , as well as discreet security links with Israel , another self-declared victim of the framework agreement . 
Turkey is also engaging in strategic recalculations . 
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , who called Iran his &quot; second home &quot; during a visit to Tehran last year , recently accused the Islamic Republic of &quot; seeking to dominate the region . &quot; 
As a result , Turkey now finds itself collaborating with Saudi Arabia in backing the Al Nusra Front , the Syrian arm of Al Qaeda , which captured Idlib in the first major military setback for Assad in recent months . 
Still , Turkey &apos;s recent behavior - from Erdoğan &apos;s shocking call for an end to the Sykes-Picot system to its de facto collusion with the Islamic State &apos;s siege of the Kurdish town of Kobani , just over the border in Syria - has discouraged the region &apos;s major Sunni powers from pursuing closer ties . 
But no regional leader is as frantic - or as dangerous - as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu . 
In his vulgar use of Holocaust metaphors to portray the Iranian threat , he sounds more like the principal of a Jewish ghetto about to be annihilated by an agitated mob than the prime minister of the most powerful country in the Middle East . 
Netanyahu &apos;s lack of self-awareness is perhaps best exemplified in his interactions with Obama . 
He expects the US to offer Israel security assistance to face the challenge that Iran poses , even as he barges clumsily into Obama &apos;s political backyard and forges alliances with his domestic opponents . 
In fact , Netanyahu has fundamentally misunderstood the Iran challenge : It is not an existential threat , but part of a broader struggle for regional mastery . 
Rather than engaging in an unrealistic campaign to kill the nuclear agreement , Netanyahu should have been focusing on the strategic implications of Iran &apos;s rise . 
It is Iran &apos;s geopolitical behavior , not its threshold nuclear status , that matters . 
Of course , Netanyahu is intentionally exaggerating the Iranian threat to deflect attention from Israel &apos;s real problems - especially its enduring conflict with Palestine . 
But he can hope to obscure the sins of occupation only temporarily . 
If the Palestine issue is not resolved soon , there can be no lasting alliances with &quot; moderate &quot; Sunni powers to counter Iran . 
In order to bring some semblance of stability to the Middle East , the US must think beyond the framework nuclear agreement with Iran and develop , with all stakeholders , a collective security regime - an initiative that will require the US to regain the trust of its allies in the region . 
In reality , the key question has never been when Iran will develop a nuclear weapon , but how to integrate it into a stable regional system before it does .
