Rules for a Frugal Superpower 
WASHINGTON , DC - American foreign policy stands on the brink of substantial belt-tightening . 
The mounting expenses of servicing the growing national debt , combined with the skyrocketing costs of Social Security and Medicare as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation retires , will leave less money for American initiatives abroad . 
As I argue in my new book The Frugal Superpower : America &apos;s Global Leadership in a Cash-Strapped Era , the burden that these obligations will impose on Americans - in the form of higher taxes and fewer benefits - will weaken public support for the expansive international role that the United States has played since World War II . 
This will change the world , and not for the better . 
American foreign policy , for all its shortcomings , has underpinned political stability around the world . 
How , then , should the US adapt what it does abroad to minimize the damage to global security caused by its straitened circumstances ? 
Here are three rules for a frugal superpower . 
Rule I : No More Nation-building 
During the first two post-Cold War presidencies , the US conducted military interventions in Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , Kosovo , Afghanistan , and Iraq . 
The motives for these interventions varied , but all led to American efforts to establish working governments - nation-building - that proved protracted and frustrating . 
The relevant institutions cannot be built quickly and cannot be imported , ready-made , from abroad . 
For this reason , among others , the enterprise has not found favor with the American public . 
To its difficulty and unpopularity another drawback to nation-building must now be added : its expense . 
The US government will no longer be able to afford to invest hundreds of billions of dollars ( the cost in Iraq alone will run into the trillions ) trying to supply other people with decent government . 
Moreover , such projects make a far smaller contribution to US and global security and well-being than do other American foreign policies - policies that the US should make every effort to continue . 
Rule II : Concentrate on the Elephants 
&quot; Don &apos;t chase the rabbits , &quot; an old saying has it , &quot; because if you chase the rabbits , the elephants will kill you . &quot; 
Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia , Kosovo , Afghanistan , and even Iraq qualify as rabbits - distractions from what should be the focus of US foreign policy . 
The functional equivalents of elephants are Europe , East Asia , and the Middle East . 
These are three of the most important parts of the world , and in each the American military presence plays a constructive role . 
In the first two , the US reassures each of these region &apos;s countries that there will be no sudden change in the balance of power that will threaten them . 
In Europe , Germany can be confident that the US would help to contain an aggressive Russia , while Russia knows that Germany will remain tied to , and thus restrained by , the US . 
In East Asia , American air and naval forces provide a check on China , but also serve one of China &apos;s strategic interests by keeping Japan from conducting an independent military policy . 
To keep the peace in both regions , a continuing US military presence of some kind will be needed . 
Complete American withdrawal could lead to suspicion , arms races , and , in the worst case , wars among the countries of Europe and Asia . 
In the Middle East , the US confronts Iran , which seeks to expand its power by any means it can , to oust neighboring countries &quot; governments in favor of ideologically sympathetic forces , and ultimately to evict America from the region . 
Nuclear weapons would make the threat posed by the Iranian regime all the more severe . 
Indeed , containing Iran while thwarting its nuclear ambitions is the single most urgent priority for today &apos;s cash-strapped American superpower . 
Rule III : Raise the Gasoline Tax 
Iran &apos;s quest to dominate the Middle East threatens the world because the region accounts for so much of the oil on which the global economy depends . 
If the world used less oil , Iran would become less threatening , because its radical rulers rely on oil revenues to purchase domestic support and pursue their regional goals . 
Reducing oil revenues by using less oil would also weaken other international troublemakers , actual and potential - Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela , for example , and Vladimir Putin of Russia . 
Moreover , some of the money that the world pays for Saudi Arabia &apos;s oil finds its way into the coffers of terrorist organizations . 
No single measure would do more to make the world a less dangerous place than a substantial reduction in its consumption of oil . 
And no single measure would do more to reduce global oil consumption than a sharp increase in the tax on gasoline in the country that consumes more of it than any other : the US . 
If Americans had to pay more for gasoline , they would use less of it . With a high gasoline price , alternative sources of energy such as ethanol and alternative forms of transportation such as electrically powered automobiles would become commercially viable . 
None of this would happen immediately . 
In the short term , Americans would have to make modest economic sacrifices in the form of higher fuel prices . 
Such sacrifices , however , would be well worthwhile . 
They would help to ensure that , even in an era of retrenchment in American foreign policy , the world would continue to enjoy the most important benefits of the expansive foreign policy that the US can no longer afford .
