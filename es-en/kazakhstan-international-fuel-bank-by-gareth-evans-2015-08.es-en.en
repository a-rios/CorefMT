A Radioactive Bank to be Welcomed 
CANBERRA - One of the many things the world has learned from the Iran nuclear saga is that its leaders made a mistake , when negotiating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) in the 1960s , in not doing anything to constrain uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing . 
This failure apparently stemmed from the belief - long since proven wrong , certainly in the case of uranium - that the only states ever likely to possess that technical capability already possessed nuclear weapons , or ( like Germany ) were totally committed never to acquire them . 
As a result , any member state can argue for its &quot; inalienable right &quot; under the NPT to pursue any stage of the nuclear fuel cycle . 
Although any such right extends only to activities for &quot; peaceful purposes , &quot; the loophole is gaping . 
Any technically capable state - and there are now dozens of them - can build uranium enrichment facilities with the official purpose of producing fuel for nuclear power or research reactors , but which are nonetheless inherently capable of producing the much higher-grade fuel needed for nuclear weapons . 
It is not for nothing that such facilities have been described as &quot; bomb starter kits , &quot; and that Iran &apos;s progress down that path - whether deliberately designed to give it a latent weapons breakout capability or not - has spooked so many others in the international community . 
That is why there was so much pressure to produce the deal now on the table , which dramatically limits Iran &apos;s enrichment capability . 
While renegotiating the NPT itself to close the enrichment loophole seems for now a lost cause , there are other ways to address this proliferation risk . 
One of the most important , and long-advocated , strategies is to demonstrate to countries that rely on nuclear power , or are planning to develop it , that they do not need their own uranium-enrichment program to ensure their fuel supply &apos;s security . 
Concern about fuel-supply security has always been Iran &apos;s main publicly stated justification for acquiring its enrichment capability - a justification that its critics assert was manufactured simply to conceal a covert weapons agenda . 
Whether or not that is the case , all current and would-be nuclear power producers are entitled to be anxious about having an absolutely assured fuel supply , given the major economic and social consequences they would face in the event of a disruption . 
Yes , until now , the commercial nuclear-fuel market has worked well : no power reactor has had to shut down because of fuel-supply disruptions . 
But the cut-off of the supply of other energy resources ( notably Russia &apos;s disruption of natural-gas supplies to Ukraine and , by extension , to Western Europe ) has raised legitimate concerns about whether this could happen with nuclear fuel . 
Although the issue has been much debated , until now there has been only modest progress in developing fuel-supply assurance arrangements that would meet this concern . 
Russia , with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , maintains a sizeable reserve of low-enriched uranium ( LEU ) at its international center in Angarsk ; but , in the current security environment , there has been understandable international reluctance to rely on it . 
The United Kingdom has proposed a supply guarantee of its own , though it has so far attracted little attention . 
Now , in an important new development , to be officially launched this month ( on August 27 ) , Kazakhstan is establishing a major new international fuel bank , which it will operate on behalf of the IAEA . 
The new facility should once and for all remove the main excuse that has been advanced , sincerely or not , for building and maintaining homegrown enrichment capability . 
Scheduled to commence operations in 2017 , the Kazakh fuel bank will store up to 90 tons of LEU , sufficient to refuel three typical power-producing light water reactors . 
While Kazakhstan will physically operate the bank , the uranium will be owned and controlled by the IAEA , and made available to non-nuclear-weapon states if , for any reason , they cannot secure the LEU they need from the commercial market . 
Provided the state in question is in compliance with its comprehensive non-proliferation safeguards agreement with the IAEA , it can draw the required fuel from the bank and transfer it to a fuel fabricator to make fuel assemblies for the reactors involved . 
The Kazakh fuel bank has very wide and high-level international backing , helped by the country &apos;s credentials . 
A former nuclear test-site state , Kazakhstan willingly gave up the nuclear weapons on its territory when the opportunity arose with the dissolution of the Soviet Union , and it has been a strong and consistent advocate of nuclear arms control and disarmament ever since . 
The bank has been funded by voluntary contributions , including $ 50 million from the Nuclear Threat Initiative , a United States-based NGO , $ 49 million from the US government , up to $ 25 million from the European Union , $ 10 million each from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates , and $ 5 million from Norway . 
Aside from the Iran deal , good news on nuclear weapons has been sparse in recent years . 
The new Kazakh fuel bank is a significant step toward achieving a world free of nuclear weapons . 
Those who have worked to establish it deserve the world &apos;s gratitude .
