Global Risk and Reward in 2011 
NEW YORK - The outlook for the global economy in 2011 is , partly , for a persistence of the trends established in 2010 . 
These are : an anemic , below-trend , U-shaped recovery in advanced economies , as firms and households continue to repair their balance sheets ; a stronger , V-shaped recovery in emerging-market countries , owing to stronger macroeconomic , financial , and policy fundamentals . 
That adds up to close to 4 % annual growth for the global economy , with advanced economies growing at around 2 % and emerging-market countries growing at about 6 % . 
But there are downside and upside risks to this scenario . 
On the downside , one of the most important risks is further financial contagion in Europe if the eurozone &apos;s problems spread - as seems likely - to Portugal , Spain , and Belgium . 
Given the current level of official resources at the disposal of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union , Spain now seems too big to fail yet too big to be bailed out . 
The United States represents another downside risk for global growth . 
In 2011 , the US faces a likely double dip in the housing market , high unemployment and weak job creation , a persistent credit crunch , gaping budgetary holes at the state and local level , and steeper borrowing costs as a result of the federal government &apos;s lack of fiscal consolidation . 
Moreover , credit growth on both sides of the Atlantic will be restrained , as many financial institutions in the US and Europe maintain a risk-averse stance toward lending . 
In China and other emerging-market economies , delays in policy tightening could fuel a rise in inflation that forces a tougher clampdown later , with China , in particular , risking a hard landing . 
There is also a risk that capital inflows to emerging markets will be mismanaged , thus fueling credit and asset bubbles . 
Moreover , further increases in oil , energy , and commodity prices could lead to negative terms of trade and a reduction in real disposable income in net commodity-importing countries , while adding to inflationary pressures in emerging markets . 
Moreover , currency tensions will remain high . 
Countries with large current-account deficits need nominal and real depreciation ( to sustain growth via net exports while ongoing private- and public-sector deleveraging keeps domestic demand weak ) , whereas surplus countries ( especially emerging markets ) are using currency intervention to resist nominal appreciation and sterilized intervention to combat real appreciation . 
This is forcing deficit countries into real exchange-rate adjustments via deflation - and thus a rising burden of public and private debt that may lead to disorderly defaults . 
Furthermore , several major geopolitical risks loom , including military confrontation between North and South Korea and the lingering possibility that Israel - or even the US - might use military force to counter Iran &apos;s nuclear weapons program . 
There are also the political and economic turmoil in Pakistan and the risk of a rise in cyber-attacks - for example , in retaliation for criminal proceedings against WikiLeaks . 
In the US , slower private-sector deleveraging - given the fiscal stimulus from the extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months , the payroll-tax cut , and maintenance of current income-tax rates for another two years - could lull policymakers into assuming that relatively large fiscal and current-account imbalances can continue indefinitely . 
Finally , in the face of political opposition to fiscal consolidation , especially in the US , there is a risk that the path of least resistance becomes continued monetization of fiscal deficits . 
Eventually ( once the slack in goods and labor markets is reduced ) , this would push inflation expectations - and yield curves - higher . 
But there are also several upside risks . 
The US corporate sector is strong and very profitable , owing to massive labor shedding , creating scope for increased capital spending and hiring to contribute to more robust and above-trend GDP growth in 2011 . 
Similarly , the eurozone , driven by Germany , could lurch toward greater economic and political union ( especially some form of fiscal union ) , thus containing the problems of its periphery . 
Meanwhile , growth in Germany and the eurozone &quot; core &quot; may further accelerate given the strength of emerging markets , which may show even greater resilience , underpinning more rapid global expansion . 
The attenuation of downside risks and pleasant surprises in developed and emerging economies could lead to a further increase in demand for risky assets ( equities and credit ) , which would reinforce economic recovery via wealth effects and lower borrowing costs . 
Positive feedback from consumption to production , employment , and income generation - both within countries and across countries via trade channels - could further accelerate the pace of global growth , particularly if monetary policies in most advanced economies remain looser than expected , supporting asset reflation and thus demand and growth . 
Indeed , after four years ( 2007-2010 ) of either recession or sub-par recovery , the process of balance-sheet repair - while not completed yet - is underway , and may result in less saving and more spending to boost growth in advanced economies . 
The damage from the financial crisis is still ongoing , but stronger growth can heal many wounds , especially debt-driven wounds . 
So far , the downside and upside risks for the world economy are balanced . 
But if sound government policies in advanced and major emerging economies contain the downside risks that are more prevalent in the first half of this year - which derive from political and policy uncertainty - a more resilient global economic recovery could take hold in the second half of 2011 and into 2012 .
