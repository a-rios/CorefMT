Testing Obama &apos;s Foreign Policy 
CAMBRIDGE - Approaching the end of his first year as president , Barack Obama has taken a bold step in deciding to increase the number of American troops in Afghanistan to over 100,000 . 
Critics on the left point out that the Korean War crippled Harry Truman &apos;s presidency , just as the Vietnam War defined Lyndon Johnson &apos;s administration . 
Obama thus risks becoming the third Democratic president whose domestic agenda will be overshadowed by a difficult war . 
But critics on the right have complained that Obama &apos;s approach to foreign policy has been weak , too apologetic , and overly reliant on soft power . 
They worry about Obama &apos;s promise to begin withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan 18 months after the surge . 
Obama inherited a fraught foreign policy agenda : a global economic crisis , two 
Obama &apos;s dilemma was how to manage this difficult legacy while creating a new vision of how Americans should deal with the world . 
Through a series of symbolic gestures and speeches ( in Prague , Cairo , Accra , the United Nations , and elsewhere ) , Obama helped to restore American soft power . 
It is a mistake to discount the role that transformative leaders can play in changing the context of difficult issues . 
Power involves setting agendas and creating others &quot; preferences as well as pushing and shoving . 
That is why Obama &apos;s administration speaks of &quot; smart power &quot; that successfully combines hard and soft power resources in different contexts . 
But soft power can create an enabling rather than a disabling environment for policy . 
Critics contend that Obama has been all words and no deeds . 
They portray him as a rock star who won a Nobel prize on the basis of promise rather than performance . 
They scoff at his popularity , and note that the Middle East remains intractable , North Korea nuclear , Iraq and Afghanistan unsettled , and Iran difficult . 
But no serious analyst would expect otherwise in the short term . 
Bush and Cheney &apos;s hard-power approach certainly did not solve these problems . 
Moreover , in addition to words , there have been some important deeds . 
First and foremost was Obama &apos;s handling of the economic crisis . 
When he came into office , his economic advisors told him that there was a one-in-three chance of a 1930 &quot; s-style depression . 
If Obama had not avoided that disaster , all else would have paled in comparison . 
Success required not only an economic stimulus package at home , but international coordination . 
Despite US measures against imports of Chinese tires , the level of protectionism has been much lower than in the 1930 &quot; s and than many observers predicted . 
Moreover , Obama used the crisis to accomplish what many had suggested for years : transform the G-8 into a broader institutional framework of a G-20 that includes the major emerging economies . 
Closely related to the economic crisis has been Obama &apos;s handling of relations with China . 
How America responds to the rise of Chinese power is one of the most important foreign-policy challenges of the twenty-first century . 
Obama broadened the Treasury-led economic meetings to a strategic dialogue co-chaired by the State Department with an agenda that includes climate change as well as multilateral issues . 
Contrary to some skeptical press reports , Obama &apos;s summit meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao in November was a quiet success . 
At the same time , he has recognized that maintaining close alliances with Japan and Australia - and good relations with India - helps to maintain the hard-power capabilities that shape the environment for a rising China . 
A third significant accomplishment of Obama &apos;s first year has been to reframe the issue of nuclear non-proliferation , which many experts regarded as being in crisis at the end of the Bush era . 
By embracing the long-term goal of a non-nuclear world ( though perhaps not in his lifetime ) , Obama reiterated America &apos;s long-standing commitment , written into Article 6 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty , to reduce the role of nuclear weapons . 
Moreover , he followed up by negotiating with Russia a successor to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty by the end of this year , and has moved the non-proliferation issue to the top of the agenda at the UN and the G-20 . 
Critics charge that these accomplishments , as well as efforts to unblock the stalemates in Sudan and Burma , have been achieved at the price of giving up moral clarity on human rights . 
But public proclamations are often less effective than long-term strategies in promoting human rights . 
Obama &apos;s speech in Ghana , carefully located in an African country that recently had a successful democratic change of government , illustrated such an approach . 
Other critics on the left have complained that he has not been able to get Congress to pass a tough energy bill before the Copenhagen conference on climate change . 
But Obama has helped to persuade China and India to announce useful efforts , and he will set an American target of reducing greenhouse emissions that should prevent the conference from being a failure . 
Of course , the big test lies ahead in Afghanistan . 
Can Obama combine hard and soft power into a smart-power strategy that works ? 
Will the increase in American and allied troops , and the increases in development aid produce enough stability for his planned withdrawal to begin in 2011 ? 
Can the Afghan government begin to provide the security that will protect its citizens against Taliban violence ? 
Or will Afghanistan prove to be a quagmire that defines Obama &apos;s presidency ? 
As Obama approaches the end of his first year in office , he must know that Afghanistan will be the major test according to which future historians will grade his foreign policy .
