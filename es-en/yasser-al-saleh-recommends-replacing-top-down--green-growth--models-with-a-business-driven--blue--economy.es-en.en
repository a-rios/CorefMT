Blue is the New Green 
ABU DHABI - In recent years , an increasingly loud chorus of environmentalists , civil-society actors , and international institutions have been demanding that conventional &quot; brown &quot; economic development , which depends on fossil fuels , be replaced by a lower-carbon &quot; green &quot; growth model . 
The fact is that most environmentally friendly technologies demand significant upfront investment , meaning that &quot; going green &quot; remains a privilege reserved for the few countries that can afford it . 
After all , governments &quot; capacity to provide subsidies is limited , and wealthy countries cannot be expected to bear the costs of the uptake of sustainable technologies worldwide . 
Thus , as the United Nations recently confirmed , more than a billion people worldwide still lack access to reliable , clean , and affordable energy . 
The blue economy - a concept developed by the Belgian economist Gunter Pauli - is powered less by investment and more by innovation , with a focus on creating jobs , building social capital , and generating multiple cash flows by stimulating entrepreneurship and the development of new business models . 
The blue economy is centered on the idea that companies should use all available resources and increase efficiency to develop a portfolio of related businesses that benefit both them and society . 
Consider the Swedish company Solarus AB , whose innovative business model - manufacturing solar panels out of carbon fibers discarded by the aerospace industry - has enabled it to offer competitively priced solar technologies , without support from government subsidies . 
The fact that solar technologies can be produced locally from recycled materials , Pauli argues , means that governments should not provide solar-related subsidies and bailouts - the costs of which eventually land on taxpayers . 
The blue economy would also help to resolve the intermittency problem inherent in solar- or wind-power systems . 
Even after the needed technologies are deployed widely , additional investment in power storage or a back-up energy would be needed . 
Given that an abundant hydropower backup supply would not be an option everywhere , businesses would have to find ways to employ the energy and resources available locally . 
It is not difficult to discern the potential benefits - for businesses and communities alike - of matching a set of seemingly disparate problems with the efficient use of locally available resources . 
Companies simply must be willing to develop bold and creative new business models that change the rules of the game . 
For example , the production of coffee - a coffee company &apos;s only revenue stream - typically requires only 0.2 % of the coffee plant . 
Instead of discarding the remaining 99.8 % , the company could , say , grow mushrooms and , with the waste from that process , create a protein-rich livestock feed , which could also be converted into a natural source of energy . 
Nuru Energy put this kind of innovation into practice , developing a human-powered cycle that provides clean power across Africa using recyclable plastic parts and locally available materials . 
Likewise , in the United Kingdom , Cyndi Rhoades launched &quot; Worn Again , &quot; which produces fashionable products from unusual recycled materials like scrap leather from car seats , parachutes , and prison blankets . 
Of course , the idea of reusing materials within continuous closed loops to extract their maximum value is not a new one . 
A report in 2012 by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimated that the circular economy concept could save the European Union alone $ 380 billion annually in materials for medium-lifespan consumer durables such as cars , furniture , and household electric appliances . 
The second and third volumes of the report estimated that the world could save as much as $ 700 billion each year on single-use consumer goods like packaged food and beverages . 
Incorporating such loops into the broader framework of the blue economy would bring even greater benefits . 
As the world heads toward catastrophic levels of resource depletion and environmental degradation , calls for a new economic model - whether green , blue , circular , or something else -will only grow louder . 
The proliferation of information technology and social media means that it is easier than ever for entrepreneurs to tap into a large pool of finance - not to mention contacts and expertise - from small investors . 
Of the roughly 500 crowdfunding platforms that now exist , several specifically target clean technologies . 
Last May , Eureeca.com took the crowdfunding concept further than ever , creating the first truly global crowd-investing marketplace that offers equity in funded companies . 
If used wisely , such platforms could take up the slack created by governments &quot; fiscal constraints to facilitate the entrepreneurial innovations needed to build the blue economy . 
Other increasingly prominent trends - such as collaborative consumption , pay per use , and sharing and leasing models - could offer similarly powerful impetus to these efforts . 
Given the impracticality - financial and otherwise - of relying on top-down solutions , the creation of a cleaner economy should rely on visionary entrepreneurs who can transform challenges into opportunities . 
Sustainability begins at the grass roots .
