The Moral Vulnerability of Markets 
LONDON  -  
Today , there seems to be no coherent alternative to capitalism , yet anti-market feelings are alive and well , expressed for example in the moralistic backlash against globalization . 
Because no social system can survive for long without a moral basis , the issues posed by anti-globalization campaigners are urgent - all the more so in the midst of the current economic crisis . 
It is hard to deny some moral value to the market . 
After all , we attach moral value to processes as well as outcomes , as in the phrase &quot; the end does not justify the means . &quot; 
It is morally better to have our goods supplied by free labor than by slaves , and to choose our goods rather than have them chosen for us by the state . 
The fact that the market system is more efficient at creating wealth and satisfying wants than any other system is an additional bonus . 
Moral criticisms of the market focus on its tendency to favor a morally deficient character type , to privilege disagreeable motives , and to promote undesirable outcomes . 
Capitalism is also held to lack a principle of justice . 
Consider character . 
It has often been claimed that capitalism rewards the qualities of self-restraint , hard-work , inventiveness , thrift , and prudence . 
On the other hand , it crowds out virtues that have no economic utility , like heroism , honor , generosity , and pity . 
( Heroism survives , in part , in the romanticized idea of the &quot; heroic entrepreneur . &quot; ) 
The problem is not just the moral inadequacy of the economic virtues , but their disappearance . Hard work and inventiveness are still rewarded , but self-restraint , thrift , and prudence surely started to vanish with the first credit card . 
In the affluent West , everyone borrows to consume as much as possible . 
America and Britain are drowning in debt . 
Adam Smith wrote that &quot; consumption is the sole end and purpose of production . &quot; 
But consumption is not an ethical aim . 
It is not positively good to have five cars rather than one . 
You need to consume in order to live , and to consume more than you strictly need in order to live well . 
This is the ethical justification for economic development . 
From the ethical point of view , consumption is a means to goodness , and the market system is the most efficient engine for lifting people out of poverty : it is doing so at a prodigious rate in China and India . 
But this does not tell us at what point consumption tips us into a bad life . 
If people want more pornography or more drugs , the market allows them to consume these goods to the point of self-destruction . 
It oversupplies some goods that are morally harmful , and undersupplies goods that are morally beneficial . 
For quality of life , we have to rely on morals , not markets . 
No doubt it is unfair to blame the market for bad moral choices . 
People can decide when to stop consuming or what they want to consume . 
But the market system relies on a particular motive for action - Keynes called it &quot; love of money &quot; - which tends to undermine traditional moral teaching . 
The paradox of capitalism is that it converts avarice , greed , and envy into virtues . 
We are told that capitalism discovers wants that people did not realize they had and thus moves humanity forward . 
But it is truer to say that the market economy is sustained by the stimulation of greed and envy through advertising . 
In a world of ubiquitous advertising , there is no natural limit to the hunger for goods and services . 
The final moral issue is capitalism &apos;s lack of a principle of justice . 
In a perfectly competitive market , with full information , models of the market show that all the factors of production receive rewards equal to their marginal products , i.e. , all are paid what they are worth . 
The full competition and information requirements ensure that all contracts are uncoerced ( there is no monopoly power ) and all expectations are fulfilled , i.e. , people get what they want . 
Justice in distribution is supposedly secured by justice in exchange . 
But no actually existing capitalist market system spontaneously generates justice in exchange . 
There is always some monopoly power , insiders have more information than outsiders , ignorance and uncertainty are pervasive , and expectations are frequently disappointed . 
Justice in exchange has to be supplied from outside the market . 
Moreover , the endowments that people bring with them to the market include not just their own innate qualities , but their starting positions , which are radically unequal . 
That is why the liberal theory of justice demands at a minimum equality of opportunity : the attempt - as far as is compatible with personal liberty - to eliminate all those differences in life chances arising from unequal starting points . 
As a result , we rely on the state to provide social goods like education , housing , and health care . 
Finally , the claim that everyone is - under ideal conditions - paid what they are worth is an economic , not a moral , valuation . 
It does not conform to our moral intuition that a CEO should not be paid 500 times the average wage of his workers , or to our belief that if someone &apos;s market-clearing wage is too low to support life , he should not be allowed to starve to death . 
As our societies have become richer , we have come to believe that everyone is entitled to a minimum standard , whether in work or sickness or unemployment , which allows for a continuing level of comfort and flourishing . 
The market system does not guarantee this . 
While the market today has no serious challenger , it is morally vulnerable . 
It has become dangerously dependent on economic success , so that any large-scale economic failure will expose the shallowness of its moral claims . 
The solution is not to abolish markets , but to re-moralize wants . 
The simplest way of doing this is to restrict advertising . 
This would prune the role of greed and envy in the operation of markets , and create room for the flourishing of other motives .
