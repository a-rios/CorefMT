How Accurate Are Your Pet Pundits ? 
Every day , experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents , Bolivian coca growers , European central bankers , and North Korea &apos;s Politburo . 
But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts ? 
The sanguine view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously for the attention of discriminating buyers ( the mass media ) , market mechanisms will assure quality control . 
Pundits who make it into newspaper opinion pages or onto television and radio must have good track records ; otherwise , they would have been weeded out . 
Skeptics , however , warn that the mass media dictate the voices we hear and are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices . 
As a result , fame could be negatively , not positively , correlated with long-run accuracy . 
Until recently , no one knew who is right , because no one was keeping score . 
But the results of a 20-year research project now suggest that the skeptics are closer to the truth . 
I describe the project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment : How good is it ? 
How can we know ? 
The basic idea was to solicit thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries , and then score the predictions for accuracy . 
We find that the media not only fail to weed out bad ideas , but that they often favor bad ideas , especially when the truth is too messy to be packaged neatly . 
The evidence falls into two categories . 
First , as the skeptics warned , when hordes of pundits are jostling for the limelight , many are tempted to claim that they know more than they do . 
Boom and doom pundits are the most reliable over-claimers . 
Between 1985 and 2005 , boomsters made 10-year forecasts that exaggerated the chances of big positive changes in both financial markets ( e.g. , a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 36,000 ) and world politics ( e.g. , tranquility in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa ) . 
They assigned probabilities of 65 % to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15 % of the time . 
In the same period , doomsters performed even more poorly , exaggerating the chances of negative changes in all the same places where boomsters accentuated the positive , plus several more ( I still await the impending disintegration of Canada , Nigeria , India , Indonesia , South Africa , Belgium , and Sudan ) . 
They assigned probabilities of 70 % to bleak scenarios that materialized only 12 % of the time . 
Second , again as the skeptics warned , over-claimers rarely pay penalties for being wrong . 
Indeed , the media shower lavish attention on over-claimers while neglecting their humbler colleagues . 
We can see this process in sharp relief when , following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin , we classify experts as &quot; hedgehogs &quot; or &quot; foxes . &quot; 
Hedgehogs are big-idea thinkers in love with grand theories : libertarianism , Marxism , environmentalism , etc . 
Their self-confidence can be infectious . 
That wins them media acclaim . 
But they don &apos;t know when to slam the mental brakes by making concessions to other points of view . 
They take their theories too seriously . 
The result : hedgehogs make more mistakes , but they pile up more hits on Google . 
Eclectic foxes are better at curbing their ideological enthusiasms . 
They are comfortable with protracted uncertainty about who is right even in bitter debates , conceding gaps in their knowledge and granting legitimacy to opposing views . 
They sprinkle their conversations with linguistic qualifiers that limit the reach of their arguments : &quot; but , &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; although . &quot; 
Because they avoid over-simplification , foxes make fewer mistakes . 
Foxes will often agree with hedgehogs up to a point , before complicating things : &quot; Yes , my colleague is right that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable , but remember that coups are rare and that the government commands many means of squelching opposition . &quot; 
Imagine your job as a media executive depends on expanding your viewing audience . 
Whom would you pick : an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the likeliest outcome is more of the same , or an expert who gets viewers on the edge of their seats over radical Islamists seizing control and causing oil prices to soar ? 
In short , the qualities that make foxes more accurate also make them less popular . 
At this point , uncharitable skeptics chortle that we get the media we deserve . 
But that is unfair . 
No society has yet created a widely trusted method for keeping score on the punditocracy . 
Even citizens who prize accuracy have little way of knowing that they are sacrificing it when they switch channels from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs . 
Here , then , is a modest proposal that applies to all democracies : the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the trade-offs between accuracy and entertainment , or between accuracy and party loyalty . 
Wouldn &apos;t they be more likely to read pundits with better track records ? 
If so , pundits might adapt to accountability by showing more humility , and political debate might begin to sound less shrill . 
Granted , it is not easy to create methods of keeping score that are credible across the spectrum of reasonable opinion . 
But in a world where , as Yeats said , &quot; and the best lack all conviction , while the worst are full of passionate intensity , &quot; it is worth trying .
