What Next in Afghanistan ? 
BERLIN - Afghanistan &apos;s future does not look good . 
The Taliban are gaining military and political strength , and President Hamid Karzai is losing support at home and internationally due to his administration &apos;s rampant corruption and the obvious fraud committed in his re-election . 
Weariness with the war is spreading in the United States , where President Barack Obama finds it difficult to decide about an increase in troops , as demanded by his own generals . 
European NATO members with troops in Afghanistan would prefer to withdraw them today rather than tomorrow . 
The West seems to have lost its orientation in the Hindu Kush - that &quot; graveyard of empires , &quot; as it was called after the British disaster in January 1842 , when only one man survived an expedition 16,000 . 
What , many people are asking , is NATO really fighting for in Afghanistan ? 
Europe remains silent on that question and has only one aim : to get out . 
In the US , the debate about the purposes being served in Afghanistan is at least still taking place . 
Follow it , and you will conclude that , ultimately , the war is all about the American superpower &apos;s military victory over the Taliban , so that it can finally withdraw its troops - for a second time . 
The source or meaning of the conflict in Afghanistan is impossible to find in the country itself . 
Afghanistan is the battlefield , but the causes of the wars that have devastated it since the mid-1970 &quot; s were and are still to be found beyond its borders . 
So an exclusively &quot; Afghan solution &quot; is not possible . 
Three dates are central to understanding today &apos;s Afghan quagmire : 1989 , 2001 , and 2003 . 
In 1989 , when the Cold War ended , the Red Army had already withdrawn from the country , thereby admitting its defeat . 
Following the Soviet Union , the US withdrew from the conflict , too , and at that moment , the second Afghan war started - a proxy war between regional neighbors over power in the Hindu Kush , disguised as a civil war . 
Supported by Saudi Arabia , Pakistan sought strategic depth against its arch-enemy India with the help of militant religious students from Afghan refugee camps . 
These &quot; Taliban &quot; were created and equipped by the Pakistani secret service , the ISI . 
Iran defended its own interests and those of the Shia minority in the west of the country . 
And in the north , the Tajik Northern Alliance and Abdul Rashid Dostum &apos;s Uzbek militia were supported and equipped by Afghanistan &apos;s northern neighbors and Russia . 
In the shadow of this second Afghan war , Osama bin Laden established his terrorist organization in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan : Al Qaeda , which , on September 11 , 2001 , carried out its terrible terrorist attack on the US . 
A month later , the current war in Afghanistan started . 
In March 2003 , George W. Bush launched his invasion of Iraq , not only squandering America &apos;s military strength , but also connecting all the individual crises between the eastern Mediterranean and the Indus Valley . 
As a result of America &apos;s foreign-policy folly , Iran became the central geo-political player in the entire region , linking the western and eastern part of this long belt of instability . 
So , those who are grappling with the Afghan riddle today should consider , first and foremost , the regional realities : can the West afford to withdraw ? 
If so , we should pull out of Afghanistan immediately . 
If not , we should stop discussing an &quot; exit strategy . &quot; 
The cost of the West &apos;s retreat from this troubled region is predictable , since we must deal with several threats that endanger Western security , and that would not disappear with withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan : terrorism , Islamist radicalism , nuclear threats ( Pakistan , Iran ) , proxy wars and regional conflicts ( Israel-Palestine , Iraq , Afghanistan , and Kashmir ) , and looming disintegration ( Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and in the longer term in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula ) . 
This means that we cannot talk about withdrawing our troops , but only of redrawing the battle line farther West . 
It is extremely doubtful that such a step would bring more security . 
On the other hand , the West &apos;s strategy in Afghanistan up to now has also yielded little progress , only strengthening the Taliban day by day . 
So what should we do ? 
First , we need to define a clear political goal : a stable status quo in Afghanistan that will prevent the country from again becoming a battlefield of regional interests and an organizational base for Al Qaeda . 
Without a sufficient military presence , as well as improved and reinforced reconstruction efforts , this goal is not attainable . 
Second , a renewed regional consensus on Afghanistan &apos;s future would also help avoid further destabilizing nuclear-armed Pakistan . 
( The Kashmir conflict must , indirectly , play a role in this settlement , but the difficulties of including it should not be underestimated . ) 
Forging this consensus will not be an easy diplomatic task . 
Third , a parallel effort at crisis containment - and perhaps even at finding solutions - is needed for the wider Middle East , Iraq , the Persian Gulf , and Iran . 
It &apos;s an equation with very many known unknowns , but if we do not try at least to mitigate these issues , the known unknowns will continue challenging all partial solutions . 
But the big question remains whether the US and its European allies still have the strength , perseverance and far-sightedness for such an undertaking . 
There are good reasons to doubt this . 
The alternative would be a chaotic and dangerous future in this large hot spot . 
Afghanistan may seem far away , but its chaos and violence are in fact just next door .
