Alarm Bells in Asia 
NEW DELHI - The deteriorating situation in Ukraine and rising tensions between Russia and the United States threaten to bury US President Barack Obama &apos;s floundering &quot; pivot &quot; toward Asia - the world &apos;s most vibrant ( but also possibly its most combustible ) continent . 
Obama &apos;s tour of Japan , South Korea , Malaysia , and the Philippines will do little to rescue the pivot or put his regional foreign policy on a sound footing . 
In fact , Russia &apos;s aggression in Ukraine is just the latest reason that the pivot - which has been rebranded as a &quot; rebalancing &quot; - has failed to gain traction . 
A slew of other factors - including America &apos;s foreign-policy preoccupation with the Muslim world , Obama &apos;s reluctance to challenge an increasingly assertive China , declining US defense outlays , and diminished US leadership on the world stage - were already working against it . 
The reality is that rising anxiety among Asian countries about China &apos;s increasingly muscular foreign policy has presented the US with an important opportunity to recapture its central role in the region by strengthening old alliances and building new partnerships . 
But the US has largely squandered its chance , allowing China to continue to broaden its territorial claims . 
Indeed , over the last two years , America &apos;s Asian allies and partners have received three jarring wake-up calls , all of which have delivered the same clear message : the US cannot be relied upon to manage China &apos;s rise effectively . 
The first such signal came in the form of Obama &apos;s silence when China seized the disputed Scarborough Shoal from the Philippines in July 2012 . 
The move - which established a model for China to annex other disputed territories - occurred despite a US-brokered deal for a mutual withdrawal of Chinese and Philippine vessels from the area . 
Obama &apos;s apparent indifference to America &apos;s commitment to the Philippines under the 1951 mutual-defense treaty , which it reaffirmed in 2011 , encouraged China to seize the Second Thomas Shoal , which is also claimed by the Philippines . 
America &apos;s Asian allies received a second wake-up call when China unilaterally established an air defense identification zone ( ADIZ ) covering territories that it claims ( but does not control ) in the East China Sea - a dangerous new precedent in international relations . 
China then demanded that all aircraft transiting the zone - whether headed for Chinese airspace or not - submit flight plans in advance . 
Instead of demonstrating its disapproval by postponing Vice President Joe Biden &apos;s trip to Beijing , the US government advised commercial airlines to respect China &apos;s self-declared ADIZ . 
Japan , by contrast , told its carriers to disregard China &apos;s demand - an indication of the growing disconnect in US-Japanese relations . 
The third wake-up call comes from Ukraine . 
The US has responded to Russia &apos;s illegal annexation of Crimea by distancing itself from the &quot; Budapest Memorandum , &quot; the pact that US President Bill Clinton signed in 1994 committing the US to safeguard Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity in exchange for relinquishing its nuclear arsenal . 
The first two wake-up calls highlighted the Obama administration &apos;s unwillingness to do anything that could disrupt its close engagement with China , a country that is now central to US interests . 
The third was even more ominous : America &apos;s own vital interests must be directly at stake for it to do what is necessary to uphold another country &apos;s territorial integrity - even a country that it has pledged to protect . 
The world is witnessing the triumph of brute power in the twenty-first century . 
Obama was quick to rule out any US military response to Russia &apos;s Crimea takeover . 
Likewise , as China has stepped up efforts to upend the regional status quo - both territorial and riparian - the US has dithered , doing little to reassure its jittery Asian allies . 
Instead , the US has pursued a neutral course , which it hopes will enable it to avoid being dragged into a military confrontation over countries &quot; conflicting territorial claims . 
To this end , the US has addressed its calls for restraint not only to China , but also to its own allies . 
But America &apos;s own restraint - whether in response to Russia &apos;s forcible absorption of Crimea or to China &apos;s creeping , covert warfare - has brought no benefits to its allies . 
In fact , its efforts to avoid confrontation at all costs could inadvertently spur game-changing - and potentially destabilizing - geopolitical developments . 
Most important , America &apos;s sanctions-driven policy toward Russia is likely to force the Kremlin to initiate its own pivot toward Asia - particularly toward energy-hungry , cash-rich China . 
At the same time , a showdown with Russia will compel the US to court China more actively . 
In a new Cold War scenario , China would thus be the big winner , gaining a wide diplomatic berth to pursue its territorial ambitions . 
While the US propitiates China , countries like Japan , India , the Philippines , and Vietnam are being forced to accept that they will have to contend with Chinese military incursions on their own . 
That is why they are stepping up efforts to build credible military capabilities . 
This trend could lead to the resurgence of militarily independent Asian powers that remain close strategic friends of the US . 
In this sense , they would be following in the footsteps of two of America &apos;s closest allies - the United Kingdom and France - which have built formidable deterrent capacities , rather than entrust their security to the US . 
This would be a game-changing development for Asia , the US , and the entire world .
