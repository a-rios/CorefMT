Europe &apos;s Politics of Dystopia 
TOKYO - The recent victory of the conservative Law and Justice ( PiS ) party in Poland confirms a recent trend in Europe : the rise of illiberal state capitalism , led by populist right-wing authoritarians . 
Call it Putinomics in Russia , Órbanomics in Hungary , Erdoğanomics in Turkey , or a decade of Berlusconomics from which Italy is still recovering . 
Soon we will no doubt be seeing Kaczyńskinomics in Poland . 
All are variations on the same discordant theme : a nationalist leader comes to power when economic malaise gives way to chronic and secular stagnation . 
This elected authoritarian then starts to reduce political freedoms through tight-fisted control of the media , especially television . 
Then , he ( so far , it has always been a man , though France &apos;s Marine Le Pen would fit the pattern should she ever come to power ) pursues an agenda opposing the European Union ( when the country is a member ) or other institutions of supra-national governance . 
He will also oppose free trade , globalization , immigration , and foreign direct investment , while favoring domestic workers and firms , particularly state-owned enterprises and private business and financial groups with ties to those in power . 
In some cases , outright nativist , racist parties support such government or provide an even deeper authoritarian and anti-democratic streak . 
To be sure , such forces are not yet in power in most of Europe . 
In Germany , the Netherlands , Finland , Denmark , Austria , and Sweden , too , the popularity of populist , anti-EU , anti-migrant right-wing parties is on the rise . 
Most of these parties tend to be socially conservative . 
Indeed , just as many supporters of radical leftist parties in the 1930s made a U-turn and ended up supporting authoritarian parties of the right , the economic ideologies of today &apos;s populist parties seem to converge in many ways . 
In the 1930s , economic stagnation and depression led to the rise of Hitler in Germany , Mussolini in Italy , and Franco in Spain ( among other authoritarians ) . 
Today &apos;s brand of illiberal leaders may not yet be as politically virulent as their 1930s predecessors . 
The reemergence of nationalist , nativist populism is not surprising : economic stagnation , high unemployment , rising inequality and poverty , lack of opportunity , and fears about migrants and minorities &quot; stealing &quot; jobs and incomes have given such forces a big boost . 
The backlash against globalization - and the freer movement of goods , services , capital , labor , and technology that comes with it - that has now emerged in many countries is also a boon to illiberal demagogues . 
If economic malaise becomes chronic , and employment and wages do not rise soon , populist parties may come closer to power in more European countries . 
Worse , the eurozone may again be at risk , with a Greek exit eventually causing a domino effect that eventually leads to the eurozone &apos;s breakup . 
Or a British exit from the EU may trigger European dis-integration , with the additional risks posed by the fact that some countries ( the UK , Spain , and Belgium ) are at risk of breaking up themselves . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , the Great Depression brought to power authoritarian regimes in Europe and even Asia , eventually leading to World War II . 
Today &apos;s resurgence of illiberal state capitalist regimes and leaders is nowhere close to inciting a war , because center-right and center-left governments still committed to liberal democracy , enlightened economic policies , and solid welfare systems still rule most of Europe . 
This rising tide of illiberalism makes avoiding a break-up of the eurozone or the EU ever more vital . 
Only bold policies can halt Europe &apos;s slide toward secular stagnation and nationalist populism . 
Timidity of the type witnessed in the past five years will only increase the risks . 
Failure to act decisively now will lead to the eventual failure of the peaceful , integrated , globalized , supra-national state that is the EU , and the rise of dystopian nationalist regimes . 
The contours of such places have been reflected in literary work such as George Orwell &apos;s 1984 , Aldous Huxley &apos;s Brave New World , and Michel Houellebecq &apos;s latest novel Submission . 
Let us hope that they remain confined to the printed page .
