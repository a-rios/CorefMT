Crippling Coalitions 
Tony Blair &apos;s re-election in Britain last year was a landslide victory for New Labor , giving his party an unassailable majority in Britain &apos;s House of Commons . 
Gerhard Schröder just scraped across the finish line with an overall majority in the German Bundestag , due to the help of his unloved coalition partner , the Greens , and a few &quot; additional seats &quot; that the electoral system &apos;s rules provide . 
Which statement is true and which is false ? 
Strangely , each statement is both true and false . 
An astonishing fact about Prime Minister Blair &apos;s Labor Party is that it secured 2 % less of the popular vote in 2001 than in 1997 , and ended up with just over 40 % of the total . 
Schröder &apos;s Social Democrats also lost 2 % of the popular vote compared with 1998 , and ended up with a little less than 40 % of the total . 
Moreover , by winning 38.5 % of a turnout of 80 % , Schröder could claim the support of one-third of the electorate , whereas Blair was elected by a mere quarter ( 40 % of a turnout of 60 % ) . 
The difference between these two center-left leaders is not their electoral success , but the electoral system under which they operate . 
The British first-past-the-post electoral system provided Blair with a solid majority , whereas the German system of modified proportional voting gives Schröder plus his Green partners a bare ( and possibly shaky ) majority . 
Electoral systems are an evergreen issue of political debate , yet these two examples raise the question anew . 
There is much to be said - once again - for the British system . 
By translating relative electoral majorities into absolute parliamentary majorities , it enables winning parties to govern rather than enter into permanent negotiations with coalition partners and scramble constantly for parliamentary majorities . 
But is the British system fair ? 
It clearly does not turn parliament into a mirror image of the electorate . The &quot; Thatcher Revolution &quot; was never supported by more than 43 % of those who voted . 
( Incidentally , an even smaller proportion of the American electorate explicitly supported the &quot; Reagan Revolution &quot; in the US . ) 
Mr Blair can use his 40 % to join the US in its approach to Iraq , and also to spread the doctrine of &quot; Public Private Partnerships &quot; at home . 
Both policies have vocal opponents , not least among his own 40 % . 
Yet both Blair and Thatcher were able to take bold decisions and implement them . 
Notwithstanding powerful adversaries both within and outside parliament , for a crucial period political leaders can take determined , decisive action that is regarded as legitimate in the sense that public support outweighs opposition . 
The day will come , however , when the balance tips the other way . 
In the US , a wise constitutional amendment forces even popular presidents to retire after two terms . 
In the absence of such a rule , Mrs Thatcher was reduced to tears when her party told her that she had to go . 
It remains to be seen how Mr Blair will fare , not least in connection with the Euro Referendum . 
In the meantime , however , the electoral system makes decisive action possible - and appreciated by the electorate . 
This is not the case under proportional representation . 
It is often said that Germany in particular needs what one former German president called a push ( Ruck ) to mobilize the dormant forces of its people . 
A stagnating economy , high unemployment , an increasingly unaffordable welfare state , will hardly be reformed by a coalition permanently worried about its shaky parliamentary majority .

But is it right to suspend the democratic interplay of government and opposition in order to solve major problems ? 
Conversely , is it fair to the electorate if reforms are shelved whenever clear political majorities go missing ? 
Some might argue that at a time when even major parties can no longer hope to gain the support of more than 50 % of the electorate , it is important that parliament reflects the variety of views held by the people who elect it . 
However , the counter argument is stronger . 
One major purpose that elections serve is to translate popular views into political action . 
This requires parliaments that can both legislate and govern . 
As long as it remains possible to remove those in power by peaceful means , such as elections , the translation of relative majorities into strong governments is preferable to weak coalitions with numerical majorities . 
Electoral systems do not change underlying social forces nor do they guarantee any particular outcome . 
Britain has had periods of immobility and stagnation ( in the 1950s and 1970s ) , and Germany has experienced significant change under quantitatively weak government coalitions ( Konrad Adenauer &apos;s post-1949 administration and Willi Brandt &apos;s after 1969 ) . 
Still the case for a system that encourages change and opposition rather than stagnation and consensus is strong . 
Of course , the main obstacle to electoral reform is the need to persuade those whose jobs depend on maintaining the status quo .
