Is Cold War II Underway ? 
TOKYO - President Hu Jintao &apos;s visit to Washington is coming at an increasingly tense moment in Sino / American relations . 
Indeed , mesmerized by China &apos;s vast military buildup , a new constellation of strategic partnerships among its neighbors , and America &apos;s revitalized commitment to Asian security , many shrewd observers suggest that 2010 saw the first sparks of a new Cold War in Asia . But is &quot; Cold War II &quot; really inevitable ? 
Although appeasing China &apos;s drive for hegemony in Asia is unthinkable , every realistic effort must be made to avoid militarization of the region &apos;s diplomacy . 
After all , there was nothing very cold about the Cold War in Asia . 
First in the Chinese civil war , and then in Korea , Indonesia , Malaysia , and Indochina - particularly Vietnam - the Cold War raged not as an ideological / propaganda battle between rival superpowers , but in dogged , often fratricidal combat that cost millions of lives and retarded economic development and political democratization . 
It is this grim history that makes China &apos;s current disregard for Deng Xiaoping &apos;s maxim that China &quot; disguise its ambition and hide its claws &quot; so worrying for Asian leaders from New Delhi to Seoul and from Tokyo to Jakarta . 
From its refusal to condemn North Korea &apos;s unprovoked sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan and shelling of South Korean islands , to its claims of sovereignty over various Japanese , Vietnamese , Malay , and Filipino archipelagos and newly conjured claims on India &apos;s province of Arunachal Pradesh , China has revealed a neo-imperial swagger . 
So it should surprise no one that &quot; containment &quot; is coming to dominate Asian diplomatic discourse . 
But it is wrong - at least for now - to think that a formal structure of alliances to contain China is needed in the way that one was required to contain the Soviet Union . 
Containment , it should be recalled , was organized against a Soviet totalitarian regime that was not only ideologically aggressive and in the process of consolidating its colonization of Eastern Europe ( as well as Japan &apos;s Northern Territories ) , but also deliberately sealed off from the wider world economy . 
Today &apos;s China is vastly different . 
Overt military imperialism of the Soviet sort has , at least historically , rarely been the Chinese way . 
Sun Tzu , the great Chinese theorist of warfare , focused on the weakening of an adversary psychologically , not in battle . 
Until recently , much of China &apos;s bid for regional hegemony reflected Sun &apos;s concepts . 
More importantly , China abandoned economic autarky three decades ago . Today , its economic links in Asia are deep , and - it is to be hoped - permanent . 
China &apos;s export machine sucks in vast quantities of parts and components for final assembly from across Asia - Thailand , Malaysia , the Philippines , and Indonesia , as well as richer Singapore , Taiwan , South Korea , and Japan . 
Membership of the World Trade Organization has helped to bind China to highly sophisticated pan-Asian production networks . 
Everybody has benefited from these ties . 
Throughout China &apos;s three-decade rise from poverty to economic juggernaut , trade within East Asia has grown even faster than the region &apos;s trade with the rest of the world , suggesting deeper specialization and integration . 
Indeed , China &apos;s rise has profoundly altered the course of Asia &apos;s trade flows . 
Japan no longer focuses on exporting finished goods to Europe and North America , but on exporting parts and components for assembly in China . 
In turn , Japan now imports from China finished goods ( such as office machines and computers ) that once came from America and Europe . 
Given that as many as half of China &apos;s 1.3 billion people remain mired in abject poverty , it is in China &apos;s interest to ensure that these economic relationships continue to flourish . 
In the past , China has recognized the vital need for good neighborly relations . 
During the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 , Chinese officials did not engage in competitive devaluation of the renminbi . 
Unfortunately , such clear-sighted and responsible policymaking is a far cry from what we are seeing today . China &apos;s dizzying increase in its military capacity is another obvious source of concern in Asia . 
But , even according to the highest estimates , China &apos;s military budget is only now about equal to that of Japan and , of course , much less than the combined military budgets of Japan , India , and Russia , all of which border China - not to mention Indonesia , South Korea , and a militarily modernizing Taiwan . 
Moreover , Russia and India possess nuclear weapons , and Japan has the technological wherewithal to reconfigure its defense posture to meet any regional nuclear threat . 
So the challenge that China poses today remains predominantly political and economic , not military . 
The test of China &apos;s intentions is whether its growing economic and , yes , military capacities will be used to seek to establish Asian hegemony by working to exclude America from the region and preventing regional partnerships from flourishing . 
The alternative is a China that becomes part of a cooperative effort to bind Asia in a rules-based system similar to that which has underpinned long-term peace in Europe . 
In this sense , Asia &apos;s rise is also a test of US competitiveness and commitment in Asia . 
America &apos;s historical opposition to hegemony in Asia - included as a joint aim with China in the Shanghai Communiqu√© of 1972 - remains valid . 
It will have to be pursued , however , primarily by political and economic means , albeit backed by US power . 
Before 2010 , most Asian countries would have preferred not to choose between China and the US . 
In 2011 we may begin to see whether those incentives lead China &apos;s rulers to re-appraise their diplomatic conduct , which has left them with only the corrupt , basket case economies of Burma and North Korea as reliable friends in Asia .
