Pakistan &apos;s Moral-Hazard Economy 
LAHORE - Hillary Clinton &apos;s just-concluded visit to Islamabad - for the second session of the strategic dialogue that she and her Pakistani counterpart , Shah Mehmood Qureshi , launched in Washington earlier this year - brought some comfort to her hosts . 
The United States promised to provide $ 500 million of funding for several &quot; highly visible &quot; projects in Pakistan . 
The day before Clinton arrived in Islamabad , the Friends of Democratic Pakistan met there . 
An earlier meeting of the group was chaired by Obama on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in New York last year . 
It was attended by then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain , the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , and government ministers from several countries . 
At the Islamabad meeting , the FDP agreed to provide finance for Pakistan &apos;s energy-development program , and requested proposals from the Pakistanis for the development of other sectors considered vital for the economy . 
A few days before that , President Asif Ali Zardari paid his fifth visit to Beijing since taking office in August 2008 - this one a state visit - and received pledges of support for developing nuclear power and constructing a railway line over the Karakoram mountain range , linking the two countries . 
These promises and pledges underscore Islamabad &apos;s growing dependence on foreign assistance , which is not surprising , given that Pakistan &apos;s tax-to-GDP ratio has declined to less than 9 % , the lowest among the 22 largest emerging economies . 
They also suggest the continuance of a sort of moral-hazard approach to economic management that ensures foreign help whenever the country drives itself to the edge of an abyss . 
Today , Pakistan is Asia &apos;s worst-performing economy . 
Its GDP growth rate of 3 % is half that of Bangladesh and one-third that of India . 
Pakistan does well when it receives large flows of foreign assistance , as in the 1960 &quot; s , during President Ayub Khan &apos;s term in power , the 1980 &quot; s , when General Zia-ul-Haq ran the country , or the early 2000 &quot; s , when General Pervez Musharraf was in charge . 
During these three periods of military rule , the country was able to align itself quickly with the US . 
In the 1960 &quot; s , America wanted Pakistan to be on its side as it sought to contain the spread of communism in Asia . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , the US wanted Pakistan to help it force the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan . 
After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the US wanted Pakistan to help end Taliban rule in Afghanistan . 
Now , for the first time , the US is providing large amounts of assistance to a democratic government . 
Will this relationship help Pakistan get off the economic rollercoaster it has been riding for the last half-century ? 
To ensure that its economy &apos;s performance is no longer dictated by the availability of foreign aid , Pakistan must undertake some fundamental restructuring . 
If carried out by a representative government , such economic reforms have a better chance of being sustained . 
On the other hand , there is no assurance that the right policies would be maintained if power once again passed to a military ruler . 
The foreign governments that are currently engaging Pakistan should encourage its leaders to move forward on at least two related fronts : trade and better relations with India are crucial . 
At independence more than 60 years ago , Pakistan had a larger trade-to-GDP ratio , owing in part to trade with India . 
That came to a sudden stop in 1949 , as a result of the first of many trade wars that the two countries have fought . 
Before 1949 , India absorbed roughly 60 % of Pakistan &apos;s exports and accounted for 70 % of its imports . 
Nowadays , India accounts for less than 5 % of Pakistan &apos;s total trade turnover . 
This is contrary to what would be predicted by the so-called gravity model of trade , which is based on both the size of the trading partner and its distance . 
According to this model , China and India , not the US , should be Pakistan &apos;s largest trading partners . 
Thus , Pakistan should not devote so much of its energy to improving its access to the US textile market , as it now does . 
Another area of emphasis for donor dialogue with Pakistan is governance - not just reducing and controlling corruption , but also bringing policymaking closer to the people . 
Long stretches of military rule , with its emphasis on command and control , has left policymaking in Pakistan highly centralized . 
More power needs to be devolved to the provinces . 
Today &apos;s democratic government has taken a step in this direction by amending Pakistan &apos;s constitution . 
The country &apos;s &quot; friends &quot; should encourage this effort , perhaps by requiring that the country &apos;s provinces be given a voice in their dialogue with Zardari &apos;s government . 
Foreign donors must insist that Pakistan reform its economy in order to escape the moral hazard implied by continued dependence on aid flows .
