Asia &apos;s Overlooked Great Power 
Mention Asia , and most people think of the region &apos;s fascinating , rising giants , China or India - or both . 
Or people think about North Korea &apos;s nuclear program , some terrorist incident , or the humanitarian consequences of the latest earthquake or tsunami . 
But often overlooked - or at least underestimated - is Japan . 
This is odd , given that Japan is still the world &apos;s second largest economy , with a GDP of $ 5 trillion - more than China and India combined . 
Despite Japan &apos;s relatively modest rate of economic growth , its GDP per capita is roughly $ 38,000 , more than ten times that of either China or India . 
Moreover , there are important stirrings in Japan that suggest change on both the economic and security fronts . 
The 1990 &quot; s may have been a lost decade , but Japan &apos;s economy has begun to recover , now growing at more than 2 % a year and boasting several firms that are truly global and hugely successful . 
Changes in foreign and defense policy are more considerable . 
Japan &apos;s self-defense agency was upgraded in January to a full ministry . 
Japan now spends more than $ 40 billion a year on defense and maintains one of the world &apos;s most diverse and modern militaries . 
Approximately 1,000 Japanese forces serve in and around Iraq . 
Intellectuals , journalists , and politicians are now saying and writing things about Japan &apos;s role in the world that were unthinkable a decade ago . 
It is a question of when , not if , the Japanese amend Article IX of their constitution , which limits the role of Japan &apos;s armed forces to self-defense . 
Not everyone will welcome these changes . 
Japan &apos;s neighbors , who continue to harbor concerns stemming from World War II and Japan &apos;s failure to deal adequately with its history , will worry about Japanese nationalism . 
Nevertheless , a more active and more capable Japan , with a robust democracy and a thriving economy , is in its neighbors &quot; best interests . 
The danger is not renewed Japanese militarism , but rather a Japan that is unable and unwilling to do its share to meet the regional and global challenges facing Asia . 
Japan , for its part , needs to continue to open and reform its economy , improve its military , and make its forces available for the sort of low-intensity but manpower-intensive missions , ranging from genocide prevention to nation-building to peacekeeping , that are increasingly required in the greater Middle East and Africa . 
Japanese leaders also need to act with sensitivity . 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is off to an uneven start . 
On one hand , he is wise not to have visited the Yasukuni shrine , which honors millions of Japan &apos;s war dead , including 14 Class A war criminals . 
On the other hand , Abe &apos;s public statements denying Japan &apos;s coercion of &quot; comfort women &quot; in China and Korea have been clumsy at best , insensitive at worst . 
It is essential that Japan and China forge a modern relationship . 
The increasing frequency of high-level visits - Prime Minister Abe went to China in October , and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was just in Japan - is a welcome development . 
But more is needed . 
Trade and investment flows can and should be expanded , which is likely only if political relations improve . 
Both countries should commit themselves to a diplomatic resolution of competing claims to offshore resources . 
Exchanges of every kind - military , educational , touristic - should be facilitated . 
The world also needs to take into account Japan &apos;s importance . 
Japan should no longer be denied fair treatment because of events more than 60 years ago . 
There is no reason Japan should not hold a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council . 
Japan should also be a full participant in Asian regional arrangements . 
Asia is rich in dynamism , but relatively thin in influential political , economic , and security-related institutions , in contrast to Europe , which often lacks dynamism but is institution-heavy . 
The Franco-German relationship , central to much twentieth-century conflict , now forms the core of modern Europe . 
The goal should be the same for China and Japan . 
The agenda is virtually limitless , including trade and investment , energy and climate change , and confidence-building in the security sphere . 
A new regional institution could be based on an existing one ( such as the six-party arrangement used to manage North Korea &apos;s nuclear challenge ) or start afresh . 
Moreover , just as the United States continues to play a major role in Europe , so , too , should it act as a guarantor of Asia &apos;s stability and a source of regional prosperity . 
The US-Japan alliance is central to America &apos;s position in Asia . 
The goal is not to enlist Japan in any anti-Chinese coalition , but rather to increase the depth and breadth of US-Japanese cooperation . 
Both countries have many reasons to pursue this goal , considering North Korea &apos;s missile and nuclear programs , terrorism , and the numerous challenges to stability around the world . 
Abe &apos;s visit to Washington in late April is an opportunity to continue to modernize a relationship conceived in an earlier geopolitical era . 
It is to be hoped that it will not be overshadowed by calls in Congress for Japan to apologize more formally than it already has for the comfort women . 
Rather , the focus should be on the future and on welcoming the emergence of a Japan that is increasingly able and willing to act as a partner of the US in addressing regional and global challenges .
