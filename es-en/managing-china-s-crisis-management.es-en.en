Managing China &apos;s Crisis Management 
BEIJING - China &apos;s &quot; Central Economic Work Meeting , &quot; comprising top government decision makers , recently chose to continue the expansionary fiscal and monetary policy launched in the last quarter of 2008 . 
But it also called for greater emphasis on transforming China &apos;s development pattern and rebalancing its economic structure . 
The move thus signaled the start - well ahead of other countries - of China &apos;s &quot; exit &quot; from crisis-driven economic policies . 
Indeed , China should accelerate its change of course . 
While expansionary policies have succeeded in ensuring a V-shape recession , their medium and long-term effects are worrisome . 
First , China &apos;s crisis management has made its growth pattern , marked by massive investment demand , even more problematic . 
China &apos;s investment rate is extremely high in comparison with other major economies , and has been increasing steadily since 2001 , creating first overheating and then overcapacity . 
Until the global financial / economic crisis that began in 2008 , however , strong export performance concealed China &apos;s overcapacity problem , which , thanks to the stimulus package , is now set to become more serious . 
Indeed , China &apos;s investment rate may have surpassed 50 % in 2009 . 
Second , China &apos;s external imbalance may also worsen . 
Trade and exports accounted for 67 % and 37 % of the country &apos;s GDP , respectively , before the global crisis , but have since fallen significantly . 
And yet reliance on external demand remains fundamentally unchanged , even as the contribution of net exports to GDP growth has turned negative . 
In fact , worsening overcapacity , together with all the many types of price distortions still in place , may push Chinese enterprises to boost production for export markets , like the United States , where protectionist tendencies are likely to intensify in 2010 and onwards . 
Third , China &apos;s financial stability and fiscal position may deteriorate in the medium term . 
The government , well aware of the overcapacity problem , focused the country &apos;s stimulus package on investment in infrastructure , rather than new factories . 
But infrastructure is a long-term investment , revenues from which will be lower without accompanying investment in manufacturing capacity . 
An eight-lane highway must carry traffic to generate tolls . 
Moreover , due to hasty and poorly supervised implementation , waste in infrastructure construction can be serious . 
With an investment rate of 50 % and a GDP growth rate of 8 % , the incremental capital-output ratio could be higher than six , compared to 4.1 in 1991-2003 , implying not only low efficiency , but also the possibility of a significant increase in nonperforming loans . 
Finally , monetary policy has been far too loose . 
Unlike the US , China did not suffer from a liquidity shortage and a credit crunch during the global financial crisis . 
Thus , low interest rates and non-market interference , rather than demand from enterprises , fueled explosive credit growth in the first half of 2009 , surpassing the full-year target . 
If commercial banks had been allowed to base lending decisions solely on economic considerations , credit and money supply would have grown more slowly , limiting the risk of rising bad-loan ratios , stalled enterprise reform , inflationary pressure , and a resurgence of asset bubbles as excess liquidity enters equity and real-estate markets . 
Indeed , China &apos;s housing prices have been skyrocketing in recent months . 
The government was too generous in helping revive real-estate demand , and , overwhelmed by fear of the negative impact of falling asset prices on economic growth , has been too cautious in dealing with bubbles when they have reappeared . 
With the housing sector accounting for 10 % of GDP and investment in real-estate development accounting for 25 % of total fixed investment , any decision to rein in runaway housing prices will be difficult . 
All in all , the negative impact of the Chinese government &apos;s crisis-management measures on China &apos;s long-term growth may be serious if the authorities fail to tackle the economy &apos;s structural problems head on . 
But it is also worth noting that the government is well aware of the problems , and has begun to take measures to put structural adjustment back at the top of the policy agenda . 
In 2010 , for example , the government may seek to stimulate domestic consumption by making income distribution more favorable to the household sector relative to the enterprise sector , and by providing more public goods to reduce households &quot; precautionary savings . 
Certainly , without a more equitable income distribution , official talk of creating a &quot; harmonious society &quot; will sound empty . 
Furthermore , the government should continue to eliminate price distortions by creating more flexible mechanisms , including for the exchange rate . 
The government &apos;s goal should be to succeed not only in reviving the economy , but also in reversing the deterioration of China &apos;s structural problems , thereby laying a solid foundation for economic growth in the future . 
In this respect , the Chinese have good reason to be optimistic , for their country has defied predictions of economic demise repeatedly over the past three decades .
