The Unaccountable G-8 
NEW YORK - In hosting the 2010 G-8 summit of major economies ( Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States ) , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper called for an &quot; accountability summit , &quot; to hold the G-8 responsible for the promises that it made over the years . 
So let &apos;s make our own account of how the G-8 did . 
The answer , alas , is a failing grade . 
The G-8 this year illustrates the difference between photo-ops and serious global governance . 
Of all of the G-8 &quot; s promises over the years , the most important was made to the world &apos;s poorest people at the 2005 G-8 Gleneagles Summit in Scotland . 
The G-8 promised that , by this year , it would increase annual development assistance to the world &apos;s poor by $ 50 billion relative to 2004 . 
Half of the increase , or $ 25 billion per year , would go to Africa . 
The G-8 fell far short of this goal , especially with respect to Africa . 
Total aid went up by around $ 40 billion rather than $ 50 billion , and aid to Africa rose by $ 10- $ 15 billion per year rather than $ 25 billion . 
The properly measured shortfall is even greater , because the promises that were made in 2005 should be adjusted for inflation . 
Re-stating those commitments in real terms , total aid should have risen by around $ 60 billion , and aid to Africa should have risen by around $ 30 billion . 
In effect , the G-8 fulfilled only half of its promise to Africa - roughly $ 15 billion in increased aid rather than $ 30 billion . 
Much of the overall G-8 increase in aid went to Iraq and Afghanistan , as part of the US-led war effort , rather than to Africa . 
Among G-8 countries , only the UK is making a bold effort to increase its overall aid budget and direct a significant portion to Africa . 
Since the G-8 was off track in its aid commitments for many years , I long wondered what the G-8 would say in 2010 , when the commitments actually fell due . 
In fact , the G-8 displayed two approaches . 
First , in an &quot; accountability report &quot; issued before the summit , the G-8 stated the 2005 commitments in current dollars rather than in inflation-adjusted dollars , in order to minimize the size of the reported shortfall . 
Second , the G-8 Summit communiqu√© simply did not mention the unmet commitments at all . 
In other words , the G-8 accountability principle became : if the G-8 fails to meet an important target , stop mentioning the target - a cynical stance , especially at a summit heralded for &quot; accountability . &quot; 
The G-8 did not fail because of the current financial crisis . 
Even before the crisis , the G-8 countries were not taking serious steps to meet their pledges to Africa . 
This year , despite a massive budget crisis , the UK government has heroically honored its aid commitments , showing that other countries could have done so if they had tried . 
But isn &apos;t this what politicians like to do - smile for the cameras , and then fail to honor their promises ? 
I would say that the situation is far more serious than that . 
First , the Gleneagles commitments might be mere words to politicians in the rich world , but they are matters of life and death for the world &apos;s poor . 
If Africa had another $ 15- $ 20 billion per year in development aid in 2010 , as promised , with the amounts rising over future years ( also as promised ) , millions of children would be spared an agonizing death from preventable diseases , and tens of millions of children would be able to get an education . 
Second , the emptiness of G-8 leaders &quot; words puts the world at risk . 
The G-8 leaders promised last year to fight hunger with $ 22 billion in new funds , but so far they are not delivering . 
They promised to fight climate change with $ 30 billion of new emergency funds , but so far they are not delivering . 
My own country , the US , shows the largest gap between promises and reality . 
Hosting this year &apos;s G-8 summit reportedly cost Canada a fortune , despite the absence of any significant results . 
The estimated cost of hosting the G-8 leaders for 1.5 days , followed by the G-20 leaders for 1.5 days , reportedly came to more than $ 1 billion . 
This is essentially the same amount that the G-8 leaders pledged to give each year to the world &apos;s poorest countries to support maternal and child health . 
It is absurd and troubling to spend $ 1 billion on three days of meetings under any circumstances ( since there are much cheaper ways to have such meetings and much better uses for the money ) . 
But it is tragic to spend so much money and then accomplish next to nothing in terms of concrete results and honest accountability . 
There are three lessons to be drawn from this sorry episode . 
First , the G-8 as a group should be brought to an end . 
The G-20 , which includes developing countries as well as rich countries , should take over . 
Second , any future promises made by the G-20 should be accompanied by a clear and transparent accounting of what each country will do , and when . 
The world needs true accountability , not empty words about accountability . 
Every G-20 promise should spell out the specific actions and commitments of each country , as well as the overall promise of the group . 
Third , the world &apos;s leaders should recognize that commitments to fight poverty , hunger , disease , and climate change are life-and-death issues that require professional management for serious implementation . 
The G-20 meets later this year in South Korea , a country that has emerged from poverty and hunger over the past 50 years . 
South Korea understands the utter seriousness of the global development agenda , and the poorest countries &quot; needs . 
Our best hope is that South Korea will succeed as the next host country , picking up where Canada has fallen far short .
