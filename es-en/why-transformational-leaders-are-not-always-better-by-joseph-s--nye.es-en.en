In Defense of Non-Visionaries 
OXFORD - Many of the recent tributes for Margaret Thatcher following her death celebrated her as a &quot; transformational &quot; leader who brought about great changes . 
There were frequent references to her equally transformational American counterpart , Ronald Reagan . 
But a more interesting comparison is with her other presidential contemporary , George H. W. Bush . 
Though often dismissed as a mere &quot; transactional &quot; manager , Bush had one of the best foreign-policy records of the past half-century . 
His administration managed the end of the Cold War , the dismantlement of the Soviet Union , and the unification of Germany within NATO - all without violence . 
At the same time , he led a broad United Nations-backed coalition that repelled Saddam Hussein &apos;s aggression against Kuwait . 
Had he dropped any of the balls he was juggling , today &apos;s world would be much worse . 
Although he presided over a major global transformation , Bush , by his own account , did not have transformational objectives . 
On the unification of Germany , he resisted the advice of Thatcher and others , apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . 
In October 1989 , Bush responded to a call from Kohl by publicly stating that he did not &quot; share the concern that some European countries have about a reunified Germany . &quot; 
At the same time , he was careful to let Kohl and others take the lead . 
When the Berlin Wall was opened a month later , partly owing to an East German mistake , Bush was criticized for his low-key response . 
But Bush had made a deliberate choice not to humiliate the Soviets or gloat : &quot; I won &apos;t beat on my chest and dance on the wall , &quot; was his response - a model of emotional intelligence in a leader . 
Such self-restraint helped to set the stage for the successful Malta Summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a month later . 
The Cold War ended quietly , and the dismantlement of the Soviet empire followed . 
As Bush and his team responded to forces that were largely outside of his control , he set goals and objectives that balanced opportunities and constraints in a prudent manner . 
Some critics have faulted him for not supporting the national aspirations of Soviet republics like Ukraine in 1991 ( when he delivered his infamous &quot; Chicken Kiev &quot; speech warning against &quot; suicidal nationalism &quot; ) ; for failing to go to Baghdad to unseat Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War ; or for sending Brent Scowcroft to Beijing to maintain relations with China after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 . 
But , in each instance , Bush was limiting his short-term gains in order to pursue long-term stability . 
Other critics complained that Bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding Russian democracy , the Middle East , or nuclear non-proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid . 
But , again , Bush remained more focused on maintaining global stability than on advancing new visions . 
Bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad , going to the US Congress for authorization of the Gulf War , and to the United Nations for a resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter . 
Although a realist in his thinking , he could be Wilsonian in his tactics . 
Bush &apos;s termination of the ground war in Iraq after only four days was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns about the slaughter of Iraqi troops , as well as by an interest in not leaving Iraq so weakened that it could not balance the power of neighboring Iran . 
While Bush &apos;s invasion of Panama to capture ( and later put on trial ) Manuel Noriega may have violated Panamanian sovereignty , it had a degree of de facto legitimacy , given Noriega &apos;s notorious behavior . 
And , when Bush organized his international coalition to prosecute the Gulf War , he included several Arab countries - not to ensure military success , but to boost the mission &apos;s legitimacy . 
When Bush and Thatcher met in Aspen , Colorado , in the summer of 1990 , Thatcher allegedly warned him &quot; not to go wobbly . &quot; 
With his careful combination of hard and soft power , Bush created a successful strategy - one that accomplished American goals in a manner that was not unduly insular and with minimal damage to the interests of foreigners . 
He was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev , and to manage the transition to Boris Yeltsin &apos;s presidency in a newly independent Russia . 
Of course , not all foreigners were adequately protected . 
For example , Bush assigned a low priority to Kurds and Shia in Iraq , to dissidents in China , and to Bosnians in the former Yugoslavia . 
In that sense , Bush &apos;s realism set limits to his cosmopolitanism . 
Could Bush have done more had he been a transformational leader like Thatcher or Reagan ? 
Perhaps he might have done more in a second term . 
And , with better communication skills , he might have been able to do more to educate the American public about the changing nature of the post-Cold War world . 
But , given the profound uncertainty of a world in flux , as well as the dangers of miscalculation as the Soviet empire collapsed , prudent management trumped grand visions . 
Bush famously said that he did not do &quot; the vision thing . &quot; 
Nonetheless , few people at the end of 1989 believed that Germany could be reunited peacefully within the Western alliance . 
Thatcher certainly did not . 
The lesson is that in some circumstances , we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like George H. W. Bush ( or Dwight Eisenhower before him ) , rather than by more flashy and inspirational transformers .
