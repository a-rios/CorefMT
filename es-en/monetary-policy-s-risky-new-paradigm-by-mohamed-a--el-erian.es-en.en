Farewell to Inflation Targeting ? 
NEWPORT BEACH - In a four-day period in mid-December , three seemingly unrelated developments suggested that modern central banking is in the midst of an historic change . 
The implications go well beyond academia and policy circles . 
To the extent that this shift gains momentum - which appears likely - it will affect economic performance , the functioning of markets , and asset-price valuations . 
The three developments began on December 12 in the United States , where the Federal Reserve , led by Ben Bernanke , announced that it will go much further than doubling ( to $ 1 trillion ) the volume of market securities that it intends to buy in 2013 in order to stimulate the economy . 
The Fed also left no doubt that it will maintain its foot on the accelerator until the US unemployment rate declines significantly , at least to 6.5 % , and as long as inflation is contained at or below 2.5 % . 
According to most analysts , the novelty in the announcement was the Fed &apos;s willingness to be explicit about its quantitative policy thresholds and , therefore , about the future course of its monetary policy . 
But my reading of what the Fed announced ( and what Bernanke said in the subsequent press conference ) suggests that the innovation goes beyond this . 
The Fed is taking very different approaches to the specification of the two quantitative thresholds : unemployment will be based on historical data , while inflation will be based on the Fed &apos;s own projections . 
This subtle difference has interesting operational effects . 
Most important , it prioritizes the unemployment objective over the inflation target . 
This realignment of the Fed &apos;s dual mandate , which I have called the &quot; reverse Volcker moment , &quot; has been evident for a few months . 
Let me explain by going back to the end of the inflationary 1970 &quot; s , when President Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker to lead the Fed . 
In order to prevent pathological inflationary dynamics from becoming embedded even more deeply in the structure of the economy ( including through wage indexation ) , Volcker dramatically changed the policy stance and made inflation public enemy number one . 
The equivalent of today &apos;s policy rate rose to 22 % as he launched a bold anti-inflationary crusade , accepting significant upfront costs for gains down the road . 
This &quot; Volcker moment &quot; was , as students of economic history know , the catalyst not only for &quot; winning the war against inflation , &quot; but also for a multi-decade shift in conventional wisdom about central banking . 
Most important , inflation targeting and independence from the fiscal authorities became core features of mainstream policy - a requirement for any country seeking the macroeconomic stability deemed crucial for sustained economic growth and high rates of job creation . 
I suspect that historians one day will view last month &apos;s Fed announcement as the catalyst for a similar change in conventional wisdom - both in America and around the world . 
They will conclude that two factors motivated Bernanke : persistently high US unemployment - which , like the inflation problem that Volcker faced , risks becoming deeply embedded in the structure of the economy - and virtual paralysis on the part of other policymaking agencies . 
There are almost five million &quot; long-term unemployed &quot; Americans , constituting more than 40 % of total unemployment . 
Millions more have dropped out of the measured labor force altogether . 
And about a quarter of 16-19-year-olds in the labor force are unemployed . 
All of this risks serious skill atrophy . 
And the unemployed young face the additional risk of becoming a lost generation . 
It is therefore doubly surprising that , aside from the Fed , America &apos;s policymaking agencies are essentially missing in action . 
The problem is not a lack of leadership from President Barack Obama , who has put forward several proposals to address the country &apos;s unemployment problem , including a comprehensive jobs initiative . 
Rather , the problem is a polarized Congress that has taken no major economic decisions in the last few years - other than missteps ( like the fiscal cliff ) that risk tripping the economy into recession . 
With political paralysis likely to continue in 2013 , notwithstanding occasional agreements , the Fed will be busy implementing the paradigm shift for central banking . 
And the impact could well spread . 
Which brings us to the two other developments in that four-day period in mid-December . 
A few hours after the Fed &apos;s announcement , news came that the British government was open to considering a change in the Bank of England &apos;s policy anchor . 
Unlike the Fed , the BoE &apos;s sole objective for years has been price stability , with no additional employment mandate . 
If the target is missed repeatedly , as it has been , the governor must send a public explanatory letter to the government . 
Now it looks like politicians may be looking to offload onto the Bank responsibility for generating economic growth and jobs . 
The third development occurred in Japan , where the newly-elected Liberal Democratic government of Shinzo Abe , commanding a two-thirds parliamentary majority , is pressing the Bank of Japan to stimulate growth - a &quot; discussion &quot; that looks set to evolve into something much more assertive . 
In short , expect central banks to devote greater attention to unemployment . 
And it is a good thing that the official sector is paying more attention to joblessness - a very good thing . 
Yet , unfortunately , this shift will not solve a problem that eats away at the social fabric of any society . 
As much as Bernanke and others wish otherwise - and as much as bickering politicians seek to dump policy responsibilities on others - central banks do not have the proper tools to deal with the component of the unemployment crisis that results from insufficient investment in education , training , and physical capital . 
Likewise , they cannot fix debt overhangs , repair broken home financing , or address medium-term fiscal-reform challenges on their own . 
The best that central banks can do is to buy time , albeit at an increasing cost , for other policymaking entities to get their act together . 
If this window closes , the monetary-policy paradigm shift now visible in the US , Britain , and Japan would risk a damaging loss of credibility and political independence for institutions that are critical to well-managed economies .
