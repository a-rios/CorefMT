The Dead Cat Bounce 
NEW YORK - Mild signs that the rate of economic contraction is slowing in the United States , China , and other parts of the world have led many economists to forecast that positive growth will return to the US in the second half of the year , and that a similar recovery will occur in other advanced economies . 
The emerging consensus among economists is that growth next year will be close to the trend rate of 2.5 % . 
Investors are talking of &quot; green shoots &quot; of recovery and of positive &quot; second derivatives of economic activity &quot; ( continuing economic contraction is the first , negative , derivative , but the slower rate suggests that the bottom is near ) . 
As a result , stock markets have started to rally in the US and around the world . 
Markets seem to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel for the economy and for the battered profits of corporations and financial firms . 
This consensus optimism is , I believe , not supported by the facts . 
Indeed , I expect that while the rate of US contraction will slow from -6 % in the last two quarters , US growth will still be negative ( around -1.5 to -2 % ) in the second half of the year ( compared to the bullish consensus of + 2 % ) . 
Moreover , growth next year will be so weak ( 0.5 to 1 % , as opposed to the consensus of 2 % or more ) and unemployment so high ( above 10 % ) that it will still feel like a recession . 
In the euro zone and Japan , the outlook for 2009 and 2010 is even worse , with growth close to zero even next year . 
China will have a more rapid recovery later this year , but growth will reach only 5 % this year and 7 % in 2010 , well below the average of 10 % over the last decade . 
Given this weak outlook for the major economies , losses by banks and other financial institutions will continue to grow . 
My latest estimates are $ 3.6 trillion in losses for loans and securities issued by US institutions , and $ 1 trillion for the rest of the world . 
It is said that the International Monetary Fund , which earlier this year revised upward its estimate of bank losses , from $ 1 trillion to $ 2.2 trillion , will announce a new estimate of $ 3.1 trillion for US assets and $ 0.9 trillion for foreign assets , figures very close to my own . 
By this standard , many US and foreign banks are effectively insolvent and will have to be taken over by governments . 
The credit crunch will last much longer if we keep zombie banks alive despite their massive and continuing losses . 
Given this outlook for the real economy and financial institutions , the latest rally in US and global stock markets has to be interpreted as a bear-market rally . 
Economists usually joke that the stock market has predicted 12 out of the last nine recessions , as markets often fall sharply without an ensuing recession . 
But , in the last two years , the stock market has predicted six out of the last zero economic recoveries - that is , six bear market rallies that eventually fizzled and led to new lows . 
The stock market &apos;s latest &quot; dead cat bounce &quot; may last a while longer , but three factors will , in due course , lead it to turn south again . 
First , macroeconomic indicators will be worse than expected , with growth failing to recover as fast the consensus expects . 
Second , the profits and earnings of corporations and financial institutions will not rebound as fast as the consensus predicts , as weak economic growth , deflationary pressures , and surging defaults on corporate bonds will limit firms &quot; pricing power and keep profit margins low . 
Third , financial shocks will be worse than expected . 
At some point , investors will realize that bank losses are massive , and that some banks are insolvent . 
Deleveraging by highly leveraged firms - such as hedge funds - will lead them to sell illiquid assets in illiquid markets . 
And some emerging market economies - despite massive IMF support - will experience a severe financial crisis with contagious effects on other economies . 
So , while this latest bear-market rally may continue for a bit longer , renewed downward pressure on stocks and other risky assets is inevitable . 
To be sure , much more aggressive policy action ( massive and unconventional monetary easing , larger fiscal-stimulus packages , bailouts of financial firms , individual mortgage-debt relief , and increased financial support for troubled emerging markets ) in many countries in the last few months has reduced the risk of a near depression . 
That outcome seemed highly likely six months ago , when global financial markets nearly collapsed . 
Still , this global recession will continue for a longer period than the consensus suggest . 
There may be light at the end of the tunnel - no depression and financial meltdown . 
But economic recovery everywhere will be weaker and will take longer than expected .
