Obama &apos;s Passage to India 
CAMBRIDGE - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi &apos;s vigorous foreign policy in the seven months since he took office has surprised observers . 
After inviting the leaders of Pakistan and other neighboring countries to his inauguration , he embarked on trips to China , Australia , and the United States . 
More recently , he welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin to New Delhi and signed a large number of trade deals and orders to import Russian nuclear reactors . 
India , Modi is telling his fellow citizens , is strong and well regarded around the world . 
Next month , US President Barack Obama will travel to New Delhi as Modi &apos;s special guest at events commemorating Republic Day , India &apos;s national holiday - just three months after the two leaders held substantive talks in Washington , DC . 
So what is likely to be on Obama &apos;s mind when he meets his Indian counterpart again , and what does he think can be done to cement bilateral ties ? 
Three issues stand out - beginning with trade , which is as important politically as it is economically . 
Obama hopes that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will be concluded in 2015 and ratified by the US Senate . 
The TPP will not be as powerful a free-trade agreement as originally intended , owing to exclusions and a very long phase-in period . 
But it will tie the US and 11 other Pacific Rim countries ( including Japan but excluding China ) together in a new economic bloc . 
Obama should be eager to stress that India &apos;s exclusion from the TPP is a matter solely of geography - India does not abut the Pacific - and that the US wants to increase bilateral trade and direct investment by American firms . 
The second issue is terrorism . 
The US authorities are worried that American citizens who have been fighting with the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in the Middle East will return home to commit terrorist acts . 
India has experienced horrific acts of terrorism on its own territory . 
Continued cooperation between the US and Indian intelligence agencies can help both countries prevent future incidents . 
Terrorism includes not just physical violence , but also assaults in cyberspace . 
China , Russia , and Iran have been the source of frequent cyber attacks on banks , companies , and government agencies ; 
North Korea , the US alleges , was behind the recent breach of Sony Pictures &quot; computers . 
Though Obama presented evidence to Chinese President Xi Jinping of technology theft by hackers based in China , the Chinese authorities continue to deny it . 
More recently , Russia and others have been planting malware in the control systems of the US power grid and other sensitive networks . 
Looking ahead , the US worries about cyber attacks by non-state actors like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda . 
Although these groups &quot; members may lack the sophistication to commit such acts , they may try to hire individuals with the necessary skills . 
India has a large number of talented computer engineers , including some who might be sympathetic to the Islamist cause . 
The US and India could both benefit from cooperating to prevent and disrupt such recruitment efforts . 
The third issue on Obama &apos;s mind is bound to be China &apos;s asserted goal of dominating Asia and excluding the US from the region . 
Chinese hegemonic ambition runs counter to India &apos;s strategic interests as well - reason enough for Modi &apos;s eagerness to strengthen his country &apos;s relations with its neighbors as well as with the US . 
Modi won a landslide victory in an election that reflected the Indian public &apos;s disappointment with the policies and performance of the previous government , led by the Indian National Congress . 
Though India had experienced annual real GDP growth of more than 8 % for several years , growth has slowed since 2010 , to less than 5 % in 2013 , owing to a populist shift in policies dictated by Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi . 
By contrast , the Modi government plans to pursue a pro-growth agenda that includes reducing bureaucratic delays , increasing infrastructure investment , stimulating manufacturing activity , and shifting to a simpler unified tax system . 
Modi &apos;s agenda also evidently includes an active foreign policy - as it should . 
Cultivating India as a reliable partner in the global economy and in international affairs is a high priority for the US as well . 
Obama &apos;s visit to India can help to realize that relationship &apos;s potential .
