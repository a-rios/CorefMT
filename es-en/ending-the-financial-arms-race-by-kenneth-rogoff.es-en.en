Ending the Financial Arms Race 
CAMBRIDGE - People often ask if regulators and legislators have fixed the flaws in the financial system that took the world to the brink of a second Great Depression . 
The short answer is no . 
Yes , the chances of an immediate repeat of the acute financial meltdown of 2008 are much reduced by the fact that most investors , regulators , consumers , and even politicians will remember their financial near-death experience for quite some time . 
As a result , it could take a while for recklessness to hit full throttle again . 
But , otherwise , little has fundamentally changed . 
Legislation and regulation produced in the wake of the crisis have mostly served as a patch to preserve the status quo . 
Politicians and regulators have neither the political courage nor the intellectual conviction needed to return to a much clearer and more straightforward system . 
In his recent speech to the annual , elite central-banking conference in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , the Bank of England &apos;s Andy Haldane made a forceful plea for a return to simplicity in banking regulation . 
Haldane rightly complained that banking regulation has evolved from a small number of very specific guidelines to mind-numbingly complicated statistical algorithms for measuring risk and capital adequacy . 
Legislative complexity is growing exponentially in parallel . 
In the United States , the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was just 37 pages and helped to produce financial stability for the greater part of seven decades . 
The recent Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is 848 pages , and requires regulatory agencies to produce several hundred additional documents giving even more detailed rules . 
Combined , the legislation appears on track to run 30,000 pages . 
As Haldane notes , even the celebrated &quot; Volcker rule , &quot; intended to build a better wall between more mundane commercial banking and riskier proprietary bank trading , has been hugely watered down as it grinds through the legislative process . 
The former Federal Reserve chairman &apos;s simple idea has been co-opted and diluted through hundreds of pages of legalese . 
The problem , at least , is simple : As finance has become more complicated , regulators have tried to keep up by adopting ever more complicated rules . 
It is an arms race that underfunded government agencies have no chance to win . 
Even back in the 1990 &quot; s , regulators would privately complain of the difficulty of retaining any staff capable of understanding the rapidly evolving derivatives market . 
Research assistants with one year of experience working on derivatives issues would get bid away by the private sector at salaries five times what the government could pay . 
Around the same time , in the mid-1990 &quot; s , academics began to publish papers suggesting that the only effective way to regulate modern banks was a form of self-regulation . 
Let banks design their own risk management systems , audit them to the limited extent possible , and then severely punish them if they produce a loss outside agreed parameters . 
Many economists argued that these clever models were flawed , because the punishment threat was not credible , particularly in the case of a systemic meltdown affecting a large part of the financial system . 
But the papers were published anyway , and the ideas were implemented . 
It is not necessary to recount the consequences . 
The clearest and most effective way to simplify regulation has been advanced in a series of important papers by Anat Admati of Stanford ( with co-authors including Peter DeMarzo , Martin Hellwig , and Paul Pfleiderer ) . 
Their basic point is that financial firms should be forced to fund themselves in a more balanced fashion , and not to rely so heavily on debt finance . 
Admati and her colleagues recommend requirements that force financial firms to generate equity funding either through retained earnings or , in the case of publicly traded firms , through stock issuance . 
The status quo allows banks instead to leverage taxpayer assistance by holding razor-thin equity margins , relying on debt to a far greater extent than typical large non-financial firms do . 
Some large firms , such as Apple , hold virtually no debt at all . 
Greater reliance on equity would give banks a much larger cushion to absorb losses . 
The financial industry complains that efforts to force greater equity funding would curtail lending , but this is just nonsense in a general equilibrium setting . 
Nevertheless , governments have been very timid in advancing on this front , with the new Basel III rules taking only a baby step toward real change . 
Of course , it is not easy to legislate financial reform in a stagnant global economy , for fear of impeding credit and turning a sluggish recovery into a full-blown recession . 
And , surely , academics are also to blame for the inertia , with many of them still defending elegant but deeply flawed models of perfect markets that create an illusion of safety for a system that is in fact highly risk-prone . 
The fashionable idea of allowing banks to issue &quot; contingent capital &quot; ( debt that becomes equity in a systemic crisis ) is no more credible than the idea of committing to punish banks severely in the event of a crisis . 
A simpler and more transparent system would ultimately lead to more lending and greater stability , not less . 
It is high time to restore sanity to financial-market regulation .
