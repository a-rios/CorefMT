Europe &apos;s Leisure Trap 
Black Friday in the United States traditionally is the day after Thanksgiving that signals the start of the holiday season sale . 
At daybreak , people line up before department stores to get the special &quot; early bird &quot; bargains . 
In Europe , black Saturday falls in the last weekend of July , when the French and other Europeans set off in droves for their Mediterranean holiday destinations , and highways get jammed with traffic . 
This contrast could serve as a metaphor for the difference in lifestyles on either side of the Atlantic . 
Americans work more hours per week and have less vacation time , but they have more money to spend . 
Not only does a higher percentage of American adults work , but they also work more hours per week and more weeks per year . 
In 2004 , the French worked 28 % fewer hours per person than Americans , and the Germans and Dutch each put in 25 % fewer hours , and the money they earned was correspondingly lower - almost 30 % less income per person than Americans received . 
According to the MIT economist Olivier Blanchard , Europeans simply enjoy leisure more than Americans do , even if it means that they have less money . 
In his view , this difference in attitude explains the income gap between Europe and the US . 
But not everybody agrees with Blanchard . 
Some economists point out that high tax rates in Europe make work less rewarding - and thus leisure more attractive . 
Other economists see Europe &apos;s powerful labor unions as an important determinant in European attitudes towards work . 
After all , employees do not negotiate individually the length of the workweek . 
During past economic downturns , labor unions in Europe negotiated a reduced workweek or more vacation time with no reduction in wages . 
Moreover , Blanchard fails to note that the preference for leisure is not gender-neutral . 
The transatlantic difference in hours worked can be explained in part by comparing the labor input of European women to the input of American women . 
While American women work 36 hours per week on average , Dutch women put in only 24 hours per week , while German women work 30 hours . 
French women with a job work on average 34 hours per week , but the percentage of women who work outside the home in France is almost 20 % lower than in the US . 
Are European females that much lazier than American females ? 
The answer depends on whether one considers the time women in Europe spend on domestic work . 
The economists Ronald Schettkat and Richard Freeman have calculated that American women spend ten hours per week less on cooking , cleaning , and childcare than European women do . 
Instead of performing these household jobs themselves , Americans pay other people to do them . 
Americans eat more often in restaurants , make ample use of laundry , dry-cleaning , and shopping services , and hire nannies to take care of young infants . 
Indeed , in the US , one finds all kinds of personal services that do not exist on a similar scale in Europe . 
A manicure , carwash , or a massage is often only a stone &apos;s throw from one &apos;s home . 
Doorman buildings provide round-the-clock service to residents and dog-walkers look after pets during the workday . 
In New York City , one can get help during the weekends to prepare meals for the coming week , with a culinary expert to advise you on the recipes , buy the groceries , and do part of the cooking . 
In other words , American women work more hours and use the money they make to hire people to do the tasks that they can &apos;t do because they &apos;re working . 
By contrast , European women work less and have less money to spend on services . 
In their &quot; free time , &quot; European women are busy cleaning the house and looking after the children . 
On balance , therefore , European and American women work about the same amount of hours . 
Meanwhile , more wealth is created in the US than in Europe . 
After all , women professionals do not have to choose between a career and children , but can enjoy both . 
By spending part of their extra income on household jobs and personal services , American women limit their workload while creating demand for service jobs that wouldn &apos;t exist otherwise . 
To put it inelegantly , two birds are killed with one stone . 
In Europe , no birds get killed at all . 
Highly educated European women who have children either stay at home or work part-time and get stuck in low-end jobs . 
They take care of the household and children themselves . 
Meanwhile , there are not enough service jobs in Europe to put everybody to work . 
The social benefits paid to the out-of-work increase the tax burden on labor income , which in turn discourages women from full-time work . 
The leisure trap thus keeps both the best educated and the least educated out of the workplace .
