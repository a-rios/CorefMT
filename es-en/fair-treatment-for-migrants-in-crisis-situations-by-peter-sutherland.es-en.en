The Responsibility to Protect Migrants Rapacious recruiters fleece them of their earnings . 
Abusive employers exploit their labor . 
Yet , when it comes to protecting migrants &quot; well-being and rights , smart practices abound - and should be promoted more widely and implemented more frequently . 
With the number of international migrants on track nearly to double in the coming decades , such practices must become reference points for action . 
The plight of migrants is particularly tragic when its source is violent conflict , like in Syria and Libya , or natural or manmade disasters . 
In crises like these , migrants &quot; lives and physical safety are jeopardized through no fault of their own . 
Yet the world has no clear guidelines for how to protect them . 
Libya &apos;s civil war placed the vulnerability of migrants in stark relief , with hundreds of thousands caught in the crossfire . 
And , while Libyans were badly affected by the war , foreign workers were even more vulnerable , as they were largely left out of schemes aimed at protecting civilians . 
What stood out were the very different fates migrants faced . 
Most were left to their own devices to escape the violence , and many died trying . 
Some were killed after being falsely targeted as mercenaries ( largely owing to the color of their skin ) . 
Other groups , however , fared better . 
High-skilled migrants employed by Western oil companies , for example , were airlifted to safety . 
Nationals from countries with robust protection protocols , and sufficient financial resources , were efficiently evacuated ( the Philippines was exemplary in this regard ) . 
Libya was thus a vivid reminder of the serious gaps that exist in helping migrants in life-threatening situations . 
Their vulnerability is heightened due to their legal status and other obstacles - restrictions on exercising their fundamental rights , language barriers , constraints on their movement , and limited social capital and networks . 
The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) and the UNHCR , the United Nations &quot; refugee agency , were heroic in going above and beyond their mandates to protect migrants at risk in Libya , as were many NGOs . 
The World Bank also acted quickly to provide funds to evacuate Bangladeshi nationals . 
But international organizations alone cannot solve the problem . 
Before the next crisis erupts , we need to clarify the critical roles that all key actors - including countries of origin and destination , neighboring states , businesses , and civil society - should play . 
Last year , I began urging states and others to define a framework for action on helping migrants caught in crisis situations . 
It would include a set of principles , such as this fundamental one : During a crisis , emergency assistance should be afforded to citizens and migrants alike , without discrimination . 
I am grateful to the United States and the Philippines - working closely with the IOM , the UNHCR , and civil-society groups - for offering to help lead an initiative to address the situation of migrants caught in acute crises . 
Georgetown University and the MacArthur Foundation also are playing indispensable roles . 
Already , some countries have identified measures that stakeholders can take before , during , and after crises in order to keep migrants out of harm &apos;s way . 
Countries that are especially experienced in protecting their workers abroad offer a blueprint for action . 
An early warning system in the Philippines , for instance , mobilizes government agencies to react quickly to crises , while a special fund pays for emergency evacuations . 
The government also provides compulsory pre-departure and post-arrival orientation , so that migrants know what to do in an emergency . 
Registration systems , such as Mexico &apos;s matricula consular , help to ensure that countries know the location of their migrants - including those who are undocumented - in a crisis . 
Destination countries have equally profound responsibilities in crises . 
Evacuation from danger zones and humanitarian aid should be provided regardless of legal status - as the United States did last year in the wake of Hurricane Sandy . 
Likewise , after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011 , Japanese authorities broadcast information in 17 languages , assuring migrants that they could seek emergency services . 
Migrants also typically need emergency travel documents after a crisis , as well as legal assistance to help them recover lost assets . 
Neighboring countries have a vital role to play , too - for example , by keeping borders open so that migrants do not become trapped , as Egypt and Tunisia so generously demonstrated during the Libya crisis . 
Employers , meanwhile , are linchpins during a crisis . 
They should be obliged to repatriate foreign workers , as required in the standard migrant employment contract used by the Philippines . 
They also should have evacuation plans for employees at all levels , not just executives . 
It should be self-evident that we need to help all migrants in distress - not only those affected by conflicts and disasters , but also those abandoned by smugglers , countless more left in limbo for years in transit countries , and the millions working in slave-like conditions . 
The principles and plans that we put in place to protect migrants in life-threatening situations eventually could - and should - be expanded in order to protect a much broader array of vulnerable migrants . 
We need not be overwhelmed by the dizzying array of problems plaguing migrants . 
With small groups of states , experts , international organizations , and civil society working together to trail-blaze solutions that might become global practices ( a model that could be applied to other international problems ) , we can address the challenges facing migrants one by one and with the necessary resolve .
