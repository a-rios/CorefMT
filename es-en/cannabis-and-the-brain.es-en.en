Cannabis and the Brain 
Across Europe and America , there is a groundswell of debate concerning the legalization of cannibas for personal use . 
Indeed , Britain has , to all intents and purposes , practically decriminalized marijuana usage . 
As a neuro-scientist , I am concerned about this debate . 
One common justification for legalization or decriminalization of cannabis centers around the idea that it does not involve a victim . 
But at least four reports in major medical journals ( Ramstrom , 1998 ; 
Moskowitz , 1985 ; 
Chesher , 1995 ; and Ashton , 2001 ) , show the contrary . 
In a study of pilots smoking only a single moderate joint , there was a difference between a placebo control group and those taking cannabis , up to 50 hours after taking the drug . 
Other costs to the community are accidents at work or at home , educational under-attainment , impaired work performance and health budget costs . 
Another argument for relaxing our attitude to cannabis is that it is non-addictive . 
Of course , defining &apos; addiction &apos; is hard , but if one regards it as an inability to give up , then there is strong evidence that cannabis incites dependence . 
Recent papers report many users in the US , UK and New Zealand now seek treatment for dependence . 
Other papers show that 10 % of users want to stop or cut down , but have difficulties doing so , whilst a paper in 1998 reported that 10-15 % of users become dependants . 
Recently , it was shown that withdrawal symptoms were experienced after only three days of light use . 
Heavy users confront a worse situation : Dr Bryan Wells , a rehabilitation expert , comments , &quot; for the first time I &apos;m beginning to see something that resembles the withdrawal symptoms produced by hard drugs in heavy cannabis users . &quot; 
Another argument in favor of relaxed laws on cannabis are its supposed beneficial effects on pain . 
So far , that evidence is anecdotal ; it is hard to exclude placebo effects . 
The results from clinical trials are awaited . 
But distinctions should be drawn between recreational drugs and medicines , as they are for opiates . 
If cannabis is a pain-killer , then it must have a huge impact on the physical brain . 
Indeed , widespread reports exist of the impact of cannabis on the brain , in particular areas concerned with memory ( hippocampus ) , emotion ( mesolimbic system ) , and movement ( basal ganglia ) . 
Cannabis affects a variety of chemical systems and it works via its own &apos; receptor , &apos; it &apos;s own molecular target . 
The fact that there is a naturally occurring analogue of cannabis in the body , as there is for morphine , provides a basic reason to differentiate it from alcohol . 
For an agent that affects a variety of transmitter systems , is as though it were a transmitter itself . 
Perhaps , not surprisingly , for cannabis has a clear effect on psychology : not only is there euphoria , but often overlooked effects of anxiety , panic and paranoia . 
Disorders in psychological performance , attention impairments , and memory deficits are well known . 
More disturbing - and less acknowledged - is the fact that these effects can be long-term . 
In one recent paper , a comparison of ex-users who used for 9 years and abstained from 3 months to 6 years , were compared with long-term users of 10 years , and short-term users of 3 years . 
In all cases the frequency of use was 10-19 days per month . 
In all cases , all users , irrespective of whether they had given up or not , had attention impairments compared to controls . 
Although those who stopped using cannabis partially improved over those continued using cannabis , they were below the level of controls , and this impairment was related to the duration of use . 
Most disturbing was the fact that no improvement in performance occurred with increasing abstinence . 
No surprise , then , that because these long-term effects seem to be irreversible , there is an effect on brain pathology . 
Because much of this data comes from work with isolated systems , and therefore on all brains , an obvious criticism is that you can &apos;t extrapolate from such data . 
Yet , the evidence suggests that the long-term effects must have a physical basis . 
A counter-argument to such thinking is to challenge whoever thinks that there is a &apos; safe &apos; dose of cannabis , with no effect on the brain , to say what that dose might be . 
Even a dose comparable to one joint , and analogous levels of the active THC ingredient to that in plasma , can kill 50 % of neurons in the hippocampus ( an area related to memory ) within 6 days . 
People , moreover , are unaware that the THC in cannabis remains in the body for over 5 days . 
For someone using cannabis routinely , the dose carried in the body is higher than imagined . 
It is also easy to underestimate the dose being taken , because there is a wide variety in the strength of cannabis . 
Individual variations in body fat and , worryingly , disposition to psychosis , means that you cannot predict how much will affect any person at any time . 
Cannabis could well be having a serious effect on the mind , which I define as the personalization of brain circuits that reflect an individual &apos;s experiences . 
A transmitter-like substance , with such powerful effects , must affect those circuits . 
So &apos; blowing your mind &apos; might be exactly what marijuana users do .
