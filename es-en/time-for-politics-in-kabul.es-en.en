Time for Politics in Kabul 
LONDON - As US and NATO soldiers prepare for their tenth Christmas in Afghanistan , a new buzzword is making the rounds : &quot; transition , &quot; the process of transferring responsibility for security from international to Afghan forces ahead of the withdrawal of foreign troops , which is set to begin in the spring of 2011 . 
But , in order to realize the hope that ordinary soldiers take from the new jargon , Western leaders will need to forge a clear political strategy for Afghanistan , without which the country will remain at war . 
American and European military and civilian leaders have said repeatedly that there is no purely military solution to ending the war in Afghanistan . 
Yet NATO states have no answer to the question that logically follows : What would a political solution entail ? 
Instead , they prefer to fall back on military-dominated plans for strengthening the capacity of the Afghan army and police , while heeding domestic pressure to demonstrate that Afghanistan will not be an endless conflict . 
Afghans themselves are overwhelmingly supportive of seeking a political settlement to end the conflict , as a recent Asia Foundation survey of national attitudes confirmed . 
They have borne the brunt of 40 years of war , and are well aware that international forces are planning their departure . 
Afghans &quot; fears and concerns are focused on what legacy will be left behind , and whether the Afghan state can provide security , justice , and good governance , which it has so far been unable to deliver in the face of an insurgency whose strength is not significantly weakened . 
Afghanistan &apos;s international partners are not responsive to these concerns and grievances . 
Though they have committed themselves rhetorically to supporting the Afghan-led Peace and Reintegration Program , Afghans are voicing discontent and wariness about a process that is decidedly marginal to &quot; transition . &quot; 
Reintegration and reconciliation , which are meant to offer incentives to insurgents to switch sides and perhaps join Afghan security institutions or nominally pro-government militias , are seen as being driven by military logic , rather than representing an honest dialogue between the state , the insurgents , and ordinary Afghans . 
Lack of transparency is driving fears that Hamid Karzai &apos;s government is brokering a power-sharing deal with the Taliban that will do little to foster stability or better governance . 
If NATO members , Afghanistan &apos;s government and citizens , and , by many accounts , the insurgents , can all agree that there is no military solution to ending the conflict , it is high time to consider and support a comprehensive political process . 
As a first step , countries with forces in Afghanistan should accept that , as parties to the conflict , they need to be parties to the peace as well , and that every military operation has far-reaching and sometimes irreversible political implications . 
Second , it is important to recognize the limited logic and impact of &quot; transition . &quot; 
Leaving aside credible questions about the capacity of the Afghan security forces , transferring security responsibility to the Afghan state does not address broader Afghan grievances about bad governance or the abuse of power - both key drivers of the conflict . 
For Afghans , these concerns need to be addressed through a serious political process moderated by a neutral third party , which most agree has to be the United Nations . 
Correspondingly , the international community should back mechanisms that will address the grievances of all Afghans , not just the political elite , and that will seek to address regional strategic concerns and agendas , especially those of Pakistan and Iran . 
A genuine and inclusive process will require engaging with the whole spectrum of Afghan civil society , including rights organizations , women &apos;s groups , the clergy , public intellectuals , and influential tribal networks . 
Peacemaking in Liberia , Nepal , Ireland , and elsewhere confirms the necessity of this approach , given such groups &quot; key role in shaping and monitoring the content of a political process , with real consequences for those who violate its guarantees of citizens &quot; rights . 
For this reason , perpetrators of serious human-rights violations on all sides should be held accountable , a demand that has been pointedly ignored since 2001 . 
The process must also include real disarmament to ensure that Afghans do not fall prey to a continuing cycle of violence , and that the Afghan state establishes genuine control of security . 
The current reintegration plan , like two previous attempts at disarmament , falls short of credibly demobilizing armed groups and regulating the arms trade . 
The international community still has an opportunity to leave behind a better Afghanistan than the NATO countries are seeking to &quot; transition &quot; out of today . 
But that requires commitment to a real vision of what constitutes a minimally functioning Afghan state , beyond the obvious need for effective security forces . 
Afghans are demanding a political settlement to the conflict , which is the only means to stop the violence that disrupts their lives , promote political inclusion and accountability , and enable better governance . 
As they contemplate the end of their military operations , NATO members must support a political process if they truly want to stabilize Afghanistan .
