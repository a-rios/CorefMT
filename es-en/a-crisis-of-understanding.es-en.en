A Crisis of Understanding 
NEW HAVEN - Few economists predicted the current economic crisis , and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes . 
So , not surprisingly , economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end , either . 
Of course , we all know the proximate causes of an economic crisis : people are not spending , because their incomes have fallen , their jobs are insecure , or both . 
But we can take it a step further back : people &apos;s income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago - and so on , backwards in time , in a repeating feedback loop . 
It is a vicious circle , but where and why did it start ? 
Why did it worsen ? 
What will reverse it ? It is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers . 
The state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the Great Depression that followed the 1929 stock market crash . 
Economists did not predict that event , either . 
In the 1920 &quot; s , some warned about an overpriced stock market , but they did not predict a decade-long depression affecting the entire economy . 
Late in the Great Depression , in August 1938 , an article by Ralph M. Blagden in 
The causes given were &quot; distributed widely among government , labor , industry , international politics and policies . &quot; 
They included misguided government interference with markets , high income and capital gains taxes , mistaken monetary policy , pressures towards high wages , monopoly , overstocked inventories , uncertainty caused by the reorganization plan for the Supreme Court , rearmament in Europe and fear of war , government encouragement of labor disputes , a savings glut because of population shrinkage , the passing of the frontier , and easy credit before the depression . 
Although economic theory today is much improved , if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis , we will mostly get the same answers . 
We would certainly hear some new ones , too : unprecedented real-estate bubbles , a global savings glut , international trade imbalances , exotic financial contracts , sub-prime mortgages , unregulated over-the-counter markets , rating agencies &quot; errors , compromised real-estate appraisals , and complacency about counterparty risk . 
More likely than not , many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right , for the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors , the chance co-occurrence of a lot of bad things , which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point . 
At that point , the trouble grabbed widespread attention , destroyed public confidence , and set in motion a negative feedback loop . 
Our attention , after all , is naturally drawn to the worst events . 
Consider the question of predicting events like the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti , which killed more than 200,000 people . 
It captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage . 
But if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predicting the extent of the damage , one could surely devise a long list of contributing factors - including even political , financial , and insurance factors - that resembles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis . 
Indeed , the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes . 
For , in a complicated economic system that feeds back on itself in many ways , events that start a vicious cycle might be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon , which , by flapping its wings , sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a far-away hurricane . 
Chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions , and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future . 
Weather forecasters cannot forecast far into the future , either , but at least they have precise mathematical models . 
Massive parallel computers are programmed to yield numerical solutions of differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics . 
Scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather , even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far . 
The problem for macroeconomics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to systematize . 
The mathematical models that macroeconomists have may resemble weather models in some respects , but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid , immutable theory . 
The most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis , Carmen Reinhart &apos;s and Kenneth Rogoff &apos;s 
This leaves us trying to use patterns from past , dissimilar crises to try to infer the likely prognosis for the current crisis . 
As a result , we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing .
