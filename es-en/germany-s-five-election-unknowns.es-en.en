Germany &apos;s Five Election Unknowns 
On September 18 , Germany will hold an election that contains at least five unknowns . 
If it were an equation , it would be impossible to solve . 
Fortunately , politics is not mathematics - though , unfortunately , this means that there are no clear solutions . 
Indeed , even in the opaque terms of contemporary politics , the German case is particularly vexing . 
The first unknown is why the election is taking place at all . 
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had another fifteen months to go before the end of the electoral term , and it seemed that he had no difficulty mobilizing his admittedly slender majority in parliament . 
To be sure , the big issues that the Federal President listed when he dissolved the Bundestag are real . 
The fiscal position is , by German standards , unacceptable , and public debt at current levels is contrary to the European Union &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact and a burden on future generations . 
Demographic developments alone require major reforms of social policy . 
Moreover , the institutions of the federal system do not permit decisions to be made either expeditiously or clearly . 
None of this is new , nor will it be changed by an election . 
The second unknown concerns what , exactly , separates the major parties in this contest . 
The Social Democrats ( SPD ) and the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) are both committed to the &quot; social market economy , &quot; to the essentials of corporatist economic management , to maintaining the entitlements of the welfare state , and to the EU and NATO . 
True , the campaign has brought out nuances that may turn out to be important . 
Schröder &apos;s SPD uses the word &quot; social &quot; a little more emphatically than it did in the last seven years . 
The opposition CDU leader , Angela Merkel , has linked its program to the ambitious ideas of an outsider , former Constitutional Court judge Paul Kirchhof , seeking a dramatic simplification of the tax system . 
In international affairs , Merkel is more skeptical about European enlargement , notably to include Turkey , than Schröder . 
Merkel , an East German by background , is also more cautious in her approach to Russia . 
The third unknown is the performance of the Left Party , a new formation positioned to the left of the SPD and built on East Germany &apos;s ex-communist PDS , with the addition of a significant number of dissident Social Democrats in the West who proclaim themselves to be defenders of the welfare state . 
The Left Party is led by two talk show politicians , Gregor Gysi , the former PDS leader , and Oskar Lafontaine , the ex-leader of the SPD , who do not have much more in common than a record of political failure and a talent for populist speeches . 
The popular vote for this party - which could be 10 % - may well determine what kind of coalition is formed after the election . 
The fourth unknown is therefore what the next government will actually do . 
It will clearly be a government without the new Left Party . 
It will also be a government without the Greens , who continue to have a devoted , if limited , clientele , but are now regarded by many as a luxury that Germany can no longer afford . 
This leaves two possibilities : a coalition between the CDU , its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union , and the liberal Free Democrats , or a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU . 
The latter is what most Germans want ; the former is what they are most likely to get . 
There is a widespread desire for change , including a change of government , but there is an equally widespread belief that nothing momentous will happen . 
Who will make Germany an engine of Europe again rather than a gloomy passenger ? 
What Germany needs is , in fact , fairly clear . 
It needs to accept that globalization is above all an opportunity , one that must be grasped by confident , innovative , and entrepreneurial people . 
Germans need to understand again - as they did so well after 1945 - that their future lies in their own hands , as citizens , rather than in the power of some remote State . 
Above all , Germany must appreciate that the changes it needs are improvements that would guarantee its future security . 
Perhaps what it requires most is a touch of Margaret Thatcher &apos;s policies of the 1980 &quot; s , combined with Tony Blair &apos;s rhetoric of today .
