The Last Gentlemen &apos;s Club 
LONDON - Is one of the last bastions of gender inequality in the rich democracies finally starting to crumble ? 
In the past few weeks , Janet Yellen was nominated as the first female chair of the US Federal Reserve Board , and Karnit Flug became the first woman to be appointed Governor of Israel &apos;s central bank . 
If money is power , then women must no longer be excluded from controlling the supply of it . 
Although women do head central banks in 17 emerging markets - including Malaysia , Russia , Argentina , South Africa , Lesotho , and Botswana - they are the exceptions that prove a general rule : women are excluded from the world of monetary policymaking . 
Yellen &apos;s appointment is particularly important , because she breaks the glass ceiling in the advanced economies . 
Until her promotion , no member of the G-7 had a woman heading its central bank . 
Moreover , men occupy all 23 seats on the European Central Bank &apos;s ( ECB ) Governing Council . 
Since the Bank of England &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee was established in 1997 , only three women have been appointed as external members - and no woman has even been nominated since 2002 . 
The Bank of Japan has only one woman on its Policy Board . 
Women , nowadays , are more likely to occupy top political jobs . 
Angela Merkel was recently reelected for a third term as German Chancellor ; 
But no woman has come close to leading these countries &quot; central banks . 
Equality seems to have eluded central banks even in gender-conscious Scandinavia . 
For example , Norway , which has been promoting positive gender discrimination for years and recently elected Erna Solberg as its first female prime minister , has yet to allow a woman to control the purse strings - at either the central bank or the finance ministry , with its powerful sovereign wealth fund . 
Recent attempts to compel change have been counter-productive . 
In an effort to promote diversity and gender equality in the ECB , the European Parliament in 2012 blocked the appointment of Luxembourg &apos;s Yves Mersch to the bank &apos;s executive board . 
But MEPs then failed to propose a plausible female alternative , leaving the ECB understaffed for weeks during the eurozone sovereign-debt crisis . 
Unsurprisingly , the European Parliament &apos;s handling of Mersch &apos;s appointment was widely ridiculed , and his nomination was eventually confirmed . 
But many people drew the wrong conclusion from the episode , which they viewed as affirming the idea that competence and experience must always trump ill-conceived ideas about positive discrimination . 
If there are no suitable female candidates , it was argued , then the best candidate should prevail , regardless of gender . 
But this view misses the point . 
Why were there no suitable female candidates in the first place ? 
Women hold around 30 % of economics doctorates in developed countries , including Europe , and not one of them could be brought forward for the ECB post ? 
The more reasonable conclusion to be drawn from Mersch &apos;s appointment is that no serious effort was made to identify qualified women early on . 
On the contrary , female candidates tend simply to be overlooked . 
Flug was finally offered the top job only in the absence of a male rival , though she was already occupying the position temporarily while the board searched for Stanley Fischer &apos;s successor . 
Neither Yellen nor Flug was held back by a lack of academic credentials - both are accomplished scholars - or by the catch-all charge of having &quot; limited experience . &quot; 
Flug has been the Bank of Israel &apos;s deputy governor since 2011 ; 
Yellen has been involved in the Fed system for almost two decades , first in San Francisco and subsequently as Vice Chair of the Fed &apos;s Board of Governors . 
If a lack of skills or experience is not preventing women from reaching the summit of monetary policymaking , what is ? 
The most plausible explanation is that , as organizations with non-elected leaders and limited transparency , central banks tend to function as clubs whose largely male membership hire and promote familiar types ; governments usually reinforce this by simply rubber-stamping the banks &quot; preferred candidate for the top job . 
If gender is a proxy for diversity , then central banks fail a basic test of it . 
Promoting diversity - not only in terms of gender , but also with respect to age and , in many countries , ethnic background - is a matter of effectiveness as much as a question of social justice . 
A broader , more transparent recruitment process would reduce groupthink , challenge the status quo , and , one hopes , leave central banks better equipped to handle a financial crisis . 
The promotion of Yellen and Flug is a good start ; now the doors of these fusty male-dominated clubs must be flung wide open .
