Profiles in Peacemaking 
NEW YORK - Fifty years ago , President John F. Kennedy did the seemingly impossible . 
At the height of the Cold War , he moved the two nuclear superpowers , the United States and the Soviet Union , toward peace . 
The lessons of Kennedy &apos;s act of leadership - one of the greatest of modern times - are directly relevant today . 
I recount this remarkable story in a new book , To Move the World . 
To many , war between the two superpowers seemed inevitable . 
The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 created a global air of fear and pessimism , and certainly the belief that the US and the Soviet Union could not be reconciled . 
Kennedy knew better . 
He understood that much of the dangerous tension stemmed from each side &apos;s hardliners , who acted as if peace were impossible . 
Their actions on one side would provoke the other side &apos;s hardline response , fueling an upward spiral of distrust that strengthened the extremes in both camps . 
The &quot; experts &quot; of that era spoke of the balance of nuclear power . 
They believed that neither side would use nuclear weapons , owing to the fear of retaliation . 
In the Cuban missile crisis , the US and the Soviet Union stumbled to the precipice of nuclear war , not because of any desire for one ( except among a few hothead extremists ) , but because of a series of miscalculations and pressure exerted by hardliners . 
Following the crisis , Kennedy was determined to pull back from the precipice for good . 
In his extraordinary &quot; Peace Speech &quot; of June 10 , 1963 , he suggested to Americans that there was a way to make peace with the Soviet Union . 
Rather than issuing a list of demands , Kennedy did something far more interesting and unusual : he called upon Americans to reconsider their own attitudes about war and peace . 
&quot; First : Let us examine our attitude toward peace itself , &quot; Kennedy said . 
&quot; Too many of us think it is impossible . 
Too many think it unreal . 
It leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable , that mankind is doomed , that we are gripped by forces we cannot control . 
We need not accept that view . 
Our problems are manmade ; therefore , they can be solved by man . &quot; 
Kennedy diagnosed the problem succinctly : &quot; We are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breeds suspicion on the other , and new weapons beget counter-weapons . &quot; 
And his assessment of its solvability was equally concise : &quot; &#91; B &#93; oth the United States and its allies , and the Soviet Union and its allies , have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race . &quot; 
Kennedy &apos;s speech provoked a highly positive response from his Soviet counterpart , Nikita Khrushchev , who called in the US envoy and told him that the speech was the finest by any American president since Franklin Roosevelt . 
Within a few weeks , both sides had agreed to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty . 
Five years later , the first treaty led to a second , and even more important , agreement : the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
Kennedy had proved a powerful truth . 
&quot; &#91; H &#93; istory teaches us that enmities between nations , as between individuals , do not last forever , &quot; he said . 
&quot; However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem , the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors . &quot; 
That lesson applies powerfully today . 
The US is again caught in a spiral of distrust and uncertainty with other countries ( and the same is true of countless conflicts around the world that do not involve the US ) . 
America &apos;s conflict with Iran is one such powerful case ; others include its conflicts with Cuba and North Korea , and also the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , in which the US is deeply engaged as a supporter of Israel . 
In all of these cases , many people consider hatred and conflict inevitable , owing to a fundamental clash of values and interests . 
Even though the US and Iran are in a spiral of distrust , for example , there could be grounds for reestablishing a far healthier bilateral relationship . 
To be sure , the two sides are now dangerously divided . 
Their conflict has spilled over into Syria , where the US is now planning to arm the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in no small part because his regime is aligned with Iran . 
Syria &apos;s civil war is therefore increasingly a proxy fight between Iran and the US ( and other anti-Iranian countries ) , with Syrians dying in massive numbers as victims of somebody else &apos;s conflict . 
Now that the Iranian people have elected a new president , Hassan Rowhani , the opportunity for a new peace overture is at hand . 
Yes , there are important matters to discuss , notably Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions ; but several countries in Iran &apos;s neighborhood already possess nuclear weapons , threatening the entire region . 
US President Barack Obama should take the next steps , both with Iran and with other countries ( including North Korea and Cuba ) . 
A decade of US secret and not-so-secret wars , drone attacks , and covert operations is enough . 
We now urgently need US leadership that envisions peace rather than war as the solution . 
Fifty years ago , Kennedy showed that peace could be achieved even in the most difficult circumstances . 
His courage , vision , eloquence , and political skills provide a model and inspiration for the US and other countries today . 
Then , as now , the path to peace must always be preferred to the dead end of war .
