Black Bears and Television Junkies 
This summer , friends who live a few kilometers from us in rural Montana in the western US had to interrupt their dinner when a black bear suddenly came out of the trees . 
They went indoors to watch as it came up to the picnic table , licked the dishes clean , and then drank two cans of beer . 
Over the following days , the bear turned over the garbage cans of two neighbors and terrorized children and pets . 
Forest Service rangers set up a cage and put some bacon inside , soon catching and transporting the bear 30 kilometers into the wilderness . 
The bear was tagged before it was released , to show that it had been causing trouble . 
&quot; Unfortunately , &quot; said the ranger , &quot; that bear may be back here even before our truck returns . 
Once they develop a taste for bacon and beer , you can &apos;t keep them away . &quot; 
If a tagged bear is caught two or more times causing disruption , the rangers have orders to shoot it . 
It is easy to feel sorry for an animal that discovers tasty food and can &apos;t resist getting more the easy way . 
The bear has no idea that its days are numbered unless it remains in the forest and hunts in the traditional way for its meals . 
That much the bear knows well . 
It had no chance to learn - and probably never will - that picnic tables and garbage cans are defended by forest rangers with orders to kill . 
How much luckier we humans are , knowing what is good and bad for us . 
We cannot be trapped so easily by things that taste good but will cause our downfall . 
But , in reality , most of us are no different from that bear . 
Most people are aware that high-fat diets , too much alcohol , smoking , promiscuous sex , and recreational drugs , while pleasant , can ruin one &apos;s health . 
Yet we can &apos;t resist the lure of the garbage can and its delights . 
There are other potentially harmful pleasures in the environment that are less known , but not less destructive than those that are . 
One of the most seductive of these pleasures - and thus one of the most dangerous - is television . 
Television is attractive to the architecture of the human nervous system : our brains are built to absorb information and follow rapid changes in the sensory field . 
TV provides these in easily digestible , sumptuously prepared morsels . 
Constant change and the appearance of excitement absorb viewers &quot; attention . 
The Sistine Chapel cannot compare with it - most children will become bored after ten minutes by the frescoes of Michelangelo , but will watch a detergent commercial with riveted interest . 
All of this applies just to the way the medium works , without taking content into consideration . 
The content in turn reinforces the seductive qualities of the medium by offering generous helpings of sex , violence , easy comfort , and other material that we are genetically prepared to respond to , but that in large doses detract from the ability to lead productive and serene lives . 
Indeed , by now the evidence that television watching is a dangerous habit has grown to such proportions that it is a wonder that stronger warnings and effective prevention have not been adopted . 
Among the many findings is that watching too much television induces passivity , both at the level of neural functioning and of behavior and that it interferes with learning and reduces political and civic participation . 
It also encourages aggressive behavior in children and produces negative moods such as sadness and loneliness . 
Nor is there any evidence of benefits to counterbalance these negative effects . 
When television was in its infancy , many thinkers Â­ and not surprisingly , television producers - painted the future of the medium in glowing terms : TV would keep us informed , cultured , and entertained ; it would strengthen family life and civic virtues . 
None of this happened . 
Even the informational value of television turned out to be a dream : individuals and communities that watch TV often know much less about what is happening in the world than comparable audiences that do not . 
The only clearly positive effect of TV watching is that people feel relaxed while doing it , and many people are willing to exchange that relaxation for the more enjoyable and useful things they might be doing instead . 
Like the bear that learned to fill his stomach comfortably , they feel satisfied to be entertained without having to exert themselves . 
Of course , television can be nice when consumed in small doses and with discernment . 
Like drinking a glass or two of wine , it helps digestion and lightens the mind . 
But those who spend hours watching it each evening , with less and less control over their attention , and deriving progressively less enjoyment from what they watch , risk becoming as besotted as an alcoholic who only feels alive when he blots out reality . 
No bear , if it knew what we do , would fall into that trap .
