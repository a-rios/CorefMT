Wild about Risk 
Most people do not feel the same impulse to go out and buy insurance , or diversify their investments , as they do to buy a sofa or new clothes . 
They should , but they don &apos;t . 
Insurance , investment , and banking institutions have historically had to fight an uphill battle to get individuals , businesses , and government to pay for risk management . 
Their successes , while impressive , remain incomplete : people still have difficulty facing the inherent risks and uncertainties about their economic future . 
This is why almost every advanced country has mandatory social security and health insurance programs . 
Of course , people are not really unaware of life &apos;s big risks . 
We simply ignore them for reasons that are rooted in human psychology . 
The link between intellectual recognition of risks and the impetus to act against them is mediated by fear : we have been programmed over millions of years of evolution to take decisive action against immediate and obvious threats . 
If a menacing wild animal approaches , we feel fear and anxiety . 
Adrenaline flows , our attention is focussed , and our instinct to protect friends and family aroused . 
But more remote risks simply do not stimulate our emotions , so we often postpone taking action indefinitely . 
We are also more afraid of well-publicized risks - especially those that can kill us in grisly ways . 
After the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the US , many Americans drove to distant locations rather than fly , even though statistics showed that flying remained far safer . 
Meanwhile , many of these same people were probably among the millions of Americans who didn &apos;t get an annual medical check-up . 
Measuring risks , especially important long-term ones , is imprecise and difficult . 
Virtually none of the economic statistics reported in the media measure risk . 
To fully comprehend risk , we must stretch our imagination to think of all the different ways that things can go wrong , including things that have not happened in recent memory . 
We must protect ourselves against fallacies , such as thinking that just because a risk has not proved damaging for decades , it no longer exists . 
Yet another psychological barrier is a sort of ego involvement in our own success . 
Our tendency to take full credit for our successes discourages us from facing up to the possibility of loss or failure , because considering such prospects calls into question our self-satisfaction . 
Indeed , self-esteem is one of the most powerful human needs : a view of our own success relative to others provides us with a sense of meaning and well-being . 
So accepting the essential randomness of life is terribly difficult , and contradicts our deep psychological need for order and accountability . 
We often do not protect the things that we have - such as our opportunities to earn income and accumulate wealth - because we mistakenly believe that our own natural superiority will do that for us . 
This tendency is especially apparent when it comes to public policy . 
Government leaders find it hard to address economic risks to the nation because it is impolitic to call into question the self-esteem of their constituency . 
But no one who looks at the matter seriously can argue that the tremendous inequality between the world &apos;s nations reflects fundamental differences in inherent ability or immutable character . 
The per capita GDP of India in 2000 , for example , was only 7 % of that of the US . 
Can anyone believe that this is because Americans are 14 times smarter or 14 times better in character than Indians ? 
Obviously , these two countries &apos; relative positions are due to circumstances that can be changed , or that will change in response to economic events and political decisions . 
But the leaders of the world &apos;s rich countries have great difficulty addressing risks to their relative success vis-Ã -vis less developed countries , because national self-esteem is too tied up with it . 
Citizens in advanced countries just can &apos;t believe - and don &apos;t want to be told - that their privileged status may be dissipated unless proper steps are taken to insure against the risks they face . 
For example , the world &apos;s advanced countries are scarcely less dependent on oil today than they were in 1973 , when the OPEC embargo stifled their economies and sent prices soaring . 
Despite occasional efforts at conservation , rich countries always go back to &quot; business as usual . &quot; 
Most companies are no better at managing or even recognizing the different kinds of economic risks that their workers face . 
Many maintain insurance and pensions for their employees , but also encourage their workers to trust the company to provide for them forever , and even to invest in the company &apos;s stock . 
When an employee is laid off in middle age , or the company goes bankrupt , the suddenly materialized risk may come as a shock . 
Clearly , establishing mandatory social security and health insurance programs , and a social safety net for the poor , has helped hedge the most fundamental risks that people face . 
The problem is the lack of any coherent policy for ensuring that individuals are protected against a broader array of economic risks to their incomes , investments , and homes . 
So new risk management institutions need to be devised . 
They should use markets , rather than state guarantees , and while they should not be mandatory , they must be designed in accordance with humans &apos; psychological limitations , so that people will use them . 
We know enough about risk perception to recognize that helping people cope with the risks of modern life requires addressing their hearts as well as their heads .
