North Korea &apos;s Missile Tantrum 
SEOUL - Once again , tension is rising across Asia over North Korea &apos;s missile program . 
Unlike its previous &quot; surprise &quot; missile launches , North Korea &apos;s government this time notified international agencies in advance that it will launch a &quot; satellite &quot; sometime between April 4 and 8 . 
The question for the world now is not whether the North Korean regime will launch its missile , but what happens afterward . 
The United States , Japan , and South Korea have already publicly condemned the launch as a &quot; provocative act &quot; and a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 , adopted in October 2006 , five days after North Korea conducted a nuclear weapons test . 
But , instead of hot rhetoric , what is needed now is a cool-headed assessment of the military implications of the missile launch . 
If Japan , the US , and others attempt to intercept or counter the missile , military tension - even possible combat - is likely to ensue . 
How to prevent unnecessary military measures and countermeasures is the most immediate concern for the region &apos;s governments . 
Above all , the ongoing six-party talks ( China , the US , Japan , Russia , South Korea , and North Korea ) that have sought to bring North Korea &apos;s nuclear program to an end must not become a casualty of the missile launch . 
In dealing with North Korea , two fundamental issues must be addressed . 
First , although governments are justified in criticizing North Korea for its foolhardy , counterproductive , and self-destructive behavior over many years , including numerous inhuman acts perpetrated against its own people and others , North Korea is not solely to blame for its &quot; missile tantrum . &quot; 
Indeed , the Bush administration &apos;s unilateral behavior , including the dismantling of the 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework with North Korea , the hyping of an enriched uranium deal , and the infamous &quot; axis of evil &quot; speech , have all increased the paranoia of an already paranoid regime . 
So former President Bush &apos;s foreign policy toward North Korea , especially during his first term in office , must take a fair share of responsibility for the present mess . 
More fundamentally , no one should think that North Korea &apos;s totalitarian communist system can be changed overnight . 
No one inside or outside can remove its anachronistic dynastic-communist regime , and no outsider can hope to modify quickly the policy behavior of its fossilized military , party , and administrative bureaucrats . 
These are the cold realities of North Korea today . 
But cold realities do not necessarily have to turn into hot combat . 
Indeed , the idea of warfare on the Korean peninsula should be unthinkable , given the grotesque levels of deaths that it would likely cause . 
Even to contemplate such a possibility is proof of diplomatic failure , not a triumph of real leadership . 
A leadership mismatch has , moreover , been a central obstacle in resolving the problem of North Korea &apos;s weapons of mass destruction and the ultimate question of achieving a unified Korea . 
Since the emergence of two separate regimes and systems on the Korean Peninsula in 1948 , South Korea and the US ( its only defense ally ) have dealt with only two &quot; supreme leaders , &quot; Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il . 
During the same period , there have been 10 South Korean presidents and 11 US presidents . 
For the past 10 years , three South Korean presidents and three US presidents have been attempting to deal with the same &quot; perpetual &quot; leader - Kim Jong-il . 
From Kim &apos;s perspective , encountering such leadership changes and subsequent policy clashes are both bewildering and difficult to assimilate . 
Just on the South Korean side , he has had to cope with Kim Dae-jung &apos;s &quot; sunshine policy &quot; of engagement , Roh Moo-hyun &apos;s on again , off again diplomacy , and current President Lee Myung-bak &apos;s confrontational stance . 
From the US , he has confronted engagement on the part of Bill Clinton , unilateral confrontation from George W. Bush , and the nascent &quot; principled engagement &quot; of Barack Obama . 
This form of leadership mismatch has also disturbed relations between South Korea and the US . 
When they do , both sides must spend an enormous amount of time and effort in reaching a consensus on North Korea , which leaves the isolated North breeding all sorts of conspiracy theories . 
The Korean question is even more intractable and perplexing if the leadership changes of other concerned parties in the region such as China , Japan , and Russia are factored into the political equation . 
The long-term result of all this is oscillation between dialogue and deadlock , which has led to periods of uncertain engagement or heated confrontation . 
To break this sterile cycle , what is needed now is not more hot rhetoric about North Korea &apos;s missiles , but a commitment to steady , patient diplomacy that transcends changes in the political cycle . 
There is no quick fix in disentangling the Korean knot . 
Only persistence and commitment will do .
