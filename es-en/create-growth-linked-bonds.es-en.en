Create Growth-Linked Bonds 
A year ago , at the Summit of the Americas , 34 western hemisphere heads of state agreed to promote the creation of government-issued growth-linked bonds whose payout is tied to gross domestic product ( GDP ) . 
Only one major proposal related to such bonds , from Argentina , is on the table . 
A unique opportunity to strengthen the world &apos;s financial infrastructure and increase economic efficiency for many years to come could be slipping away . 
I have argued for growth-linked bonds since my 1993 book Macro Markets . 
GDP is the most comprehensive measure we have of an economy &apos;s success . 
The simplest form of growth-linked bonds would be a long-term government security that pays a regular dividend proportional to the GDP of the issuing country . 
Suppose that the Argentine government issued perpetual bonds that paid an annual dividend equal to one ten-billionth of Argentine GDP , payable in pesos . 
Because Argentina &apos;s annual GDP now runs at about 500 billion pesos , one of these bonds today would pay a dividend of 50 pesos ( about $ 17 or â‚¬ 13 ) a year . 
The dividend would rise or fall as the success of Argentina &apos;s economy is revealed through time . 
The market for GDP-linked bonds would arrive at a price that makes them attractive to investors , reflecting expectations and uncertainties about the issuing country &apos;s future . 
Until there is a market for such bonds , we cannot know what the price will be . 
What will happen to Argentina in the next 25 years ? 
Argentina &apos;s long-term GDP growth has been disappointing . 
In fact , real GDP per capita declined 15 % over the 25-year period from 1965 to 1990 - a period that saw some Asian economies quintuple in size . 
But the 8 % real GDP growth recorded in 2004 might encourage some to expect a surge in economic performance , as has occurred elsewhere in the world . 
Could there be another decline in Argentina ? 
Or a huge growth breakthrough ? 
Nobody knows . 
The economic costs implied by this uncertainty could be reduced if there were a market for growth risk . 
Indeed , Argentina &apos;s economy would be better off today if Argentina had borrowed in terms linked to its GDP decades ago rather than at an interest rate denominated in dollars . 
Its foreign debt would have declined in line with its GDP , thus sheltering the economy from default and economic disaster . 
To be sure , investors would have then lost on their bet on Argentina &apos;s growth , but they would still have been protected against inflation , even if their bonds had not been denominated in dollars ( because Argentina &apos;s nominal GDP would have moved up with inflation ) . 
Can we engineer new debt contracts for countries like Argentina ? 
The stumbling block has been potential investors &quot; fear that accounting fiascos in emerging countries would render the bonds unsafe . 
If you don &apos;t trust the numbers , you can &apos;t trust the debt . 
Clearly , more work is needed to improve the quality of the numbers . 
In the meantime , we should not give up on trying to create these bonds . 
Instead , advanced countries should issue them first . 
True , advanced economies are relatively more stable , which means that the bonds would have a less distinctive risk-management advantage . 
But the demonstration effect would be immediate . 
Once any major country develops a market for GDP-linked debt , the concept will be established , making it much easier for other countries to join in . 
The spread of inflation-indexed bonds serves as a historical precedent . 
Finland was the first to issue national inflation-indexed bonds , in 1946 , in response to massive wartime price growth . 
Israel and Iceland were next , in 1955 , followed by Brazil , Chile , Columbia , Argentina , the UK , Australia , Mexico , Canada , Sweden , New Zealand , the US , France , Japan , and Italy . 
It took a long time , but the contagion of a sound financial idea has been unmistakable . 
GDP-linked bonds would also allow hedging the risk of inflation , plus respond to GDP growth . 
Some will object that there is little point in creating GDP-linked bonds in advanced countries , because there is little uncertainty about GDP growth there . 
However , even in the relative calm of the post-war era , long-term real GDP growth in advanced countries has been rather variable . 
For example , US real per capita GDP grew by a factor of 1.87 - that is , nearly doubled in size - from 1961 to 1986 , but by a factor of only 1.58 from 1978 to 2003 . 
Such differences in 25-year growth rates are important : if US GDP grows by a factor of 1.87 over the next 25 years , annual GDP will be $ 3.6 trillion ( $ 10,000 per person ) higher than if it grows by a factor of only 1.58 . 
Much of today &apos;s debates about the future of old-age pensions hinges on this uncertainty . 
If the economy grows rapidly , there will be no problem ; if it does not , a pension crisis looms . 
Creating a marketplace where such uncertainties are traded and hedged would be a fundamental step toward managing the risks involved . 
If personal pension accounts or provident funds are invested in GDP-linked bonds , the payments that retirees receive in 25 years will reflect the growth rate of the economy - and that of the tax base - to that date , which all makes good sense . 
Sweden &apos;s pension system recently created a link between national income growth and benefits , but the reforms did not include creating GDP-linked bonds , a natural adjunct to such a scheme . 
At a time when many advanced countries run government deficits , GDP-linked bonds would improve risk management and bring down financing costs . 
They might also spur developing countries to do what it takes to join that market .
