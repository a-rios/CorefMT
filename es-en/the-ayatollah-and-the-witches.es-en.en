The Ayatollah and the Witches 
WASHINGTON , DC - Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has now made the mistake that all Iranian presidents make : he has challenged the authority of the country &apos;s Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
He is doomed to fail . 
The challenge posed by Ahmadinejad is such a predictable part of Iranian politics that it has come to be known as &quot; the president &apos;s symptom . &quot; 
It emerges from a president &apos;s confidence that , as a popularly elected leader , he should not be constrained by the Supreme Leader &apos;s oversight . 
But the Islamic Republic &apos;s history is littered with its presidents &quot; failed attempts to consolidate an independent power center . Ultimately , divine authority trumps political authority . 
This dual authority is embedded in the Islamic Republic &apos;s constitution , and inevitably tilts toward the divine , particularly in a president &apos;s second term . 
Ahmadinejad is not an exception to this rule . 
In fact , because he has pushed harder than his predecessors , his star is falling faster . 
Moreover , the controversial presidential election of June 2009 , and the political crisis that ensued , irreparably damaged Ahmadinejad &apos;s democratic legitimacy . 
Khamenei was forced to use his authority to support the president , and has since repeatedly condemned the &quot; Green Movement &quot; that opposed Ahmadinejad &apos;s re-election . 
As a result , Ahmadinejad has been the most costly president for Khamenei to date , because he forced the Supreme Leader to deplete his power in the face of a common enemy - a move that called into question his own judgment and tarnished his reputation . 
Ahmadinejad himself , however , has generally ignored the post-election crisis in his public statements , and evidently believed that Khamenei &apos;s post-election support meant that the Supreme Leader would remain passive in the face of encroachments on his traditional powers and prerogatives . 
Indeed , for the last two years , Ahmadinejad has repeatedly undermined parliament , and abruptly dismissed ministers tied to Khamenei , like Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki and Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi . 
Since becoming Supreme Leader 22 years ago , Khamenei has been relatively weak , but has adapted by seeking to encourage weakness in the Islamic Republic &apos;s other high offices . 
He has supported factionalization in the government , and , when necessary , has weakened factions that he previously supported . 
Most importantly , he has ensured that Iran &apos;s presidents remain weak , regardless of their agenda or popularity . 
So , now that the threat posed by the Green Movement has diminished - at least in Khamenei &apos;s eyes - the time has come to call Ahmadinejad to account . 
Both men are hard at work preparing for the March 2012 parliamentary election , as well as the 2013 presidential election , and Khamenei has taken off the gloves . 
He has given official propagandists the green light to attack Ahmadinejad and his cronies explicitly , portraying them as people who do not believe in the principle of the guardianship of the Shia jurist , the key concept bequeathed by the Islamic Republic &apos;s founder , Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . 
In the official view , Ahmadinejad and his circle lack rationality and wisdom ; indeed , they are said to be in the grip of superstition . 
There are even rumors that some of them have resorted to witchcraft to summon spirits from beyond the grave , and that Ahmadinejad has had direct contact with the hidden Imam ( the Shia messiah ) . 
Likewise , the judiciary , under Khamenei &apos;s control , has accused the vice president , Mohammad Reza Rahimi , of leading an economic mafia , and many of Ahmadinejad &apos;s allies have been arrested or are under investigation . 
It is likely that the Guardian Council , which can veto legislation and bar candidates from standing in elections , will use its power to shift the balance in favor of Ahmadinejad &apos;s conservative critics . 
The anti-Ahmadinejad camp &apos;s leaders , the brothers Ali and Sadeq Larijani , who head the parliament and judiciary , respectively , will help Khamenei to push the president from the center of power . 
But , since Khamenei cannot accept a single , united political faction , it is extremely unlikely that he will let the Larijani camp ( which includes Tehran Mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati ) become powerful enough to win the next presidential election . 
Khamenei will likely create a new faction to compete with traditional conservatives after Ahmadinejad &apos;s decline . 
This might force him to pick a new face for the next presidential election , someone with little domestic-policy experience and little influence on ordinary people &apos;s lives . 
One possible candidate is Said Jalili , Iran &apos;s current nuclear negotiator , or someone like him . 
Only those with a strong background in intelligence or the Revolutionary Guards , and a low profile in domestic politics , need apply . 
Having full control over the judiciary , the intelligence apparatus , and the military makes Khamenei seem invincible against all political factions or elected officials . 
This will lead the regime down an increasingly autocratic path , applying more aggression at home and defying the West with greater self-confidence . 
But the concentration of power in the Supreme Leader &apos;s hands poses risks for the Islamic Republic . 
When Khamenei dies , there is no strong and obvious successor . 
And , since he has systematically weakened Iran &apos;s political institutions so that the Islamic Republic itself has come to be identified with his person , his absence will create a vacuum . 
His strength today foreshadows greater uncertainty in Iran &apos;s future .
