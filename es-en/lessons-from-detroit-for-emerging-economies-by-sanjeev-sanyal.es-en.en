The Detroit Syndrome 
SINGAPORE - When the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy last week , it became the largest such filing in United States history . 
Detroit &apos;s population has dropped from 1.8 million in 1950 , when it was America &apos;s fifth-largest city , to less than 700,000 today . 
Its industrial base lies shattered . 
And yet we live in a world where cities have never had it so good . 
More than half of the world &apos;s population is urban , for the first time in history , and urban hubs generate an estimated 80 % of global GDP . 
These proportions will rise even higher as emerging-market countries urbanize rapidly . 
So , what can the world learn from Detroit &apos;s plight ? 
As recently as the 1990 &quot; s , many experts were suggesting that technology would make cities irrelevant . 
It was believed that the Internet and mobile communications , then infant technologies , would make it unnecessary for people to live in crowded and expensive urban hubs . 
Instead , cities like New York and London have experienced sharp increases in population since 1990 , after decades of decline . 
One factor that has helped cities is the nature of twenty-first century life . 
Previously , life in developed countries was based on daily routines : people went to work in offices and factories , returned home to eat dinner with their families , watched their favorite television programs , went to sleep , and repeated the cycle when they awoke . 
Such regular cycles no longer apply to most peoples &quot; lives . 
In the course of a work day , people mix and match many activities - they may work at a desk , but they may also meet a friend for lunch , go to the gym , do chores , travel on business , shop online , and so on . 
Similarly , time at home is no longer clearly demarcated , with people working online or participating in conference calls even as they manage their family life . 
We have discovered that this multi-tasking life is best done in cities , which concentrate a multiplicity of hard amenities - airports , shops , schools , parks , and sports facilities - as well as soft amenities like clubs , bars , and restaurants . 
Another factor is that cities have increased in importance as hubs for innovation and creativity . 
Until the nineteenth century , innovation was carried out mostly by generalists and tinkerers , which meant that the accumulation of new knowledge was slow , but that its diffusion across different fields was rapid . 
In the twentieth century , knowledge creation became the job of specialists , which accelerated knowledge creation but retarded inter-disciplinary application . 
But recent studies have shown that this source of innovation is rapidly decelerating ( the productivity of an American research worker may now be less than 15 % of a similar researcher in 1950 ) . 
Instead , innovation is increasingly based on mixing and matching knowledge from different specializations . 
Certain cities are ideally suited for this , because they concentrate different kinds of human capital and encourage random interactions between people with different knowledge and skills . 
The problem with this post-industrial urban model is that it strongly favors generalist cities that can cluster different kinds of soft and hard amenities and human capital . 
Indeed , the growth dynamic can be so strong for some successful cities that they can hollow out smaller rivals ( for example , London vis-Ã -vis the cities of northern England ) . 
Some specialist cities could also do well in this world . 
All of this has important implications for emerging economies . 
As it transformed itself into the &quot; factory of the world , &quot; the share of China &apos;s urban population jumped from 26.4 % in 1990 to around 53 % today . 
The big , cosmopolitan cities of Beijing and Shanghai have grown dramatically , but the bulk of the urban migration has been to cookie-cutter small and medium-size industrial towns that have mushroomed over the last decade . 
By clustering industrial infrastructure and using the hukou system of city-specific residency permits , the authorities have been able to control the process surprisingly well . 
This process of urban growth , however , is about to unravel . 
As China shifts its economic model away from heavy infrastructure investment and bulk manufacturing , many of these small industrial cities will lose their core industry . 
Meanwhile , the post-industrial attractions of cities like Shanghai and Beijing will attract the more talented and better-educated children of today &apos;s industrial workers . 
Unlike rural migrants heading for industrial jobs , it will be much more difficult to guide educated and creative professionals using the hukou system . 
The boom in the successful cities , therefore , will hollow out human capital from less attractive industrial hubs , which will then fall into a vicious cycle of decay and falling productivity . 
Stories like Detroit &apos;s have played out several times in developed countries during the last half-century . 
That is why China needs to prepare for this moment . 
Rather than building ever more cookie-cutter industrial towns , China needs to refit and upgrade its existing cities . 
As its population begins to shrink , it may even be worthwhile to shut down unviable cities and consolidate . 
Detroit &apos;s fate should serve as a warning , not only for China , but for the next generation of urbanizing countries ( for example , India ) as well .
