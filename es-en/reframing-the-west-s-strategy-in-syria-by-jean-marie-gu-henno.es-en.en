The West &apos;s Second Chance in Syria 
NEW YORK - The last-minute agreement between Russia and the United States to put Syria &apos;s chemical weapons under international control gives the West , which had run out of good options , a second chance to reach what always should have been its strategic goal : peace in Syria and an end to its people &apos;s suffering . 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov took advantage of Western leaders &quot; failure to formulate a clear central objective . 
Did they hope to end Syria &apos;s civil war by forcing a military stalemate , or to bring about the demise of President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime ? 
Did they want to strengthen international law barring the use of chemical weapons , or to send Iran a signal about their determination to enforce &quot; red lines &quot; ? 
The Russian proposal forced the West to choose prohibition of chemical weapons as its immediate goal . 
Given that this is one of the few areas of possible agreement in the United Nations Security Council , it is a good starting point to repair badly damaged relations among the Council &apos;s five permanent members ( China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the US ) . 
Of course , the deal may prove to be little more than a diversion , breaking the momentum toward military action but failing to achieve its goal . 
Its implementation will be a test of Russia &apos;s good faith . 
For their part , Western countries must avoid the traps of the difficult negotiation process that the deal demands , without losing sight of their strategic goal of ending the conflict . 
The complex process of securing and destroying Syria &apos;s chemical arsenal promises to be next to impossible in the midst of a civil war . 
To succeed , Western leaders must reframe their approach to the Syrian endgame , rejecting the assumptions that have shaped their policies since the beginning of the crisis . 
The West &apos;s fundamental mistake has been consistently to underestimate the Assad regime &apos;s resilience . 
Despite its brutality , the Assad government retains a substantial base of supporters who are willing to fight to the death to prevent the regime &apos;s collapse . 
Indeed , many Syrians believe that they have no future if Assad &apos;s government collapses - a belief that has been reinforced as the civil war &apos;s dividing lines have become increasingly sectarian . 
With regime supporters &quot; physical survival seemingly at stake , the expectation of a quick collapse was illusory . 
More problematic , the West &apos;s loud calls for Assad &apos;s exit from power , though now muted , have given false hope to the opposition , while Russia has been hiding behind the rhetoric of a &quot; Syrian-led process &quot; to avoid confronting its international responsibilities . 
The alternative - an attempt at negotiation between Syria &apos;s government and an increasingly fragmented opposition - would serve only to prolong the war and raise the death toll . 
Likewise , the West must recognize that reconciliation in Syria will be impossible without reconciliation between the Sunni and Shia regimes in the wider region . 
Several of the Sunni-ruled Gulf monarchies view Syria &apos;s crisis and the prospect of Assad &apos;s demise as an opportunity to compensate for Iraq &apos;s rapprochement with Iran following the fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Sunni regime and the emergence of a Shia-led government . 
A year ago , the US , the UK , and France appeared to side with Saudi Arabia when they rejected former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan &apos;s request that Iran be invited to the first attempt in Geneva to negotiate a settlement of Syria &apos;s civil war . 
They probably feared that Iran &apos;s participation in the talks would enable Iranian leaders to link efforts to end the Syrian crisis to negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program , enhancing their ability to resist international demands that the program be terminated . 
But , while Iran &apos;s direct involvement in Syria - where its own Revolutionary Guards , along with its Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah , are fighting in support of Assad - is part of the problem , a long-term solution is virtually impossible without Iranian participation . 
Indeed , the Middle East cannot achieve long-term stability while Iran is excluded from negotiations and the Shia-Sunni schism is allowed to deepen . 
Although it is too soon to tell what , if anything , will come of the current diplomatic charm offensive by Iran &apos;s more moderate new president , Hassan Rouhani , it might herald an important shift in Iranian policy that could ultimately enable regional reconciliation . 
With the entire Middle East undergoing a generational transformation , regional challenges cannot be addressed separately . 
Only a unified , comprehensive approach can manage the forces driving momentous change in the Middle East , prevent outside powers &quot; rivalries from complicating the situation further , and ensure a peaceful outcome . 
With emerging regional powers increasingly challenging the capacity of the Security Council &apos;s permanent members to shape events in the Middle East , there is no time to waste . 
The West &apos;s lofty and self-serving rhetoric has not helped to end Syria &apos;s conflict ; it may even have made the situation more dangerous . 
Although the Russian initiative is not without pitfalls , it could be a crucial launchpad for more serious and constructive engagement with Syria - and with the rest of the Middle East .
