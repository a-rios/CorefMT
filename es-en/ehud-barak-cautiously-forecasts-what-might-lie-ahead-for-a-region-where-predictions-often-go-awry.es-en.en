Middle East Security in 2014 
JERUSALEM - The Middle East is a region where predictions go to die . 
And the region &apos;s recent turbulence has made forecasting the course of events there even more treacherous . 
But , as became increasingly clear in 2013 , the main source of the Middle East &apos;s crises is not a &quot; clash of civilizations , &quot; but a clash within Islam , centered on the Sunni-Shia divide . 
The civilian death toll from this struggle is staggering . 
The combined figure for Afghanistan , Egypt , Iraq , Libya , and Syria is now approaching many hundreds of thousands - perhaps ten times the total death toll of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1948 - while millions more are leading squalid lives as refugees . 
With the Arab Spring now frozen over , the regional outlook for 2014 appears gloomy . 
Some opportunities are still on the table , and more will surely emerge during the coming year . 
But seizing them will demand global leadership , strategic clarity , nuance , and decisiveness - almost all of which were absent in 2013 . 
Indeed , there is a spreading perception among world leaders and publics , adversaries and allies alike , that the longtime incumbent global leader , the United States , has been significantly weakened . 
Consider President Barack Obama &apos;s failure to defend his &quot; red line &quot; after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime used chemical weapons this past summer ; Egypt &apos;s return to military rule ; 
As a result of American uncertainty , the radical axis of Iran , Syria , and Hezbollah feels emboldened , and will certainly try to leverage its achievements in the year ahead . 
Assad ended up using the shock caused by his chemical-weapons attack as a bargaining chip in a disarmament deal - still to be executed and verified - that bought him a valuable pause in the efforts to topple him , if not salvation . 
Assad will seek in 2014 to delay the actual implementation of the chemical-weapons deal , in order to gain time to split and weaken his opponents further . 
He could then muddle through until the US mid-term elections in November , when attacking him would be politically impossible . 
There is a good chance that he will get away with it . 
Hezbollah will support Assad to the end , because his continuing hold on power is critical to its own survival . 
The Syrian rebels , weakened by infighting , have also been victims of the growing rift between the US and its closest Arab allies . 
Short of a successful attack on Assad himself , the chances of a rebel triumph on the ground are slim . 
Renewed peace negotiations in Geneva next year can succeed only if Assad comes to the table substantially weaker , which probably will not happen . 
Israel will continue to act proactively to prevent the transfer of heavy missiles or advanced air-defense systems from Syria to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon , which of course carries the risk of a military showdown . 
But such pre-emptive measures could also promote Lebanon &apos;s survival by preventing Hezbollah from gaining absolute dominance over the country . 
Though Assad may survive for now , Syria , like Iraq and Libya , faces creeping disintegration into more ethnically homogenous sub-entities , either completely separate or very loosely tied together , similar to post-Tito Yugoslavia , where communal rage filled the political void left by the dictator &apos;s iron fist . 
Paradoxically , disintegration in the Arab world is taking place just when Iran is emerging from its decades-long diplomatic deep freeze . 
Following the six-month interim agreement on its nuclear program reached in Geneva in November , Iran &apos;s military nuclear program may be stopped temporarily . 
But Iran got relief from crippling international sanctions at a low price ; and , because the two-phase structure of the interim agreement delays verification of its success or failure , the true test for Iran - and the world - is still to come . 
The immediate risk is that Iran still possesses the capability to enrich uranium , as well as a substantial amount of low-enriched uranium . 
The decision about how to proceed is Iran &apos;s , and its rulers will most likely simply wait for an opportunity to charge ahead toward nuclear capability when the US is unable , for whatever reasons , to respond . 
This might take 6-12 months , with some risks from the Iranians &quot; point of view ; but once they have enough weapon-grade material , nothing could be done to stop Iran from becoming a military nuclear power . 
Both Pakistan and North Korea took that path . 
And , following America &apos;s Syrian zigzag , the Iranians are convinced that , for the time being , a physical attack ( at least by the US ) is not on the table . 
The consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran could be devastating for regional order and global stability . 
Saudi Arabia might have nuclear weapons within weeks , with Turkey and Egypt feeling compelled to follow . 
The international non-proliferation regime would collapse . 
Hegemonic Iran would intimidate its Gulf neighbors , sponsor terrorist activities abroad , and feel immune from international intervention . 
Of course , if negotiations on a permanent agreement collapse , Israel and probably even the US might feel compelled to contemplate further action . 
But , for now , Iran &apos;s leaders clearly believe that they have bought themselves time . 
Moreover , in six months , Iran might propose another slightly modified interim agreement with a further loosening of sanctions , leveraging once again the paralysis imposed by election-year dynamics on American decision-making . 
Such a strategy could drag the permanent phase of the agreement far beyond 2014 . 
Iranians are chess players ; they know what a gambit is . 
The only solution - for which there is still time - is to find a way to tell the Iranians unequivocally : &quot; We respect your needs . 
We will not embarrass you in public . 
But you should understand that we mean business . 
You will have to dismantle the military nuclear program in the coming few months , or face the consequences . &quot; 
Such a message has never reached Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
Without hearing and believing it , there is no way that he will yield .
