Was Killing Bin Laden a Mistake ? 
LONDON - &quot; He lived a hero , he died a martyr ... if they killed one Osama , a thousand others will be born , &quot; says a comment on a Facebook group called &quot; We are all Osama bin Laden . &quot; 
The group was formed one hour after US President Barack Obama &apos;s announcement of the Al Qaeda leader &apos;s death . 
That Facebook group already has around 30,000 &quot; likes . &quot; 
Moreover , there are more than 50 similar groups on Facebook . 
Reaction to Bin Laden &apos;s death on Al Jazeera and other Arabic news outlets has been mixed . 
Some view the man considered a mass murderer in the West as an icon , and his death and burial at sea at the hands of American forces will not undermine that perception in the eyes of his sympathizers . 
Indeed , Egypt &apos;s former Mufti , Sheikh Nasr Farid Wasil , has already declared Bin Laden a martyr , &quot; because he was killed by the hands of the enemy . &quot; 
( Sheikh Wasil , it should be made known , has no links or known sympathies for Al Qaeda and he represents a very different Islamic school of thought . ) 
Aside from the mixed signals online , in the virtual world , the critical question is whether eliminating Bin Laden marks the beginning of Al Qaeda &apos;s demise in reality . 
Some terrorist organizations have , of course , collapsed following the death of their charismatic leader . 
The case of Shoko Asahara , the founder of Aum Shinrikyo ( the Japanese group that organized the Sarin gas attack on Tokyo &apos;s subway in 1995 ) , comes to mind here . 
But capturing and trying violent leaders is probably a better marker of the end of such organizations - the chances of such an outcome being higher when such leaders recant their views and call on their followers to lay down their arms . 
Abimael Guzm√°n , the leader of the Maoist Shining Path in Peru , and Abdullah Ocalan , the leader of the Kurdistan Workers &quot; Party ( PKK ) in Turkey , are notable examples of this . 
By contrast , far from causing the demise of an armed movement , the killing of a charismatic leader at the hands of his enemies can transform such a figure into a martyr . 
Che Guevera was far more valuable to leftist militancy after his death than he was while alive . 
Armed Islamism has its particularities , of course , but it also shares important characteristics with some of these groups , including the relationship between the physical elimination of a leader and organizational survival . 
Decentralized organizations with relevant ideologies , operating in contexts full of conditions conducive to armed action , usually survive leadership losses , whereas hierarchical , cult-like organizations often do not . 
Since 9 / 11 , Al Qaeda has been far from a hierarchical , cult-like organization . 
Abu Musab al-Zaraqawi &apos;s Al Qaeda offshoot in Iraq demonstrates this well : the group was called Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia for recruitment and propaganda purposes , but it was quite autonomous organizationally and operationally . 
When Bin Laden &apos;s close collaborator Ayman al-Zawahiri asked al-Zaraqawi to avoid targeting Shiites , al-Zaraqawi instead escalated the violence against them . 
Al Qaeda &apos;s franchise model applies to Algeria , Yemen , North Mali , and Somalia as well . 
And , like guerrilla movements of yore , Al Qaeda partakes of &quot; ideological front &quot; tactics : small urban cells and / or vulnerable individuals subscribe to the ideology and self-recruit or self-start an affiliated cell . 
In all of its decentralized modes of operation , Bin Laden mainly played the role of inspirational guide and iconic figurehead - a role better played when dead by American guns than alive , hiding from them . 
Consider Sayyid Qutb , the Islamist intellectual who influenced Bin Laden and others . 
Qutb was executed by Gamel Abdel Nasser &apos;s dictatorship in Egypt in August 1966 , in an attempt to reduce his influence . 
That tactic backfired badly . 
Of the 98 fellow Muslim Brotherhood prisoners with whom Qutb discussed his new confrontational ideology in 1964 , 35 were strongly supportive , 23 strongly opposed , and 50 hesitant . 
Despite his intellectual status and prestige , Qutb had failed to persuade the majority of like-minded inmates under conditions of repression . 
But , no sooner was Qutb the intellectual executed than Qutb the grand martyr was born . 
His supporters soon numbered in the thousands , rather than the dozens , and he came to inspire generations , not just individual inmates . 
Moreover , Qutb was executed by an Arab Nationalist Muslim leader , whereas Bin Laden was killed by US Navy Seals . 
That makes a significant difference in the Muslim world . 
Imprisonment , followed by recantation of violence , has become almost a trend in several jihadist groups , notably the 20,000-strong Egyptian Islamic Group , factions of the al-Jihad Organization in Egypt , and smaller groups like the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group . 
Leading figures in armed Islamist movements have not only abandoned political violence , but have also de-legitimized it as a means for social and political change after spending periods in prison . 
For example , Sayyid Imam al-Sharif ( a.k.a. 
The same applies to the Islamic Group , a movement implicated in violent acts in almost a dozen countries throughout the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , including armed insurgency in Egypt , bombings in the United States and Croatia , assassination attempts in Ethiopia , and training camps in Afghanistan . 
In the 2000 &quot; s , the imprisoned leadership of the Group produced more than 25 books aimed at de-legitimizing political violence as a method for change . 
Eliminating the &quot; spiritual guide &quot; ( as opposed to the organizational leaders ) of a militant group might be perceived as a political victory for a government in the short term , but it probably makes a comprehensive de-radicalization process less likely , and it will not necessarily mean the end of the organization in question . 
For long-term results , capture is almost always more effective than killing .
