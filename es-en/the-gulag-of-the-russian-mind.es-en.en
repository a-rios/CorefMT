The Gulag of the Russian Mind 
It is now 15 years since the failed coup of August 1991 against Mikhail Gorbachev . 
At the time , Gorbachev &apos;s policies of perestroika and glasnost were seen by Soviet hardliners as a sell-out of communist Russia to the capitalist West . 
But it is now clear that the KGB and the military who launched the coup were not defending the idea of communism . 
Gorbachev &apos;s reforms not only liberated ordinary Russians from the straitjacket of Marxism-Leninism , but also released the national aspirations of people who had been locked in the empire for centuries . 
Having seen the peoples of Central Europe free themselves from Soviet domination just two years before , the constituent nations of the USSR were beginning to seek the same freedom for themselves . 
The Baltic republics of Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania were the first to insist on traveling their own national path , and have since linked their fate to Europe as members of the European Union and NATO . 
Others soon followed . 
By December 1991 , the Soviet empire was no more . 
But only the Baltics have secured the sort of independence dreamed of in 1991 . 
Georgia , which is both European and Asiatic , teeters on the edge of instability . 
Traditionally Asian Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have resumed the tribal forms of autocracy they practiced throughout the centuries . 
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have in essence become their presidents &quot; wholly owned family fiefs . 
Ukraine &apos;s break with Russia was perhaps the most wrenching , both for those in the Kremlin nostalgic for imperial control and for ordinary Russians who see Ukraine as the wellspring of Russian civilization . 
The Orange Revolution of 2004 , which overturned a rigged presidential election , proved that Ukraine was no longer a Malorossiya ( a small Russia ) , an inferior and subordinate Slavic brother . 
Indeed , that peaceful revolution , led by Viktor Yushchenko and Yuliya Tymoshenko , was a reminder of how enlightened Kievan Rus had been before it was forced to give way to the despotic princes of Moscow . 
Two years after the Orange revolt , Yushchenko ( a politician who seems out of his depth ) has now accepted the Kremlin placeman Viktor Yanukovych , the foe he had vanquished in 2004 , as his new prime minister . 
Nonetheless , the Orange movement - now led by Yushchenko &apos;s former partner and prime minister , Tymoshenko - has not fully lost its way , and still aims to preserve Ukraine as a truly independent and free country . 
Malorossiya , for the majority of Ukrainians , remains a thing of the past . 
Despite all these epochal changes , Russians cannot accept the loss of their imperial role . 
The dream of empire is , indeed , the gulag that imprisons the Russian mind . 
Most Russians do not regard Europe &apos;s approach to their country &apos;s borders as a sign that they have , at long last , fully united with the civilization of which they are a part , but as a source of insecurity . 
Something more is at work here than mere nostalgia . 
During the chaotic years of Boris Yeltsin &apos;s presidency , it was perhaps understandable that Russians regretted their loss of great power status . 
Something had to be blamed for their dire economic conditions . 
Yet under President Vladimir Putin , with the economy growing robustly , these feelings have hardened , not diminished . 
Russians are reverting to the past - to the grand pronouncements of Russia as a unique great nation , destined to rule the world . 
As before the advent of Gorbachev - indeed , restoring a centuries-old tendency - Russians yet again believe that the people should be willing to forfeit their freedoms for the sake of the greatness of the state , which wins wars and launches Sputniks . 
A free press , free speech , and free elections , it is feared , may diminish the brute power that is needed for Russia to assert itself . 
Russians have long boasted of their various unique forms of greatness : first it was the holy Russian soul , so superior to Western practicality . 
In the fifteenth century , Moscow was declared a &quot; Third Rome , &quot; the savior of spiritual Christianity . 
The seventeenth century united this spiritual mission with imperial expansion , which eventually encompassed a landmass spanning 11 times zones . 
In the early twentieth century , the imperial and spiritual mission became one , as Russia became the bastion of world communism . 
All these forms of greatness , however , demanded that ordinary Russians accept their debasement and enslavement . 
Development is not seen as a means of improving people &apos;s lives , but as helping Russia prove itself to be superior to everybody else . 
So , ultimately , the material achievements of Russian development always come with a body count . 
Joseph Stalin &apos;s industrialization killed millions - and became obsolete in only 30 years . 
Putin &apos;s Russia doesn &apos;t go in for mass killing , yet it has not lost the country &apos;s &quot; superiority &quot; complex . 
For Russia &apos;s elite , a restaurant bill cannot be too expensive , and one can never have enough bodyguards waiting out front for you . 
On a grander scale , Putin &apos;s Russia has become a great power in terms of energy production , but that looks to be temporary , as scant investment is being made to maintain and improve the oil and gas fields . 
What matters is selling the reserves and being rich now , not finding more for later . 
So , as always , the trouble with Russia is that the state develops , but society doesn &apos;t . 
The good of the people is sacrificed for the good of the nation . 
The dream of great Russia remains the gulag of the Russian mind .
