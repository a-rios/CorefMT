The Face of Evil 
NEW YORK - Standing with Slobodan Milosevic 13 years ago on the veranda of a government hunting lodge outside Belgrade , I saw two men in the distance . 
They left their twin Mercedes and , in fading light , started toward us . 
I felt a jolt go through my body ; they were unmistakable . 
Ratko Mladic , in combat fatigues , stocky , walking as though through a muddy field ; and Radovan Karadzic , taller , wearing a suit , with his wild , but carefully coiffed , shock of white hair . 
The capture of Karadzic and his arrival at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague took me back to a long night of confrontation , drama , and negotiations - the only time I ever met him . 
It was 5 p.m. on September 13 , 1995 , during the height of the war in Bosnia . 
After years of weak Western and United Nations response to Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Croats in Bosnia , United States-led NATO bombing had put the Serbs on the defensive . 
Our small diplomatic negotiating team was trying to end a war that had taken the lives of nearly 300,000 people . 
Milosevic , Mladic , and Karadzic were the primary reason for that war . 
Mladic and Karadzic had already been indicted as war criminals by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia . 
In a change of strategy , the negotiating team had decided to marginalize Karadzic and Mladic and to force Milosevic , as the senior Serb in the region , to take responsibility for the war and for the negotiations that we hoped would end it . 
Now Milosevic wanted to bring the two men back into the discussions , probably to take some of the pressure off of himself . 
We had anticipated this moment and agreed in advance that , while we would never ask to meet with Karadzic and Mladic , if Milosevic offered such a meeting , we would accept - but only once , and only under strict guidelines that would require Milosevic to be responsible for their behavior . 
I told each member of our negotiating team to decide for himself or herself whether to shake hands with the mass murderers . 
I hated these men for what they had done . 
Their crimes included , indirectly , the deaths of three of our colleagues - Bob Frasure , Joe Kruzel , and Nelson Drew , who had died when the armored personnel carrier they were in plunged down a ravine as we attempted to reach Sarajevo by the only route available , a dangerous dirt road that went through sniper-filled , Serbian-controlled territory . 
I did not shake hands , although both Karadzic and Mladic tried to . 
Some of our team did ; others did not . 
Mladic , not Karadzic , was the dominant figure that evening . 
He engaged in staring contests with some of our team as we sat across the table . 
Karadzic was silent at first . 
He had a large face with heavy jowls , a soft chin , and surprisingly gentle eyes . 
When he heard our demand that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately , he exploded . 
Rising from the table , the American-educated Karadzic raged in passable English about the &quot; humiliations &quot; his people were suffering . 
I reminded Milosevic that he had promised that such harangues would not occur . 
Karadzic responded emotionally that he would call former President Jimmy Carter , with whom he said he was in touch , and started to leave . 
For the only time that long night , I addressed Karadzic directly , telling him that we worked only for President Bill Clinton and that he could call Carter if he wished but that we would leave and that the bombing would intensify . 
Milosevic said something to Karadzic in Serbian ; he sat down again , and the meeting got down to business . 
After ten hours , we reached an agreement that would end the siege , after more than three years of war . 
The next day , we were able to fly into the reopened airfield in Sarajevo . 
That indomitable city was already beginning to come back to life . 
Two months later , the war would end at Dayton , never to resume . 
But while the Dayton agreement gave NATO the authority to capture Karadzic and Mladic , an arrest didn &apos;t occur for nearly 13 years . 
During that period , Karadzic spread a completely false rumor that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and I had made a deal that , with Karadzic &apos;s disappearance from public view , NATO would not seek his arrest . 
Of course , this another ridiculous fabrication from the same man who famously said that the Bosnian Muslims had shelled their own villages in order to lure NATO into the war . 
Finally , one of these dreadful murderers is in The Hague . 
It is imperative that Mladic follow Karadzic on this one-way journey . 
Karadzic &apos;s capture is all the more important because Serbian authorities accomplished it . 
Serbian President Boris Tadic deserves great credit for this action , especially since his good friend Zoran Djindjic , then prime minister of Serbia , was assassinated in 2003 as a direct result of his courage in arresting Milosevic and sending him to The Hague in 2001 . 
Karadzic &apos;s arrest is no mere historical footnote ; it removes from the scene a man who was still undermining peace and progress in the Balkans and whose enthusiastic advocacy of ethnic cleansing merits emphatic repudiation . 
It also moves Serbia closer to European Union membership . 
Moreover , Karadzic &apos;s arrest is another reminder of the value of war crimes tribunals . 
Even though almost 13 years is an inexcusably long time , the war crimes indictment kept Karadzic on the run and prevented him from resurfacing . 
In far-away Khartoum , Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir , now indicted by the International Criminal Court , should be paying close attention .
