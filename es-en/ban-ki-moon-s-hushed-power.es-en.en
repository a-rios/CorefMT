Ban Ki-moon &apos;s Hushed Power 
NEW YORK - Days after Sri Lanka &apos;s government defeated its long-time foe , the Tamil Tigers , in May , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon flew into the country &apos;s capital , Colombo , for a 24-hour visit to urge its president to open up its refugee camps to international aid groups . 
This was another urgent trip by Ban to a war-torn capital , as part of his regular duties as the UN &apos;s chief representative , seeking to uphold peace and restore global comity . 
But who really knew much about this latest foray into a troubled region by the UN chief ? 
Not many . 
Ban , who has just marked the half-way point in his five-year term in office , has so far been unable to attract a large worldwide audience for his activities . This is due , in part , to stylistic reasons , but also to the vagaries of UN diplomacy . 
Still in his quiet way , Ban is spending more than a third of his time on the road , and has accomplished much over the past 30 months . 
In Darfur , he managed to get African Union peacekeepers into Sudan &apos;s killing zone in his first year in office through intensive behind-the-scenes diplomacy . 
Though the political process has since stalled , he has pushed for more peacekeepers and helicopters . 
In Kosovo , Ban was able to lower the temperature on the boiling issue of the province &apos;s independence . 
He persuaded the European Union and the United States to allow continued UN oversight in Kosovo while gradually permitting self-governance - all without triggering dangerous confrontations with the two states which oppose its breakaway , Serbia and its close ally , Russia . 
In Myanmar , despite bitter resistance from the military regime , Ban pressured the authorities to let in humanitarian aid after Cyclone Nargis devastated the country last year . 
His public and private entreaties , including dozens of phone calls and meetings , saved perhaps a half-million lives . 
Today , he continues his call for the release of the democracy leader , Aung San Suu Kyi . 
In Haiti , which still suffers from underdevelopment , political turmoil , and the effects of destructive hurricanes , Ban appointed former US President Bill Clinton as his Special Representative to help deal with the country &apos;s plight . 
This followed two visits he made to Haiti over the past 18 months and a donor &apos;s conference he sponsored in April that sought to raise $ 300 million in aid and investment . 
More recently , Ban took an active role in the Gaza crisis . 
He has regularly defended the Palestinians &quot; rights to a state , but he also condemned Hamas &apos;s rocket attacks on southern Israel . 
During the fighting in Gaza , he publicly demanded a halt to the warfare and requested that Israel open Gaza &apos;s borders to relief aid . 
He also visited the UN compound in the center of Gaza to express the UN &apos;s grave concern over its bombing . 
Ban has taken a leadership position on the problem of global warming . 
He tackled the issue at the Bali Conference of 2007 , made it one of his central concerns at the UN , and will attempt to forge a new agreement among all global states at the UN Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009 . 
And he has moved forward in the health field . 
He accelerated efforts to eliminate the world &apos;s most dangerous ancient scourge , malaria , by naming a special adviser on the disease , and by forging innovative partnerships within the UN system that have brought together private industry , foundations , and non-governmental organizations . 
His campaign has already helped to reduce the incidence of malaria . 
The problem for Ban is his diffident manner , which stands in stark contrast with that of his predecessor , Kofi Annan , a larger than life secretary-general who dominated the scene through his flair , eloquence , and star power . 
Ban , by contrast , is neither charismatic nor an inspirational speaker - indeed , his English is not as good as Annan &apos;s . 
In his own way , though , he is an engaging , polite man , hip to contemporary cultural icons , and even given to singing at public occasions with wry lyrics and verses . 
Nonetheless Ban is sometimes criticized for not doing more , not listening enough , or deferring too much to the Big Five countries on the Security Council . 
One of the main complaints is that communicating with him can be difficult . 
Ban invariably nods his head in polite agreement without giving clear guidance . 
Others say he has yet to prove he is a good manager and must push harder for internal management reforms at the UN . 
Ban , in turn , has openly chastised member states for not giving him sufficient resources . 
But , wherever the truth may lie , few critics take into account that he , like all former UN chief executives , has to deal with the reality that he possesses only moral power , not economic , military , or political power . 
Still throughout his tenure , Ban has consistently displayed progressive instincts on issues , despite the fact that his candidacy was originally championed by an authoritarian Chinese government and a right-wing , UN-bashing American envoy to the organization , John Bolton . 
In the end he should be measured by what he has accomplished rather than by personal foibles or flatness of style .
