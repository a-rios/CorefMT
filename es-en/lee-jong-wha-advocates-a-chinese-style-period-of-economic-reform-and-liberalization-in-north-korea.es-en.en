Is North Korea Opening for Business ? 
SEOUL - North Korea &apos;s system is failing . 
The country is facing severe energy constraints , and its economy has been stagnating since 1990 , with annual per capita income , estimated at $ 1,800 , amounting to slightly more than 5 % of South Korea &apos;s . 
Meanwhile , a food shortage has left 24 million North Koreans suffering from starvation , and more than 25 of every 1,000 infants die each year , compared to four in South Korea . 
In order to survive , the world &apos;s most centralized and closed economy will have to open up . 
A more dynamic and prosperous North Korea - together with peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula - would serve the interests not only of North Korea itself , but also of neighboring countries and the broader international community . 
After all , North Korea &apos;s sudden collapse or a military conflict on the peninsula would undermine regional security , while burdening neighboring countries with millions of refugees and hundreds of billions of dollars in reconstruction costs . 
This should spur international institutions and North Korea &apos;s neighbors to provide the food aid , technical assistance , and direct investment that the country needs to escape its current predicament and make the transition to a market economy . 
But there remain significant obstacles to such cooperation - not least the North &apos;s obscure and often-unpredictable politics , exemplified by the recent execution of its leader Kim Jong-un &apos;s once-powerful uncle , Jang Song-thaek . 
The good news is that North Korea &apos;s leadership seems to understand that its current troubles stem from its grossly inefficient economic system . 
In recent speeches , Kim has emphasized the need for economic reform and opening up to develop agriculture and labor-intensive manufacturing industries . 
Furthermore , in a bid to attract foreign investment , the government has announced the establishment of 14 new special economic zones . 
If only out of a sense of self-preservation , North Korean political and military leaders are likely to support this effort , as long as it does not undermine their power or national security . 
Officially , North Korea began opening up to foreign investors in 1984 , when the government enacted the Foreign Joint Venture Law , following the success of a similar law in China . 
In 1993 , North Korea continued this effort by establishing the Rajin-Sonbong special economic and trade zone . 
But these initiatives have yet to yield significant results , with foreign investors wary of operating in a country that lacks both economic-policy credibility and the physical and institutional infrastructure needed to support large-scale projects . 
North Korea now should follow the examples of Vietnam and China , pursuing reforms like deregulation , liberalization , privatization , and macroeconomic stabilization , while developing a new legal system and new institutions . 
Such market-based , outward-oriented economic policies are a prerequisite for long-term economic growth . 
The country certainly does not lack growth potential . 
While North Korea does not have the agricultural base that initially spurred reforms in China and Vietnam , geographical advantages like natural seaports and rich mineral resources enable it to pursue export-led growth . 
Moreover , the relative abundance of well-educated workers implies low initial wages and the ability to compete internationally in labor-intensive manufacturing activities - for example , in footwear , textiles and garments , and electronic assembly - which can form the basis for export-led industrialization . 
To this end , a significant share of North Korea &apos;s military manpower , which currently amounts to more than 8.5 % of the total labor force , could be used for more productive purposes . 
If the relevant conditions are satisfied , North Korea could capitalize on the &quot; catch-up &quot; effect , boosting growth further , because its low per capita income level would help to increase investment productivity and facilitate technology transfer from more developed economies . 
This implies a significant role for North Korea &apos;s neighbors , especially South Korea and Japan . 
So far , however , the Kaesong Industrial Complex , operating with about 50,000 North Korean workers under South Korean management , is the only case of economic cooperation between the two Koreas . 
North and South Korea are natural trading partners . 
In 2012 , inter-Korean trade amounted to $ 2 billion - only 0.2 % of South Korea &apos;s total trade , but 29 % of North Korea &apos;s . 
According to the economist Marcus Noland , normalized trade relations could increase South Korea &apos;s share of the North &apos;s trade volume to as much as 60 % . 
With a strong commitment to economic reform and opening up - backed by robust international support - North Korea could emulate the success of East Asian economies like South Korea , experiencing annual growth of more than 5 % for the next several decades . 
But there is more to North Korea &apos;s situation than economics . 
The country is locked in a stalemate with the international community , which wants it to denuclearize and become a &quot; normal &quot; country . 
Unwilling to abandon its nuclear-weapons program , North Korea faces economic sanctions from the United States , with official aid and membership in institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on hold . 
Given how unlikely North Korea is to denuclearize , at least in the immediate future , an alternative strategy is needed . 
The international community , especially South Korea , should support North Korea &apos;s efforts to build a more open , market-based economy through expanded trade and investment , while continuing to work toward a compromise on denuclearization . 
The resulting prosperity and accessibility could , over time , bring about political change . 
For ordinary North Koreans , who are suffering the most under the current system , such a transformation could not be more urgent .
