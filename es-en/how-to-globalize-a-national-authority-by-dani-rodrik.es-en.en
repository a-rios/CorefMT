National Governments , Global Citizens 
CAMBRIDGE - Nothing endangers globalization more than the yawning governance gap - the dangerous disparity between the national scope of political accountability and the global nature of markets for goods , capital , and many services - that has opened up in recent decades . 
When markets transcend national regulation , as with today &apos;s globalization of finance , market failure , instability , and crisis is the result . 
But pushing rule-making onto supranational bureaucracies , such as the World Trade Organization or the European Commission , can result in a democratic deficit and a loss of legitimacy . 
How can this governance gap be closed ? 
One option is to re-establish national democratic control over global markets . 
This is difficult and smacks of protectionism , but it is neither impossible nor necessarily inimical to healthy globalization . 
As I argue in my book The Globalization Paradox , expanding the scope for national governments to maintain regulatory diversity and rebuild frayed social bargains would enhance the functioning of the global economy . 
Instead , policy elites ( and most economists ) favor strengthening what is euphemistically called &quot; global governance . &quot; 
According to this view , reforms such as those that enhance the effectiveness of the G-20 , increase the representativeness of the International Monetary Fund &apos;s Executive Board , and tighten the capital standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision would be sufficient to provide a sound institutional underpinning for the global economy . 
But the trouble is not just that these global institutions remain weak . 
It is also that they are inter-governmental bodies - a collection of member states rather than agents of global citizens . 
Because their accountability to national electorates is indirect and uncertain , they do not generate the political allegiance - and hence legitimacy - that truly representative institutions require . 
Indeed , the travails of the European Union have revealed the limits of transnational political community-building , even among a comparatively limited and similar set of countries . 
Ultimately , the buck stops with national parliaments and executives . 
During the financial crisis , it was national governments that bailed out banks and firms , recapitalized the financial system , guaranteed debts , eased liquidity , primed the fiscal pump , and paid the unemployment and welfare checks - and took the blame for everything that went wrong . 
In the memorable words of outgoing Bank of England Governor Mervyn King , global banks are &quot; international in life , but national in death . &quot; 
But perhaps there is another path , one that accepts the authority of national governments , but aims to reorient national interests in a more global direction . 
Progress along such a path requires &quot; national &quot; citizens to begin viewing themselves increasingly as &quot; global &quot; citizens , with interests that extend beyond their state &apos;s borders . 
National governments are accountable to their citizens , at least in principle . 
So , the more global these citizens &quot; sense of their interests becomes , the more globally responsible national policy will be . 
This may seem like a pipedream , but something along these lines has already been happening for a while . 
The global campaign for debt relief for poor countries was led by non-governmental organizations that successfully mobilized young people in rich countries to put pressure on their governments . 
Multinational companies are well aware of the effectiveness of such citizen campaigns , having been compelled to increase transparency and change their ways on labor practices around the world . 
Some governments have gone after foreign political leaders who committed human-rights crimes , with considerable domestic popular support . 
Nancy Birdsall , the president of the Center for Global Development , cites the example of a Ghanaian citizen providing testimony to the US Congress in the hope of convincing American officials to pressure the World Bank to change its position on user fees in Africa . 
Such bottom-up efforts to &quot; globalize &quot; national governments have the greatest potential to affect environmental policies , particularly those aimed at mitigating climate change - the most intractable global problem of all . 
Interestingly , some of the most important initiatives to stem greenhouse gases and promote green growth are the products of local pressures . 
World Resources Institute President Andrew Steer notes that more than 50 developing countries are now implementing costly policies to reduce climate change . 
From the perspective of national interest , that makes no sense at all , given the global-commons nature of the problem . 
Some of these policies are driven by the desire to attain a competitive advantage , as is the case with China &apos;s support for green industries . 
But when voters are globally aware and environmentally conscious , good climate policy can also be good politics . 
Consider California , which at the beginning of this year launched a cap-and-trade system that aims to reduce carbon emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 . 
While global action remained stalled on capping emissions , environmental groups and concerned citizens successfully pushed for the plan over the opposition of business groups , and the state &apos;s Republican governor at the time , Arnold Schwarzenegger , signed it into law in 2006 . 
If it proves a success and remains popular , it could become a model for the entire country . 
Global polls such as the World Values Survey indicate that there is still a lot of ground that needs to be covered : self-expressed global citizenship tends to run 15-20 percentage points behind national citizenship . 
But the gap is smaller for young people , the better educated , and the professional classes . 
Those who consider themselves to be at the top of the class structure are significantly more globally minded than those who consider themselves to be from the lower classes . 
Of course , &quot; global citizenship &quot; will always be a metaphor , because there will never be a world government administering a worldwide political community . 
But the more we each think of ourselves as global citizens and express our preferences as such to our governments , the less we will need to pursue the chimera of global governance .
