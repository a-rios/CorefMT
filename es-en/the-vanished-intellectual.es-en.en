The Vanished Intellectual 
This spring marks the centenary of the birth of two all-round intellectuals , those ideological avatars of the Cold War era , Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre . 
Aron was born on March 14 , 1905 , Sartre on June 21 . 
Sartre and Aron began their 50-year acquaintance with a shared elite French education that included a formative period in Germany just before the rise of Nazism . 
Each in his inimitable way displayed the contrariness both loved and loathed in intellectuals : Aron fancied Anglo-American liberalism before it became fashionable , while Sartre remained a Communist sympathiser after the fashion had passed . 
Aron wrote cool , sleek prose about the most heated geopolitical conflicts , while Sartre could turn any triviality into an existential crisis . 
Yet they often stood together against the French political establishment . 
Both joined the Resistance when France was a Nazi puppet state , and both called for Algerian independence after France regained its sovereignty . 
Unfortunately , Sartre and Aron are also joined in death : both have been disowned , ignored , or underrated by all the academic disciplines - philosophy , literature , sociology , politics - to which their voluminous works might be thought to have contributed . 
Silenced by death , Sartre and Aron are remembered more for the attitudes they brought to whatever they wrote about than for what they actually said . 
Theirs is a fate perennially suffered by intellectuals . 
Great intellectuals like Abelard , Erasmus , Galileo , Voltaire , Zola , and Russell each challenged the pieties of his era , and we now regard their success as a good thing . 
Consider three examples . 
Abelard is credited with the introduction of theology as a critical discipline in Christianity . 
Similarly , Galileo is now known to have committed what we now call &quot; research fraud &quot; in his famed physical experiments . 
Assuming he conducted them at all , they very probably did not produce the neat results that he used to assail his opponents . 
As for Zola , who defended Captain Alfred Dreyfus from charges of treason fueled by anti-Semitism , he was easily convicted for libel because he merely questioned the motives of witnesses without offering any new evidence . 
All three were subsequently vindicated - sometimes in their lifetimes , sometimes not . 
What they shared is a paradoxical ethic common to all intellectuals : the end cause of truth justifies whatever means happens to be at your disposal . 
This is because the whole truth is rarely what passes for the truth at any moment . 
Such an ethic is abhorrent in today &apos;s world , where knowledge is parceled out to academic disciplines like bits of real estate . 
To an intellectual , an academic may look like someone who mistakes the means of inquiry for its end . 
Intellectuals differ from ordinary academics in holding that the truth is best approached not by producing new knowledge , but by destroying old belief . 
When the Enlightenment philosophers renovated the old Christian slogan , &quot; The truth shall set you free , &quot; they imagined a process of opening doors , not building barricades . 
In short , intellectuals want their audiences to think for themselves , not simply shift allegiances from one expert to another . 
The intellectual &apos;s ethic is both exhilarating and harsh , for it places responsibility for thinking squarely on the thinker &apos;s shoulders . 
Every act of deference thus becomes an abdication of one &apos;s own intellectual authority . 
The slogan &quot; Knowledge is power &quot; may be familiar , but only intellectuals see its full implications . 
Obviously , greater knowledge enhances our capacity to act . 
What is much less obvious is that such empowerment requires the destruction of socially sanctioned knowledge . 
Only then is a society &apos;s space for decision opened up , enabling its members to move in many more directions than previously deemed possible . 
Aron and Sartre developed contrasting , but equally controversial , styles of destroying received belief . 
Aron preferred demonizing fellow intellectuals as alarmists than conceding that the Cold War might eventuate in a nuclear holocaust . 
Sartre castigated those who failed to resist oppression when they could have , while excusing those who enforced oppression given the chance . 
Aron exaggerated the power of reason , while Sartre inflated the power of action . 
Each wanted to take French society in radically different directions , but both never ceased being critical of the status quo . 
In the end , the two appear to have thought both in and out of their time . 
While this makes them awkward candidates for any academic discipline , such is the ambivalence of any intellectual &apos;s legacy .
