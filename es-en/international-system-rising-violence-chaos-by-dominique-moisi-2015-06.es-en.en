Renovating the World Order 
WARSAW - Russia-instigated violence has returned to Ukraine . 
The Islamic State continues its bloodstained territorial conquests . 
As violent conflicts and crises intensify worldwide , from Africa to Asia , it is becoming abundantly clear that there is no longer a guarantor of order - not international law or even a global hegemon - that countries ( and would-be state-builders ) view as legitimate and credible . 
To develop a strategy for restoring order requires an understanding of the complex drivers of today &apos;s fissures . 
And the best place to start is with the fate of four major empires . 
That story begins in 1923 with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire , which , at its peak in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , controlled much of southeastern Europe , western Asia , and North Africa . 
Nearly seven decades later came the dissolution of the Soviet Union , followed by the renaissance of a Chinese empire that aims to translate its economic success into geopolitical influence . 
Finally , and most important , there is the declining influence of the United States - what Raymond Aron called &quot; the Imperial Republic . &quot; 
After all , it is the US that organized and supported the post-1945 multilateral institutions - the United Nations Security Council , the International Monetary Fund , and the World Bank , among others - to sustain global stability . 
The failure of that system to adapt to changing geopolitical and economic realities has raised serious questions about its legitimacy . 
With the world now divided less into &quot; empires , &quot; the number of actors ( including many dysfunctional ones ) on the world stage has multiplied - a trend propelled by the notion that identity and national sovereignty are inextricably linked . 
In the aftermath of the decolonization of Africa , the proliferation of states - including those that some considered &quot; artificial &quot; - was widely criticized for fueling tensions and instability on an already-fragile continent . 
A similar phenomenon may now be occurring on a global scale . 
Still another factor contributing to the rise of disorder is the explosion of inequality . 
With globalization , the divide between the richest and the poorest - both within and among countries - has grown larger , diminishing the sense of unity of purpose that is so important to a legitimate international system . 
How can one speak of the &quot; common good , &quot; when so few have so much , and so many have so little ? 
Against this background , it will undoubtedly be extremely difficult to create an international order that strikes the needed balance between legitimacy and power . 
To meet this challenge , three potential approaches stand out . 
The first approach entails redefining the international order so that it better reflects geopolitical realities . 
After World War II , a bipolar world order , dominated by the US and the Soviet Union , emerged . 
When the Soviet Union collapsed , the world became unipolar , with the US as the sole superpower . 
But , in the last decade , as the US has retreated from its global leadership position , no other country has stepped in to fill the void , leaving the system vulnerable to instability . 
Clearly , another power must help the US to support global stability and promote multilateral cooperation . 
The European Union , mired in crisis , is not prepared to fill this role . 
Russia not only lacks the means to assume such a position ; it has also proven itself to be a primary generator of disorder . 
And emerging countries like Brazil and India , as well as developed countries like Japan , are great regional powers , but have yet to develop a global mindset . 
In fact , the only country with the means and ambition to serve alongside the US as a world leader is China ( an obvious conclusion , perhaps ) . 
Together , these countries can reinvigorate the international system so that it is better able to stem the tide of chaos and violence . 
Of course , the creation of such a bipolar world order would not be a panacea . 
Despite its relative decline , the US still possesses important structural advantages over China relating to innovation and values , not to mention vastly greater energy resources . 
As a result , the new order would be lopsided . 
Still , the recognition of China as a true global power would force the US to come to terms with its declining hegemony and compel China &apos;s leaders to recognize their international responsibilities . 
The second approach to revitalizing the international system is to reinforce the values that underpin it . 
At the end of the eighteenth century , Jean-Jacques Rousseau was convinced that the absence of democracy in Europe constituted one of the main causes of war . 
Today , it seems that what is missing is the rule of law . 
The dynamic is simple . 
As ordinary citizens have watched the wealthy get wealthier - often aided , directly or indirectly , by corrupt governments - they have become increasingly frustrated . 
In order to quell popular unrest , many governments have turned to nationalism , often in its most revanchist form , blaming some external enemy - say , the Western countries that imposed sanctions on Russia - for their citizens &quot; struggles . 
An international system that enforced the rule of law effectively would go a long way toward mitigating such conflict-generating behaviors . 
The third approach is to reevaluate the functioning of multilateral institutions . 
Specifically , the best way to transcend the paralysis of the UN Security Council is to shift some important decisions to a more informal institution like the G-20 , whose composition , while far from ideal , is more representative of today &apos;s geopolitical dynamics . 
These three approaches are not the only options that global leaders have for reforming the international system . 
But the one approach that they must not choose is to do nothing - unless they are willing to countenance further erosion of the global order and , with it , a continued descent into chaos and violence .
