Democracy Comes Second 
Democracy is slowly spreading around the world . 
From the Middle East to Latin America and Asia , many autocracies are taking gradual steps towards more democratic and accountable forms of government , or have become fully-fledged and well functioning democracies . 
The US administration is determined to consolidate political freedoms in many developing countries under its sphere of influence ; indeed , expansion of democracy has become a cornerstone of American foreign policy . 
There are many reasons to celebrate the current democratic wave . 
Democracy is associated with less injustice and abuse , with basic civic and political freedoms , and with greater sensitivity by governments for the true priorities of its citizens . 
But how important is democracy for economic success ? 
Not much , the empirical evidence suggests . 
After all , is it not true that virtually all rich countries have democratic forms of government , while the poorest countries ( mainly in Africa ) are non-democracies ? 
Indeed , throughout the world , democracy is strongly correlated with higher per capita income . 
But this correlation goes missing when one looks at the dimension of time rather than space . 
Countries that become democracies do not , on average , achieve faster economic growth after their political transition ; and , vice versa , democracies that fail and relapse into autocracy do not , on average , do worse than before . 
The positive correlation between income and democracy that one sees across countries could be due to reverse causation : democracy is more likely to persist as a country grows richer . 
It could also be due to special historical or cultural circumstances : some societies are just more successful than others , both in terms of economic development and with regard to their ability to develop and maintain democratic political institutions . 
Whatever the reason for the observed positive cross-country correlation between income and democracy , it should not be confused with causality . 
Being democratic does not seem important in securing economic success . 
Of course , there are many different kinds of democratic transitions , and lumping them all together might be misleading . 
An important distinction in practice concerns the interaction between the economic and the political system . 
A democracy born in an open economic environment , with a well functioning market system , widespread foreign direct investment , and sizeable international trade , is likely to consolidate economic liberalism , stabilize expectations , and hence lead to more investment and faster growth . 
Conversely , if an economy is tightly controlled by the state , has protectionist barriers against foreign imports and capital movements , or relies on rents from exhaustible resources to obtain foreign currency , transition to democracy can be plagued by populism and struggles for redistribution , hurting economic growth . 
Empirical evidence supports the idea that the success of a democracy depends on the openness of the underlying economic system at the time of political transition . 
In the post-WWII period , the more successful episodes of democratic transitions have been preceded by widespread economic reforms that extended the scope of the market and facilitated international integration . 
Examples include Chile and South Korea in the late 1980 &quot; s and Mexico in the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
Conversely , when democratic transition was attempted in a fragile and closed economic environment , the outcome was much worse . 
This applies to the episodes of democratization in Latin America and the Philippines in the mid-1980 &quot; s , but also to Turkey in the early 1980 &quot; s and Nepal in 1990 . 
The contrast between China and Russia also fits this pattern very well . 
China first opened its economic system to the rest of the world , and only now is it thinking ( a bit too slowly ) about political reform . 
Russia instead jumped into democracy , and only then worried about replacing socialism with a market system . 
There was probably no other way to do it in Russia , but the Chinese path seems much more likely to lead to lasting economic success . 
This does not mean that democracy is unimportant . 
When an open and well functioning market system is in place , democracy has a much better chance to lead to lasting prosperity . 
An important reason for this is that , in order to create a successful market system , the state must respect basic individual rights : the rule of law , private property , and the enforcement of justice . 
These fundamental rights are part and parcel of democratic government . 
This is how the Western world became democratic in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
Economic liberalism came first , political liberalism later . 
But today &apos;s young democracies have to do everything much faster . 
They don &apos;t have the luxury of restricting suffrage to property owners , or to more educated citizens . 
Nevertheless , we should remember the lessons of history . 
Political reforms are more likely to be successful if they are preceded by economic reforms . 
We should insist that Egypt or Pakistan improve their market system , apply the rule of law , and open their economies to international trade and capital movements . 
Allowing free elections and true political competition is also critically important , but this should follow economic reforms , not precede them .
