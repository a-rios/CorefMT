Goodbye to Going It Alone 
A key lesson that the next American president will take away from the experiences of the Bush administration is certain to be that multilateralism matters . 
Notions of American hegemony and unilateral responses make little sense when most of the serious challenges that countries face today - problems like climate change , pandemics , financial stability , and terrorism - fall outside the control of even the largest countries . 
All of them require multilateral cooperation . 
The United Nations can play an important role in helping to legitimize and implement agreements among countries , but even its closest friends admit that its large size , rigid regional blocs , formal diplomatic procedures , and cumbersome bureaucracy often impede consensus As one sage put it , the problem for multilateral organizations is &quot; how to get everyone into the act and still get action . &quot; 
One answer is to supplement the UN by creating informal consultative organizations at the regional and global level . 
For example , during the financial crises that followed the oil shocks of the 1970 &quot; s , the French government hosted the leaders of five leading economies to discuss and coordinate policies . 
The idea was to keep the meeting small and informal by limiting it to a number that could fit into the library of the chateau at Rambouillet . 
But keeping the group small proved impossible . 
It was soon grew to a &quot; G-7 &quot; of advanced industrial economies . 
Later , Russia was added to make it the &quot; G-8 . &quot; 
More recently , the annual G-8 summit has invited five other countries to attend as observers , creating a de facto G-13 . 
With this expansion have come problems . 
The new invitees resent not being included as full members able to help plan and shape the meetings , and the original countries &quot; delegations have expanded to include hundreds of officials each . 
The once informal summits have become unwieldy . 
There have been several proposals for new types of supplemental multilateral organizations . 
Todd Stern and William Antholis have suggested the creation of an &quot; E-8 &quot; : a compact forum of leaders from developed and developing countries - including the United States , the European Union , Japan , Russia , China , India , Brazil , and South Africa - that would devote their full attention once a year to environmental challenges and global climate change . 
These states represent their regions &quot; core economies , account for three-quarters of global GDP , and include the top six emitters of greenhouse gases . 
But some critics worry about restricting a group to only one topic . 
Leaders &quot; time is a scarce resource . 
They cannot afford to attend multiple summits for each transnational issue . 
Moreover , a variable geometry of attendance at meetings might weaken the development of a personal chemistry and the breadth of bargaining that can arise when the same group of leaders meets regularly to discuss a broader range of subjects . 
Former Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin , drawing on his personal experience with the Group of 20 finance ministers as well as the G-8 , has proposed a new informal grouping that he calls an &quot; L-20 , &quot; with the &quot; L &quot; signifying that it is restricted to leaders . 
The L-20 would build upon the G-8 &quot; s original strengths of informality and flexibility to provide a consultative forum on issues such a climate change , global health , and conflict management . 
Martin argues that about 20 people in a room is probably a reasonable size for attempting to tackle difficult cross-sectoral problems . 
With a larger group , real discussion is lost ; with a smaller group , meaningful regional representation is difficult . 
He would include the present G-8 , other leading economies , and major regional powers regardless of economic ranking . 
Marcos de Azambuja , former secretary-general of Brazil &apos;s Foreign Ministry , agrees that international life cannot be managed solely or primarily by vast assemblies of nearly 200 states with enormous disparities in their political and economic weight . 
He suggests something like an &quot; L-14 &quot; would be an effective group to reflect the world as it is evolving , and could be quickly accomplished by expanding the current G-8 to include China , India , Brazil , South Africa , Mexico , and a Muslim country . 
Whatever the geometry of such a consultative group , it would be designed to supplement the UN in reaching decisions , and would help galvanize bureaucracies in member governments to address key transnational issues . 
Like the G-8 , it would act as a catalyst to set agendas , and focus the attention of national bureaucracies on a set of important issues as they prepare their head of government for the discussions . 
The G-8 , for example , is often credited with helping to advance international trade rounds , addressing public health issues , and increasing aid to Africa . 
In addition to membership , several other issues remain . 
Should such a new grouping have a secretariat to present common proposals , or should it rely solely on meetings of national officials ? 
The former runs the risk of developing a new bureaucracy , but the latter may forego continuity . 
Should papers be exchanged in advance , with comments from a secretariat or from other countries ? 
How can informality be preserved and the size of meetings be restricted ? 
Perhaps leaders should be limited to one aide in the room and prohibited from reading formally prepared opening statements . 
None of the proposals suggested thus far is perfect , and many of the details need to be worked out . 
Prolonged negotiations and gridlock are not acceptable , because today &apos;s most serious problems cannot wait for perfect institutional solutions .
