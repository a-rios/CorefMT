Europe Has Lost its Way 
WASHINGTON , DC - Europe &apos;s response to the strategic challenges it is facing - Russian aggression in Ukraine , refugees fleeing violence in the Middle East , disorder in North Africa - leaves the impression that its leaders have no idea what to do . 
And indeed , they may not - a reality that needs to be acknowledged , not papered over . 
Simply put , the European Union &apos;s stagnant economy is conditioning its response to the external pressures it confronts ; internal crisis has left EU leaders little room for maneuver . 
Fortunately , Europe has the means to address this crisis , if it can summon the wisdom and the political will . 
The origins of the EU &apos;s problems lie in its response to the 2008 global financial crisis : two years of large-scale fiscal stimulus . 
While this did little for growth , it resulted in crippling public debt . 
Seven years later , EU output per person is no higher than it was at the start of the crisis . 
Meanwhile , average public debt has soared to 87 % of GDP , leaving little space for policy flexibility or innovation . 
In hindsight , it is all too obvious what should have been done . 
Greece , which carried out the biggest fiscal stimulus , is the country whose economy has suffered the most damage . 
Furthermore , the slow pace of European decision-making has compounded Greece &apos;s troubles . 
When it comes to economic policy , a fast , faulty decision is often better than inaction . 
Instead of resolving the Greek financial crisis quickly , EU leaders allowed it to crowd out discussion of other issues for five long years . 
Meanwhile , Greece limped along , never taking the decisive measures that might have restored confidence . 
With its attention focused on macroeconomics , the EU neglected to take the measures that would have put economic growth back on track : freeing up markets , cutting spending ( rather than raising taxes ) , and , above all , further developing its greatest asset , the single European market . 
Little has changed since Italian economists Alberto Alesina and Francesco Giavazzi noted , nearly a decade ago , that , &quot; Without serious , deep , and comprehensive reforms , Europe will inexorably decline , both economically and politically . &quot; 
They warned that , &quot; Absent profound change , in 20 or 30 years the share of Europe &#91; in world output &#93; will be significantly lower than it is today , and , perhaps more important , its political influence will be much trimmed . &quot; 
Indeed , a World Bank report on European growth in 2012 summed up the situation as follows : &quot; Aging Europeans are being squeezed between innovative Americans and efficient Asians . &quot; 
The chief culprits for Europe &apos;s underperformance are well known : high taxes , too many and bad regulations , the absence of key markets , and high public expenditures . 
And there is only one reason why European governments spend so much : excessive social protection . 
As the World Bank observed , &quot; Western European governments spend about 10 % of GDP more than the United States , Canada , and Japan . 
The difference in social protection spending is 9 % of GDP . &quot; 
In order to fund this spending , revenues must be raised . 
Across the continent , but especially in southern Europe , taxes and strict labor-market regulations keep unemployment high , at 11 % of the labor force , and dissuade Europeans from investing in their education . 
The natural consequences are too little employment , too little investment in sophisticated education , too little innovation , and minimal increases in productivity . 
Most striking is European backwardness in high-tech development and innovation . 
By almost any measure , most of Europe looks pitiable . 
Of the 50 best universities in the world , according to the Shanghai list and the Times Higher Education Supplement list , some 30 are American , six or seven are British , and only a handful are to be found in continental Europe . 
A half-dozen northern European countries can compete with the US when it comes to research and development spending and patents granted , but the south and east of Europe lag far behind . 
Meanwhile , the EU has yet to open its markets for business services and digital trade , on which the American economy thrives , even though services account for about 70 % of GDP in most EU countries . 
In 2006 , the European Commission issued a directive on the liberalization of trade in services , but major countries - particularly Germany - have refused to implement it . 
The absence of services and digital markets harms the development of a modern economy in Europe . 
It is not by chance that American giants like Apple , Amazon , and Google rule the world of high-tech . 
There is nothing inevitable about Europe &apos;s malaise , just as there is nothing quintessentially European about having excessive social transfers . 
Serious European governments - from Ireland to Poland - have successfully addressed the problem . 
The rest of the EU should not only follow suit ; they should also cut income and payroll taxes and liberalize their labor markets . 
Fundamental economic reforms are usually implemented only after a severe crisis , as was the case in Britain in the late 1970s , in Sweden and Finland in the early 1990s , and in Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism in 1989 . 
The EU has wasted the opportunities afforded by the 2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent euro crisis . 
Rather than making the difficult changes that would enable strong recovery , Europe &apos;s policymakers have weighed down the economy with more spending and debt . 
The EU will continue to flounder until it recognizes its mistakes and begins to carry out the reforms its economy needs . 
Only by putting the continent firmly back on the path of growth will Europe &apos;s leaders be able to address the external challenges they now confront .
