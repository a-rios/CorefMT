Fear and Loathing in Europe 
Two far-right parties , the Austrian Freedom Party and the Movement for Austria &apos;s Future , won 29 % of the vote in the latest Austrian general election , double their total in the 2006 election . 
Both parties share the same attitudes toward immigrants , especially Muslims , and the European Union : a mixture of fear and loathing . 
Since the two parties &quot; leaders , Heinz-Christian Strache and JÃ¶rg Haider , despise each other , there is little chance of a far-right coalition taking power . 
Nonetheless , this is Adolf Hitler &apos;s native land , where Jews were once forced to scrub Vienna &apos;s streets with toothbrushes before being deported and killed , so the result is disturbing . 
But how disturbing ? 
That 29 % is about 15 % more than populist right-wing parties get in very good years ( for them ) in other European countries . 
Strache , the leader of the Freedom Party , wants the government to create a new ministry to manage the deportation of immigrants . 
Muslims are openly disparaged . 
Haider once praised the employment practices of Hitler &apos;s Third Reich . 
Inevitably , the new rightists bring back memories of storm troopers and race laws . 
Yet , to see the rise of the Austrian right as a revival of Nazism is a mistake . 
Neither party advocates violence , even if some of their rhetoric might inspire it . 
Voters for the far right may be motivated less by ideology than by anxieties and resentments that are felt in many European countries , including ones with no Nazi tradition , such as The Netherlands and Denmark . 
In Denmark , the hard-right Danish People &apos;s Party , with 25 parliamentary seats , is the country &apos;s third largest party . 
Dutch populists , such as Rita Verdonk or Geert Wilders , who is driven by a paranoid fear of &quot; Islamization , &quot; are putting the traditional political elites - a combination of liberals , social democrats , and Christian democrats - under severe pressure . 
This is precisely the point . 
The biggest resentment among right-wing voters in European countries is reserved for political elites , who , in the opinion of many , have been governing for too long in cozy coalitions , which appear to exist chiefly to protect vested interests . 
In Austria , even liberals admit that an endless succession of social democratic and Christian democratic governments has clogged the political system &apos;s arteries , making it difficult for smaller parties to penetrate what is seen as a bastion of political privilege . 
The same is true in The Netherlands , which has been governed for decades by the same middle-of-the-road parties , led by benevolent but rather paternalistic figures , whose views about &quot; multiculturalism , &quot; &quot; tolerance , &quot; and &quot; Europe , &quot; were , until recently , rarely challenged . 
Expressions of nationalism in postwar European democracies were always tolerated in soccer stadiums , not in public life . 
Skepticism about European unity was routinely denounced as bigotry , or even a form of racism . 
Attachment to national feeling was further undermined by governments &quot; habit of blaming unpopular policies on European Union bureaucrats , who are increasingly seen as yet another bunch of self-satisfied , privileged , and unaccountable elitists . 
This is linked to resentment of immigrants . 
When the offspring of manual workers imported from countries such as Turkey and Morocco in the 1960 &quot; s began to form large Muslim minorities in European cities , tensions rose in working-class neighborhoods . 
Complaints about crime and unfamiliar customs were often dismissed by liberal elites as &quot; racism . &quot; 
People simply had to learn to be tolerant . 
None of this was necessarily wrong . 
Tolerance , European unity , distrust of nationalism , and vigilance against racism are laudable goals . 
But promoting these aims without discussion , let alone criticism , resulted in a backlash . 
When the Dutch , the French , and the Irish voted against the European constitution , they were expressing distrust of their political elites . 
And populists who promise to restore national sovereignty by rejecting &quot; Europe , &quot; fighting &quot; Islamization , &quot; and kicking out immigrants are exploiting this distrust . 
The rhetoric of xenophobia and chauvinism is unpleasant , and , in a country with Austria &apos;s past , even alarming . 
But the new populism is not yet undemocratic , or even anti-democratic . 
The phrase most often heard in Austria among voters of the right-wing parties is &quot; fresh air . &quot; 
People say they voted for Haider and Strache to break the stranglehold of the ruling parties . 
This is not an illegitimate motivation . 
If people are anxious about their national identities , the sovereignty of their governments , the demographic and social complexion of their societies , such fears are best voiced in the political arena . 
As long as people express their concerns , however distasteful to liberal ears , by votes , not violence , democracy will not be seriously harmed . 
Running against the political elite is , of course , the essence of populism everywhere . 
American presidential candidates pretend to run against &quot; Washington &quot; even when they are the sons of former presidents . 
Real damage is done when people lose confidence , not only in the elites , but in the system itself . 
This has not yet happened in Europe , not even in Austria . 
There is no need for liberal , traditional parties , in a fit of panic , to battle the right by pandering to the same resentments . 
But those resentments should be taken seriously in political debates . 
That way , the dangers of popular antipathies will be contained . 
Instead of damaging democracy , the rise of the right , by challenging the corruption of vested interests , might actually turn out to strengthen it .
