Booming Until It Hurts ? 
NEW HAVEN - In recent months , concern has intensified among the world &apos;s financial experts and news media that overheated asset markets - real estate , equities , and long-term bonds - could lead to a major correction and another economic crisis . 
The general public seems unbothered : Google Trends shows some pickup in the search term &quot; stock market bubble , &quot; but it is not at its peak 2007 levels , and &quot; housing bubble &quot; searches are relatively infrequent . 
But the experts &quot; concern is notable and healthy , because the belief that markets are always efficient can survive only when some people do not completely believe it and think that they can profit by timing the markets . 
At the same time , this heightened concern carries dangers , too , because we do not know whether it will lead to a public overreaction on the downside . 
International agencies recently issued warnings about speculative excesses in asset markets , suggesting that we should be worried about a possible crisis . 
In a speech in June , International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director Min Zhu argued that housing markets in several countries , including in Europe , Asia , and the Americas , &quot; show signs of overheating . &quot; 
The same month , the Bank for International Settlements said in its Annual Report that such &quot; signs are worrying . &quot; 
Newspapers are sounding alarms as well . 
On July 8 , the New York Times led its front page with a somewhat hyperbolic headline : &quot; From Stocks to Farmland , All &apos;s Booming , or Bubbling : Prices for Nearly All Assets around World Are High , Bringing Economic Risks . &quot; 
The words &quot; nearly all &quot; are too strong , though the headline evinces the newfound concern . 
It is not entirely clear why the alarms are sounding just now , after five years of general expansion in markets since they hit bottom in early 2009 . 
Why aren &apos;t people blithely expecting more years of expansion ? 
It seems that this thinking is heavily influenced by recent record highs in stock markets , even if these levels are practically meaningless , given inflation . 
Notably , just a month ago the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index broke the record that it reached on October 31 , 2007 . 
The International Monetary Fund announced in June a new Global Housing Watch website that tracks global home prices and ratios . 
The site shows a global index for house prices that is rising , on a GDP-weighted basis , as fast as during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis , though not yet reaching the 2006 record level . 
There is also the US Federal Reserve &apos;s announcement that , if the economy progresses as expected , the last bond purchase from the round of quantitative easing that it began in September 2012 will be in the month after the Federal Open Market Committee &apos;s October 2014 meeting . 
That kind of news story seems also to affect observers &quot; thinking , though it is not really much in the way of news , given that everyone has known that the Fed would end the program before long . 
The problem is that there is no certain way to explain how people will react to such a policy change , to any signs of price overheating or decline , or to other news stories that might be spun as somehow important . 
We simply do not have much well-documented history of big financial crises to examine , leaving econometricians vulnerable to serious error , despite studying time series that are typically no more than a few decades long . 
Until the recent crisis , economists were talking up the &quot; great moderation &quot; : economic fluctuations were supposedly becoming milder , and many concluded that economic stabilization policy had reached new heights of effectiveness . 
As of 2005 , just before the onset of the financial crisis , the Harvard econometricians James Stock ( now a member of President Barack Obama &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers ) and Mark Watson concluded that the advanced economies had become both less volatile and less correlated with each other over the course of the preceding 40 years . 
That conclusion would have to be significantly modified in light of the data recorded since the financial crisis . 
The economic slowdown in 2009 , the worst year of the crisis , was nothing short of catastrophic . 
In fact , we have had only three salient global crises in the last century : 1929-33 , 1980-82 , and 2007-9 . 
These events appear to be more than just larger versions of the more frequent small fluctuations that we often see , and that Stock and Watson analyzed . 
But , with only three observations , it is hard to understand these events . 
All seemed to have something to do with speculative price movements that surprised most observers and were never really explained , even years after the fact . 
They also had something to do with government policymakers &quot; mistakes . 
For example , the 1980-82 crisis was triggered by an oil price spike caused by the Iran-Iraq war . 
But all of them were related to asset-price bubbles that burst , leading to financial collapse . 
Those who warn of grave dangers if speculative price increases are allowed to continue unimpeded are right to do so , even if they cannot prove that there is any cause for concern . 
The warnings might help prevent the booms that we are now seeing from continuing much longer and becoming more dangerous .
