The New Public Diplomacy 
CAMBRIDGE - The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win . 
In today &apos;s information age , politics is also about whose &quot; story &quot; wins . 
National narratives are , indeed , a type of currency . 
Governments compete with each other and with other organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents . 
Witness the contest between the government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009 , in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles , or the recent controversy between Google and China . 
Reputation has always mattered in world politics , but credibility has become crucial because of a &quot; paradox of plenty . &quot; 
When information is plentiful , the scarce resource is attention . 
Under the new conditions , a soft sell may , more than ever , prove more effective than a hard sell . 
For example , the relative independence of the BBC , sometimes a source of consternation to British governments , has paid rich dividends in credibility , as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete &apos;s day : &quot; he rises at dawn , listens to the BBC World Service , then scans the Tanzanian press . &quot; 
Skeptics who treat the term &quot; public diplomacy &quot; as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point . 
Simple propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy . 
Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations campaign . 
Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies . 
The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or stages of public diplomacy , and all three are important . 
The first and most immediate dimension is daily communications , which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions . 
This dimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises . 
If there is a vacuum in information after an event , others will rush in to fill it . 
The second dimension is strategic communication , which develops a set of simple themes , much as a political or advertising campaign does . 
While the first dimension is measured in hours and days , the second occurs over weeks , months , and even years . 
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years or even decades , through scholarships , exchanges , training , seminars , conferences , and access to media channels . 
These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the crucial &quot; last three feet &quot; - face-to-face communications , with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates . 
But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product . 
A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against the grain of policy . 
Actions speak louder than words . 
All too often , policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments . 
For example , China tried to enhance its soft power by successfully staging the 2008 Olympics , but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet - and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers - undercut its gains . 
Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage , but they do not always understand how to do it . 
Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign policy undercuts its credibility . 
Instead , they advocate diplomacy &quot; on steroids , &quot; staffed by diplomats trained in new media , cross-cultural communications , granular local knowledge , and networks of contacts with under-represented groups . 
The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role . 
Governments need to correct daily misrepresentations of their policies , as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message . 
The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda . 
The sender knows what she says , but not always what the targets hear . 
Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard . 
Networked communications , on the other hand , can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to-peer relations to overcome cultural differences . 
This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to accomplish , given their central accountability structures . 
The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call &quot; the new public diplomacy , &quot; which is no longer confined to messaging , promotion campaigns , or even direct governmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes . 
It is also about building relationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental parties at home and abroad . 
In this approach to public diplomacy , government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in , rather than controlling , such cross-border networks . 
Indeed , too much government control , or even the appearance of it , can undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender . 
The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication . 
Power in a global information age , more than ever , will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard dimensions of coercion and payment . 
Combining these dimensions effectively is called &quot; smart power . &quot; 
For example , the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds , and over-reliance on hard power alone is not the path to success . 
Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power , but smart public diplomacy requires an understanding of credibility , self-criticism , and the role of civil society in generating soft power . 
If it degenerates into propaganda , public diplomacy not only fails to convince , but can undercut soft power . 
Instead , it must remain a two-way process , because soft power depends , first and foremost , upon understanding the minds of others .
