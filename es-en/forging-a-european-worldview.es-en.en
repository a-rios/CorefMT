Forging a European Worldview 
WARSAW - Some complain that the European Union lacks a &quot; worldview . &quot; 
In fact , the EU &apos;s problem is that it has too many of them . 
Europeans &quot; common experiences and interests mean that they should have a shared view on global issues . 
Nevertheless , the more pragmatic Europe &apos;s policies are , the greater the chances of success , not least when it comes to global issues . 
Europeans have a shared appraisal of many of the world &apos;s problems , and often put forward common methods and strategies for coping with them . 
For example , on climate change , immigration , and development aid , there is growing consensus , as there is on energy policy and the further development of the European Security Strategy . 
Agreement in these areas is not merely a reflection of some lowest common denominators ; in each area , Europe has contributed important added value at a global level . 
Indeed , Europe &apos;s community of attitudes is becoming synonymous with solutions to world problems . 
After all , climate change , energy security , and demographic challenges have been part of the European discourse for many years ; now that discourse is starting to be shared by other parts of the world . 
The global financial and economic crisis may also be a catalyst for promoting Europe &apos;s vision of a new world order . 
The EU vision of a capitalist economy harnessed to social progress and subject to regulation , rather than laissez-faire , is growing in influence . 
New economic powers like China , India , and Brazil must find their own ways of addressing social injustice and encouraging equal opportunity for all , and the European model looks increasingly attractive to them . 
Yet many differences still separate societies within the EU . 
There are divergent views on many vital global problems . 
It is nevertheless comforting that Europe &apos;s differences on global issues have not had an excessive impact on the EU &apos;s internal dynamics . 
The war in Iraq did not delay the Union &apos;s &quot; big bang &quot; enlargement , and was not the reason for the failure of referenda in France and the Netherlands on the Constitutional and Lisbon treaties . 
And Europe does need to develop structures and decision-making processes that limit conflicts of interest by offering compromise solutions . 
This is the crux of the Lisbon Treaty , which is designed to usher in new institutions and mechanisms aimed at creating more politically cohesive EU external policies . 
Transferring more areas of responsibility , such as foreign aid and development policies , to EU institutions helps the Union to adapt to new international realities by underpinning its growing importance as Europe &apos;s decision-making center . 
Shaping a shared vision of the world should start with Europe &apos;s immediate neighborhood . 
The enlargement of NATO and the EU has embraced a dozen or so states in Central and Eastern Europe and in the western Balkans . 
This failing was the key reason for the Balkan tragedy of the 1990 &quot; s . 
Fortunately , the time for armed conflict in that region appears to have come to a definitive end , now that the Balkan states are on the path to NATO and EU membership . 
Ukraine &apos;s population of 46 million means it is far too big and important to be left out of any vision of Europe &apos;s future . 
Yet the EU &apos;s strategy towards Ukraine has been ambiguous and obscure . 
The Orange Revolution &apos;s reform drive has been slowed or even halted by domestic political and economic crises , but also by the Union &apos;s perceived indifference to Ukraine &apos;s fate . 
EU leaders lament Ukraine &apos;s political divisions and slow pace of reform , and the country &apos;s leaders need to address these criticisms . 
Reform of a country &apos;s political and economic institutions and its accession to the EU and NATO usually go hand in hand , because the prospect of membership makes painful decisions electorally acceptable . 
In short , it is unrealistic of the EU to expect European outcomes from countries like Ukraine and Moldova without making a full commitment to them . 
Fortunately , that approach is changing . 
The Gas Memorandum signed earlier this year between the EU and Ukraine on the extension and exploitation of Ukrainian gas pipelines is a perfect example ; in return for political support and for funding of the extension of its pipelines , Ukraine has agreed to adopt EU rules governing management and access to the gas transmission line . 
Ukraine also agreed to implement the relevant EU energy directives as part of its membership of the European Energy Community . 
It is a first step towards Ukraine &apos;s eventual full integration into the EU Single Market . 
The EU &apos;s current lack of unanimity on many world issues , as well as continental issues such as Ukraine , is no reason for despair . 
The trick for the Union is to develop shared solutions and to take joint foreign-policy actions , even when various EU governments see things differently .
