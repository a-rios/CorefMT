The Politics of Islamophobia 
NEW YORK - There are many roads to political disaster : greed , hubris , the charisma of the demagogue , and , perhaps most dangerous of all , fear . 
When people panic , they can become hysterical , and hysteria often leads to mass violence . 
When politicians convince people that they are in a life-or-death battle - that survival is a matter of &quot; us or them &quot; - anything becomes possible . 
Adolf Hitler combined all the elements of political catastrophe : hubris , charisma , greed , and the idea that &quot; Aryans &quot; and Jews were locked in a struggle for survival . 
Of course , none of the demagogues in the West today - from Donald Trump in the United States to Marine Le Pen or Geert Wilders in Europe - are comparable to Hitler . 
None has promoted dictatorship , let alone mass murder . 
Trump , for one , also promotes greed , openly boasting of his wealth , and has somehow refined outlandish hubris and contradictory posturing into a bizarre form of charisma . 
On the one hand , he promises to fix all the world &apos;s problems , and to show China , Russia , the Islamic State , or anyone else who is boss . 
On the other hand , he claims that his vast and powerful country cannot take in desperate refugees from Syria , because , he warns , Muslim asylum-seekers might stage &quot; one of the great military coups of all time . &quot; 
Trump &apos;s Republican colleagues in the race for the US presidency , such as Ted Cruz , Ben Carson , and Marco Rubio , stoke similar fears about refugees . 
Cruz , as well as the supposedly more moderate Jeb Bush , even suggested that only Christians should be allowed into the US . 
More than 10,000 people are killed every year by gun violence in the US - all but a handful for reasons having nothing to do with Islam . 
This is not to say that terrible acts of Islamist terror could not happen in the US , or elsewhere . 
They have , and there probably will be more of them , so long as the Middle East remains in turmoil and revolutionary Islam appeals to disaffected Western youth . 
An American friend of mine speculated that , &quot; We might be one terrorist act away from a Trump presidency . &quot; 
A spectacular murder spree by Islamists could spook Americans enough to vote for the greatest fear-monger . 
Anything is possible , but I don &apos;t believe American voters would be that stupid . 
The greater danger is , however , that the demagogues will drive even mainstream politicians into their camp . 
Since the November 13 terror attacks in Paris , Fran√ßois Hollande , the unpopular but altogether sensible French president , has been so afraid of being labeled a weakling by politicians of the right and far right that he has declared a national state of emergency - and war on the Islamic State ( ISIS ) . 
As long as France &apos;s state of emergency lasts , police may arrest people without warrants , break down the doors of private residences in the middle of the night , take over restaurants and other public places with armed force , and generally behave like agents in a police state . 
Most French citizens are now so frightened of Islamist attacks that such measures are widely supported . 
A national leader can declare war on a state , not on a network of revolutionaries . 
ISIS , despite its claims , is not a state , and Hollande should not treat it as one . 
Besides , even if bombing ISIS strongholds in Iraq or Syria makes military sense , it won &apos;t break the spell of Islamist revolution for frustrated , bored , and marginalized young people in French slums . 
On the contrary : The canny leaders of ISIS also rely on an apocalyptic &quot; us or them &quot; view of the world . 
Most Muslims are not violent revolutionaries who condone , let alone admire , mass violence . 
ISIS seeks to broaden its support , especially among young Muslims , by convincing them that true Muslims are in an existential war with the West - that the infidels are their mortal enemies . 
For them no less than for Trump , fear is the most powerful weapon . 
So the more a Western government allows its policemen to humiliate and bully Muslims in the name of security , the more ISIS is likely to win European recruits . 
The only way to combat revolutionary Islamist violence is to gain the trust of law-abiding Muslims in the West . 
This will not be easy , but arbitrary arrests are surely the wrong way to go about it . 
Likewise , when it comes to civil wars in the Middle East , Western restraint is usually a better strategy than hasty military intervention driven by domestic fear . 
Republican candidates in the US are already using the recent murder spree in Paris to blame President Barack Obama , and by extension any future Democratic candidate , for being weak . 
Trump has promised to &quot; bomb the shit out of ISIS . &quot; 
This bellicosity has had the effect of pushing Hillary Clinton , the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination , into distancing herself from Obama . 
Like Hollande , she has to assuage public fear by talking tough and promising more military action . 
Obama has consistently resisted the temptation to unleash more wars . 
His policies have sometimes been inconsistent and irresolute .
