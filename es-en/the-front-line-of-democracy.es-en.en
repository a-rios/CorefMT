The Front Line of Democracy 
BENGHAZI - This week , I flew to Benghazi to meet Libya &apos;s Transitional National Council ( TNC ) , a visit coordinated with European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton and NATO allies . 
I was the first Western foreign minister to travel to Libya since the crisis began . 
What I saw reminded me of my country 20 years ago , just after Poland &apos;s first free elections , which , together with the fall of the Berlin Wall barely six months later , came to symbolize the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Peoples in transition from authoritarian rule - peaceful in Poland in 1989 , bloody in Libya today - grapple with decisions that determine their fate for decades . 
How should the former regime &apos;s worst wrongdoers and security police , with their insidious archives , be treated ? 
Should the former ruling party be banned ? 
How can civilian , democratic control of the army and police be secured ? 
What role should religion play in public affairs ? 
Should the constitution establish a presidential or parliamentary system ? 
The former communist world made those choices 20 years ago . 
The results form a crucial database of experience . 
Today &apos;s Arab reformers thus can draw on our successes - and avoid our mistakes . 
We central Europeans knew the misery of communism . 
Building democratic structures requires time , discipline , pain , and patience . 
But it pays off . 
Poland learned the hard way that demanding change and defying oppression are much less difficult than formulating and delivering a clear , reasonable program for a better future . 
Not all popular demands for freedom succeed : in the confusion , reactionary forces can make their move . 
The fall of the Shah in Iran had ruinous consequences for that country . 
Belarus won independence in 1991 , but , since 1994 , President Alexander Lukashenko has shamelessly embraced communist symbols - and methods - to cling to power . 
Europe has unfinished business here . 
Today , across North Africa , millions of people are demanding a voice in their own destiny . 
Each country is looking to change and move forward . 
In Morocco , the King has announced constitutional reforms , including guarantees for public participation in national decision-making , an independent judiciary , and new regional authorities . 
This measured , inclusive reform can be a model for others . 
Libya is experiencing a deadly struggle between people insisting on change , and a desperate , greedy regime determined to cling to power after 40 years of crass misrule . 
The United Nations Security Council , supported by the Arab League , has authorized the use of all necessary means to protect Libyans from the cruelty of their own leaders . 
Our NATO allies launched proportionate military operations aimed at denying Col. Muammar Qaddafi &apos;s regime the means to attack civilian targets . 
Governments worldwide have frozen illicit assets stashed abroad by the regime - money that should be used to help the opposition to build a new society . 
I went to Benghazi to assess the intentions and credibility of the Transitional National Council and Libyan opposition . 
We brought medical supplies for the Benghazi Medical Center , where injured people from Misurata and elsewhere are being treated . 
Around the table sat improbable allies : some had been prominent officials in Qaddafi &apos;s regime ; others had spent many years in prison under sentence of death . 
They were united in recognizing that their country deserved a new start . 
I was reminded of Poland &apos;s &quot; roundtable &quot; in 1989 , when Solidarity sat with the ruling communists to negotiate the end of the regime . 
I talked frankly with TNC Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil , Deputy Chairman Abdul Hafez Ghoga , and TNC Defense Minister Jalal Dheili , himself a former political prisoner . 
They were grateful for the international community &apos;s involvement , but described in moving terms the huge loss of life that Qaddafi had inflicted on his own people . 
I told them that we considered the TNC to be our new legitimate political interlocutors in Libya and were ready to support them , but that in return we expected the TNC to work towards the best standards of transparent democratic government . 
They had to realize that they need a plan - revolutionary moments are moments to be seized . 
Poland would help by offering training for TNC officials . 
Following this visit , my message to European leaders is twofold . 
First , Libya &apos;s TNC is the best bet we can make now for Libya &apos;s future . 
Its leaders are cooperating in an effort to bring about real reform in a way that was unthinkable a few months ago . 
They deserve the world &apos;s energetic support . 
Second , while Europe has much to offer its North African neighbors in terms of financial support , advice , and training , the region needs to find its own path to freedom and success . 
Let us approach this task in the best spirit of European solidarity , but also with a certain humility . 
Europe &apos;s former communist countries can make a special contribution to the process of transition across North Africa . 
Above all , we understand that sustained reform requires assuming responsibility by mobilizing the energy of one &apos;s own people , not relying on well-intentioned but often ill-focused outside help . 
Poland is ready to lead the way , on its own and as EU President . 
For example , former President Lech Wa≈Çesa recently visited Tunisia to offer advice as part of a Polish program to help Tunisia devise robust constitutional reforms and election laws . 
North Africa &apos;s people know what they don &apos;t want - and won &apos;t accept . 
As I saw in Benghazi , there is a fair chance that Libya &apos;s emerging leaders will be good , realistic partners for good realistic policies .
