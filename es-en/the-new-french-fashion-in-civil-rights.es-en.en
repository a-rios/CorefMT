The New French Fashion in Civil Rights 
NEW YORK - First the Swiss ban minarets . 
Now the French parliament wants to ban Muslim women from wearing the burqa - the full , face-covering garment worn in orthodox Arab countries , and now adopted by some orthodox non-Arabs - in public places . 
The hijab , the headscarf that some Muslim women wear , is already banned in French public schools , where the &quot; ostentatious &quot; display of any religious symbolism is forbidden . 
The burqa , however , is worn far more rarely in France - by about 1,900 of nearly six million Muslims , almost none of them from a traditional burqa-wearing country . 
The reason why French parliamentarians , ranging from Communists to conservatives , support this ban is a general consensus that wearing the burqa is &quot; contrary to the values of the Republic . &quot; 
As the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , famously said , the burqa is &quot; not welcome in France . &quot; 
Immigrants who cover their faces have been refused French citizenship for that reason . 
Feminists , including some women from Muslim backgrounds , have backed the ban , because they regard the custom as degrading . 
A Communist member of parliament , Andr√© Gerin , warned that terrorism and extremism were &quot; hiding behind the veil . &quot; 
In fact , only the Socialists refused to vote for the parliamentary resolution . 
They do not like the burqa either , but they don &apos;t believe that legislation is the best way to fight it . 
I think the Socialists are right . 
Aside from the fact that more serious issues face the French government than the sartorial habits of a small number of women , there is the matter of individual freedom . 
Some women may , indeed , be forced by family or peer pressure to cover themselves up . 
The same is true of orthodox Jewish women who must shave their heads and wear wigs when they marry . 
It is not immediately apparent why Jewish or some extreme forms of Christian orthodoxy should be more compatible with Republican values , let alone feminism , than Muslim salafism . 
Still , no one should be forced to cover herself up . 
But should they be forced not to ? 
One French woman , who took to the burqa entirely through her own volition , protested : &quot; France is supposed to be a free country . 
Nowadays , women have the right to take their clothes off , but not to put them on . &quot; 
Another protester said , &quot; If they make us take it off , they &apos;ll be taking a part of us . 
I &apos;d rather die than let them do it . &quot; 
Some Muslims , including clerics , maintain that covering women &apos;s faces is not actually a Muslim tradition . 
The Egyptian imam , Sheikh Mohammed Tantawi , wants to ban the wearing of face-covering veils in Egyptian schools . 
But this is still no reason why French women should not be allowed to enter a post office , a bank , a school , or any other public place in a burqa . 
Interpreting Islamic tradition is not part of the French government &apos;s brief . 
One could take the view that national governments should enforce laws , but not values . 
But , whereas most democracies are less prone than the French Republic is to impose &quot; national values &quot; on their citizens , the law cannot be totally divorced from shared values either . 
The fact that Europeans can marry only one spouse is both a legal and a cultural norm . 
And views on sexual , gender , and racial discrimination , which change with time , are reflected in the laws as well . 
There is always a delicate balance , to be sure , between commonly held views and individual liberties . 
Some people might still condemn homosexuality , but few Europeans wish to ban it by law anymore . 
On the whole , individual practices , as long as they do no harm to others , should be allowed , even if many people don &apos;t particularly like them . 
It may be undesirable to have people who carry out public functions - judges , teachers , or policewomen , for example - cover up their faces . 
But one can impose dress codes for certain jobs , without banning a type of clothing for everyone . 
After all , we don &apos;t have judges and teachers wearing bikinis on the job , either . 
There is another , practical , reason why the burqa ban is a bad idea . 
If we are serious about integrating immigrants into Western societies , they should be encouraged to move around in public as much as possible . 
Banning the burqa would force this tiny minority of women to stay at home , and be even more dependent on their men to deal with the outside world . 
So what should be done about practices that are judged to be illiberal , if we don &apos;t ban them ? 
Sometimes it is better to do nothing . 
Living with values that one does not share is a price to be paid for living in a pluralist society . 
Making sure all citizens get a good education could help to reduce potential grounds for conflict . 
And so could a sense of humor . 
This does not have to be hostile , as with the Danish newspaper cartoons . 
One of the wittiest advertisements on the market today is for a brand of German lingerie . 
The commercial shows a beautiful nude woman , posing in front of her mirror , taking pleasure in slipping on sexy black panties and black stockings with garters - before covering up in a black burqa . 
All we see , as she looks out of the window , are her eyes , nicely framed in mascara . 
&quot; Sexiness for everyone : everywhere . &quot; 
Not only is it humorous and well produced , but , based on my observations in the Middle East , this advertisement is also an accurate reflection of reality . 
It is certainly possible to imagine , as the French Communist deputy does , a woman in a burqa harboring an extremist or terrorist agenda . 
The same can be true of a man in jeans or a woman in a business suit . 
What we sometimes forget is that the average person inside a burqa is also simply a woman .
