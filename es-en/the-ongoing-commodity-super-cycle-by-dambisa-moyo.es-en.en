Commodities on the Rise 
SEOUL - The commodity super-cycle - in which commodity prices reach ever-higher highs , and fall only to higher lows - is not over . 
Despite the euphoria around shale gas - indeed , despite weak global growth - commodity prices have risen by as much as 150 % in the aftermath of the financial crisis . 
In the medium term , this trend will continue to pose an inflation risk and undermine living standards worldwide . 
For starters , there is the convergence argument . 
As China grows , its increasing size , wealth , and urbanization will continue to stoke demand for energy , grains , minerals , and other resources . 
For example , the US consumes more than nine times as much oil as China on a per capita basis . 
As more of China &apos;s population converges to Western standards of consumption , demand for commodities - and thus their prices - will remain on an upward trajectory . 
Of course , not all commodities are equal . 
For example , although the case for copper seems straightforward , given that it is a key input for wiring , electronics , and indoor plumbing , a strong bid for iron is not as obvious , given the Chinese infrastructure boom that already has occurred in the last two decades . 
Worst-case estimates have China &apos;s real GDP growing at around 7 % per year over the next decade . 
Meanwhile , the supply of most commodities is forecast to grow by no more than 2 % annually in real terms . 
All else being equal , unless China &apos;s commodity intensity , defined as the amount of a commodity consumed to generate a unit of output , falls dramatically , its demand for commodities will be greater this year than it was last year . 
As long as China &apos;s commodity demand grows at a higher rate than global supply , prices will rise . 
And the rapid economic growth that China &apos;s leaders must sustain in order to lift enormous numbers of people out of poverty - and thus prevent a crisis of legitimacy - places a floor under global food , energy , and mineral prices . 
To be sure , intensity of use has fallen for some commodities , like gold and nuclear energy ; but for others , such as aluminum and coal , it has risen since 2000 or , as is the case for copper and oil , declines have slowed markedly or stalled at high levels . 
As the composition of China &apos;s economy continues to shift from investment to consumption , demand for commodity-intensive consumer durables - cars , mobile phones , indoor plumbing , computers , and televisions - will rise . 
There is also the issue of the so-called reserve price ( the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service ) . 
The reserve price places a cap on how high commodity prices will go , as it is the price at which demand destruction occurs ( consumers are no longer willing or able to purchase the good or service ) . 
For many commodities , such as oil , the reserve price is higher in emerging countries than in developed economies . 
One explanation for the difference is accelerating wage growth across developing regions , which is raising commodity demand , whereas stagnating wages in developed markets are causing the reserve price to decline . 
By implication , if nothing else , global energy , food , and mineral prices will continue to be buoyed by seemingly insatiable emerging-market demand , which commands much higher reserve prices . 
Ultimately , emerging economies &quot; absolute size and rate of growth both matter in charting commodity demand and the future trajectory of global commodity prices , with per capita income clearly linked to consumers &quot; wealth . 
If people feel rich and enjoy growing wages and appreciating assets , they are less inclined to cannibalize other spending when commodity consumption becomes more expensive . 
Of course , upward pressure on commodity prices also stems from supply-side challenges . 
It is not just that global supplies of resources are increasingly scarce , but also that supplies are increasingly falling into inefficient hands . 
Around the world , governments are taking greater control of resources and imposing policies that hamper global production and ultimately force prices higher . 
Such price increases can prove particularly inflationary in countries that import commodities . 
And they can be disastrous to exporting economies , which risk rapid currency appreciation and thus a loss of competitiveness . 
Of course , technological advances , like hydraulic fracturing ( &quot; fracking &quot; ) in the shale-gas industry , could increase supply and therefore lower prices . 
But mounting environmental challenges , and the limited availability of commodity substitutes , suggest that a reprieve on commodity prices is not near . 
There is a perennial temptation to focus on - even to overemphasize - the short-term , tactical drivers of commodity-price movements , at the expense of giving longer-term , structural factors their due . 
While short-term factors - for example , political instability , weather-related disruptions , and speculative activity - are important determinants of prices , they tell only part of the story . 
The economic fundamentals of supply and demand remain the key factors in driving the direction of commodity prices and determining whether the commodity super-cycle will persist . 
In practical terms , this means that oil prices , for example , are more likely to hover near $ 120 per barrel over the next decade , rather than $ 50 ; and we are unlikely to see a $ 20 barrel of oil ever again .
