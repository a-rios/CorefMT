Sex and Surveillance 
NEW YORK - It is impossible to hear about sexual or sex-crime scandals nowadays - whether that involving Dominique Strauss-Kahn or those of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , or the half-dozen United States congressmen whose careers have ended in the past couple of years - without considering how they were exposed . 
What does it mean to live in a society in which surveillance is omnipresent ? 
Like the heat beneath the proverbial boiling frogs , the level of surveillance in Western democracies has been ratcheted up slowly - but far faster than citizens can respond . 
In the US , for example , President George W. Bush &apos;s Patriot Act is being extended , following a series of backroom deals . 
Americans do not want it , and they were not consulted when it was enacted by their representatives under the pressure of a government that demanded more power in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
That does not seem to matter . 
A concerted effort is underway in the US - and in the United Kingdom - to &quot; brand &quot; surveillance as positive . 
New York City subway passengers are now advised that they might experience random searches of their bags . 
Activists in America are now accustomed to assuming that their emails are being read and their phone calls monitored . 
Indeed , the telecom companies Verizon and AT T have established areas on their premises for eavesdropping activity by the National Security Agency . 
The spate of sex scandals is a sign of more serious corruption and degradation than most commentators seem to realize . 
Yes , sex criminals must be punished ; but political career after political career , especially in America , is ending because of consensual affairs . 
Consensual sex between adults is no one else &apos;s business . 
After all , the human sex drive , especially if it compels risky or self-destructive behavior , has held appeal for dramatists since the ancient Greeks , who originated the story of Achilles and his vulnerability . 
Citizens &quot; attention can be channeled away from , say , major corporate theft and government malfeasance toward narratives involving two hapless individuals ( and their wives and children , who are usually suffering quite enough without the media &apos;s heavy breathing ) . 
Another reason to mourn the normalization of a surveillance society lies in the link between sexual privacy and other kinds of psychological liberation . 
That is why closed societies monitor their citizens &quot; sexual lives . 
The combination of sexuality and privacy has an anarchic , subversive effect on citizens . 
Connecting with another person in an unscrutinized , uncivilized , unmediated , unobserved way inevitably reminds people that there are aspects of the human soul that cannot and must not be subjected to official control . 
For this reason , closed and closing societies have always feared sexual liberationists , and have sought to link political dissidence with sexual anarchy . 
In the 1950 &quot; s , communism and the homosexual &quot; threat &quot; became wedded in the American public imagination . 
In Britain &apos;s decadent 1890 &quot; s , feminists , socialists , and Utopians were portrayed as free-love menaces to family life - even if they had no sexually transformational agenda at all . 
Everyone has secrets - that is what people realize too late when a surveillance society falls softly into place . 
Think about your own privacy and secrets . 
If you or your spouse strayed , would you want to discuss it in private , or have the world discuss it with you - or have a government official tell you that he will discuss it with your spouse , unless you do as requested ? 
You might even choose not to address it at all . 
Most people take for granted that they would have that choice , because they do not realize that living in a surveillance society means that eventually everyone must face the same anxieties about exposure as public figures do . 
Of course , the issue is broader : If you are a recovering alcoholic , make a pass at someone of the same gender , have a gambling problem , suffer from bipolar illness , or have had a conversation with your accountant about your taxes that skirted what was proper , are you ready to be &quot; outed &quot; ? 
Official surveillance has been marketed as a national-security imperative . 
In fact , it gives the state the power to blackmail anyone it wishes . 
Consider the official US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that revealed that State Department employees were asked to obtain &quot; biometrics &quot; on public officials at the United Nations . 
Are we entering an era of geopolitics by blackmail ? 
Perhaps we should defuse the threats posed by a surveillance society by having an annual day of amnesty . 
On Amnesty Day - not a state holiday , to be sure - we would reveal to our loved ones , constituents , or employers the secrets that we think put us at risk . 
Or we could work to eliminate the threat of exposure of private behavior . 
For example , as consumers of media , we have power : the next time you are peddled a sex scandal , refuse to buy it . 
Sexual impropriety - of whatever flavor - is not among the most important things in the world ; the loss of freedom is .
