A Race to Hunger 
SYDNEY - Spectators at February &apos;s Daytona 500 in Florida were handed green flags to wave in celebration of the news that the race &apos;s stock cars now use gasoline with 15 % corn-based ethanol . 
It was the start of a season-long television marketing campaign to sell the merits of biofuel to Americans . 
On the surface , the self-proclaimed &quot; greening of NASCAR &quot; ( National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ) is merely a transparent ( and , one suspects , ill-fated ) exercise in an environmental form of whitewashing for the sport - call it &quot; greenwashing . &quot; 
But the partnership between a beloved American pastime and the biofuel lobby also marks the latest attempt to sway public opinion in favor of a truly irresponsible policy . 
The United States spends about $ 6 billion a year on federal support for ethanol production through tax credits , tariffs , and other programs . 
Thanks to this financial assistance , one-sixth of the world &apos;s corn supply is burned in American cars . 
That is enough corn to feed 350 million people for an entire year . 
Government support of rapid growth in biofuel production has contributed to disarray in food production . 
Indeed , as a result of official policy in the US and Europe , including aggressive production targets , biofuel consumed more than 6.5 % of global grain output and 8 % of the world &apos;s vegetable oil in 2010 , up from 2 % of grain supplies and virtually no vegetable oil in 2004 . 
This year , after a particularly bad growing season , we see the results . 
Global food prices are the highest they have been since the United Nations started tracking them in 1990 , pushed up largely by increases in the cost of corn . 
Despite the strides made recently against malnutrition , millions more people will be undernourished than would have been the case in the absence of official support for biofuels . 
We have been here before . 
In 2007 and 2008 , the swift increase in biofuel production caused a food crisis that incited political instability and fueled malnutrition . 
Developed countries did not learn . 
Since 2008 , ethanol production has increased by 33 % . 
Biofuels were initially championed by environmental campaigners as a silver bullet against global warming . 
They started to change their minds as a stream of research showed that biofuels from most food crops did not significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions - and in many cases , caused forests to be destroyed to grow more food , creating more net carbon-dioxide emissions than fossil fuels . 
Some green activists supported mandates for biofuel , hoping they would pave the way for next-generation ethanol , which would use non-food plants . 
That has not happened . 
Today , it is difficult to find a single environmentalist who still backs the policy . 
Even former US Vice President and Nobel laureate Al Gore - who once boasted of casting the deciding vote for ethanol support - calls the policy &quot; a mistake . &quot; 
He now admits that he supported it because he &quot; had a certain fondness for the &#91; corn &#93; farmers in the state of Iowa &quot; - who , not coincidentally , were crucial to his 2000 presidential bid . 
It is refreshing that Gore has now changed his view in line with the evidence . 
But there is a wider lesson . 
A chorus of voices from the left and right argue against continued government support for biofuel . 
The problem , as Gore has put it , is that &quot; it &apos;s hard once such a program is put in place to deal with the lobbies that keep it going . &quot; 
Politicians can &apos;t stop such rent-seeking behavior . 
What they can do is craft well-considered policies that maximize social welfare . 
Unfortunately , when it comes to policies marketed as reining in global warming , protecting the environment , or creating &quot; green jobs , &quot; we have a tendency to make hasty decisions that don &apos;t pass the test . 
Government support for biofuel is only one example of a knee-jerk &quot; green &quot; policy that creates lucrative opportunities for a self-interested group of businesses but does very little to help the planet . 
Consider the financial support afforded early-generation renewable-energy companies . 
Germany led the world in putting up solar panels , funded by $ 75 billion in subsidies . 
The result ? 
Inefficient , uncompetitive solar technology sitting on rooftops in a fairly cloudy country , delivering a trivial 0.1 % of Germany &apos;s total energy supply , and postponing the effects of global warming by seven hours in 2100 . 
Given the financial stakes , it is little wonder that alternative-energy companies , &quot; green &quot; investment firms , and biofuel producers are lobbying hard for more government largesse , and marketing their cause directly to the public by highlighting its supposed benefits for the environment , energy security , and even employment - none of which withstand scrutiny . 
&quot; The NASCAR deal will push American ethanol into the stratosphere , &quot; declared Tom Buis , CEO of the ethanol trade association Growth Energy . 
At least one group is already sold : presidential contenders . 
In Iowa last month , possible Republican candidate Newt Gingrich derided &quot; big-city attacks &quot; on ethanol subsidies . 
And , in what must be music to the industry &apos;s ears , an Obama administration official declared that even amidst the highest food prices the world has seen , there is &quot; no reason to take the foot off the gas &quot; on biofuel . 
In fact , there are millions of reasons - all of them suffering needlessly - to apply the brakes .
