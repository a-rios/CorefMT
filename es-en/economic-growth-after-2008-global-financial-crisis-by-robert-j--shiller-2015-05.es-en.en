Inspiring Economic Growth 
NEW HAVEN - In his First Inaugural Address , during the depths of the Great Depression , US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously told Americans that , &quot; The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . &quot; 
Invoking the Book of Exodus , he went on to say that , &quot; We are stricken by no plague of locusts . &quot; 
Nothing tangible was causing the depression ; the problem , in March 1933 , was in people &apos;s minds . 
The same could be said today , seven years after the 2008 global financial crisis , about the world economy &apos;s many remaining weak spots . 
Fear causes individuals to restrain their spending and firms to withhold investments ; as a result , the economy weakens , confirming their fear and leading them to restrain spending further . 
The downturn deepens , and a vicious circle of despair takes hold . 
Though the 2008 financial crisis has passed , we remain stuck in the emotional cycle that it set in motion . 
It is a bit like stage fright . 
Dwelling on performance anxiety may cause hesitation or a loss of inspiration . 
Once such a cycle starts , it can be very difficult to stop . 
According to Google Ngrams , it was during the Great Depression - around the late 1930s - that the term &quot; feedback loop &quot; began to appear frequently in books , often in relation to electronics . 
Then , in 1948 , the great sociologist Robert K. Merton popularized the phrase &quot; self-fulfilling prophecy &quot; in an essay with that title . 
Merton &apos;s prime example was the Great Depression . 
But the memory of the Great Depression is fading today , and many people probably do not imagine that such a thing could be happening now . 
Surely , they think , economic weakness must be due to something more tangible than a feedback loop . 
But it is not , and the most direct evidence of this is that , despite rock-bottom interest rates , investment is not booming . 
In fact , real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates are hovering around zero throughout much of the world , and have been for more than five years . 
This is especially true for government borrowing , but corporate interest rates , too , are at record lows . 
In such circumstances , governments considering a proposal to build , say , a new highway , should regard this as an ideal time . 
If the highway will cost $ 1 billion , last indefinitely with regular maintenance and repairs , and yield projected annual net benefits to society of $ 20 million , a long-term real interest rate of 3 % would make it nonviable : the interest cost would exceed the benefit . 
But if the long-term real interest rate is 1 % , the government should borrow the money and build it . 
That is just sound investing . 
In fact , the 30-year inflation-indexed US government bond yield as of May 4 was only 0.86 % , compared with more than 4 % in the year 2000 . 
Such rates are similarly low today in many countries . 
Our need for better highways cannot have declined ; on the contrary , given population growth , the need for investment can only have become more pronounced . 
So why are we not well into a highway-construction boom ? 
People &apos;s weak appetite for economic risk may not be the result of pure fear , at least not in the sense of an anxiety like stage fright . 
It may stem from a perception that others are afraid , or that something is inexplicably wrong with the business environment , or a lack of inspiration ( which can help overcome background fears ) . 
It is worth noting that the US experienced its fastest economic growth since 1929 in the 1950s and 1960s , a time of high government expenditure on the Interstate Highway System , which was launched in 1956 . 
As the system was completed , one could cross the country and reach its commercial hubs on high-speed expressways at 75 miles ( 120 kilometers ) an hour . 
Maybe the national highway system was more inspirational than the kinds of things that Roosevelt tried to stimulate the US out of the Great Depression . 
With his Civilian Conservation Corps , for example , young men were enlisted to clean up the wilderness and plant trees . 
That sounded like a pleasant experience - maybe a learning experience - for young men who would otherwise be idle and unemployed . 
But it was not a great inspiration for the future , which may help to explain why Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal was unable to end America &apos;s economic malaise . 
By contrast , the apparent relative strength of the US economy today may reflect some highly visible recent inspirations . 
The fracking revolution , widely viewed as originating in the US , has helped to lower energy prices and has eliminated America &apos;s dependency on foreign oil . 
Likewise , much of the rapid advance in communications in recent years reflects innovations - smartphone and tablet hardware and software , for example - that has been indigenous to the US . 
Higher government spending could stimulate the economy further , assuming that it generates a level of inspiration like that of the Interstate Highway System . 
It is not true that governments are inherently unable to stimulate people &apos;s imagination . 
What is called for is not little patches here and there , but something big and revolutionary . 
Government-funded space-exploration programs around the world have been profound inspirations . 
Of course , it was scientists , not government bureaucrat , who led the charge . 
But such programs , whether publicly funded or not , have been psychologically transforming . 
And with inspiration comes a decline in fear , which now , as in Roosevelt &apos;s time , is the main obstacle to economic progress .
