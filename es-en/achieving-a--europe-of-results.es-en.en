Achieving a &quot; Europe of Results &quot; 
BRUSSELS - The tsunami that has swept across financial markets is a global catastrophe . 
If handled correctly , however , the crisis may yet raise the esteem of the European Union and its institutions . 
The EU &apos;s legitimacy problem has two different aspects : apathy , leading to a low turnout in the European parliamentary elections , and outright euro-skepticism . 
The voter-turnout problem partly reflects frustration about the present state of the EU , and also people &apos;s impression that they can exert little influence by voting one way or the other . 
Euro-skepticism , on the other hand , and the looming threat of anti-European populism , is directly linked to the idea that the EU is not merely incapable of offering a solution to the crisis , but in fact is part of the problem . 
So , although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today &apos;s increasingly difficult environment , it is actually being blamed for globalization . 
Many people confuse these two aspects of the EU &apos;s legitimacy problem , and believe that somehow turnout in European elections can be increased by pointing out to people how good and important the EU is . 
At first sight , the easiest answer to the problem of low voter turnout is to give more power to the European Parliament . 
But if this was the solution , then we would not have had steadily declining turnouts since the high point of 63 % , at the first elections to the European Parliament in 1979 . 
After all , since then the EP &apos;s influence and powers of joint decision-making have grown constantly . 
The trouble is that , EP elections must be &quot; about &quot; something if voters are to be interested , which means they must involve a real choice . 
And a real choice requires Europe-wide election campaigns by all parties . 
This would also involve making the choice of the European Commission &apos;s president dependent on the outcome of the EP elections . 
But , in fact , both of these conditions have already been met ; in 2004 , Portuguese Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso was appointed President of the Commission because he came from the political organization with the strongest election result , the European People &apos;s Party . 
And this year &apos;s elections saw a more intensive presence of party organizations at European level than ever before . 
Instead , I believe that the most important way to reawaken voters &quot; interest in European elections will be to open up the election of the Commission &apos;s President to them , and create a genuinely Europe-wide political debate during the next election campaign . 
The Euro-skepticism problem can be tackled only if the Union itself starts to perform better , and is seen to be doing so . 
That is why in the aftermath of the failed referenda four years ago in France and the Netherlands on the Constitutional treaty , the Commission tried to emphasize the idea of a &quot; Europe of Results &quot; that would seek to convince citizens of its worth through concrete achievements . 
Given the gravity of the economic crisis , the time has come for the EU to demonstrate its strengths whenever possible . 
The aim must be not only to win back the hearts of Europeans who have become skeptical , but also to convince them that the Union is indispensable to meeting the challenges Europeans face . 
Europe &apos;s citizens understand that the relatively small nation-states that make up the EU are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own . 
In Ireland , last autumn &apos;s financial crisis provoked a turnaround in public opinion about the EU , and even in Iceland , although it lies on the periphery of our continent , membership of the EU and the euro have become a priority . 
European countries have become so interconnected that isolated national measures on issues like financial-market regulation are hopeless . 
A changing world in which new powers like China and India play an increasingly important role will not wait for Europe to make up its mind . 
The EU must instead show leadership through its efforts to solve the world &apos;s current problems . 
As for the European People &apos;s Party , for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people . 
The economic crisis was caused by shortsightedness and a lack of control in the global financial system . 
Now we must redefine the role of regulators in financial markets and in the wider economy , for we cannot let the financial sector walk off with the profits and leave taxpayers bearing the losses . 
That doesn &apos;t mean that we are advocating a move to socialism ; we want better and smarter regulation , not regulation for its own sake . 
We see five keys to recovery : 
A &quot; Europe of Results &quot; is achievable . 
It can strengthen the EU &apos;s legitimacy , though , only if policy recommendations such as these , and the successes that result from implementing them , are communicated clearly and effectively to the general public .
