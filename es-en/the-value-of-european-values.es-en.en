The Value of European Values 
Europe &apos;s leaders have revived the constitutional talks that broke down last December in a dispute about voting rights . 
Such disputes are , of course , subject to compromises , which are likely to be found . 
What still needs to be settled is a clear understanding of what the constitution is meant to achieve . 
Two fundamental principles have underpinned European integration : solidarity and subsidiarity . 
Both principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy , politics , economics , sociology , and law . 
For years they have been present in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in treaties , in the Charter of Fundamental Rights ( which quotes them in the Preamble ) , in the recent draft Constitution . 
They are , in short , inscribed in the EU &apos;s history and ideals . 
But what do solidarity and subsidiarity really mean ? 
Consider solidarity , which is open to at least two interpretations : static solidarity , which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth , and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity , which concerns the production of income and wealth as well . 
In the postwar history of European integration , dynamic solidarity was strong in the first period - that of the European Coal and Steel Community - both in its economic development strategy ( reconstruction ) and in the Treaties , particularly the Treaty of Rome . 
This does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed : European Monetary Union , for example , is an expression of it . 
Some countries did not immediately benefit from the euro , but accepted it for the sake of solidarity . 
Dynamic solidarity , in other words , means favoring policies that foster investment , innovation , economic growth , and employment . 
However , as GDP growth in the EU indicates , dynamic solidarity has been undermined over the last decade . 
What is particularly worrying is the research and development lag . 
Realization of the EU &apos;s so-called Lisbon strategy , adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world &apos;s most competitive economy , is threatened by a growing emphasis on static solidarity , reflected in high social welfare costs and the high taxes needed to finance them . 
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population , which , along with slower growth , has led to structural fiscal imbalances . 
One of the biggest challenges for the future of the EU is addressing today &apos;s prevalence of static solidarity oriented towards old people over dynamic solidarity favoring young people . 
After all , the Union cannot afford to permit current consumption to continue to prevail over the investment needed to ensure future prosperity . 
Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that it , too , has two interpretations : vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity . 
Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers among different levels of government and sovereignty : the EU , national states , regions , and municipalities . 
The best-known application of this principle is federalism . 
In the European Treaties , we find a clear expression of vertical subsidiarity . 
But is this enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional settings of the Union ? 
Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings , as well as social and economic powers . 
It encompasses the relations between state , society , and market . 
But society and the market have their own rights and sovereignties that are not granted by the state . 
So the problem comes in assuring the autonomy of each realm . 
An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the internal European market , which created a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms because they are no longer protected by national governments . 
Horizontal subsidiarity means that in both society and the economic sphere , the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility , which must be respected to the greatest possible extent . 
It also means that support must be given by a &quot; superior power &quot; whenever individual freedom and responsibility do not suffice to achieve the ends necessary for human dignity . 
This support , however , should be implemented in ways that the natural potential of individuals , society , and the market is promoted . 
But that is possible only when the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly formulated , which it has not been in the European Treaties , the Charter of Fundamental Rights , or the work of the European Convention . 
In short , solidarity has come to mean redistribution rather than growth ( which is how today &apos;s generation expresses solidarity with respect to future generations ) , while subsidiarity has come to mean the distribution of political power , rather than a careful delineation of the boundaries between the state , civil society , and the market . 
Today , both values are defined in ways that favor the state . 
Indeed , focusing on market-based growth has often been identified with the semi-alien values of America . 
But these values are deeply ingrained in Europe , and should be brought out again . 
The EU should restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity that is more balanced in favor of the market and society , and that reduces the state &apos;s socio-economic influence . 
State institutions should deliver public goods ( like defense , justice , and fiscal and monetary policy ) , society should deliver social goods ( like culture , education , and assistance to needy people ) , and the market should deliver economic goods ( which are connected with profits , growth , and employment ) . 
In the 21st century , Europe must reconsider the value of both principles - solidarity and subsidiarity - if it is to attain integration &apos;s historic goal : the freedom and well being needed to overcome the differences and political divisions that incited tragedy in the 20th century . 
That is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written .
