Europe &apos;s Distant Mirror ? 
It is tempting for Europeans to project their own history onto Asia and to view current developments there as a mere repetition , if not an imitation , of what occurred in Europe . 
In fact , Asians themselves encourage this temptation , with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) openly aiming to become increasingly like the European Union . 
In trying to decipher Asia &apos;s diplomatic future , Europeans are confronted , so to speak , with an &quot; embarrassment of riches . &quot; 
Is Asia today replaying the balance of power games of late nineteenth-century Europe , with China in the role of Germany ? 
Or is South Asia , through the growth of ASEAN , poised to one day become the Far Eastern equivalent of the EU ? 
These comparisons are not neutral , and one may detect in the analogy between China today and nineteenth-century Germany an element of that guilty pleasure in others &quot; troubles that the Germans call &quot; Schadenfreude . &quot; 
Asia may be doing well economically now , according to this view , but just wait : rising nationalism , China &apos;s appetite for power , and the rest of Asia &apos;s desire to curb its ambitions will necessarily impede economic growth and restore the West &apos;s global primacy . 
But this scenario does not correspond to reality . 
China at the beginning of the twenty-first century is not Bismarck &apos;s newly unified Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century . 
The Chinese do not view themselves as a rising new power , but instead as Asia &apos;s traditional power , now experiencing a renaissance . 
China , they believe , is regaining the status and prestige that it enjoyed until the end of the eighteenth century . 
As a result , unlike Wilhelmine Germany , the Chinese are not in a hurry to prove how strong and powerful they have become . 
In strategic terms , China is not a revisionist power , but instead a &quot; satisfied , &quot; status-quo power . 
The only exception to this , of course , would be a declaration of independence from Taiwan , which the Chinese would consider a casus belli . 
To be sure , the Chinese are indeed rearming - and even entering the military space race - but they are doing so at a pace and to a proportion that reflects their new economic prosperity . 
China &apos;s fundamental priorities remain economic , reflecting its leaders &quot; belief that their regime &apos;s long-term survival presupposes the continuation of rapid growth . 
For that , they need access to energy , but they are not about to engage in military or even diplomatic adventures . 
Nor are they set to become a benevolent , altruistic power , ready to use their new strength and reputation to improve the stability of the international system . 
Chinese cynicism and spontaneous selfishness , however , is now tempered by what they perceive as growing recognition of their unique status . 
The combination of respect and interest they see in the way the world now views China can only reinforce their sense of confidence . 
So why should they take unnecessary risks ? 
The resounding success of the Africa-China summit , which was attended by more African leaders than purely African gatherings ; the diplomatic rapprochement between India and Japan ; and the democratic alliance in the making between India , Japan , and Australia can only be interpreted as signs of China &apos;s newly regained position . 
Why would they jeopardize such real and symbolic gains with rash and untested moves ? 
There is no Bismarck at the helm of Chinese diplomacy , but there is no impetuous Kaiser either : just relatively prudent and competent technocrats . 
In reality , what may threaten the stability of the region , and above all that of China , is not an excess of Chinese ambitions or a failure to democratize , but the Chinese regime &apos;s inability to establish the rule of law . 
In 1978 , China &apos;s newly installed leader , Deng Xiaoping , viewed Singapore as living proof of the superiority of capitalism over communism . 
He remembered the impoverished backwater that Singapore was in the 1920 &quot; s , and now he saw the gleaming city that free enterprise - together with Lee Kwan Yew &apos;s quasi-authoritarian leadership - had wrought . 
It was after visiting Singapore that Deng introduced &quot; special economic zones &quot; in southern China . 
But the rule of law , even Singapore-style , is far harder to implement than capitalism , and its absence represents the major obstacle to the establishment of an Asian community based on the EU model . 
Twenty years ago , one of the main obstacles to creating an Asian Union was Japan - Asia &apos;s most advanced and successful country , but one that did not feel Asian . 
Moreover , the rest of Asia resented the Japanese for reveling in this difference . 
That resentment remains , sustained in part by historical grievances , but the Japanese have now come to perceive themselves as Asians , helped by their realization that the economic miracle that they initiated in the region has gone well beyond them . 
In Europe , transcending nationalism required not only two devastating world wars in the first half of the twentieth century , but also the prevalence of democratic regimes . 
The rule of law is the equivalent for Asia today of what democracy was for Europe yesterday . 
Without its gradual imposition , an Asian Union could at best remain only a pale and hollow copy of its European model .
