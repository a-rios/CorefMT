Gun Control After Newtown 
NEW YORK - The brutal murder of 20 children and seven adults in Newtown , Connecticut , shakes us to the core as individuals and requires a response as citizens . 
The United States seems to reel from one mass gun killing to another - roughly one a month this year alone . 
Easy access to guns in the US leads to horrific murder rates relative to other highly educated and wealthy societies . 
America needs to find a better way . 
Other countries have done so . 
Between the mid-1970 &quot; s and the mid-1990 &quot; s , Australia had several mass shootings . 
After a particularly horrible massacre in 1996 , a new prime minister , John Howard , declared that enough was enough . 
He instituted a severe crackdown on gun ownership , and forced would-be gun owners to submit to a rigorous application process , and to document why they would need a gun . 
Conditions for gun ownership in Australia are now very strict , and the registration and approval process can take a year or more . 
Howard &apos;s government also implemented a rigorous &quot; buyback &quot; policy , to enable the government to purchase guns already owned by the public . 
The policy worked . 
While violent crime has not ended in Australia , murders are down , and , even more dramatically , there has not been a single mass shooting since 1996 in which three or more people died ( the definition used in many studies of mass shootings ) . 
Before the crackdown , there had been 13 such massacres in 18 years . 
Yet the US still refuses to act , even after this year &apos;s string of shocking incidents : the massacre in a movie theatre in Colorado , an attack on a Sikh community in Milwaukee , another on a shopping mall in Oregon , and many more before the ruthless slaughter of first graders and school staff in Newtown . 
The gun lobby in the US remains powerful , and politicians are afraid to counter it . 
Given the shooting of then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 , perhaps they even fear that they , too , might be targeted . 
There can be little doubt that some societies are more steeped in violence than others , even controlling for obvious factors like income levels and education . 
The US homicide rate is roughly four times that of comparable societies in Western Europe , and Latin America &apos;s homicide rates are even higher than in the US ( and dramatically higher than Asian countries at roughly the same income level ) . 
What accounts for staggeringly high rates in the US and Latin America ? 
American violence is rooted in history . 
The US and Latin American countries are all &quot; conquest &quot; societies , in which Europeans ruled over multi-racial societies . 
In many of these countries , including the US , the European conquerors and their descendants nearly wiped out the indigenous populations , partly through disease , but also through war , starvation , death marches , and forced labor . 
In the US and many Latin American countries , slaveholding fueled mass violence as well . 
The slaves - and generations of their descendants - were routinely murdered . 
The US also developed a particular populist belief that gun ownership constitutes a vital protection against government tyranny . 
The US was born in a citizens &quot; revolt against British imperial power . 
The right of citizens to organize militias to fight government tyranny was therefore a founding idea of the new country , enshrined in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution , which declares that , because a country needs a well-regulated militia , the people have the right to bear arms . 
Since citizens &quot; militias are anachronistic , gun owners now use the second amendment merely to defend individual gun ownership , as if that somehow offers protection against tyranny . 
A reckless , right-wing Supreme Court has agreed with them . 
As a result , gun ownership has become perversely linked to freedom in the vast gun-owning American sub-culture . 
But , instead of protection of freedom , Americans nowadays are getting massive bloodshed and fear . 
The claim that gun ownership ensures freedom is especially absurd , given that most of the world &apos;s vibrant democracies have long since cracked down on private gun ownership . 
No tyrant has risen in Australia since Howard &apos;s gun-control reforms . 
Simply put , freedom in the twenty-first century does not depend on unregulated gun ownership . 
Indeed , America &apos;s gun culture is a threat to freedom , after the murder of a president , senator , and other public leaders , and countless assassination attempts against public officials over recent decades . 
Yet US gun culture remains as pervasive as it is unrecorded . 
America reels from one shooting disaster to the next , and on nearly every occasion , politicians dutifully declare their continued devotion to unregulated gun ownership . 
Indeed , no one even knows how many guns Americans hold . 
The number is estimated to be around 270 million , or almost one per person on average . 
According to one recent poll , 47 % of households have a gun at home . 
The shooting in Newtown was not only especially horrific and heartbreaking , but is also part of an increasingly common pattern - a specific kind of murder-suicide that has been carefully studied by psychologists and psychiatrists . 
Loners , often with paranoid tendencies , commit these heinous acts as part of their own suicide . 
They use carefully planned and staged mass murders of innocents in order to take revenge on society and to glorify themselves as they take their own lives . 
The perpetrators are not hardened criminals ; many have no previous criminal record . 
They are pathetic , deranged , and often have struggled with mental instability for much of their lives . 
They need help - and society needs to keep guns out of their reach . 
America has now suffered around 30 shooting massacres over the past 30 years , including this year &apos;s deadly dozen ; each is a gut-wrenching tragedy for many families . 
And yet , each time , gun owners scream that freedom will be eliminated if they are unable to buy assault weapons and 100-round clips . 
The bloodbath in Newtown is the time to stop feeding this gun frenzy . 
Australia and other countries provide models of how to do it : regulate and limit gun ownership to approved uses . 
America &apos;s real freedoms depend on sane public policy .
