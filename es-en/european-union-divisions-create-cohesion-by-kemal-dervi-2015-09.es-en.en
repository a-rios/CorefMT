E Pluribus Europe ? 
BRUSSELS - The European Union &apos;s economic crises of the last half-decade have fueled the emergence of a deep divide between the northern creditor countries and the southern debtors . 
Now Europe &apos;s migrant crisis is creating an east-west divide between the countries that are welcoming toward the ongoing influx of refugees , and those who want to do little , or nothing , to help . 
Add to that growing political divisions within member countries , and one must ask : Is the EU coming unglued ? 
The creditor / debtor split was thrown into sharp relief this summer , during the negotiations over Greece &apos;s third bailout agreement . 
Germany , the leading proponent of austerity and the most influential creditor , was accused of insufficient flexibility and solidarity ; 
( It was France , neither entirely &quot; north &quot; nor entirely &quot; south , &quot; that ended up playing a vital role in facilitating the deal . ) 
Germany is now trying to lead the way in the migrant crisis as well , but this time by its generosity . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel has pledged to take in more than 800,000 refugees just this year . 
Welcoming crowds have lined streets and filled train stations in German cities , offering drinks , food , and clothing to the exhausted refugees , many of whom have walked hundreds of miles and risked their lives to get to safety . 
Whereas Merkel declared forcefully that Islam was also a religion of Germany , some in Eastern Europe have declared that they will welcome only a small number of refugees - and only if they are Christian . 
Such bigotry plays directly into the hands of Islamist extremists worldwide . 
The refugee crisis is all the more challenging in view of EU member countries &quot; internal political fragmentation . 
While those on the left support cautious acceptance of refugees , the further one moves to the right , the more negative the attitude becomes . 
Even the Christian Social Union , the Bavarian sister party to Merkel &apos;s Christian Democratic Union , has proved a reluctant partner in this area . 
Yet another divide lies between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU . 
Given the UK &apos;s role , alongside France , as the key force in European defense and a significant authority in world affairs , particularly with regard to climate- and development-related issues , the prospect of a genuine split should be a source of serious concern for the EU . 
These divisions have created deep doubts about the dream of ever-closer union in Europe , underpinned by a shared system of governance that allows for more effective decision-making . 
Likewise , they are not conducive to implementation of the reforms that are needed to spur economic growth . 
Yet it is still too early to write off progress toward increased European integration . 
In fact , when it comes to EU cohesion , more cleavages are probably better than a single divide . 
When economic considerations alone were dominating the debate , austerity-obsessed northern Europe , oblivious to any Keynesian considerations , and struggling southern Europe , desperately in need of fiscal room to make demand-boosting , job-creating structural reforms politically feasible , were at loggerheads . 
The situation became so heated that some respected observers even proposed creating a &quot; northern euro &quot; for the region around Germany , and a &quot; southern euro &quot; in the Mediterranean ( where France would fit was unclear ) . 
In such a eurozone , the European Central Bank would have to split , and the northern euro would appreciate . 
Exchange-rate uncertainty would reappear , not only between the two euros , but also , before long , within the &quot; northern &quot; and &quot; southern &quot; zones , owing to the collapse of confidence in the very idea of a currency union . 
Within the northern bloc , Germany would play an even more outsize role than it does now , a situation that would likely generate new tensions . 
Similarly , a clear division between a refugee-friendly west and a closed east would effectively end the Schengen Agreement , because the political disagreement would harden into a physical barrier blocking the free movement of people within the EU . 
Such a split would be as damaging to Europe &apos;s cohesion as a divided eurozone . 
But what if countries that are on opposite sides of one cleavage are on the same side of another ? 
Germany , Italy , Spain , and Sweden may agree on the immigration issue , while Greece , France , Italy , and Portugal agree on eurozone macroeconomic policies . 
France , Poland , and the UK may be willing to spend more on defense , while Germany remains more pacifist . 
And Germany , the Scandinavian countries , and the UK may be at the forefront of the fight against climate change . 
Moreover , the Europe-wide political &quot; families &quot; of Christian Democrats , Social Democrats , and so on could be allies on some policies and opponents on others , transcending national or regional borders , and moving toward pan-European politics , with the European Parliament increasing its democratic debate and oversight functions . 
A Europe where countries do not fit neatly into one category or another , and where flexible coalitions emerge on various issues , probably has a greater chance of progressing than one divided simply between north and south or east and west . 
Of course , there remains the challenge of strengthening institutions so that they can manage this diversity and reconcile it with political effectiveness . 
Here , greater scope for weighted and double-majority voting is crucial . 
But , for truly democratic societies , the challenge of reconciling divergent interests never goes away .
