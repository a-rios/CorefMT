Weak States , Poor Countries 
This commentary was originally published in September 2013 . 
Imagine my surprise when , as a 19-year-old on my first visit to the United States , I was met by a stream of obscenities from a New York City cop who was directing traffic in Times Square after I asked him for directions to the nearest post office . 
In my subsequent confusion , I inserted my employer &apos;s urgent documents into a trash bin that , to me , looked a lot like a mailbox . 
Europeans tend to feel more positively about their governments than do Americans , for whom the failures and unpopularity of their federal , state , and local politicians are a commonplace . 
Yet Americans &quot; various governments collect taxes and , in return , provide services without which they could not easily live their lives . 
Americans , like many citizens of rich countries , take for granted the legal and regulatory system , the public schools , health care and social security for the elderly , roads , defense and diplomacy , and heavy investments by the state in research , particularly in medicine . 
Certainly , not all of these services are as good as they might be , nor held in equal regard by everyone ; but people mostly pay their taxes , and if the way that money is spent offends some , a lively public debate ensues , and regular elections allow people to change priorities . 
All of this is so obvious that it hardly needs saying - at least for those who live in rich countries with effective governments . 
But most of the world &apos;s population does not . 
In much of Africa and Asia , states lack the capacity to raise taxes or deliver services . 
The contract between government and governed - imperfect in rich countries - is often altogether absent in poor countries . 
The New York cop was little more than impolite ( and busy providing a service ) ; in much of the world , police prey on the people they are supposed to protect , shaking them down for money or persecuting them on behalf of powerful patrons . 
Even in a middle-income country like India , public schools and public clinics face mass ( unpunished ) absenteeism . 
Private doctors give people what ( they think ) they want - injections , intravenous drips , and antibiotics - but the state does not regulate them , and many practitioners are entirely unqualified . 
Throughout the developing world , children die because they are born in the wrong place - not of exotic , incurable diseases , but of the commonplace childhood illnesses that we have known how to treat for almost a century . 
Without a state that is capable of delivering routine maternal and child health care , these children will continue to die . 
Likewise , without government capacity , regulation and enforcement do not work properly , so businesses find it difficult to operate . 
Without properly functioning civil courts , there is no guarantee that innovative entrepreneurs can claim the rewards of their ideas . 
The absence of state capacity - that is , of the services and protections that people in rich countries take for granted - is one of the major causes of poverty and deprivation around the world . 
Without effective states working with active and involved citizens , there is little chance for the growth that is needed to abolish global poverty . 
Unfortunately , the world &apos;s rich countries currently are making things worse . 
Foreign aid - transfers from rich countries to poor countries - has much to its credit , particularly in terms of health care , with many people alive today who would otherwise be dead . 
But foreign aid also undermines the development of local state capacity . 
This is most obvious in countries - mostly in Africa - where the government receives aid directly and aid flows are large relative to fiscal expenditure ( often more than half the total ) . 
Such governments need no contract with their citizens , no parliament , and no tax-collection system . 
If they are accountable to anyone , it is to the donors ; but even this fails in practice , because the donors , under pressure from their own citizens ( who rightly want to help the poor ) , need to disburse money just as much as poor-country governments need to receive it , if not more so . 
What about bypassing governments and giving aid directly to the poor ? 
Certainly , the immediate effects are likely to be better , especially in countries where little government-to-government aid actually reaches the poor . 
And it would take an astonishingly small sum of money - about 15 US cents a day from each adult in the rich world - to bring everyone up to at least the destitution line of a dollar a day . 
Yet this is no solution . 
Poor people need government to lead better lives ; taking government out of the loop might improve things in the short run , but it would leave unsolved the underlying problem . 
Poor countries cannot forever have their health services run from abroad . 
Aid undermines what poor people need most : an effective government that works with them for today and tomorrow . 
One thing that we can do is to agitate for our own governments to stop doing those things that make it harder for poor countries to stop being poor . 
Reducing aid is one , but so is limiting the arms trade , improving rich-country trade and subsidy policies , providing technical advice that is not tied to aid , and developing better drugs for diseases that do not affect rich people . 
We cannot help the poor by making their already-weak governments even weaker .
