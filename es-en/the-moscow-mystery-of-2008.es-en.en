The Moscow Mystery of 2008 
Usually at this time of year , people are obsessed with what the coming year will bring . 
But in Russia , the real uncertainty concerns 2008 , not 2007 . 
Indeed , one can boil Russian politics down to one issue nowadays : Will President Vladimir Putin stay on as president after 2008 , despite repeatedly stating that he won &apos;t ? 
And if he indeed steps down , whom will he groom as his replacement ? 
Will his chosen successor belong to one of the Kremlin &apos;s feuding factions ? 
Or will he pick an &quot; outsider &quot; ? 
Unless Putin maintains his stature as the country &apos;s ultimate arbiter and decision-taker , there is a high risk of fierce infighting . 
In an environment where power and property are inseparable and all government institutions are emasculated , a major transfer of authority at the top may lead to violent redistribution . 
Thus , resolving these questions is vital for Russia &apos;s political elites who are anxious to preserve the current perks and gain more . 
As for the public , the vast majority appears resigned to accepting whatever is arranged by the leadership . 
Fully 45 % of Russians believe that Putin will name a successor , and that this person will become the new president . 
Almost a quarter believe that the constitution will be changed so that Putin can have a third term . 
Either way , it is almost universally understood that the transfer of presidential authority is masterminded at the top and endorsed at the ballot box . 
The balance of forces in the legislature , too , will be determined by the Kremlin . 
Over the past years the configuration of the political parties and the election legislation have been repeatedly modified so as to suit the interests of the ruling elite . 
As a result unwanted forces have no chance in next December &apos;s parliamentary election . 
The alienation between the state and the people has a long tradition in Russia , and so does public apathy . 
But these days the apathy is reinforced by improved living standards . 
Thanks to windfall revenues from oil and gas , Russians live better than ever in the postcommunist times . 
Moreover , it may be argued that never in Russian history has the proportion of those who enjoy reasonably decent lifestyles been as high as it is today . 
As a result , people have become even more compliant in the face of increasingly autocratic governance . 
Of course , there are plenty of reasons to complain , and people may grumble , but they won &apos;t come together to oppose the status quo . 
Marginal political groups and figures who stage protests increasingly find themselves confronting official pressure and even harassment - all the more reason for the broad public to turn away from them . 
Since the election results are preordained , many may simply not vote . 
In fact , today &apos;s Russian state barely has a reason to muster active support . 
On the contrary , public participation is seen as an obstacle to the goals pursued by the bureaucracy : self-perpetuation and expanding control over lucrative assets . 
If any among the Russian elite ever nursed modernizing ambitions , they have abandoned them , for without public participation , modernization is a fallacy . 
Instead , the Kremlin increasingly draws on the conservative , Soviet-style electorate as its power base , while alienating the advanced , the entrepreneurial , and the best educated . 
Stephen Jennings , the chairman of the board of Renaissance Capital , an investment group with a decade of experience in Russia , recently noted the country &apos;s &quot; contradictory trends &quot; : the emergence of a &quot; burgeoning middle class &quot; alongside a &quot; highly centralized government , breeding a new class of state oligarchs and a mushrooming bureaucracy . &quot; 
The problem is that Russia &apos;s best and brightest , which Jennings praised for &quot; high management skills , professionalism , productivity , and social and economic ambition , &quot; don &apos;t seem to mind their alienation from policy-making . 
They may resent the Kremlin &apos;s economic policies , but they put up with Russia &apos;s rampant corruption and its disgraceful ratings in competitiveness indices , just as they put up with the general erosion of democracy , manipulation of the judiciary , and weak law enforcement . 
Like their less advanced compatriots , they don &apos;t seek to hold the government accountable or call for change . 
For the time being , life is good enough as it is . 
Thus , if there is any threat to a smooth transition in 2008 , or a risk of subsequent destabilization , it may stem from infighting at the top , not from the public . 
Optimists hope that at some point Russia &apos;s burgeoning middle class will assume responsibility for Russia &apos;s future and demand a radical improvement in governance . 
But what would trigger a shift from passive compliance to active public participation ? 
If good times breed political apathy , and bad policies lead to a socioeconomic decline , Russia &apos;s best and brightest may find themselves outstripped by populist forces .
