Asia &apos;s Rebalancing Act 
SEOUL - Rapid economic growth in China undoubtedly benefits the rest of Asia . 
Indeed , strong Chinese demand has supported its trading partners &quot; export-led growth for much of the past three decades . 
But now , faced with a slowdown in China and significant downside risks there , the rest of Asia must abandon over-reliance on export-oriented development strategies and strive to ensure stable and sustainable growth domestically and regionally . 
China &apos;s vulnerabilities and risks - stemming from property bubbles , shadow banking , and local-government debt - have triggered concerns about a crisis not only there , but also in neighboring Asian countries . 
Some , indeed , now predict a Chinese banking or fiscal disaster ; others predict long-term stagnation equivalent to Japan &apos;s lost decades . 
These &quot; hard landing &quot; scenarios are extreme . 
But the road ahead is bumpy and uncertain . 
No one can guarantee that Prime Minister Li Keqiang &apos;s attempts to achieve deleveraging and structural reform will succeed . 
Moreover , external shocks , policy mistakes , and political instability could disrupt even the best-laid plans . 
In any case , China &apos;s stellar growth record cannot be sustained . 
Even if it manages a &quot; soft landing , &quot; annual output growth will slow to 5-6 % in the coming decades . 
Standard growth theory predicts &quot; convergence &quot; of per capita GDP : a fast-growing country will eventually encounter difficulty maintaining high rates of labor mobilization , capital accumulation , and technological progress . 
In China , labor inputs have fallen as a result of declining fertility and an aging population . 
Reduced rates of return will lower investment rates . 
China may be able to rely on policy reforms to boost productivity growth ; but , with relatively low innovative capacity , it will struggle to catch up with frontier technologies . 
China &apos;s inevitable growth slowdown , along with a large tail risk , threatens stable growth in Asian economies that have become increasingly interdependent . 
Trade within Asia now accounts for more than half of the continent &apos;s total trade turnover . 
Moreover , direct investment and financial flows contribute further to economic interdependence . 
The rise in intra-Asian trade reflects China &apos;s central role in East Asia &apos;s production networks . 
From 2001 to 2011 , China &apos;s share of South Korean exports doubled , from 12 % to 24 % ; its share of Japanese exports grew even faster , rising from 8 % to 20 % . 
As a result , China has become South Korea &apos;s single largest export market , and Japan &apos;s second largest . 
It is also the largest trading partner of all ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) . 
Asian economies &quot; deepening trade and financial integration has left them increasingly vulnerable to growth shocks from China , with exporters of commodities and capital goods especially vulnerable . 
In fact , a study by the Asian Development Bank shows that Chinese shocks have larger and more persistent effects on individual Asian economies &quot; output than do global shocks , as a 1 % increase in China &apos;s GDP raised GDP in emerging East Asia by about 0.6 % . 
In terms of investment , the International Monetary Fund predicts that a disruption in China &apos;s investment boom will adversely affect its trading partners . 
A drop of one percentage point in China &apos;s investment rate is estimated to reduce Taiwan &apos;s GDP growth rate by 0.9 percentage points and Korea &apos;s by 0.6 percentage points . 
If China can successfully rebalance its economy and shift to consumption-based growth , its trading partners could benefit enormously from a huge retail market . 
But as long as China &apos;s import share of final consumption remains low , direct gains for exporters of consumer goods are likely to be small . 
As they prepare for the coming Chinese slowdown and seek to minimize the risk of regional destabilization , Asian economies must strengthen domestic demand and reduce excessive reliance on exports to China . 
In other words , sustainable growth requires all of Asia &apos;s China-dependent economies to rebalance their two main growth engines . 
To enhance domestic demand , Asia , including China , must reallocate resources and structurally transform the economy . 
Reinforcing social safety nets , broadening and deepening financial markets , and supporting small and medium-size enterprises would also strengthen domestic demand . 
Likewise , service-sector liberalization will be essential to promoting productivity and creating jobs . 
In short , implementation of fiscal , financial , and structural reforms can mitigate the spillover effects from China &apos;s slowdown . 
But a second reform front , aimed at enhancing regional coordination , must also be opened . 
With economic shocks able to spread more quickly than ever before , owing to broadened trade and financial channels , all Asian countries must maintain a sound macroeconomic environment . 
Perhaps most important , deeper regional integration calls for closer cooperation in macroeconomic and financial surveillance , as envisaged by the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization . 
Asian countries must be able to conduct well-coordinated candid reviews of one another to reduce the likelihood of risks and detect emerging vulnerabilities . 
China &apos;s long-term growth potential - and that of the rest of developing Asia - is not pre-defined . 
Maximizing it requires not only that individual countries address their weaknesses and rebalance their sources of growth , but also that they build and strengthen the regional institutions needed to manage economic integration .
