Creative Self-Disruption 
LAGUNA BEACH - Like many readers , I still vividly recall when Nokia was the dominant player in mobile phones , with over 40 % of the market , and Apple was just a computer company . 
I remember when Amazon was known only for books , and when dirty taxis or high-priced limousines were the only alternative to public transport or my own car . 
And I recall when the Four Seasons , Ritz Carltons , and St. Regises of this world competed with one another - not with Airbnb . 
Now , I may be old , but I am not that old . 
These changes happened recently - and fast . 
How did they occur ? 
Will the pace of change remain so rapid - or even accelerate further ? 
And how should companies respond ? 
An industry can be transformed by top-down economic , financial , political , and regulatory changes . 
Importantly and counter-intuitively , doing so serves their own core competencies , rather than those of the industry that they seek to disrupt . 
Indeed , rather than using existing approaches and processes to compete , these entrants created radical new game plans , rewriting the target industry &apos;s rules . 
Their creativity and passion enabled them to subdue - and in some cases even destroy - less adaptable giants remarkably quickly . 
Central to these companies &quot; success has been their understanding of a fundamental trend affecting nearly all industries : individual empowerment through the Internet , app technology , digitalization , and social media . 
Most traditional companies , meanwhile , remain focused on their macro environment , at the expense of responding adequately to the new micro-level forces in play . 
If existing companies hope to compete in this new environment , shaped by both top-down and bottom-up forces , they will to have to adapt , preempting disruptive new players by figuring out how to disrupt themselves . 
Otherwise , they could face a fate similar to Nokia , which was disintermediated by one tech company ( Apple ) and acquired by another ( Microsoft ) . 
In this effort , companies must recognize that both demand and supply factors are or will be driving the transformation of their competitive landscapes . 
On the demand side , consumers expect a lot more from the products and services they use . 
They want speed , productivity , and convenience . 
And , as the success of services like TripAdvisor show , they want to be more engaged , with companies responding faster to their feedback with real improvements . 
On the supply side , technological advances are toppling long-standing entry barriers . 
The online car service Uber adapted existing technologies to transform a long-sheltered industry that too often provided lousy and expensive service . 
Airbnb &apos;s &quot; supply &quot; of rooms far exceeds anything to which traditional hotels could reasonably aspire . 
An existing company would have to be highly specialized , well protected , or foolish to ignore these disruptions . 
But , while some well-established companies in traditional industries are already looking for ways to adapt , others still need to do a lot more . 
One traditional industry in which progress is being made is the automotive branch , where companies are pursuing digitalization . 
Though new entrants could undoubtedly disrupt incumbents &quot; production platforms - Elon Musk &apos;s Tesla Motors is a clear example - they are rare . 
These days , the more pervasive competitive threat comes from companies in other domains that can erode the customer value proposition after the car is sold . 
Automotive companies are recognizing that , over time , the digital experience in the cars they produce will command a larger share of the consumer surplus , owing largely to the potential for substantial profit margins and economies of scale . 
As a result , they are adapting their vehicles to the new sharing economy , helping people to remain well-connected in the car , expanding the scope of after-sale services , and preparing for the shift away from individual car ownership toward car sharing . 
If they are to make progress , they must move beyond simply providing apps and online banking . 
Their aim should be holistic engagement of clients , who seek not only convenience and security , but also more control over their financial destiny . 
In these and many other industries , the competitive landscape is undoubtedly becoming more complicated and unpredictable . 
But four general guidelines can help managers effectively adapt their mindsets and business models to facilitate orderly and constructive self-disruption . 
路 First , companies should modernize core competencies by benchmarking beyond the narrow confines of their industry . 
路 Second , they should increase their focus on customers , including by soliciting and responding to feedback in an engaging way . 
路 Third , managers should recognize the value of the data collected in their companies &quot; everyday operations , and ensure that it is managed intelligently and securely . 
路 Finally , the micro-level forces that have the potential to drive segment-wide transformations should be internalized at every level of the company . 
Companies that apply these guidelines stand a better chance of adapting to what is driving today &apos;s rapid reconfiguration of entire industries . 
The bottom line , once again , is supply and demand : More than ever , people want - indeed , feel empowered to expect - cheaper , smarter , safer , and more efficient tools to live a more self-directed life . 
Companies that fail to deliver will find that their days are numbered .
