RUDI DORNBUSCH 
Rudi Dornbusch &apos;s death on July 25 , at age 60 , took a great economist and exceptional human being from us . 
Rudi was born and grew up in Krefeld , Germany . 
He was an undergraduate at the University of Geneva and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1971 . 
He taught at the University of Rochester from 1972 to 1974 , before returning to the University of Chicago as Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Business in 1974-75 . 
In 1975 he accepted an offer from the MIT Department of Economics , where he taught until his death . 
Both the subject and style of Rudi &apos;s early work reflected the influence of his thesis adviser , Robert Mundell . 
The topic was exchange rates , output , and interest rates ; the style was elegant and deceptively simple , with complex models reduced to the interaction of two curves . 
For some time , indeed , such diagrams were known as &quot; Dornbusch diagrams . &quot; 
Many of these early articles are collected in his classic book Open Economy Macroeconomics , published in 1980 . 
In 1976 , soon after coming to MIT , Rudi wrote his most famous and influential article , &quot; Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics , &quot; on the overshooting of exchange rates . 
The exchange rate fluctuations that came about following the shift to flexible exchange rates in 1973 were surprisingly large - far greater than fluctuations in domestic prices - and the question was why . 
Rudi provided a simple explanation . 
Price level and the level of output are &quot; sticky , &quot; that is , they change only slowly . 
When a shock hits the economy , it is initially absorbed by interest rates and the exchange rate . 
Gradually the impact of the shock is transferred to output and domestic prices , and the exchange rate moves towards a new equilibrium . 
The &quot; Dornbusch result &quot; is that , in this process , the exchange rate typically overshoots its long run value . 
Because it overshoots , the exchange rate fluctuates more than the price level . 
As Ken Rogoff , the current IMF chief economist who studied under Rudi , commented on the 25 th anniversary of the article &apos;s publication : &quot; The &apos; overshooting &apos; paper ... marks the birth of modern international macroeconomics . &quot; 
Even as he continued to produce outstanding theoretical articles , Rudi became interested in policy issues . 
He became one of the outstanding policy economists of our time , displaying the same rare talent demonstrated in his theoretical work : the ability to extract the essence of a complicated problem and explain it in terms that made it appear simple . 
He worked on a range of problems , typically the major international and national economic issues of the day , drawing on his knowledge of economic history to illuminate the present . 
For example , he applied the lessons of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire to the break-up of the Soviet bloc . 
Among his policy papers , the most famous is a 1994 paper that predicted Mexico &apos;s peso crisis , one of many papers on Latin America &apos;s economic problems . 
Another that warrants rereading is his 1990 paper &quot; Macroeconomic Populism , &quot; which accurately depicts a temptation to which policymakers in Latin America and other countries often used to succumb . 
As his policy interests grew , Rudi &apos;s fame spread . 
He was an indefatigable traveller , speaker , and writer , and a frequent columnist . 
In his more popular articles , in his columns , and on the podium , his wit and the speed of his mind made him a formidable presence . 
He was one of the finest debaters and polemicists in the profession . 
He did not shy away from stating his views , often reflecting the advice of Keynes : &quot; Words ought to be a little wild for they are the assault of thoughts on the unthinking . &quot; 
At various times he was persona non grata to the authorities in a number of countries after characterizing either their policies or their behaviour in ways they did not appreciate . 
It did not help that he was more often right than not . 
Despite his public persona , Rudi was an excellent confidential policy adviser . 
When I was in the IMF , I often called him to discuss a difficult situation . 
He would talk as long as necessary , and his advice was always thoughtful and nuanced , providing insights no one else had seen . 
For a short time , Rudi thought about joining the Clinton administration . 
Fortunately he did not , because he had little patience for bureaucracy , long meetings , and the need to toe an official line . 
His comparative advantage was on the outside , where he was free to develop his insights and express his views . 
Rudi was also a spectacularly successful teacher . 
As a thesis adviser , Rudi had few peers . 
Every outstanding American international macroeconomist who went to MIT , among them Jeffrey Frankel , Paul Krugman , Maurice Obstfeld and Ken Rogoff , was Rudi &apos;s student . 
Outstanding students of Rudi can be found all over the globe , many as policymakers . 
In their devotion to their teacher and friend lies the greatest compliment to his teaching and his mentoring . 
I had the good fortune to collaborate with Rudi in writing two textbooks and several articles . 
One textbook , Macroeconomics , sold well over a million copies worldwide and gave me as much satisfaction as anything I have done in my professional life . 
Rudi felt the same way . 
Rudi lit up any group in which he participated . 
He was among the most talented of men , and the warmest , generous with his time and himself , available for students and friends whenever they needed him . 
He fought his terminal cancer for over 18 months , never complaining , always expressing optimism that the latest experimental treatment would work . 
When he was finally forced to take to his bed , he said that he hoped his friends would remember him as he had been , not as he was at the end . 
That they will .
