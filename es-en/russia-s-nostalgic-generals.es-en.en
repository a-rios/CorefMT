Russia \ u0027s Nostalgic Generals 
Generals everywhere are mocked for wanting to fight new wars the same way they fought the last one . 
Russia &apos;s military leaders - indeed , much of its foreign policy elite - is stuck in a similar rut . 
Both generals and diplomats are finding it hard to move beyond Cold War thinking , and their retrograde posture is hindering President Putin &apos;s efforts to push the country in a new direction . 
Around the world , Vladimir Putin is viewed as a strong man whose word is sacred . 
But this is hardly the case . 
In the Iraq crisis , both the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministries voiced opinions starkly at odds with Putin . 
Such divisions occur regularly . 
Kremlin watchers , also stuck with Cold War mindsets , prefer to believe that President Putin and his ministers are playing a game of &quot; good cop / bad cop , &quot; in which , where the West is concerned , Mr Putin is good and everyone else is bad . 
If so , it &apos;s a strange game with perverse effects . 
But what happened during the Iraq war demonstrated that no real practical goal - such as securing repayment of Iraq &apos;s debts or preserving Russian interests in Iraqi oil - guided Russia &apos;s foreign policy . 
Instead , the Kremlin placed at risk its hard-won warm relations with the US for no clear reason . 
It is no secret that Russia &apos;s diplomats and military leaders were unhappy with Putin &apos;s decisive tilt toward the West after the war on terror began . 
Both the Foreign and Defense Ministries wanted a drawn-out fight over America &apos;s withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and NATO enlargement . 
They were mightily disappointed when Putin stated that he did not want any &quot; hysteria &quot; over these issues . 
But without the support of these two ministries , Putin cannot institutionalize his new foreign policy course . 
In other words , his efforts to reorient Russia &apos;s military to confront the most likely threats of the 21st century are being frustrated at the highest level . 
Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov does not even bother to hide his skepticism about the necessity of such a reorientation . &quot; In my view , &quot; he proclaims , &quot; it is still premature to speak of the specific content of changes to Russia &apos;s defense priorities and to the functions and tasks of its armed forces in connection with the threat of international terrorism . &quot; 
Underscoring his real agenda , he adds that , &quot; No radical revision of the fundamental principles governing the operation of the armed forces is required . &quot; 
Yet it is facile to say that antagonism to Putin &apos;s new course derives simply from adherence to Cold War stereotypes . 
Of course , Russia &apos;s generals readily believe the most paranoid explanations of American motives ( particularly now , when American foreign policy seems so arrogant ) . 
But stereotypes can survive so long and be so influential only insofar as they serve the real interests of real people and institutions . 
The interest that Russia &apos;s military and diplomatic elite is defending is something I call the &quot; confrontation paradigm , &quot; within which the role - and budgets !  - of the Foreign and Defense Ministries receive priority in public spending . 
Today , however , President Putin recognizes that economics will determine Russia &apos;s future , and so the &quot; power &quot; ministries must take a back seat to Russia &apos;s modernization and development . 
To promote their position , Russia &apos;s generals and diplomats adhere to the perception that the country remains besieged by enemies , the US and NATO most prominently . 
High-ranking diplomats understand that their way of thinking requires one sort of diplomacy , and that a foreign policy focused on realizing Russia &apos;s economic potential requires quite another . 
So confrontation with the West ( even if only rhetorical ) is a form of job protection by other means . 
The military brass act as they do for essentially the same reason . 
They maintain that Russia needs a big standing army in order to defend the country in any potential war with the US . 
Indeed , this year &apos;s annual session of the Academy of Military Sciences saw army commanders and military theorists try to prove that a future source of conflict will be America &apos;s desire to control the world &apos;s oil-rich regions . 
Lt. Gen. Alexander Rukshin , chief of the General Staff &apos;s main operative directorate , spoke of the need for modernization of command and control systems in preparation for such a war . 
He complained that the existing system has limited capabilities against America &apos;s precision weapons . 
Admiral Victor Kravchenko , the chief of the Navy staff , argued that the main threat to Russia is the US Navy . 
Indeed , only the continuance of a vast global threat can justify the existence of Russia &apos;s armed forces at their current size of 1.2 million personnel , as well as the current conscription system - deeply resented by oridinary Russians - and a reserve of many millions . 
Russian generals insist that conscription must be maintained so that , if necessary , a large-scale war can be waged . 
Like post-Soviet Bourbons , Russia &apos;s generals and diplomats have learned nothing and forgotten nothing . 
They continue to think as they have always done , because it is in their direct self-interest to do all they can to preserve the militarized state of a decadent era .
