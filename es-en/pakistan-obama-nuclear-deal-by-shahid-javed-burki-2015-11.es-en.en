The Pakistani Nuclear Deal That Wasn &apos;t 
LAHORE - Recently , it came to light that the United States was attempting to negotiate with Pakistan a deal to constrain the Pakistanis &quot; fast-growing nuclear weapons program . 
That sounds like good news : Any move toward non-proliferation seems like a positive step . 
Unfortunately , in this case the effort has had some dangerous unintended consequences . 
It all started last month , when US media reported that an agreement was already near completion . 
First , David Ignatius of The Washington Post reported , on the basis of conversations with senior US officials , that agreement had already been reached on a number of steps Pakistan would take to reduce its dependence on nuclear weapons for deterrence . 
A few days later , David Sanger of The New York Times confirmed . 
Both accounts suggested that the agreement would be announced in a joint statement following the October 23 meeting in Washington , DC , between US President Barack Obama and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif . 
But the reality is that those media reports were the beginning , not the end , of the process . 
According to senior Pakistani officials - including Sartaj Aziz , a key adviser on foreign affairs and national security - there was no agreement in the works when the stories appeared . 
Rather , it seemed that the US was using the media to put pressure on Pakistan &apos;s government to respond more readily to America &apos;s pleas to cap production of tactical weapons and the short-range missiles that could deliver them . 
The reports put Pakistan &apos;s political leaders in an awkward position . 
They could not possibly succeed in convincing the country &apos;s powerful military establishment to place constraints on the development of the country &apos;s nuclear arsenal . 
Indeed , the US effort merely widened the divide on security issues within Pakistani- a situation that serves no one &apos;s interests . 
Pakistan &apos;s leaders were determined to turn attention back toward their country &apos;s rapidly deteriorating relations with India , a challenge with which the US could help . 
So when they received America &apos;s draft of the statement to be issued after the Obama-Sharif meeting , and saw that it focused almost entirely on nuclear issues , it was decided that Aziz would head to Washington a day early to agree on revisions . 
From Pakistan &apos;s perspective , the draft statement seemed to be driven by the White House . 
It seemed that &quot; the office of the National Security Adviser wanted to add another &quot; nuclear feather &quot; to Obama &apos;s cap , following the successful negotiations with Iran , &quot; Aziz speculated to me in a private conversation . 
Believing that the US State Department was not &quot; kept in the loop , &quot; Aziz requested that , if he could not agree on the statement &apos;s wording with the designated official , he could meet with Secretary of State John Kerry . 
To be sure , the US government &apos;s agenda would have some benefits for Pakistan . 
The US would press the Nuclear Supplier Group to issue a waiver to Pakistan , as it has already done for India , so that Pakistan could import the technology , parts , and components needed to build nuclear power plants . 
And , in fact , Pakistan needs to build about a half-dozen such plants - in addition to the two already being built by the Chinese near Karachi - to address its energy shortfall , which amounts to an estimated 5,000 megawatts annually . 
With voters heading to the polls in early 2018 , genuine progress toward resolving the energy crisis would presumably be good for Pakistan &apos;s political leaders . 
In exchange for this , however , Pakistan would have to limit the number of tactical nuclear weapons in its arsenal and cease development work on them . 
Moreover , Pakistan would have to mothball the short-range &quot; Nasr &quot; missile , which has already been shown to be capable of delivering small nuclear weapons over a distance of 50-75 kilometers . 
The US believed that shifting Pakistani leaders &quot; attention from nuclear-weapons development to power-plant construction would , in addition to bolstering efforts to close the energy gap , limit Pakistan &apos;s dependence on China for nuclear technology and reduce the risk of an immensely destructive war in South Asia . 
But these calculations failed to take into account Pakistani security considerations - in particular , the military &apos;s renewed fears about India &apos;s intentions . 
For some time , senior military officials have been concentrating on rooting out terrorism at home , and they have scored some impressive successes . 
But recent base-building activity by India near its border with Pakistan has been raising red flags in Islamabad . 
According to a senior Pakistani military official , India , in pursuit of its &quot; Cold Start &quot; military doctrine , is constructing eight bases at which heavy armor would be stationed . 
Developed after the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament , the doctrine calls for Indian troops to move rapidly to occupy 300-500 square kilometers of Pakistani territory in the event of another terrorist attack . 
The occupation would end only when Pakistan formally relinquished its claim to Kashmir and dismantled all terrorist training camps operating within its borders . 
&quot; Tactical nuclear weapons , &quot; the Pakistani military official explained , &quot; will deter India from following through on this strategy . &quot; 
Against this background , the US should have known that trying to compel Pakistan to limit its nuclear-weapons capability would fail . 
But it pushed anyway . 
As a result , Pakistan &apos;s reliance on China has been strengthened , not weakened . 
And , instead of reducing the chances of a nuclear standoff in South Asia , the White House plan served only to distract attention from efforts to address tensions between India and Pakistan . 
Ultimately , the Obama-Sharif statement did emphasize India-Pakistan relations , and made no reference to the nuclear issue . 
Obama mentioned Kashmir as an unresolved issue , while pleading for stability in South Asian affairs . 
According to Aziz , Pakistan was satisfied with the final statement . 
The US , however , may not have felt the same .
