Cold War Lessons for George W. Bush 
President Bush recently drew an analogy between the current struggle against violent jihadi terrorism and the Cold War . 
He is right in one respect : waves of terrorism tend to be generational . 
Unfortunately , like the Cold War , the current &quot; war on terror &quot; is likely to be a matter of decades , not years . 
But Bush missed another lesson implicit in his analogy : the importance of using the soft power of culture . 
The Cold War was won by a combination of military power , which deterred Soviet aggression , and the attractive power of Western culture and ideas . 
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 , hammers and bulldozers , not artillery , brought it down . 
Unfortunately , Bush has not learned this lesson . 
Academic and scientific exchanges during the Cold War played a significant role in enhancing American soft power . 
While some American skeptics feared that Soviet scientists and KGB agents would steal American technology , they failed to notice that the visitors vacuumed up political ideas alongside scientific secrets . 
Many of these scientists became leading proponents of human rights and liberalization inside the USSR . 
Some 50,000 Soviets - writers , journalists , officials , musicians , dancers , athletes , and academics - visited the United States between 1958 and 1988 . 
Aleksandr Yakovlev was strongly influenced by his studies at Columbia University in 1958 . 
Yakovlev went on to become a Politburo member and key liberalizing influence on Mikhail Gorbachev . 
Oleg Kalugin , who became a high KGB official , said in looking back from the vantage point of 1997 , &quot; Exchanges were a Trojan Horse for the Soviet Union . 
They played a tremendous role in the erosion of the Soviet system .... They kept infecting more and more people over the years . &quot; 
Yet today , the Bush administration oversees a cumbersome visa program that has cut the number of such exchanges , particularly with Muslim countries . 
Popular culture was also important during the Cold War . 
Many intellectuals disdain popular culture because of its crude commercialism . 
But such scorn is misplaced , because popular entertainment often contains subtle images and messages about individualism , consumer choice , and other values that have important political effects . 
American films , for example , include sex , violence , and materialism , but that is not the whole story . 
They also portray American life as open , mobile , individualistic , anti-establishment , pluralist , populist , and free . 
As the poet Carl Sandburg put it in 1961 : &quot; What , Hollywood &apos;s more important than Harvard ? 
The answer is , not as clean as Harvard , but nevertheless , further reaching . &quot; 
The line between information and entertainment has never been as sharp as some intellectuals imagine , and it is becoming increasingly blurred . 
Some popular music lyrics can have political effects . 
Cultural messages can also be conveyed by the way that sports teams or stars conduct themselves , or in the multiple images purveyed by television or cinema . 
Pictures often convey values more powerfully than words . 
Even the consumption of fast food can make an implicit statement . 
As one Indian family described their visit to McDonald &apos;s , it was stepping out for &quot; a slice of America . &quot; 
Although the Soviet Union restricted and censored Western films , those that made it through had devastating political effects . 
As one Soviet journalist commented after a restricted showing of films that were critical of American nuclear weapons policies , &quot; They absolutely shocked us .... We began to understand that the same thing would happen to us as to them in a nuclear war . &quot; 
Soviet audiences watching films with apolitical themes nonetheless learned that people in the West did not have to stand in long lines to purchase food , did not live in communal apartments , and owned their own cars . 
All of this discredited the negative views promulgated by the Soviet media . 
Even rock and roll played a part . 
As one of Gorbachev &apos;s aides later testified , &quot; The Beatles were our quiet way of rejecting &quot; the system &quot; while conforming to most of its demands . &quot; 
Czech Communist officials sentenced a group of young people to prison in the 1950 &quot; s for playing tapes of &quot; decadent American music , &quot; but their efforts turned out to be counter-productive . 
In 1980 , after John Lennon was murdered , a monument to him spontaneously appeared in Prague , and the anniversary of his death was marked by an annual procession for peace and democracy . 
In 1988 , the organizers founded a Lennon Peace Club that demanded the removal of Soviet troops . 
Lennon trumped Lenin . 
The Cold War was won by a mixture of hard and soft power . 
Not all of the sources of soft power were American - witness the role of the BBC and the Beatles . 
But it would be a mistake to ignore the role that popular culture played . 
One has to be careful in drawing lessons for today . 
Eastern European cultures were more similar to Western cultures than are Muslim cultures . 
In some fundamentalist circles , and among the terrorists , Western culture evokes repulsion , not attraction . 
But even in Iran , where the ruling mullahs describe America as &quot; the great Satan , &quot; the young want to watch American videos in the privacy of their homes . 
Polls in the Muslim world show that American culture remains attractive to the moderate majority . 
It is American policies that have led to America &apos;s unpopularity . 
For a start , Bush could learn to get out of the way and encourage more popular and grassroots contacts .
