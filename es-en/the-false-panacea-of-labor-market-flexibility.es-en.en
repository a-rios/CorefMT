The False Panacea of Labor-Market Flexibility 
AMSTERDAM - Competitiveness has become one of the economic buzzwords of our time . 
Barack Obama trumpeted it during his State of the Union address in January , and European leaders from the Tory David Cameron in Britain to the Socialist Jos√© Luis Zapatero in Spain to Japan &apos;s new Minister of Economics Kaoru Yosano have embraced it as a priority . 
But what sort of competitiveness do they have in mind ? 
Asked during an interview in September 2007 whether European governments should liberalize their countries &quot; labor codes , former United States Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan responded that Europe &apos;s labor-protection laws significantly inhibited economic performance and resulted in chronically high unemployment across the continent . 
In the United States , people are fired more easily than in any other country , and the unemployment rate at the time was among the lowest in the world . 
But it &apos;s no longer September 2007 , and US unemployment stands at 9.4 % , not 4.5 % . 
And , according to Greenspan &apos;s successor , Ben Bernanke , there is no reason to assume that the unemployment rate will approach 5 % - generally considered to be the natural rate of unemployment - any time soon . 
In the 2000 &quot; s , the US lost two million private-sector jobs on balance , with the total falling from 110 million in December 1999 to 108 million in December 2009 , despite massive consumer spending . 
That 1.4 % decline came during a decade in which the US population grew by about 9.8 % . 
To understand what is happening , consider Evergreen Solar , the third-largest maker of solar panels in the US , which announced in January that it would close its main American factory , lay off its 800 workers there within two months , and shift production to China . 
Evergreen &apos;s management cited the much higher government support available in China as its reason for the move . 
Evergreen is only one of many cases suggesting that the US might find itself in the midst of what Princeton-economist Alan Blinder in 2005 dubbed the Third Industrial Revolution . 
According to Blinder , 42-56 million US jobs - about one-third of all public- and private-sector jobs in the country - are vulnerable for offshoring . 
Blinder also predicted that the flexible , fluid US labor market would adapt better and faster to globalization than European labor markets would . 
If anything , we are only in the early stages of that revolution , and the outcome remains uncertain . 
But a preliminary comparison between Europe &apos;s largest economy , Germany , and the US suggests that the former is better equipped to hold its own in the age of globalization . 
German multinationals like Siemens and Daimler are ratcheting up investment to meet both emerging-market and domestic demand . 
The companies plan to add hundreds of thousands of jobs worldwide this year alone . 
While many of these jobs will be in Asia , both companies say that they will add high-skill jobs in Germany as well . 
Is Germany &apos;s labor-market rigidity to thank for that ? 
It may indeed be part of the explanation . 
A recent study by the Central Planning Bureau in the Netherlands shows that workers with a permanent contract receive more employer-funded training than workers with a temporary contract . 
For US employers , it is much easier to purge workers from the payroll - or , as Robert Gordon of Northwestern University puts it , to toss out every deck chair - than it is for German employers . 
Germany &apos;s labor code bars such layoffs , but German employers also are presumably less inclined than US employers to shed workers , because they have invested more in their companies &quot; human capital . 
With fewer firm-specific skills than their German counterparts , American workers are more susceptible to layoffs . 
Indeed , Siemens , apparently conscious of the benefits of labor-market rigidity , has taken the unusual step of promising its employees a job for life . 
Last year , the company sealed an agreement with the trade union IG Metall that includes a no-layoff pledge for its 128,000-strong German workforce . 
A more important explanation for Germany &apos;s current economic success may be the substantial government support that German industries receive on a structural basis , especially the car industry . 
The US economy , on the other hand , is bogging down in its policymakers &quot; persistent emphasis on consumption and tax cuts ( most notably for the super-rich ) over investment . 
The US needs to change its economic-policy course . 
A decade of historically low interest rates has led to economic imbalances in favor of sectors that are highly leveraged : the financial sector , the housing market , and private equity . 
This has come at the expense of sectors that are more dependent on equity financing . 
Now that the housing bubble has burst , the US finds itself out-trained , out-educated , and out-maneuvered in the global competition for employment . 
We now know that labor-market deregulation does not ensure economic resilience and rapid job creation . 
On the contrary , the best solution is probably a diversity of labor contracts . 
A certain amount of labor-market rigidity may make economic sense for jobs that require firm-specific skills and training , alongside greater flexibility for jobs that require fewer skills .
