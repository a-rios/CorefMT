Why Development Aid is Not Enough 
OSLO - Poverty is not only about not having enough money . 
It is also about exploitation and oppression , and about armed conflicts and wars that make it impossible to run a business , visit the doctor , or send children to school . 
In short , poverty is about politics , and the need to devise political solutions to its underlying causes , which involves more than providing money . 
The world has changed greatly since 2000 , when the international community adopted the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) . 
There has been a major shift in geopolitical power , with countries previously regarded as poor enough to receive aid transformed into emerging-market drivers of the world economy . 
Power has also shifted in the global political arena , with the global financial crisis catalysing the emergence of the G-20 . 
If the fight against poverty is to be based on our traditional carbon-heavy growth path , the climate consequences will be devastating , even if the richer parts of the world were to get rid of all emissions today . 
The result would be floods , drought , dramatically reduced food production , and a great loss of our precious biodiversity . 
All of this would obviously lead to a dramatic increase in poverty around the world , but , as always , the poorer countries would be the hardest hit . 
Yet not to fight poverty is perhaps a worse option still . 
Not providing proper access to energy would mean not only denying a billion people their basic needs and rights , but also that more wood will be chopped down for firewood , resulting in deforestation and desertification . 
Rich countries &quot; engagement in the fight against global poverty has always been based on justice and a moral imperative . 
But our experience during this first decade of the twenty-first century has made it clear that fighting poverty is also necessary for a secure future . 
As Norway &apos;s minister for both the environment and development since 2007 , I meet with other countries &quot; ministers with both portfolios , and it has come as a shock to see how the two groups lead such separate lives . 
Each has its own important agenda , its own analysis of the challenges ahead , its own strategic plans , and literally its own language . 
While each recognizes the importance of the other &apos;s agenda , unless they talk and act together , neither group &apos;s goals will be achieved . 
Meanwhile , global climate negotiations - now the most important forum where development and environment experts and decision makers meet - have proven that the era of Western global hegemony has passed . 
The so-called developing world contains something that we want : huge untouched rainforests that are vital to our future existence . 
These countries are able to choose a different technological path to growth , one based on low-carbon strategies and green principles . 
It is a path that we desperately need them to choose , but one that also means greater negotiating power for poorer countries than we have ever seen . 
It will be challenging , but maybe also healthy for our common future . 
The amounts needed for development , peacekeeping , and climate adaptation and mitigation will be enormous , and we have been debating for years the appropriate level of aid . 
But , although aid is important , public funding from the developed countries can never be enough , even if we were to fulfill all our pledges . 
Over the last decade , innovative financing has become the new buzzword , and not just for development . 
As part of the climate negotiations , new mechanisms for mobilizing funds are being suggested , with levies on air travel and taxes on financial transactions perhaps the best known . 
Such funding schemes &quot; great innovation is that the richest people would pay , regardless of their own country &apos;s economic position . 
But the most important of all financial flows are the illicit funds that pour out of so many developing countries , which the Tax Justice Network estimates to be around ten times the development aid that they receive . 
Much of this money comes from cross-border financial transactions linked to illegal activities , with profits from organized crime and the trafficking of drugs , weapons , and human beings accounting for a substantial proportion . 
Moreover , while large sums disappear through fraud , corruption , bribery , smuggling , and money laundering , the largest share of illicit financial flows is related to commercial transactions , often within multinational companies , for the purpose of tax evasion . 
These flows are made possible mainly by tax havens , so the fight against global poverty should also be a fight against them . 
Tax havens make economic crime more profitable , and the only way to fight them is to adopt global agreements on transparency in financial transfers , which should also cover companies on a country-to-country basis . 
We must be careful not to fool ourselves into believing that the MDGs can be achieved through development aid alone . 
The wider politics of poverty must be placed at the top of the international agenda , along with the three factors most critical to development : climate , conflict , and capital .
