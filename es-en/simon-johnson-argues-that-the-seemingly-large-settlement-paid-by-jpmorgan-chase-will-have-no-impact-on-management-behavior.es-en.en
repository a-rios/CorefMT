Financial Regulators &quot; Fine Mess 
WASHINGTON , DC - When an athlete breaks the rules , it is easy to figure out whether the relevant disciplinary body really wants to discourage repeat offenses . 
Suspending a player from the sport - as happens in soccer in the case of dangerous fouls - is a real punishment , not only for the individual but also for the team . 
Consider the case of Michael Clarke , the captain of the Australian cricket team , who recently threatened bodily harm to an opposing player . 
Despite public hand-wringing , Cricket Australia ( the governing body ) imposed only a small fine ( that is , small relative to Clarke &apos;s annual salary ) . 
Whether or not this was appropriate , Cricket Australia was making it clear that such behavior merited only a symbolic punishment . 
The recent $ 13 billion settlement between the US Department of Justice and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) , one of the world &apos;s largest international banks , should be viewed the same way . 
To the uninitiated , the fine appears significant ( which explains all the attention-grabbing headlines ) , and it certainly has made America &apos;s financial regulators look busy and serious . 
But , just like Cricket Australia , the message is clear : There will be no change to business as usual . 
JPM was accused of a wide range of illegal activities , including misrepresenting securities to investors and much more . 
Better Markets , a pro-financial-reform group , points out that what we know about the settlement suggests that it is largely meaningless . 
As Dennis Kelleher , head of Better Markets , put it , 
&quot; Rather than throwing the book at &#91; JPM &#93; and its executives , the Department of Justice called off a press conference and stopped a lawsuit because the bank &apos;s high profile , politically-connected CEO , Jamie Dimon , personally called the Attorney General and asked him to do so . &quot; 
The way in which the settlement was worked out should also give us pause - with Dimon having direct access to US Attorney General Eric Holder , America &apos;s top law-enforcement official . 
&quot; Few if any Americans have the ability to even get the AG on the phone , &quot; Kelleher reminds us , &quot; much less the power to get him to stop him from filing a lawsuit that would have revealed to the public the details of JPMorgan &apos;s alleged illegal conduct . &quot; 
As a result , we will not learn exactly what was alleged in the case against JPM , including the evidence used . 
The level of public scrutiny and concern will subside . 
But at least JPM must pay a high price to make the entire matter disappear , right ? 
Well , no . 
A $ 13 billion &quot; fine &quot; for a company the size of JPM is about as painful as Clarke &apos;s fine is for him - not painful at all . 
Clarke earns about $ 6 million ( Australian dollars ) per year ; in addition to an annual retainer , he receives a $ 14,000 match fee for every international test match , along with other tour fees and bonuses . 
He was fined 20 % of the international match fee ( $ 2,800 ) , or about 0.05 % of his annual salary . 
For anyone with an annual income of $ 50,000 ( which is close to the median for US households ) , this would be equivalent to a fine of $ 25 . 
JPM has a total balance sheet of around $ 4 trillion , measured using international accounting standards . 
As management told shareholders after the settlement was announced , &quot; the Firm is appropriately reserved for all of these matters , &quot; meaning that there would be no material impact on earnings . 
And , predictably , &quot; the Firm did not admit any violations of law . &quot; 
In fact , while Clark &apos;s paltry fine presumably at least comes out of his own pocket , the penalty levied on JPM is to be paid largely by its shareholders . 
And , because there is no market for corporate control over megabanks ( because protections provided by regulators prevent hostile takeovers or effective shareholder activism ) , frustration on the part of JPM &apos;s investors cannot result in a change of management . 
But , again , JPM &apos;s shareholders have little cause for concern . 
Marianne Lake , JP Morgan &apos;s chief financial officer , has suggested that about $ 7 billion of the fine is likely to be tax deductible , that is , treated as a form of necessary and usual business expense . 
The bank was taxed at an effective rate of 31.3 % in the first nine months of 2013 , according to the Wall Street Journal , implying a tax break worth around $ 2.2 billion ( which could end up higher ) . 
While JPM is now off the hook , holding individual employees personally accountable for their behavior is still an option . 
But no one should hold their breath . 
The chances that anyone will be suspended from the industry are minimal , and the impact on management is likely to be nil . 
Kelleher sent a forceful letter to Holder , urging full disclosure of all relevant details in the case - and there are many . 
Americans owe it to themselves to read it and recommend it to their elected representatives . 
Kelleher concludes , &quot; Equal justice for all without fear or favor is the bedrock of our democracy and , indeed , our country . &quot; 
Unfortunately , the Department of Justice still seems to believe that very large companies deserve special access and special treatment .
