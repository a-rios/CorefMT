Running from Musharraf 
How times change the man . 
Pakistan &apos;s embattled president , Pervez Musharraf , once declared , &quot; I am not at all a politician . 
Eight years after seizing power and exiling his main civilian opponents , the general is moving heaven and earth to hold on to political office . 
Though he took power in a bloodless coup , there was little doubt about his popularity at the time . 
The public had tired of a civilian regime marked by corruption and economic chaos . 
Musharraf &apos;s personal frankness and integrity appealed to the street and earned him de facto legitimacy . 
The general , who offered the father of modern Turkey , Kemal Atat√ºrk , as his model , also seemed to represent a vision for his country that combined economic growth with support for secularizing impulses . 
But , given his unwillingness to seek support for his regime and his policies from the ballot box , Musharraf succeeded in undermining both . 
Over the years , he rigged referendums , browbeat the judiciary , and asked Islamic parties for support to shore up his government . 
A president &apos;s modernizing vision degenerated into a dictator &apos;s power-driven myopia . 
Musharraf admitted on television this year , &quot; Yes , my popularity has been reduced . &quot; 
Yet he clearly failed to comprehend that this was not just about approval ratings . 
The political core of his regime had become hollow . 
In March , he sacked the chief justice of the Supreme Court , Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , probably because Chaudhry objected to Musharraf &apos;s seeking a constitutionally questionable third term as president . 
It proved to be the tipping point , triggering waves of protests by lawyers and other groups in Pakistan &apos;s main cities . 
Unable to vote the general out of office , the public took to the streets . 
Polls show Musharraf &apos;s support has fallen to a third of the population , and that two-thirds oppose his seeking another presidential term . 
Simultaneously , there has been considerable erosion of support from Musharraf &apos;s strongest external backer , the United States . 
After he seized power , America welcomed Musharraf &apos;s willingness to fight al-Qaeda and the Taliban on his territory in exchange for large infusions of military aid . 
The general fought less out of conviction than pragmatism , but the end result was the same . 
Or so the US believed . 
Given the long-standing relationship between Pakistan &apos;s Islamic militants and the military , it became clear there were limits to how far Musharraf was prepared to go in the &quot; war on terrorism . &quot; 
Musharraf is now desperate to beg , steal , or borrow any political legitimacy he can get - including from the two civilian political leaders he exiled . 
His most ambitious strategy has been to try to form a partnership with Benazir Bhutto , the head of one of the two largest democratic parties . 
Bhutto initially saw this as an opportunity to end her exile and ease herself into the prime ministership with a politically wounded partner . 
Her primary demand was that Musharraf surrender his uniform . 
The other civilian leader , Nawaz Sharif , responded by defying his exile , returning to Pakistan , and promptly being re-expelled . 
But Sharif succeeded in undermining the Bhutto-Musharraf plan , positioning himself as Pakistan &apos;s genuine champion of democracy . 
In one move , he reversed the Pakistani political dynamic : being farthest from the dictator became more valuable than being closest to him . 
Unsurprisingly , Bhutto is now having second thoughts about an alliance with Musharraf , who has been reduced to chasing after her in an effort to salvage the deal . 
Musharraf , according to his lawyer &apos;s depositions before the Supreme Court , plans to give up his uniform after the indirect presidential elections he scheduled for October 6 . 
In preparation , he has replaced senior generals in the Pakistani army with officers considered more beholden to him , evidently hoping that this will ensure the military &apos;s loyalty even after he removes himself from the chain of command . 
However , his options are shrinking rapidly . 
The US , concerned with ensuring stability in case of a transition to a new government , is keeping silent about its preference for Musharraf to remain head of both the government and the army . 
The Bush administration is slowly recognizing that for a Pakistani leader to be an effective counterterrorism ally , he or she must have a modicum of legitimacy . 
The two civilian leaders may soon begin vying with each other to see who can claim to be more anti-Musharraf . 
Even Osama bin Laden , sensing an opportunity to stir up trouble and win popular support , has issued a video calling for a jihad against Musharraf . 
Nor can Musharraf count on the military , despite his recent appointments . 
The generals have always placed the institution of the military above all else , including rulers from their own ranks . 
If they come to believe that Musharraf is sinking , they can be counted on to cut him loose , especially if he becomes a civilian .
