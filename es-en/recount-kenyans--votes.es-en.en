Recount Kenyans &quot; Votes 
Kenya is aflame after a presidential election on December 27 widely believed to have been rigged to secure the re-election of Mwai Kibaki . 
Kibaki &apos;s opponents took to the streets , the government issued shoot-to-kill orders , and hundreds have died at the hands of the police as well as from gang rampages and inter-ethnic violence . 
The United States has led the international diplomatic response , but its approach has been deeply flawed . 
Kenyans voted in vast numbers , waiting in the hot sun for several hours at crowded polling booths around the country . 
The first results to be counted were for Kenya &apos;s parliament , with Kibaki &apos;s government ministers roundly defeated in their local constituencies . 
The main opposition alliance , led by Raila Odinga , won about 100 seats , compared to roughly 30 for Kibaki . 
It appeared overwhelmingly likely that the presidential vote count would similarly show Odinga beating Kibaki by a wide margin . 
That , indeed , is how the early count transpired . 
As the tallies from polling stations from around the country came into Nairobi , Odinga built up a lead of several hundred thousand votes . 
Then the trouble began . 
Vote tallies from Kibaki &apos;s homeland in central Kenya were delayed . 
Independent observers from the European Union and elsewhere began to report serious irregularities in the Kibaki strongholds , where opposition party representatives were denied access to polling sites . 
Matters became even more dubious as the vote tallies were collected and recorded at the Electoral Commission of Kenya ( ECK ) . 
According to detailed evidence submitted by the opposition , the tallies from the countryside , allegedly already padded for Kibaki , were again manipulated , with additional votes awarded to him . 
As a result , many more votes were recorded by the ECK for the presidential race than for the parliamentary race , even though voters were clearly instructed - indeed required - to cast a vote in both races . 
When the opposition tried to challenge these inconsistencies , the ECK abruptly declared Kibaki the winner . 
Days later , the ECK &apos;s head publicly acknowledged that Kibaki supporters had pressured him to announce the &quot; results &quot; immediately , despite the clear evidence of vote rigging . 
Shockingly , he declared that he did not know who really won . 
The EU observers also announced that the election tally had not met basic international standards . 
The election is a disaster for Kenya , but the response of the international community , led by the US , is no less distressing . 
American foreign policy in Africa is in the hands of Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer , a former student of Secretary of State Condeleezza Rice . 
From the start of the post-election crisis , Frazer took three flawed positions . 
First , she declared that the vote could not be re-assessed by an independent tally . 
In fact , most observers on the scene believed that there was a long paper trail , from the polling sites all the way to Nairobi , which could be re-assessed in detail . 
Second , she claimed that there had been vote rigging &quot; on both sides , &quot; and suggested that the true election results were very close and that perhaps Kibaki had won . 
Given the vast amount of direct and circumstantial evidence that the rigging was on behalf of Kibaki , Frazer &apos;s assignment of equal blame to each side was met with astonishment and dismay by the opposition . 
She also failed to acknowledge an exit poll carried out by a US foundation , which showed a clear Odinga victory . 
Finally , Frazer argued that the two sides needed to compromise and share power . 
Instead , Kibaki disdainfully appointed 18 key cabinet members even as &quot; mediation &quot; from abroad was about to begin . 
The opposition , of course , was perplexed by the US call for compromise without any serious call to review the vote itself . 
In the end , only Kenya will decide its own fate . 
The US or other outside powers will not save Kenyan democracy . 
Threats , sanctions , or aid cutoffs would only cause further damage to an economy already in free fall , tragically punishing Kenya &apos;s poor while fomenting further violence . 
Still , the international community can play a more constructive role than it has until now by pressing both sides to accept an independent recount . 
By standing up for democratic principles , the world would truly stand on the side of the Kenyan people . 
In dismissing such a recount , Frazer told Kenyans that they shouldn &apos;t expect their vote to be tallied accurately , and that power can be seized or perhaps even negotiated in a backroom . 
She also sent an unmistakable signal to those who would steal votes : at worst , they might have to share a few cabinet positions with the opposition . 
Perhaps a recount would show that the election was too close to call . 
Perhaps , as the opposition insists , it would demonstrate a clear victory for Odinga . 
Either way , Kenyans and their votes would be taken seriously , and tempers could well subside . 
Only if both sides accept that there was no clear winner is it reasonable to call for power-sharing ( or a new election ) . 
There is still time to get this right . 
The international community should stop pushing for a backroom &quot; compromise &quot; that ignores the popular will . 
Let the world stand with neither Kibaki nor the opposition , nor for an arbitrary compromise , but with Kenya &apos;s voters . 
If Kibaki rejects an independent recount , his refusal will reverberate around Kenya and the world . 
Those who ignore voters should quickly learn that they have no place to hide .
