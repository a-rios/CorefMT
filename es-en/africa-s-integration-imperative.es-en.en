Africa &apos;s Integration Imperative 
Karl Marx predicted that states would wither away in anticipation of an idyllic communist society capable of auto-regulating economic imbalances and empowering the masses . 
So he would have been flabbergasted to see his prophecy realized , not by communism , but by the globalization of Anglo-American economic liberalism . 
Opening up markets to the free flow of capital , not the dictatorship of the proletariat , has rendered state power obsolete . 
Today &apos;s capital markets raise money for governments , corporate clients , and individual customers , manage pension funds &quot; investments , and bet on the level of interest rates or the stock market . 
Trading in derivatives by investment banks , hedge funds , and other market participants , reaps huge profits for traders while depriving the real economy of productive investment and job creation . 
No population in the world is spared from the harsh treatment of such a system . 
Some 40 % of the world &apos;s 6.5 billion people live in poverty , and a sixth live in extreme poverty . 
However , the world &apos;s black populations are the prime victims . 
In the United States , one-eighth of all black males between the ages of 25 and 34 are in jail , and three out of five black American households with children are headed by a single mother . 
As for African countries , the politics and economics of globalization have stripped them of their assets and natural resources and left them with an unbearable debt burden . 
As a result , the percentage of Africa &apos;s population living in extreme poverty increased from 41.6 % in 1981 to 46.9 % in 2001 . 
On the other hand , in the era of globalization , regions in which internal trade exceeds external trade have better economic outlooks and stronger social cohesion . 
This is the case for Europe , Asia , and , increasingly , Latin America , particularly among the member states of Mercosur ( Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Uruguay , and Paraguay ) . 
The opposite is true for regional groupings in Africa and in the Middle East where trade with the outside world is more important than intra-regional trade . 
As a result , any country formulating strategies to counter the destructive forces of globalization should give overriding priority to a self-centred economic development strategy , preferably within a regional framework . 
This is a prerequisite to defending against market fundamentalism and avoiding the iniquitous conditions of the international marketplace . 
In this respect , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Brunei Darussalam , Cambodia , Indonesia , Laos , Malaysia , Myanmar , Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , and Vietnam ) constitutes an edifying example . 
The ASEAN economies adopted a united front on international economic issues and accorded priority to internal economic integration and expanding linkages with major trading partners . 
Exports have remained the main driver of economic performance for the ASEAN countries , contributing to 5.8 % regional GDP growth in 2006 . 
ASEAN foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows reached US $ 38 billion in 2005 , up by 48 % from the previous year . 
The outlook for 2006 was also bullish , with preliminary data for the first quarter indicating that FDI flows had already reached US $ 14 billion , up from US $ 7.4 billion in the year-earlier period . 
ASEAN &apos;s drive to establish a fully-fledged economic community has been underlined by implementation of its Priority Integration Sector Roadmaps . 
By contrast , sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s historical legacy of artificial and unmanageable colonial boundaries , ethnic antagonisms , its citizens &quot; deficit of self-respect , and an appalling record of leadership failures has hampered its quest for economic integration . 
But a sector-by-sector approach could mitigate these handicaps , and , given the pressing need to address demand for energy and climate change , it might be strategically advisable to start with the energy sector . 
Africa is a continent rich in energy , holding two-thirds of the world &apos;s reserves of hydro-electric power - trillions of kilowatt-hours representing about half of total world resources . 
The Congo River alone holds more than 600 billion kilowatt-hours of annual reserves . The Sanaga ( Cameroon ) and the Ogoou√© ( Gabon ) hold half as much . 
Technological breakthroughs have made it feasible to transport electricity via high-voltage direct current ( HVDC ) over long distances without incurring great losses ( only about 3 % per 1,000 kilometers ) . 
Carbon-free hydroelectric power is the right choice as sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s principal source of energy . 
Harnessing the hydroelectric power of the Congo Basin alone would be enough to meet all of Africa &apos;s energy needs , or to light the entire continent of South America . Moreover , establishing an African grid would enable power from the Democratic Republic of Congo to be delivered to southern European countries such as Spain , Portugal , and Italy . 
However , while 90 % of world reserves of hydraulic energy are concentrated in underdeveloped regions like sub-Saharan Africa , HVDC technology remains the preserve of developed countries . 
There is thus an imperative not only for regional integration in Africa , but also for a joint strategic vision and partnership to help build global energy and climate security .
