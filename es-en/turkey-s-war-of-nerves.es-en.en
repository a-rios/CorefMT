Turkey &apos;s War of Nerves 
With the political standoff surrounding the selection of a new president intensifying , Turkey is entering a critical period that could have a profound effect on both the country &apos;s internal evolution as a secular democracy and its relations with the West . 
The presidential candidacy of the moderate Islamist Abdullah Gul , currently the foreign minister , has been rejected by Turkey &apos;s highest court , and the parliamentary election scheduled for November has been moved up to July in an effort to break the political impasse . 
But these steps are unlikely to defuse tensions between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s government and Turkey &apos;s military , which sees itself as the guardian of the country &apos;s secular state . 
On the contrary , these tensions have heightened as a result of changes in the top echelons of the Turkish armed forces , particularly the replacement last August of General Hilmi Ozkok as chief of the Turkish General Staff . 
Ozkok was a moderate who maintained a low profile and sought to develop good working relations with Erdogan , By contrast , his successor , General Yasar Buyukanit , is a strong secularist who has been far more outspoken in asserting the military &apos;s views . 
In a speech last October to the Military Academies Command in Istanbul , Buyukanit publicly warned that Turkey faced a serious threat from &quot; fundamentalism . &quot; 
Many viewed that charge as a direct criticism of Erdogan and the governing Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) . 
Tensions reached a boiling point on April 27 when the General Staff issued a statement stressing that &quot; the Turkish armed forces maintain their sound determination to carry out their duties stemming from laws to protect the unchangeable character of the Republic of Turkey . 
Their loyalty to this determination is absolute . &quot; 
That toughly worded statement was seen as a veiled but unmistakable warning that the military was prepared to intervene if Gul &apos;s election as president resulted in an effort by the Erdogan government to push its Islamic agenda or take measures that threatened the secular nature of the Turkish political order . 
The statement was particularly significant because the Turkish armed forces have intervened in the political process four times since 1960 - the last time in l997 when they forced the resignation of the Islamist-oriented government of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan in what has come to be known as a &quot; post-modern coup . &quot; 
These tensions have been compounded by differences between Buyukanit and Erdogan over Turkey &apos;s struggle against Kurdish separatists led by the Kurdistan Workers &quot; Party ( PKK ) , which the military regards as a serious threat to Turkey &apos;s territorial integrity . 
PKK guerrilla attacks have resulted in more than 35,000 deaths since l984 . 
Since January 2006 , PKK cross-border raids from safe havens in northern Iraq have led to roughly 600 deaths , many of them members of the Turkish security forces . 
As Turkish casualties have mounted , the military &apos;s patience has begun to wear thin and Erdogan has come under growing internal pressure to take unilateral military action against the PKK . 
At a news conference on April 12 , Buyukanit bluntly argued that a military operation in Iraq aimed at eliminating the PKK threat was &quot; necessary &quot; and &quot; would be useful . &quot; 
His remarks reflect the military &apos;s growing frustration with the lack of concrete American support , and seemed designed to intensify pressure on Erdogan to authorize unilateral cross-border operations against PKK bases in northern Iraq . 
But Turkey &apos;s Kurdish problem cannot be solved by military means . 
It can be resolved only by dialogue between the Turkish government and the leaders of the Iraqi Kurds , as well as by economic and political measures designed to improve the living conditions and political rights of Turkey &apos;s Kurdish population . 
Erdogan &apos;s government seems to recognize this , and has recently shown an interest in initiating a dialogue with Iraqi Kurdish leaders . 
The Turkish military , however , oppose a high-level dialogue with Iraqi Kurds on the grounds that the Democratic Party of Kurdistan ( DPK ) , headed by Massoud Barzani , and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , led by Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , support the PKK materially and politically . 
Given the key role the military plays in Turkish politics , especially on sensitive national security issues , Erdogan will need the military &apos;s support - or at least its acquiescence - for any initiative to succeed . 
Thus , he may be reluctant to proceed with a dialogue with the Iraqi Kurds at a time when tensions with the military are running high over the influence of Islamists in Turkish politics . 
Erdogan has moved to defuse the current crisis by declaring that he will seek early elections as well as sweeping constitutional changes that would make the president popularly elected , rather than elected by the parliament . 
This would give the president greater legitimacy and independence , while reducing fears that he might be tempted to follow the agenda of a particular party . 
At the same time , if Turkey is to become a mature , modern democracy , the military will need to accept a less intrusive role in Turkish politics . 
While a number of steps have been taken in this direction during the past several years , the current crisis underscores that Turkey still faces a long road before that goal is fully realized .
