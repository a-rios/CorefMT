Benazir Bhutto &apos;s Gamble 
As the initial shock of the terrorist attacks against Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto fade , it is becoming clear that they were a political boon for her , triggering a wave of public sympathy that extends well beyond her local Sindh stronghold . 
Yet despite this , Bhutto is finding it hard to convert this changed public mood into increased political support . 
Bhutto , the head of the Pakistan People &apos;s Party , needs all the support she can find after returning from exile . 
Her decision to form an alliance of convenience with Pakistan &apos;s unpopular military ruler , Pervez Musharraf , continues to undermine her claim to be a restorer of democracy and champion of the street . 
The deal has lent greater public legitimacy to Musharraf , who will share some of the power he has monopolized . 
Yet there is little love and even less common policy between the two . 
In theory , the suicide attacks against Bhutto should have brought them closer together . 
After all , Islamic militants have repeatedly tried to assassinate Musharraf . 
Instead , Bhutto accused members of Musharraf &apos;s own party , the Pakistan Muslim League ( Q ) , and his government of playing a role in the attack . 
Shujaat , only half-jokingly , returned the favor by calling her a terrorist . 
Musharraf denounced her statements . 
Bhutto and Musharraf implicitly agree that Pakistan &apos;s other democratic leader , Nawaz Sharif , should be kept in exile in Saudi Arabia until after the general election in January . 
But skewing the election in this manner hurts Bhutto more than Musharraf , reinforcing the sentiment that she is a stooge of the military , and that Sharif is the real democratic leader . 
This reinforces her need to maintain distance from Musharraf . Almost everyone agrees that theirs is less a political alliance than a shotgun wedding . Much of the shotgun &apos;s ammunition comes from the United States , which perceives keeping the military in power as being necessary for the short-term battle against the new Taliban groups . 
However , America also believes that rolling back popular support for Islamic fundamentalism in the long term requires a legitimate democratic government . 
Islamic parties have tended to benefit electorally when the democratic parties are politically hobbled . 
The US hopes to get the best of both worlds . 
Likewise , Bhutto &apos;s ability to play the Musharraf card and still maintain public support is fragile . 
A poll by the International Republican Institute in August showed that 47 % of Pakistani voters supported a Bhutto-Musharraf alliance , with 37 % opposed . 
Notably , nearly a third of Bhutto &apos;s own party opposed such a deal . 
Musharraf &apos;s recent farcical reelection as president probably cost Bhutto support . 
The terrorist attacks and her response - attacking Musharraf &apos;s party , visiting the wounded in hospital , and offering to pay for their medical care - have probably earned some of it back . 
The question now is : can she keep it ? 
One concern for Bhutto is the role of the judiciary , which has no love for Musharraf . 
Their acquiescence in Musharraf &apos;s reelection , however , appears to confirm rumors that the judges have come to terms with the generals . 
The wild card is the increasingly savage war between the Pakistani state and the Islamic militants who have established a de facto independent state - a so-called &quot; Al Qaedastan &quot; - straddling the Pakistan-Afghanistan border . 
The army is losing dozens of men every week and facing growing disciplinary problems from its Pashtun ethnic soldiers , who hail from the border region . 
The militant response has been suicide bomb attacks in the urban centers of the Pakistani heartland . 
But the attacks have not led the public to rally against Islamic militancy . 
A poll by Terror Free Tomorrow in September showed that Osama bin Laden , the Taliban , and local Islamic militants received approval ratings either equal to or higher than Musharraf . 
There is no approval for the escalating suicide bomb attacks . 
This has already taken its toll on Musharraf . 
If it undermines Bhutto &apos;s popularity , she may come to rue her deal with the general as a Faustian bargain . 
The greater danger is that any Pakistani government needs greater legitimacy to wage the intensifying war against &quot; Al Qaedastan . &quot; 
By acceding to Musharraf &apos;s desire to keep Sharif on the political margins , the US has left itself with few options if the Bhutto-Musharraf alliance fails to produce a government acceptable to Pakistanis . 
At the same time , Bhutto always remembers that her father &apos;s attempts to play politics with the army eventually led to his death at the generals &quot; hands .
