Iran Versus Saudi Arabia 
BERLIN - The &quot; new &quot; Middle East is now on daily display . 
Unlike the old Middle East , whose fate was determined by the dominant Western powers ( the United Kingdom and France after World War I , and the United States from the 1940s until recently ) , the new one has no external hegemon to stabilize it . 
And , without a dominant regional power , a dangerous strategic vacuum has emerged . 
The US , quite obviously , is no longer willing - or able - to play its old role . 
Though America will not withdraw its armed forces from the region completely , direct military intervention , especially with ground troops , is not tenable , given the debacle in Iraq . 
America will not be a military player so long as the region &apos;s strategic balance is not called into question in a fundamental way ( which explains US airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria ) . 
Apart from this , the US is now operating at the level of diplomacy to resolve , or at least contain , a fundamental strategic threat - the danger posed by the Iranian nuclear program . 
Various state and non-state actors have been trying to fill the void created by America &apos;s newfound caution , with most of the latter dependent on the support of regional powers , and two in particular : Iran and Saudi Arabia . 
These countries &quot; struggle for regional supremacy is now playing out on proxy battlefields in Lebanon , Iraq , Syria , and , now , Yemen . 
Indeed , the Houthi rebellion in Yemen marks a new phase in the broader regional conflict . 
Not only is it occurring in the south of the Arabian Peninsula , directly on Saudi Arabia &apos;s borders ; the kingdom &apos;s direct military intervention has brought its strategic rivalry with Iran into the open . 
As always in the Middle East , religious and ethnic factors play a large role in this rivalry . 
The Shia-Sunni divide within Islam is being reflected in the region &apos;s geopolitics . 
Moreover , whereas Iran is a Shia country , the overwhelming majority of Arabs are Sunni , reinforcing the salience of Iran &apos;s ethnic distinctiveness . 
Geopolitical interests , religious sectarianism , and ethnicity thus form a dangerous m√©lange in the new Middle East . 
And , because history has shown that outside military intervention can neither solve nor even contain such conflicts , the regional powers will have to sort this out among themselves , which is far easier said than done . 
It will entail a long phase of largely unpredictable violence , which implies a high risk of escalation , even toward global conflict ; and it will most likely result in humanitarian disasters on the order of what is happening in Syria today . 
Even barring escalation beyond the Middle East , significant economic dangers are also likely , given the region &apos;s energy reserves and thus its importance to the global economy . 
World oil prices are de facto determined on the Arabian Peninsula and by the countries of the adjacent Gulf region , and this will not change anytime soon . 
In terms of international security , a long-term fight for regional dominance will increase the threat of global terrorism , as both sides are using extremist groups that seek to legitimize their actions in religious terms . 
An even greater danger is that the key players in this conflict seek to arm themselves with nuclear weapons . 
A nuclear arms race in a region characterized by long-term instability would be a global nightmare . 
So it is no accident that , concurrently with the regional powers &quot; direct military confrontation in Yemen , the international community , led by the US , has been trying to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran . 
The framework agreement that has now resulted from these talks , which have been taking place off and on for 12 years ( and in which I participated for a time ) is intended to bring Iran &apos;s nuclear program under international supervision , thereby containing the risk to regional and global stability . 
In exchange , international economic sanctions on Iran are to be lifted . 
America &apos;s agenda is now arousing massive criticism from its close allies in the region , Israel and Saudi Arabia . 
The only realistic option to prevent a nuclear arms race in the region is international supervision - as far-reaching and as comprehensive as possible . 
But this goal , even if achieved , would satisfy neither Israel nor Saudi Arabia , both of which fear that any agreement would support Iran in its effort to establish its regional dominance . 
So the end result could be a de facto change of regional strategic partners by the US - a development that in fact is already becoming apparent in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq . 
Iran &apos;s strategy in all of this has not been very clever : its military interventions in Syria , Lebanon , Iraq , and Yemen entail major risks . 
That became apparent with the recent formation of a pan-Arab military force , which is clearly directed against Iran and should give its leaders reason to rethink their policy . 
The new Middle East needs neither a nuclear arms race nor religious hatred , and it also does not need a foreign policy based on military intervention . 
Without diplomacy and the willingness to work toward viable mutual understandings , as has just happened with the framework agreement negotiated with Iran , the new Middle East will remain the powder keg of world politics - one whose fuse has already been lit .
