New Europe &apos;s Surprising Resilience 
KIEV - Two years ago , five of the ten new East European members of the European Union - the three Baltic states , Hungary , and Romania - appeared to be devastated by the global financial crisis . 
Social unrest , huge devaluations , and populist protests loomed . 
And then nothing . 
Today , all of these countries are returning to financial health and economic growth without significant disruption . 
No country has even changed its exchange-rate regime . 
Old Europe should learn from New Europe &apos;s untold success . 
The cause of the East European financial crisis was a standard credit boom-and-bust cycle . 
East European countries attracted large international capital flows , owing to loose global monetary policy and accommodating business conditions . 
In the end , short-term bank lending became excessive and was used to finance a splurge on real-estate investment and consumption , while inflation took hold . 
Moreover , current-account deficits piled up into substantial private-sector foreign debt , while public finances were in good order everywhere but Socialist-led Hungary . 
This crisis of success and overheating was reminiscent of East Asia in 1997-1998 . 
East Asia &apos;s nations , as well as Russia in 1998 and Argentina in 2001 , exited their crises through devaluation . 
A choir of prominent American economists , including Paul Krugman , Kenneth Rogoff , and Nouriel Roubini , claimed that Latvia , Estonia , and Lithuania must also devalue . 
None of them did , yet they raised themselves out of the crisis . 
The Baltic states had many reasons not to devalue . 
Their aim is to adopt the euro as soon as possible , which devaluation would have complicated . 
As their small and open economies were already heavily &quot; euro-ized , &quot; the pass-though of higher foreign prices into inflation would have been huge following any devaluation , which would also have broken their otherwise reasonably healthy banking systems . 
Instead , the three Baltic governments opted for &quot; internal devaluation , &quot; reducing public-sector wages and costs . 
In 2009 , all three countries cut public expenditures by 8-10 % of GDP , which - remarkably - was politically easier than marginal cuts . 
When cuts are big , people realize how severe the crisis is , and the politically impossible becomes necessary . 
Small cuts are usually delivered evenly , aggravating all public services , while deep cuts have to be selective and structural . 
Therefore , they may improve economic efficiency . 
All the countries in crisis cut their public administration and wages . 
Latvia slashed state salaries by 35 % and the number of public agencies by half . 
It also closed half of its excessive number of hospitals and sacked superfluous teachers , of which there was one for every six children before the crisis . 
Estonia , Lithuania , Hungary , Romania , and Bulgaria have carried out similar reforms , though not quite as radical . 
( Lithuania , for example , pursued a higher-education reform to enhance efficiency and quality . ) 
And , though state revenues have fallen with recession , forcing a few countries to hike value-added taxes , none has increased income taxes , and none of the seven countries that had in place a flat-rate income tax has abandoned it . 
As a result , these countries exit the crisis more productive . 
Contrary to expectations - and to the Greek and French experiences - social unrest has been minimal . 
Extremists on neither the right nor the left have benefited . 
In the European Parliament elections in June 2009 , center-right parties won a majority in all ten eastern EU countries , and center-right parties now govern in nine of them , with Slovenia the sole exception . 
The liberal right has never been stronger in Eastern Europe . 
The communists have been wiped out and the socialists badly weakened . 
The extreme right has lost support everywhere but Hungary . 
This year , responsible center-right parties have won three surprise victories - in the Czech Republic , Slovakia , and Latvia . 
The new Czech foreign minister , Karel Schwarzenberg , stated : &quot; We won by telling the truth . 
Populism is no longer popular . &quot; 
Most remarkable was the victory of Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis on October 2 . 
His coalition increased its share of parliamentary seats from 45 % to 63 % , although GDP fell last year by a shocking 18 % . 
Dombrovskis blamed his irresponsible predecessors , and voters clearly saw him as the most credible problem solver . 
Three countries in the region - Hungary , Latvia , and Romania - required emergency standby programs with the International Monetary Fund . 
The IMF had learned from East Asia , posing fewer conditions and offering more budget financing , because the problems were temporary and not structural . 
In addition , the EU provided financing , whereas the European Central Bank , which could have given swap credits , played no helpful role . 
As a result of their successful crisis resolution , the EU &apos;s East European members look better both fiscally and structurally than the old eurozone members . 
Of the 12 members of the eurozone in 2001 , only two ( Finland and Luxembourg ) have public debts of less than 60 % of GDP to compare with nine of the ten new eastern members . 
Only Hungary has a large public debt . 
East Europeans suffered from high private-sector debt , which they largely avoided transforming into public debt . 
All of this , together with post-crisis improvement in EU institutions ( such as financial regulators ) contributes to greater European convergence . 
Whereas Eastern Europe &apos;s economies look healthier than the eurozone countries , they are not abandoning the EU project . 
On the contrary , this year Estonia qualified to enter the eurozone in January 2011 .
