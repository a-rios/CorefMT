Ukraine and the Crisis of International Law 
NEW YORK - Russia &apos;s actions in Ukraine constitute a serious and dangerous violation of international law . 
In 1994 , Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the Soviet Union , in return for a solemn commitment by the United States , the United Kingdom , and Russia to protect Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity and sovereignty . 
Russia has now violated that pledge , not only harming Ukraine but also undermining the international legal framework for preventing nuclear proliferation . 
Unless Russia changes course - which seems unlikely anytime soon - the global consequences are apt to be grave . 
The US and the European Union will impose sanctions , weakening Russia &apos;s economy and the world economy - and stoking even more tension and nationalism . 
Mistakes on one side or the other could lead to violent disaster . 
We need only to recall the spiral of hubris and miscalculation that led to the outbreak of World War I , a century ago this year . 
As frightening as the Ukraine crisis is , the more general disregard of international law in recent years must not be overlooked . 
Without diminishing the seriousness of Russia &apos;s recent actions , we should note that they come in the context of repeated violations of international law by the US , the EU , and NATO . 
Every such violation undermines the fragile edifice of international law , and risks throwing the world into a lawless war of all against all . 
The US and its allies have also launched a series of military interventions in recent years in contravention of the United Nations Charter and without the support of the UN Security Council . 
The US-led NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 lacked the sanction of international law , and occurred despite the strong objections of Russia , a Serbian ally . 
Kosovo &apos;s subsequent declaration of independence from Serbia , recognized by the US and most EU members , is a precedent that Russia eagerly cites for its actions in Crimea . 
The ironies are obvious . 
The Kosovo War was followed by the US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , both of which occurred without the support of the Security Council , and in the case of Iraq , despite vigorous objections within it . 
The results for both Afghanistan and Iraq have been utterly devastating . 
NATO &apos;s actions in Libya in 2011 to topple Muammar el-Qaddafi constituted another such violation of international law . 
After the Security Council approved a resolution to institute a no-fly zone and take other actions ostensibly to protect Libyan civilians , NATO used the resolution as a pretext to overthrow Qaddafi &apos;s regime through aerial bombardment . 
Russia and China strenuously objected , stating then and now that NATO seriously exceeded its mandate . 
Libya remains unstable and violent , without an effective national government , to this day . 
As Russia itself has repeatedly pointed out , US actions in Syria have been similarly illegal . 
When the Arab Spring protests began in early 2011 , peaceful demonstrators in Syria demanded reforms . 
At that point , in the summer of 2011 , the US began to back the military insurrection , with President Barack Obama declaring that Assad must &quot; step aside . &quot; 
Since then , the US , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and others have provided logistical , financial , and military support to the insurrection , in violation of Syria &apos;s sovereignty and international law . 
There is no doubt that Assad has behaved cruelly , but there is also no doubt that the US-led support of the insurrection is a violation of Syria &apos;s sovereignty , one that has contributed to an upward spiral of violence that by now has claimed more than 130,000 Syrian lives and destroyed much of the country &apos;s cultural heritage and infrastructure . 
One can add many other US actions , including drone strikes on the territory of sovereign states without their governments &quot; permission ; covert military operations ; renditions and torture of terror suspects ; and massive spying by the US National Security Agency . 
When challenged by other countries or UN organizations , the US has brushed aside their objections . 
International law itself is at a crossroads . 
The US , Russia , the EU , and NATO cite it when it is to their advantage and disregard it when they deem it a nuisance . 
Again , this is not to justify Russia &apos;s unacceptable actions ; rather , it is to add them to the sequence of actions contrary to international law . 
The same problems may soon spill over into Asia . 
Until recently , China , Japan , and others in Asia have staunchly defended the requirement that the Security Council approve any outside military intervention in sovereign states . 
Recently , however , several countries in East Asia have become locked in a spiral of claims and counterclaims regarding borders , shipping lanes , and territorial rights . 
We must hope that the countries of the region continue to see the great value of international law as a bulwark of sovereignty , and act accordingly . 
There have long been skeptics of international law - those who believe that it can never prevail over the national interests of major powers , and that maintaining a balance of power among competitors is all that really can be done to keep the peace . 
From this perspective , Russia &apos;s actions in the Crimea are simply the actions of a great power asserting its prerogatives . 
Yet such a world is profoundly and unnecessarily dangerous . 
We have learned time and again that there is no such thing as a true &quot; balance of power . &quot; 
There are always imbalances and destabilizing power shifts . 
Without some scaffolding of law , open conflict is all too likely . 
This is especially true today , as countries jostle for oil and other vital resources . 
It is no coincidence that most of the deadly wars of recent years have taken place in regions rich in valuable and contested natural resources . 
As we look back in this centennial year toward the outbreak of WWI , we see again and again that the only possible route to safety is international law , upheld by the United Nations and respected on all sides . 
Yes , it sounds naive , but no one has to look back to see the naivet√© of the belief that great-power politics will preserve peace and ensure humanity &apos;s survival . 
In the Ukraine crisis , the Security Council should help to find a negotiated solution that preserves Ukraine &apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity . 
That will not happen soon , but the UN should persevere , looking for a breakthrough at a later date . 
And , just as the US turns to the Security Council in this case , so it should hold itself accountable to international law as well , helping to build a bulwark against dangerous global instability .
