Signs of Life in the Eurozone 
NEW YORK - The latest economic data from the eurozone suggest that recovery may be at hand . 
What is driving the upturn ? 
What obstacles does it face ? 
And what can be done to sustain it ? 
The immediate causes of recovery are not difficult to discern . 
Last year , the eurozone was on the verge of a double-dip recession . 
When it recently fell into technical deflation , the European Central Bank finally pulled the trigger on aggressive easing and launched a combination of quantitative easing ( including sovereign-bond purchases ) and negative policy rates . 
The financial impact was immediate : in anticipation of monetary easing , and after it began , the euro fell sharply , bond yields in the eurozone &apos;s core and periphery fell to very low levels , and stock markets started to rally robustly . 
This , together with the sharp fall in oil prices , boosted economic growth . 
Other factors are helping , too . 
The ECB &apos;s easing of credit is effectively subsidizing bank lending . 
The fiscal drag from austerity will be smaller this year , as the European Commission becomes more lenient . 
And the start of a banking union also helps ; following the latest stress tests and asset quality review , banks have greater liquidity and more capital to lend to the private sector . 
As a result of these factors , eurozone growth has resumed , and eurozone equities have recently outperformed US equities . 
The weakening of the euro and the ECB &apos;s aggressive measures may even stop the deflationary pressure later this year . 
But a more robust and sustained recovery still faces many challenges . 
For starters , political risks could derail progress . 
Greece , one hopes , will remain in the eurozone . 
But the difficult negotiations between the Syriza-led government and the &quot; troika &quot; ( the ECB , the European Commission , and the International Monetary Fund ) could cause an unintended accident - call it a &quot; Grexident &quot; - if an agreement on funding the country is not reached in the next few weeks . 
Moreover , Podemos , a leftist party in the Syriza mold , could come to power in Spain . 
Populist anti-euro parties of the right and the left are challenging Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi . 
And Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front is polling well ahead of the 2017 French presidential election . 
Slow job creation and income growth may continue to fuel the populist backlash against austerity and reform . 
Even the ECB estimates that the eurozone unemployment rate will still be 9.9 % in 2017 - well above the 7.2 % average prior to the global financial crisis seven years ago . 
And austerity and reform fatigue in the eurozone periphery has been matched by bailout fatigue in the core , boosting support for a range of anti-euro parties in Germany , the Netherlands , and Finland . 
A second obstacle to sustained recovery is the eurozone &apos;s bad neighborhood . 
Russia is becoming more assertive and aggressive in Ukraine , the Baltics , and even the Balkans ( while sanctions against Russia have hurt many European economies ) . 
And the Middle East is burning just next door : the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Copenhagen , and against foreign tourists in Tunisia , remind Europe that hundreds of homegrown jihadists could return from fighting in Syria , Iraq , or elsewhere and launch further attacks . 
Third , while ECB policies keep borrowing costs lower , private and public debt in the periphery countries , as a share of GDP , is high and still rising , because the denominator of the debt ratio - nominal GDP - is barely increasing . 
Thus , debt sustainability will remain an issue for these economies over the medium term . 
Fourth , fiscal policy remains contractionary , because Germany continues to reject a growing chorus of advice that it should undertake a short-term stimulus . 
Thus , higher German spending will not offset the impact of additional austerity in the periphery or the significant shortfall expected for the three-year , â‚¬ 300 billion ( $ 325 billion ) investment plan unveiled by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker . 
Fifth , structural reforms are still occurring at a snail &apos;s pace , holding back potential growth . 
And , while structural reforms are necessary , some measures - for example , labor-market liberalization and pension overhauls - may boost the eurozone &apos;s savings rate and thus weaken aggregate demand further ( as occurred in Germany following its structural reforms a decade ago ) . 
Finally , Europe &apos;s monetary union remains incomplete . 
Its long-term viability requires the development over time of a full banking union , fiscal union , economic union , and eventually political union . 
But the process of further European integration has stalled . 
If the eurozone unemployment rate is still too high by the end of 2016 , annual inflation remains well below the ECB &apos;s 2 % target , and fiscal policies and structural reforms exert a short-term drag on economic growth , the only game in town may be continued quantitative easing . 
But the ongoing weakness of the euro - fed by such policies - is fueling growth in the eurozone &apos;s current-account surplus . 
Indeed , as the euro weakens , the periphery countries &quot; external accounts have swung from deficit to balance and , increasingly , to surplus . 
Germany and the eurozone core were already running large surpluses ; in the absence of policies to boost domestic demand , those surpluses have simply risen further . 
Thus , the ECB &apos;s monetary policy will take on an increasingly beggar-thy-neighbor cast , leading to trade and currency tensions with the United States and other trade partners . 
To avoid this outcome , Germany needs to adopt policies - fiscal stimulus , higher spending on infrastructure and public investment , and more rapid wage growth - that would boost domestic spending and reduce the country &apos;s external surplus . 
Unless , and until , Germany moves in this direction , no one should bet the farm on a more robust and sustained eurozone recovery .
