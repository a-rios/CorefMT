Central Europe \ u0027s Fractious Right 
Is Eastern Europe &apos;s political pendulum about to run down ? 
Across Central Europe since 1989 , elections have oscillated between right and left . 
Is Hungary &apos;s slick young prime minister , Viktor Orban , poised to end all that ? 
A ruthless program to absorb his political rivals on the right has helped Orban &apos;s FIDESZ party become nearly equal in size to his Socialist rivals on the left . 
Moreover , infighting among the Socialists has dented one of their biggest political advantages : the hard-headed discipline and political professionalism inherited from their Communist days . 
Premier Orban &apos;s semi-successful efforts to unify the right under the banner of FIDESZ are unique among Eastern Europe &apos;s fractured and fractious rightist parties . 
Since Communism &apos;s fall , center right parties in the Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , and Slovakia have suffered from disunity and a lack of vision . 
Despite the fact the region is still recovering from decades of communist mismanagement , the political right &apos;s fragmentation helped the political left , in some cases represented by former Communists , to win democratic elections regularly . 
Some problems faced by Central Europe &apos;s right are similar to those the political right faces elsewhere in Europe , where social democratic parties expropriated many formerly liberal ideas to seize a monopoly of the political center . 
In Central Europe this effect has been amplified by the fact that , regardless of ideological leanings , rulings parties have had to privatize the economy and , under pressure from the European Union , introduce reform measures that would , in a classical Western system , usually be undertaken by the political right . 
Leftist parties in various Central European countries , indeed , have often turned out to be more successful in reforming because they , paradoxically , have greater legitimacy in this respect . 
Many people believe that the Socialists would not privatize the economy or slash welfare systems if such measures were not absolutely necessary . 
The most serious problem of Central Europe &apos;s political right is a lack of identity . 
Although right-of-center politicians in Central European countries formally embrace traditional ideologies , for example , liberalism or conservatism , their electorates , unfamiliar with Western political philosophies , do not always understand the real meaning of those terms . 
In various surveys , significant segments of Central European electorates describe themselves as &quot; rightist , &quot; but years of communist paternalism pushed the region &apos;s political center of gravity firmly to the left . 
A person may describe him or herself as , for example , a liberal , yet at same time demand that the government continue subsidizing energy , education , or housing . 
Under the communist regimes , ideologies became totally instrumental . 
As during those years , many people now formally accept ideological labels but identify with them only as long as such an allegiance to a specific political current has tangible short-term benefits for them . 
One consequence of this cynical treatment of political ideologies is the wild swings in voters &apos; preferences seen in various Central European countries . 
The problem of identity is made even worse by the fact that most Central European nations , where nation-building was retarded by Communism , easily succumb to nationalist sentiments that in turn are misused by some politicians . 
Although such politicians often describe themselves as &quot; rightist , &quot; their real policies , such as , for , example , those of former Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar , are in fact demagogic populist or authoritarian . 
The situation of the political right in each Central European country is also influenced by experiences that are rooted in history and tradition . 
Political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of communism set the Czech Republic and Slovakia apart from both Poland and Hungary . 
While both the Polish and Hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization that allowed relatively large semi-official zones of activity outside communist control , Czechoslovakia after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 became a rigid neo-Stalinist regime . 
When the communist regimes collapsed in 1989 , the communist parties of Poland and Hungary transformed themselves into credible democratic-left parties that became formidable opponents of the newly emerging political right . 
No strong social democratic party in Czechoslovakia could emerge from the rigid Czechoslovak Communist Party . 
In the absence of a credible democratic left party , Czech center-right politicians had the upper hand , and were relatively united , until 1997 . 
However , lack of a strong opposition corrupted the political right , which splintered into various groupings that cannot find a common language . 
In Slovakia , where nationalist sentiments were an important political factor after 1989 , the political spectrum has not yet coalesced along standard right-left political axis . 
The main political battles occur between nationalist / populist forces , whose outlook have in essence been undemocratic , and forces that struggle for standard democracy . 
The threat of return to power by Meciar forced all democrats , leftist or rightist , into one camp . 
Even in this situation the political right has been quarrelsome , creating space for Meciar &apos;s possible return to power . 
Hungary &apos;s political right has suffered mainly from differences between conservative and populist forces on the one hand , and traditional , mainly urban , liberals on the other . 
Various rightist parties failed to decide whether the modus operandi on the political right should be traditional Western ideologies or a Hungarian brand of nationalist conservatism and populism . 
Although the current governing coalition , consisting of conservatives and populists , has been successful , the real reckoning for Hungary &apos;s right may still be yet to come . 
Poland &apos;s right poses the most difficult case . 
Its problems originate in the communist era , when a trade union movement , which under normal circumstances should stand to the political left , became the main anti-communist opposition . 
As a result , various political groups associated with the Solidarity trade union movement have , since Communism &apos;s fall , aspired to represent the political right , confusing the terms of political discourse . 
Christian-democratic parties , associated with the Catholic Church , and the liberals have been to some extent marginalized . 
The confusion has been made complete by the existence of relatively strong nationalist and populist parties that use the numerous Polish farmers as their electoral base . 
As in other postcommunist countries , the main beneficiary of such a lack of unity has been the democratic left .
