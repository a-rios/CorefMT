The Other Asia 
WASHINGTON , DC - South Asia presents a depressing paradox . 
It is among the fastest growing regions in the world , but it is also home to the largest concentration of people living in debilitating poverty , conflict , and human misery . 
While South Asia is far more developed than Sub-Saharan Africa , and India ( the largest country in the region ) has achieved lower middle-income status , South Asia has many more poor people than Sub-Saharan Africa . 
This raises the big question of whether the best escape from poverty comes from general economic growth or from a direct attack on poverty . 
The answer depends on where one looks . 
Stupendous growth hides deep pockets of poverty . 
For the countries of South Asia , poverty has morphed from a national to a sub-national problem . 
Although economic growth has reduced South Asia &apos;s poverty rate , it has not fallen fast enough to reduce the total number of poor people . 
The number of people living on less than $ 1.25 a day increased from 549 million in 1981 to 595 million in 2005 . 
In India , which accounts for almost three-quarters of this population , the numbers increased from 420 million to 455 million during this period . 
Besides the slow pace of poverty reduction , human development has not kept up with the pace of income growth , either . 
There are more than 250 million children in South Asia who are undernourished , and more than 30 million children who do not go to school . 
Over one-third of adult women are anemic . 
The share of female employment in total employment is among the lowest in the world . 
Indeed , South Asia , with deeper regional disparities than the rest of the world , is really two South Asia &apos;s . 
A lot of attention has been given to the &quot; Shining Asia , &quot; while the &quot; Suffering Asia &quot; has been forgotten . 
The gap between them is so wide that they seem to be anchored in two different centuries . 
Worse still , it continues to increase . 
The leading regions have experienced rapid growth . 
They have acted as gateways connecting South Asia to the developed world , and have benefited from globalization , education , capital accumulation , and technological advancement . 
This is sustainable as there is huge room for South Asia to catch up to rich countries &quot; productivity levels . 
This transformation has become a virtuous circle where initial growth has spiraled into greater growth , leading to more growth . 
Some leading regions in India are now the envy of other middle income countries . 
Indeed growth can eliminate poverty in leading regions in a generation . 
Indeed , their social and human development indicators are worse than in Sub-Saharan Africa . 
South Asia &apos;s worst problems - poverty , conflict , hunger , and gender inequalities - are largely concentrated in its lagging regions , where there are limits to growth , because geography , institutions , and globalization will continue to favor the concentration of economic activity in the leading regions . 
With migration to leading regions low , poverty remains concentrated in the lagging regions . 
What can be done ? 
There is no universal &quot; fix &quot; in economic development , and pluralism of approaches has great value . 
The challenge is to find what works best inwhich setting . 
While economic growth is critical for poverty reduction , reviving growth in lagging regions will take time . 
Rather than wait for a rising tide to lift all boats , policymakers should consider direct policy interventionsto reduce poverty . 
A direct attack on poverty can yield a double dividend : in reducing human misery , it could spark growth , thereby creating more political space for direct poverty reduction . 
A high priority should be given to increasing pro-poor fiscal transfers . 
Lagging states spend considerably less than leading states on social services , including education and health care . 
Poor regions have a low base of economic activity to tax , which prevents them from investing in human and physical capital . 
Achieving equity through fiscal transfers can ensure a level playing field . 
But simply directing financial resources to lagging regions will not be enough to solve their problems . 
For example , the gains from labor mobility have not been equally sharedbetween educated and uneducated migrants . 
The gains are much higher for skilled workers , so the mobility rate increases with education . 
The mobility of university graduates is much higher than the mobility of unskilled workers . 
Removing barriers to human mobility - such as labor laws , state-specific social-welfare programs , and housing-market distortions - should be an integral part of development . 
It also empowers traditionally disadvantaged groups , particularly women . 
Likewise , slow agricultural growth has constrained economic opportunities for the vast majority of poor people in lagging regions . 
Policymakers should recast agriculture in the new environment of globalization , supply chains , and growing domestic demand . 
The food-price crisis of two years ago served as a wake-up call , and has created an opportunity to revisit existing agricultural policies . 
Regional development policies to promote so-called &quot; equitable growth &quot; are not a solution , for two reasons . 
First , empirical evidence shows that convergence of per capita income between lagging and leading regions is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for achieving poverty reduction and social convergence . 
South Asia is at a critical stage in its historical transformation , when deepening economic disparities could stifle growth itself . 
If not addressed through direct measures , all of Asia will suffer .
