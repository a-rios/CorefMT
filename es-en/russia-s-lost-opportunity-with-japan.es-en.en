Russia &apos;s Lost Opportunity with Japan 
TOKYO - President Dmitri A. Medvedev visit to the south Kuril Islands , which the Soviet Red Army seized from Japan in the closing days of World War II , has demonstrated in unmistakable terms that Russia has no intention of returning the mineral-rich islands . 
This visit is not only a lost opportunity , given Russia &apos;s need to modernize its economy and the help Japan could provide , but a grave strategic error in view of Russia &apos;s increasing worries about China &apos;s ambitions in Asia , which includes Russia &apos;s lightly populated Siberian provinces . 
Russia , however , is only now beginning to realize that it must be much more pro-active in protecting its national-security interests in the Pacific region . 
The problem is that Russia &apos;s focus is wrong-headed . 
For coinciding with China &apos;s recent naval exercises in the Yellow Sea , the Russian Armed Forces carried out part of its &quot; Vostok 2010 &quot; drills ( involving 1,500 troops ) on Etorofu , the largest island among the Russian-occupied Northern Territories of Japan . 
The entire Vostok 2010 exercise involved more than 20,000 troops . 
Russia &apos;s illegal occupation of the south Kuril Islands began on August 18 , 1945 , three days after Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration ( or the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender ) , which ended the Pacific War . 
Stalin &apos;s Red Army nonetheless invaded the Chishima Islands , and has occupied them , Southern Karafuto ( or Southern Sakhalin ) , and the islands of Etorofu , Kunashiri , Shikotan , and Habomai - which had never been part of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union at any point in history - ever since . 
Indeed , the lower house of Russia &apos;s Duma passed a resolution earlier this year designating September 2 as the anniversary of the &quot; real &quot; end of World War II , effectively making it a day to commemorate the Soviet Union &apos;s victory over Japan - and thus an attempt to undermine Japan &apos;s claim that the occupation of the islands came after WWII &apos;s end . 
On a trip to Russia &apos;s Asian port of Vladivostok , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev declared that the social and economic development of Russia &apos;s Far East is a national priority . 
By continuing to maintain its illegal occupation of Japanese territory , however , Russia precludes expansive Japanese involvement in this effort , effectively leaving the Chinese to dominate the region &apos;s development . 
Russia &apos;s persistence in its self-defeating occupation is surprising . 
Indeed , when Boris Yeltsin was Russia &apos;s president , the country came close to recognizing the need to return the Northern Territories to Japan . 
But a nationalist backlash doomed Yeltsin &apos;s efforts . 
Even Japan &apos;s strategically myopic current government seems to understand that Russia needs to play some role in achieving a new balance of power in Asia . 
There are rumors that Prime Minister Naoto Kan &apos;s administration is planning to break the logjam in the Japan-Russia relationship by appointing Yukio Hatoyama , his predecessor as prime minister , ambassador to Russia . 
Hatoyama is the grandson of Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama , who signed the Japanese-Soviet Joint Declaration on October 19 , 1956 , which formally restored diplomatic relations between two countries and also enabled Japan &apos;s entry into the United Nations . 
That treaty , however , did not settle the territorial dispute , resolution of which was put off until the conclusion of a permanent peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union ( now Russia ) . 
In the 1956 declaration , the two countries agreed to negotiate such a treaty , and the Soviet Union was to hand over Shikotan and Habomai islands to Japan once it was concluded . 
In the meantime , the status of the larger Etorofu and Kunashiri islands would remain unresolved and subject to negotiation . 
Japanese public opinion has remained adamant for decades that all four islands belong to Japan , and that no real peace can exist until they are returned . 
So sending Hatoyama as ambassador may elicit harsh criticism , as his grandfather once agreed to a peace process that returned only two islands , and many Japanese fear that his grandson may also be prepared to cut another unequal deal . 
Ambassadorial appointments should never be used as political stunts . 
This is particularly true for the appointment of an ambassador to a country that is critical to Asia &apos;s balance of power . 
But it is not surprising coming from a government that lacks any coherent concept of Japan &apos;s national security . 
Fortunately , Japanese voters sense their government &apos;s irresolute nature , delivering it a sharp rebuke in the recent elections to the upper house of Japan &apos;s Diet . 
But it is not only Japan that needs a government that takes regional security issues seriously . 
Russia should recognize that it has neglected its position in Asia for too long , and that only when it returns Japan &apos;s Northern Territories can Japanese expertise be brought seriously to bear in developing Russia &apos;s Far East . 
Only normal bilateral relations will allow the two countries to work together to forge a lasting Asian balance of power . 
Given his record , Vladimir Putin would not face the type of nationalist backlash Yeltsin confronted if he sought to reach an agreement that restored Japan &apos;s sovereignty over its Northern Territories . 
Will he have the strategic vision to do so ?
