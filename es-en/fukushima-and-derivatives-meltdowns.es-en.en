Fukushima and Derivatives Meltdowns 
CAMBRIDGE - Financial commentators have likened Japan &apos;s earthquake , tsunami , and nuclear catastrophe to derivatives &quot; role in the 2008 financial meltdown . 
The resemblance is clear enough : each activity yields big benefits and carries a tiny but explosive risk . 
But the similarity between the two types of crisis ends where preventing their recurrence begins . 
For the Fukushima nuclear-power plant , a 1,000-year flood and ordinarily innocuous design defects combined to deprive the reactors of circulating water coolant and cause serious radiation leaks . 
In financial markets , an unexpected collapse in real-estate securities and design defects in the derivatives and repo markets combined to damage core financial institutions &quot; ability make good on their payment obligations . 
While the basic risks originated outside the systems - a tsunami for Fukushima , over-investment in real-estate mortgages for financial institutions - design defects and bad luck meant that the system couldn &apos;t contain the damage . 
In the United States , AIG , Bear Stearns , and Lehman Brothers - all with large derivatives and / or repo investments - failed , freezing up credit markets for a scary few weeks . 
We now understand the Fukushima risks and design defects well . 
Not so for the derivatives risks that jeopardized the global economy . 
For Fukushima , crews are valiantly trying to stop the radiation leakage . 
But for derivatives , the analogous efforts are misdirected and won &apos;t save us from the financial fire next time . 
We are rebuilding derivatives and related financial structures atop the same , still-active faults . 
Financial players use derivatives to transfer risk : one player assumes the risk of , say , euro fluctuation , but doesn &apos;t want yen risk , while for another , it &apos;s the opposite . 
So the former promises to deliver euros next June 1 , while the latter promises to deliver yen . 
If one currency declines relative to the other , the loser pays the difference . 
Repos are financing transactions . 
Financial firms sell assets , like Treasury bonds or real-estate securities , for cash , and promise to buy those assets back ( i.e. , to repurchase them or , for short , to do a &quot; repo &quot; ) , typically the following day . 
But , with the cash coming from short-term repos making up much of core financial firms &quot; balance sheets , tremors in financial markets could hit them hard , drying up repo financing for a few , as occurred in 2008 . 
Some , like Bear Stearns , then failed . 
Individual derivatives and repo transactions are hardly nefarious . 
Each alone legitimately transfers risk to those better able to bear it , or backs financial holdings . 
But , when over-used by systemically vital firms , they can blow up the financial system , owing to its design defects . 
Even today , about 70 % of the core US financial firms &quot; liabilities are very short-term loans , like overnight repos . 
In the US , the main design defects are in bankruptcy law , which exempts derivatives and repos from most regular bankruptcy constraints . 
For example , investors holding derivatives and repo contracts with a weakened financial institution can grab the firm &apos;s assets ahead of - and at the expense of - its regular creditors , possibly sealing its fate , when , with a little extra time , the firm might have survived . 
Such runs were the ruin of AIG , Bear Stearns , and others during the financial crisis . 
Worse still , because derivatives and repo investors jump to the head of the repayment line in so many ways , they have less incentive to foster market discipline by closely monitoring their counterparties &quot; solvency and carefully rationing their exposure to any single counterparty . 
They typically get repaid , regardless . 
True , someone has to come first . 
Other financial players take on more risk because derivatives and repo players &quot; bankruptcy exemptions put them first . 
Usually , we would expect the others to have an interest in more market discipline . 
But the next player in line is too often the US government , as guarantor of too-big-to-fail financial institutions , and it is poorly positioned to regulate these markets on a day-to-day basis . 
It is not financially nimble ; it is often captured by the regulated ; and when economic times are good , no official wants to spoil the party . 
The US Congress had a chance to fix this design defect in the major financial overhaul that it enacted last summer via the Dodd-Frank bill . 
But it didn &apos;t . 
If investors in derivatives , repos , and credit-default swaps lacked favored treatment , they would behave differently . 
Above all , they would insist more often that their counterparties be well capitalized . 
They accepted the risk implied by ultra-thin capitalizations when it was mainly US government money on the line ; they would be more reluctant to do so if it was mostly their own money that they were wagering . 
The public perceives Fukushima-type risks and derivatives risks differently . 
Many fear nuclear risks , which are vivid , slowing the industry &apos;s development amid safety concerns . 
But the derivatives and repo markets present risks that are poorly understood , difficult to communicate in the media , and hard for politicians to debate and resolve . 
During a crisis , these markets attract public attention and scorn , but , as the economy steadies , ordinary people lose interest , leaving the financial industry to control its own destiny with legislatures . 
For Fukushima-type risks , analysts are already discussing how nuclear plants can be designed and built to contain earthquake and tsunami risks via passive cooling . 
It is possible , the thinking now runs , to design and build nuclear plants that can keep the fuel rods cool even if all power is lost . 
But little of importance has yet been done to prevent the damage that derivatives and repo bankruptcy priorities could cause in another financial-system meltdown . 
New rules to require end-users ( such as oil companies using derivatives to guard against unexpected oil-price changes ) and others to put up good collateral are being developed . 
But these rules don &apos;t address the main problem : the weakened incentives for market discipline for core financial institutions . 
It &apos;s as if we reacted to Fukushima by better handling gas emissions in oil-shale projects . 
We should be examining how to make derivatives and repo investors assume the full risk of their decisions when dealing with systemically vital financial institutions . 
Instead , we survived the financial tsunami of 2008 , only to rebuild in the same place , on the main financial fault-lines , using the same flawed design .
