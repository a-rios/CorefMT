Putin &apos;s Gas Problem 
HOUSTON - Russia watchers are rightly focusing on the latest brittle ceasefire in Ukraine , seeking to discern President Vladimir Putin &apos;s intentions there . 
Last December , Russian &apos;s giant gas firm , Gazprom , and a Turkish pipeline company signed a memorandum of understanding to construct a pipeline from Russia to Turkey under the Black Sea . 
This new &quot; Turkish Stream &quot; is an alternative to the &quot; South Stream &quot; Black Sea pipeline from Russia to Bulgaria - a project that the Kremlin abandoned in December , in response to the sanctions imposed by the European Union after Russia &apos;s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea . 
The South Stream project failed to comply with EU competition and energy directives , and the announcement of the $ 12 billion Turkish Stream is likely to reinforce Russia &apos;s reputation as an unreliable partner , thus accelerating Europe &apos;s search for alternate supply sources . 
Indeed , in risking his most lucrative market , Putin is exhibiting an almost suicidal disregard for the Russian economy - apparently for no other reason than to cement enmity with Ukraine . 
The Kremlin intends to remove Ukraine from a gas-delivery system that has been in place since the 1980s , routing supplies instead through a new and untried network to a market that may not even exist . 
Last month , Gazprom announced its intention to cease shipments through Ukraine when the contracts with the country &apos;s gas pipeline company , Naftogaz , expire in 2019 . 
Gas from the Turkish Stream will be delivered to the Greek border on a take-it-or-leave-it basis . 
Gazprom expects permission to carry out design and survey work &quot; soon , &quot; with its first delivery to Turkey to arrive in 2017 . 
Gazprom &apos;s erratic behavior is not a matter of minor concern for Europe . 
The continent relies on Russia for some 30 % of its natural gas , 80 % of which is transported through Ukraine . 
In January 2009 , Gazprom ordered cutbacks of deliveries through Ukraine , causing severe shortages in six countries in eastern and southeastern Europe . 
In late 2014 , Russia cut off Ukraine completely , again signaling its readiness to use gas supplies as a weapon of foreign policy . 
The EU rushed in to broker a settlement that some contend was against Ukraine &apos;s interests . 
But , contrary to what Putin seems to believe , neither Europe nor Ukraine is likely to be the biggest loser in Russia &apos;s effort to redirect its gas exports . 
Gazprom receives two-thirds of its hard-currency revenues from Europe , and a period of falling exports and domestic economic crisis is not the ideal time to play games with your best customer . 
Indeed , the European market is already slipping away . 
Gazprom &apos;s European sales plummeted in the third quarter of last year and fell by 25 % in the fourth quarter . 
The slump in demand is coming at a time when Russia is desperate for hard currency , owing to sanctions that exclude it from credit markets . 
Its major companies are facing huge debt refinancing needs , its currency reserves are collapsing , its economy is heading toward a deep recession , and the ruble is plumbing new lows . 
In redirecting its exports , Russia is in effect demanding that Europe spend billions of euros on new infrastructure to replace a perfectly good pipeline , only to satisfy Putin &apos;s desire to cause trouble in Ukraine . 
In January , Gazprom &apos;s CEO , Alexey Miller , imperiously brushed off European concerns , stating , &quot; We have informed our European partners , and now it is up to them to put in place the necessary infrastructure starting from the Turkish-Greek border . &quot; 
The initial reaction in Europe was that Putin either was bluffing or had taken leave of his senses . 
&quot; The decision makes no economic sense , &quot; was how Maroš Šefčovič , the European Commission &apos;s vice president for energy union , put it . 
&quot; We &apos;re good customers . 
We &apos;re paying a lot of money . 
We &apos;re paying on time , and we &apos;re paying in hard currency . 
Putin &apos;s erratic and economically oblivious policies are frittering away the last remnants of what was once Gazprom &apos;s monopoly position in the European gas market . 
Clearly , if Europe is to spend billions on pipelines , it would be better off doing so as part of an effort to diversify its sources of natural gas , rather than deepen its dependence on Russia . 
After all , memories are long , especially when it comes to frigid winters of unheated homes and closed factories . 
When one of Joseph Stalin &apos;s chief planners was asked why he was willing to defend a series of ludicrous proposals , he famously replied , &quot; I &apos;d rather stand for unrealistic plans than sit &#91; in jail &#93; for realistic ones . &quot; 
One can imagine that Gazprom officials are thinking along the same lines . 
If so , they should start thinking differently . 
Russia cannot afford more economic pain and suffering .
