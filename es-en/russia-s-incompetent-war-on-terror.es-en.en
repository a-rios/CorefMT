Russia \ u0027s Incompetent War on Terror 
In response to the recent wave of terrorist attacks , Vladimir Putin has demanded that even more power be vested in him . 
As leading Russian military expert Alexander Golts argues , the problem in Russia is not a lack of central power , but of power exercised incompetently and without individual initiative . 
The slaughter by terrorists of hundreds of Russian children in Beslan was final proof - if more was needed - of the utter incompetence of Russia &apos;s military and security services . 
In Beslan , camouflaged men representing four ministries fussed uselessly , with no clear leader or goals , losing precious minutes when the violence erupted . 
Meanwhile , Nikolai Patrushev , the director of the Federal Security Service ( FSB , the former KGB ) and Rashid Nurgaliev , the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs ( MVD ) , both sent to Beslan by President Vladimir Putin , were invisible as the tragedy unfolded . 
So once again Russians must face how ineffective their military is . 
Indeed , none of Russia &apos;s power structures , including the military , the FSB , and the MVD , are capable of performing effective anti-terrorist operations . 
Most Russians reached this conclusion long before the Beslan attack . 
In 2002 , after terrorists took 800 theatergoers hostage , Putin ordered that an anti-terrorist component be added to Russia &apos;s military strategic plan . 
Some military analysts saw this as the beginning , at long last , of serious reforms , as the army was capable only of executing military operations in Russia &apos;s traditional way , i.e. , using overwhelming force , as in WWII . 
Russia &apos;s traditional army cannot fight terrorists effectively because it disdains the ability of soldiers to work in small groups , and does not encourage individual initiative on the part of officers . 
All are simply expected to execute orders scrupulously . 
But it is individual training and the ability to make split-second decisions in a fluid situation that are required in anti-terrorist operations . 
Incidentally , when one such anti-terrorist operation was suggested in the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia , Putin decided against it , understanding that instead of eliminating terrorists it would likely turn into a full blown traditional war . 
From the outset , the Defense Ministry was skeptical of Putin &apos;s order to include anti-terrorism on the military agenda . 
It suggested , instead , that the army should play a secondary role in anti-terrorist operations . 
The Army &apos;s hostility to reform is deeply ingrained . 
Today , Russia &apos;s army has no professional institution for training non-commissioned officers . 
The Defense Ministry simply names sergeants from senior conscripts , which means that sergeants are not very different from their subordinates in either age or training . 
The internal conditions of the &quot; power &quot; ministries - the FSB and the MVD , which bear the main responsibility for antiterrorist operations - are equally grim . 
Now the Kremlin wants to merge the FSB and MVD into one Ministry of State Security , thereby creating a single anti-terrorist center . 
Putin has already decided to create an operational center of 13 groups in the Northern Caucasus region to coordinate the actions of the Defense and Emergencies Ministries . 
But there is little reason to believe that this proposed bureaucratic monster will provide better security than the existing FSB and MVD forces . 
The only positive result that may emerge from such a structural change could be that the number of anti-terrorist formations will grow . 
Yet even that is uncertain : before Beslan , the response to terrorist attacks in Ingushetia and Chechnya consisted of efforts to form additional traditional military divisions . 
It is now obvious that overwhelming numbers don &apos;t provide an advantage in fighting terrorism , because it is the terrorists who have the initiative . 
Confronting them effectively will require root-and-branch change in order to inspire Russian security officials to take the initiative . 
For example , Russian security structures have no information about the underground work of the terrorist organizations , which are spread across the entire Russian Federation . 
There is no credible intelligence penetration of these organizations . 
This must change if Russia is to prevent future Beslans . 
But fighting terrorists requires an entirely different kind of spying from &quot; uncovering &quot; traditional &quot; spies , &quot; or neutralizing unpopular oligarchs such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
To meet today &apos;s threats , troops must be able to take individual responsibility and initiative , and need to be trained to react resourcefully and at a moment &apos;s notice . 
These qualities simply don &apos;t exist in Russia &apos;s Sovietized military organizations , with their rigid hierarchies and culture of blind conformity . 
The entire military philosophy in Russia must be changed . 
Instead of confronting today &apos;s new and very real enemy , they would rather confront the old , traditional one - the West . 
After the Beslan tragedy , Putin offered an exotic explanation of terrorism : the terrorists , he claimed , are instruments in the hands of those who still fear Russia as a nuclear power . 
This is nonsense on stilts , though it obviously sounds pleasing to generals in the power ministries , because the only war they know how to wage is with &quot; world imperialism . &quot; 
They are useless at fighting today &apos;s new terrorist enemy . 
Without major reform of all security and military forces - reforms that provide incentives for individual officers to show initiative and take responsibility - Russia &apos;s war on terror will remain one-sided : the terrorists will be doing all the attacking .
