Solving Europe &apos;s Credibility Problem 
PARIS - As the eurozone debates how to escape the stagnation trap in which it finds itself , one question has become increasingly important : Can governments credibly commit to trim public spending in the future while avoiding immediate cuts ? 
Fortunately , the answer is a qualified yes : there are ways to ensure that fiscal accommodation now is followed by consolidation later . 
Growth and inflation in the eurozone remain much too weak . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s latest assessment is bleak , and ECB President Mario Draghi has made no secret of the fact that risks remain on the downside . 
Nominal GDP growth - that is , real growth plus inflation - will not exceed 1.5 % this year and may well end up perilously close to 1 % . 
Though monetary policy is supportive , it is close to reaching its limits , and the ECB &apos;s initiative to stimulate credit by lending to commercial banks on super-cheap terms has not proved as effective as hoped . 
AAA ten-year government bonds currently yield about 1 % , suggesting that markets do not expect a strong rebound . 
This is the type of situation in which fiscal policy should come to the rescue . 
Draghi made that very point in his speech at the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , in late August , and several economists have suggested that it is time for the eurozone to engineer a temporary fiscal expansion . 
In a recent article , Francesco Giavazzi and Guido Tabellini of Bocconi University proposed a permanent tax cut , followed by gradual spending cuts . 
Combined with pro-growth reforms of product and labor markets , such a program could yield both lasting supply-side benefits ( through lower taxation ) and a temporary demand boost that would help to revive eurozone growth . 
Gradualism on spending cuts may have other merits , quite apart from its macroeconomic benefits . 
Efficient public-sector reform takes time . 
Governments that trim public expenditures in a hurry rarely make informed choices . 
An expenditure review based on systematic policy evaluations is the best approach to sorting out good spending from bad spending and thus maximize value for money . 
There are two objections to this approach . 
First , it is argued that action of this sort would violate the requirements of the EU &apos;s fiscal compact . 
That is not necessarily the case . 
Of the eurozone &apos;s 18 members , ten are no longer considered to be running an excessive deficit . 
Even for those under enhanced scrutiny , such as France and Spain , escape clauses exist : in case of a &quot; protracted period of very low annual GDP growth , &quot; the EU can grant an exemption from the required annual adjustment . 
These countries cannot launch stimulus measures , but the EU could let them fine-tune the pace of consolidation , provided that they are able to commit to comprehensive cuts in the future . 
So the eurozone has some - albeit limited - fiscal space . 
Debt levels and remaining deficits underscore the need for extreme caution , but , assuming a common will to undertake action , there would be room for maneuver within the European rules . 
The second objection is that governments will fail to deliver on their promises . 
Responding to Giavazzi and Tabellini , Roberto Perotti ( also of Bocconi ) has argued that the gradualist strategy simply would not be credible . 
Spending cuts are bound to be politically difficult decisions , and governments cannot commit to delivering them with certainty . 
So , says Perotti , the &quot; cut taxes now , cut spending later &quot; combination would involve enormous moral hazard . 
Perotti has a point . 
Carlo Cottarelli , appointed by the Italian government to oversee its expenditure review , noted recently that even before spending cuts were enacted , they were being used to finance new spending . 
The political economy of public-spending reform is tricky , and well-designed macroeconomic plans can be taken hostage by pork-barrel politics . 
There is , however , a solution to this problem : Governments and parliaments can delay action without postponing decision . 
Nothing prevents them from deciding now that pensions will be reduced in three years or that a given industrial subsidy will disappear on January 1 , 2017 . 
If parliaments want to tie their own hands , they can do so simply by passing a law . 
Actual decisions whose effects are delayed could serve as a down payment , ensuring that , say , half of the spending cuts programmed for the years to come are already enacted . 
To be sure , decisions can always be reversed ; parliaments can simply pass another law . 
Everything is reversible in a democracy . 
Moreover , Europe has instruments to ensure that commitments retain their long-term value . 
Its surveillance apparatus is mostly used to monitor budget deficits in real time , but it could also help to evaluate the future consequences of policy decisions . 
The so-called &quot; costing &quot; of policy measures ( determining the exact amount of savings brought about by a reform ) requires technical skills and access to extensive data . 
The European Commission is uniquely equipped to do this job ; together with the independent national fiscal watchdogs , it could be asked to review draft laws in detail , assess their future budgetary effects , and thereby ensure that governments do not embellish their projections when promising that their reforms will yield future savings . 
A &quot; cut taxes now , cut expenditures later &quot; strategy is therefore feasible . 
Though such a strategy would be challenging to implement and enforce , it could be credible and remain compatible with fiscal responsibility if it were buttressed by strong commitment mechanisms at the national and European levels . 
Of course , not everybody agrees that such a strategy , though possible , is desirable .
