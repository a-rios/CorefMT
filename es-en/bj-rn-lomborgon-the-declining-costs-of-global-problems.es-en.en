A Better World Is Here 
COPENHAGEN - For centuries , optimists and pessimists have argued over the state of the world . 
Pessimists see a world where more people means less food , where rising demand for resources means depletion and war , and , in recent decades , where boosting production capacity means more pollution and global warming . 
One of the current generation of pessimists &quot; sacred texts , The Limits to Growth , influences the environmental movement to this day . 
The optimists , by contrast , cheerfully claim that everything - human health , living standards , environmental quality , and so on - is getting better . 
Their opponents think of them as &quot; cornucopian &quot; economists , placing their faith in the market to fix any and all problems . 
But , rather than picking facts and stories to fit some grand narrative of decline or progress , we should try to compare across all areas of human existence to see if the world really is doing better or worse . 
Together with 21 of the world &apos;s top economists , I have tried to do just that , developing a scorecard spanning 150 years . 
Across ten areas - including health , education , war , gender , air pollution , climate change , and biodiversity - the economists all answered the same question : What was the relative cost of this problem in every year since 1900 , all the way to 2013 , with predictions to 2050 . 
Using classic economic valuations of everything from lost lives , bad health , and illiteracy to wetlands destruction and increased hurricane damage from global warming , the economists show how much each problem costs . 
To estimate the magnitude of the problem , it is compared to the total resources available to fix it . 
This gives us the problem &apos;s size as a share of GDP . 
And the trends since 1900 are sometimes surprising . 
Consider gender inequality . 
Essentially , we were excluding almost half the world &apos;s population from production . 
In 1900 , only 15 % of the global workforce was female . 
What is the loss from lower female workforce participation ? 
Even taking into account that someone has to do unpaid housework and the increased costs of female education , the loss was at least 17 % of global GDP in 1900 . 
Today , with higher female participation and lower wage differentials , the loss is 7 % - and projected to fall to 4 % by 2050 . 
It will probably come as a big surprise that climate change is expected to be mostly an increasing net benefit - rising to about 1.5 % of GDP per year - in the period from 1900 to 2025 . 
This is because global warming has mixed effects ; for moderate warming , the benefits prevail . 
On one hand , because CO2 works as a fertilizer , higher levels have been a boon for agriculture , which comprises the biggest positive impact , at 0.8 % of GDP . 
Likewise , moderate warming prevents more cold deaths than the number of extra heat deaths that it causes . 
It also reduces demand for heating more than it increases the costs of cooling , implying a gain of about 0.4 % of GDP . 
On the other hand , warming increases water stress , costing about 0.2 % of GDP , and negatively affects ecosystems like wetlands , at a cost of about 0.1 % . 
As temperatures rise , however , the costs will rise and the benefits will decline , leading to a dramatic reduction in net benefits . 
After the year 2070 , global warming will become a net cost to the world , justifying cost-effective climate action now and in the decades to come . 
Yet , to put matters in perspective , the scorecard also shows us that the world &apos;s biggest environmental problem by far is indoor air pollution . 
Today , indoor pollution from cooking and heating with bad fuels kills more than three million people annually , or the equivalent of a loss of 3 % of global GDP . 
But in 1900 , the cost was 19 % of GDP , and it is expected to drop to 1 % of GDP by 2050 . 
Health indicators worldwide have shown some of the largest improvements . Human life expectancy barely changed before the late eighteenth century . 
Yet it is difficult to overstate the magnitude of the gain since 1900 : in that year , life expectancy worldwide was 32 years , compared to 69 now ( and a projection of 76 years in 2050 ) . 
The biggest factor was the fall in infant mortality . 
For example , even as late as 1970 , only around 5 % of infants were vaccinated against measles , tetanus , whooping cough , diphtheria , and polio . 
By 2000 , it was 85 % , saving about three million lives annually - more , each year , than world peace would have saved in the twentieth century . 
This success has many parents . 
The Gates Foundation and the GAVI Alliance have spent more than $ 2.5 billion and promised another $ 10 billion for vaccines . 
Efforts by the Rotary Club , the World Health Organization , and many others have reduced polio by 99 % worldwide since 1979 . 
In economic terms , the cost of poor health at the outset of the twentieth century was an astounding 32 % of global GDP . 
Today , it is down to about 11 % , and by 2050 it will be half that . 
While the optimists are not entirely right ( loss of biodiversity in the twentieth century probably cost about 1 % of GDP per year , with some places losing much more ) , the overall picture is clear . 
Most of the topics in the scorecard show improvements of 5-20 % of GDP . 
And the overall trend is even clearer . 
Global problems have declined dramatically relative to the resources available to tackle them . 
Of course , this does not mean that there are no more problems . 
Although much smaller , problems in health , education , malnutrition , air pollution , gender inequality , and trade remain large . 
But realists should now embrace the view that the world is doing much better . 
Moreover , the scorecard shows us where the substantial challenges remain for a better 2050 . 
We should guide our future attention not on the basis of the scariest stories or loudest pressure groups , but on objective assessments of where we can do the most good .
