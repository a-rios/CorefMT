The Real Long March 
Every nation has its founding myth . 
For Communist China , it is the Long March - a story on a par with Moses leading the Israelites &quot; exodus out of Egypt . 
I was raised on it . 
The myth can be stated succinctly . 
The fledgling Communist Party and its three Red Armies were driven out of their bases in the South in the early 1930 &quot; s by Chiang Kaishek &apos;s Nationalist government . 
Pursued and harried by their enemies , they crossed high mountains , turbulent rivers , and impassable grassland , with Mao steering the course from victory to victory . 
After two years and 10,000 miles of endurance , courage , and hope against impossible odds , the Red Armies reached northwest China . 
Only a fifth of the 200,000 soldiers remained , worn out , battered , but defiant . 
A decade later , they fought back , defeated Chiang Kaishek , and launched Mao &apos;s New China . 
How does China &apos;s founding myth stand up to reality ? 
In 2004 , seventy years after it began , I set out to retrace the Long March . 
It remains a daunting journey , through areas little changed to this day , inaccessible , and desperately poor . 
Of the 40,000 survivors , perhaps 500 are still alive ; 
Huang Zhiji was a boy , little taller than his rifle , when he joined the Red Army . 
He had no choice : they had arrested his father and would not release him until Huang agreed . 
He thought of deserting , but stayed for fear of being caught and shot . 
Many did run away . 
Six weeks into the March , Mao &apos;s First Army was reduced from 86,000 to 30,000 troops . 
The loss is still blamed on the Xiang River Battle , the Army &apos;s first big engagement of the March . 
Another battle , over the Dadu River , is the core of the Long March legend : 22 brave men supposedly overpowered a regiment of Nationalist troops guarding the chains of the Luding Bridge with machine guns , and opened the way for the Marchers . 
Mao told Edgar Snow , author of Red Star Over China , that crossing the Dadu River was the single most important incident during the Long March , and today it is eulogized as such . 
But documents that I have seen indicate that the general who commanded the division that crossed the Dadu River first told Party historians a very different story . 
&quot; This affair was not as complicated as people made it out to be later , &quot; he said . 
&quot; When you investigate historical facts , you should respect the truth . 
How you present it is a different matter . &quot; 
So the legend lives on . 
There was only a skirmish over the Dadu River . 
The local warlord , who hated Chiang Kaishek , let Mao pass . 
As a reward , he was later made a minister in the Communist government . 
The Marchers did not know where they would end up . 
There were constant debates about the final destination . 
When they converged in north China in October 1936 , it was hailed as the end of the March . 
But the &quot; promised land &quot; was not as promised . 
Soldiers had no clothes to protect them from freezing cold . 
Women were ordered to turn back and go home because there was not enough food . 
Barely a month after the union of the three Red Armies , the Party decided that the Long March was to continue . 
As part of the price for his release , Chiang recognized the Communists as legitimate . 
The Long March was over . 
Not , however , for the 21,000 men and women of the Western Legion . They belonged to the Fourth Army , headed by Zhang Guotao , Mao &apos;s archrival . 
Their mission was to get help from Russia at the border in western China . 
But Mao kept sending them contradictory orders ; the result was that they could neither fight nor retreat . 
Trapped in barren land where survival was difficult , the overwhelming forces of Muslim warlords wiped them out . 
Only 400 reached the border ; the rest were killed or captured . 
It was the Red Army &apos;s biggest defeat . 
Yet it is missing from official history . 
Wang Quanyan , a senior officer , was taken by a Muslim commander as a concubine . 
She and the rest of the Fourth Army survivors had to fight for half a century to be recognized as Marchers . 
The Long Marchers persevered , fought , starved , despaired , and endured . 
Hunger drove the armies to take hostages for ransom . 
Purges continued until practically no officers were left to command battles . 
If the Marchers had doubts , they conquered them with the help of Communist propaganda . 
They rose to their ordealwith a bravery and self-sacrifice unsurpassed in China &apos;s or anyone &apos;s history . 
What motivated them ? 
I asked a top general what he knew of communism at the time . 
&quot; I had no idea then and now , &quot; he replied . 
&quot; I doubt that even Mao knew what it was . &quot; 
For him , a survivor of extreme poverty and oppression , communism was a beautiful , sustaining dream , the hope of a just and advanced society . 
Perhaps no one knew or could know how much suffering would lie ahead , how vast the sacrifice would be , and how great the difference would be between the dream and the reality .
