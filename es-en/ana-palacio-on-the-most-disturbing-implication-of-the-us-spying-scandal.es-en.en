America &apos;s Strategic Blindness 
MADRID - The recriminations over US spying activities , triggered by the revelations of the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden , have now reached fever pitch . 
Questions abound - about what President Barack Obama knew and when , about the legitimacy of eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders &quot; conversations , about the future of transatlantic relations , and even about the meaning of the term &quot; ally . &quot; 
But the current firestorm , like other recent diplomatic crises for the United States , reflects a more fundamental problem : the lack of strategic vision in American foreign policy . 
Until the US is able to establish an overarching , purpose-oriented framework through which it relates to the world , a reactive approach is inevitable , with high-intensity incidents such as we have seen this month continuing to be the norm . 
For more than 40 years , the Cold War policy of containment of Soviet influence provided America its strategic framework . 
Though US tactics were debated and shifted from administration to administration , the overarching approach remained consistent , because it was broadly supported by Republicans and Democrats alike . 
Of course , an overarching national-security strategy provided no guarantee against problems or even major disasters in countries like Vietnam and Nicaragua . 
Nonetheless , in hindsight , containment infused an order and organization on US foreign policy that is absent today . 
After the fall of the Berlin Wall , the necessity that had been driving containment disappeared . 
What followed was a decade of scattershot foreign policy marked by notable cases of inaction , together with individual initiatives taken largely without reference to a broader doctrine . 
Unchallenged in the world &apos;s unipolar moment , the US had the luxury of not knowing its strategic goals . 
Shocked by the attacks of September 11 , the US forced a new framework onto its still-unquestioned belief in the inexorable movement of history toward freedom . 
Unfortunately , what emerged was a deeply flawed approach , not least because in declaring a &quot; war on terror , &quot; America positioned itself against a tactic , not an entity or an ideology . 
Under Obama , the US has begun to depart from this approach . 
As in the 1990 &quot; s , the US has no organizing imperative , and the result is the same : a combination of inactivity and incoherent initiatives . 
And , at a time of domestic political polarization , the lack of a global strategy denies a potential rallying point around which Democrats and Republicans can unite . 
Two decades ago , geopolitical conditions limited blowback from America &apos;s foreign-policy vacuum . 
It cannot solve problems that directly affect it by acting on its own , though its leadership remains indispensable . 
That is all the more true given that the nature of such problems has also changed . 
America , like the rest of us , is vulnerable to climate change , pandemics , and terrorism - challenges that require coordinated global solutions . 
For the US , however , the utility of multilateralism is purely situational . 
Above all , multilateralism is never preferable to a &quot; good &quot; bilateral solution - a view that has reinforced behavior that undermines , rather than strengthens , the capacity for effective international action . 
Indeed , always ready to negotiate treaties but rarely prepared to sign - and even less likely to ratify - them , the US remains absent from such key global agreements as the Kyoto Protocol , the Mine Ban Treaty , and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea . 
Its inspired creativity and support in building formal institutions like the United Nations and World Bank has given way to a predilection for weak , informal , and ad hoc groupings , such as the various G-somethings and &quot; coalitions of the willing . &quot; 
Establishing effective multilateralism requires an emphasis on rules and institutions that facilitate coordination . 
The recent decision by the US to sign the Arms Trade Treaty could be a good start - if only Congress could marshal the bipartisan support needed to ratify it . 
But scattered moves in the right direction will not suffice . 
What is really needed is a change in vision and mentality - a shift from viewing multilateralism as a tactic to embracing it as a strategic imperative . 
The current spying scandal is the product of a rudderless US foreign policy focused on narrowly drawn tactical objectives that exist outside the conceptual funnel of a comprehensive vision . 
The result in this case has been damage to the transatlantic relationship , with some in Europe even calling for a halt to the talks on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) . 
Suspending the trade talks would be folly , not just in terms of the regional impact , but also because the TTIP should be an exercise in rule-making that echoes globally . 
The current diplomatic crisis , too , is an opportunity to ensure that transatlantic discussions about privacy and surveillance reverberate in a multilateral setting ; seizing it would represent a small but significant contribution to the strategic vision that has been sorely lacking for the last quarter-century .
