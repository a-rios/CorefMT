Europe &apos;s Interest in Closing Guantánamo 
BRUSSELS - For years , the European Union has called loudly for the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention center . 
Now that US President Barack Obama has taken the decision to do so , the EU stands ready to provide political and practical support to the United States to help achieve that goal . 
We share President Obama &apos;s assessment that &quot; Guantánamo became a symbol that helped Al Qaeda recruit terrorists to its cause . 
Indeed , the existence of Guantánamo likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained . &quot; 
We in the EU believe that it is our common interest with the US to prevent radicalization and recruitment to terrorism throughout the world . 
The primary responsibility for closing Guantánamo and re-settling detainees lies with the US . 
But Europeans want to help the US turn the page . 
That is why EU member states have already received their own nationals and former residents from Guantánamo . 
That is why France recently received an Algerian ex-detainee . 
And that is why several other EU countries are now considering receiving ex-detainees cleared for release , but who , for compelling reasons , cannot return to their countries of origin . 
We in the EU expect the US to do likewise ; if it is safe to release these people in Europe , it is safe to do so in the US . 
More generally , we agree with Obama that &quot; in the long run we ... cannot keep ... safe unless we enlist the power of our most fundamental values , &quot; and that &quot; we uphold our most cherished values not only because doing so is right , but because it strengthens &#91; us &#93; and keeps us safe . &quot; 
The experience of European democracies confronted with a long-term terrorist threat shows that human rights and the rule of law are our strongest assets . 
That is why terrorists want to destroy them . 
The closure of Guantánamo must be accompanied by a fundamental review of the underlying policies that gave rise to its existence . 
Obama &apos;s decisions to ban &quot; enhanced interrogation &quot; and end secret detention are important steps in the right direction . 
But more steps are needed . 
In particular , indefinite detention without trial needs to be addressed to avoid the recurrence of problems . 
Therefore , the review of detention , trial , transfer , and interrogation policies is of utmost importance . 
There must be no gaps in protection , whatever law is applicable . 
The EU will take up the Obama administration &apos;s invitation to share its views with his Detention Policy Task Force on international law principles relevant to the fight against terrorism . 
We hope the US will change its &quot; war on terror &quot; paradigm and re-think its conception of a global armed conflict against Al Qaeda . 
No EU member has taken such an approach . 
There is an obvious difference between persons engaged in an armed conflict , as in Afghanistan and Iraq , and terrorist suspects arrested outside of armed conflict . 
A case-by-case approach is therefore necessary . 
We welcome the fact that the first former Guantánamo detainee is facing criminal charges in New York . 
The perpetrators of the Madrid and London bombings were prosecuted in ordinary criminal trials . 
One plotter in the attack of September 11 , 2001 , appeared before ordinary courts in Germany . 
In many EU member states , criminal law has been strengthened and is being used to prevent attacks . 
Membership of a terrorist organization , including those operating on foreign soil , training and recruiting people for terrorism , and promotion of terrorism have been made criminal offenses . 
The fight against international terrorism raises important legal questions . 
We are looking forward to continuing our productive dialogue with the US State Department Legal Adviser . 
The threat from Al Qaeda is global . 
The EU and US must work together to make Europe and America safe . 
By closing Guantánamo and addressing the underlying policy issues , the US is creating a much stronger foundation for close EU-US cooperation in counter-terrorism and the fight against international crime , one based on the rule of law and human rights . 
Together , the EU and the US will be in a better position jointly to promote justice , human rights and freedom around the world . 
This has been and remains the most sustainable way of preventing radicalization and recruitment to terrorism . 
Closing Guantánamo is not a gesture to win applause from Europeans . 
It is a necessary revision of policy that will make the US , Europe , and the world safer .
