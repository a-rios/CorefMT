Europe &apos;s Two-Speed Future 
PARIS - For three years , the euro crisis has threatened not only to unravel the eurozone , but to bring down the entire European Union with it . 
Although the pressure from financial markets has moderated , for now , a long-term resolution to the crisis remains an existential priority for the EU . 
In today &apos;s highly competitive global economy , European countries &quot; relatively small size , aging populations , and excessive indebtedness , combined with a lack of energy resources and insufficient investment in research and development , mean that their high living standards and generous social-welfare states are in jeopardy . 
Individually , they cannot compete with emerging markets ; they need a strong EU to face the challenges posed by globalization . 
But the eurozone &apos;s architecture - in which monetary policy is centralized , but budgetary and economic policies are left up to individual governments - is not viable in the long term . 
Although Europe &apos;s leaders have made some progress on institutional reform , the measures taken so far will not lead to real convergence of economic and budgetary policies , or to genuine economic union . 
As a result , they will fail to reassure financial markets . 
Given that treaty change is politically unfeasible , establishing a &quot; two-speed Europe &quot; - in which a core group of countries pursues deeper integration more quickly than the rest - is the EU &apos;s best option for reaching the level of cooperation needed to escape the crisis intact . 
This can be accomplished in two ways . 
The first option would be to progress de facto toward a two-speed EU without establishing further legal commitments . 
Eurozone countries , together with others willing to join the euro in the future ( the &quot; eurozone plus &quot; ) , could simply decide to use the legal means already available to increase cooperation . 
Ideally , this cooperation would take place within the EU &apos;s institutional framework . 
If all eurozone members participated , Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU could be used to support their action.The scope of this provision - which says that , &quot; the &#91; European &#93; Council shall ... adopt measures specific to &#91; euro &#93; Member States , &quot; and that &quot; only &#91; euro &#93; Member States ... shall take part in the vote &quot; - is wide . 
In addition , Article 138 would allow unified representation of the eurozone in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . 
The group could then extend cooperation to three other policy areas : 
· 
Minimal harmonization of tax laws ( such as a common basis for assessing corporate taxation ) and social policy ( such as further liberalization of national labor markets to encourage labor mobility ) ; 
· 
Common policy measures on immigration , linked to labor-market needs ; 
· 
Closer judicial cooperation - again aimed at encouraging mobility - in civil matters with cross-border implications , specifically concerning contracts and family law . 
The group could also take some measures outside the EU framework . 
Indeed , if all eurozone countries did not participate , such outside cooperation would be crucial , given that Articles 136 and 138 would no longer apply . 
This could include measures to strengthen the European Stability Mechanism and the Euro Plus Pact ( designed to enhance economic policy coordination among member states ) , de facto cooperation within the Bretton Woods institutions , and voluntary approximation of national laws in certain areas . 
Participating countries would have to decide whether to commit to a common set of policies , or to reserve the right to opt in on a case-by-case basis . 
Cooperation on matters related to the EU &apos;s Economic and Monetary Union ( discipline and solidarity ) should be obligatory . 
The involvement of most , or all , current and future eurozone countries would enhance the group &apos;s coherence , making it easier to win public support for cooperation in other areas . 
Pursuing this option would require that the decision-making process be legitimate . 
In the Council , as in all cases of &quot; enhanced cooperation , &quot; only participating members have the right to vote . 
In the European Parliament , by contrast , all 27 EU members participate in the decision-making process , even concerning measures that will affect only the 23 &quot; eurozone plus &quot; countries ( the 17 eurozone members and the six that have agreed to the Euro Plus Pact ) - a method that could pose a political problem . 
In any case , national parliaments should become involved in order to enhance the legitimacy of decisions . 
The second option would imply an international agreement , in addition to the EU treaties , which would legally bind participating countries , enabling them to commit to establishing a genuine economic union , and to define the organs and rules that will govern their cooperation . 
Such a treaty would take time to be negotiated , ratified , and implemented . 
But a clear , precise announcement of the decision to pursue it , together with a bold European Central Bank policy in line with its recently announced bond-purchasing program , might be enough to convince both financial markets and EU citizens that a lasting solution is within sight . 
The eurozone &apos;s path to genuine economic union will be fraught with political and institutional challenges - from determining substantive areas of cooperation to protecting the rights and interests of all EU countries and safeguarding the unity of both the internal market and foreign relations . 
But navigating that path is the EU &apos;s only option .
