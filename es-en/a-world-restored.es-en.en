A World Restored ? 
BERLIN : Like old battle horses feeling young as the bugle sounds , Cold War strategists are feeling the adrenalin mount as missile defense becomes front page news . 
True , the defense against missiles which Bill Clinton ( reluctantly ) and George W. Bush ( enthusiastically ) are proposing - with massive support from America &apos;s Congress - is different from Ronald Reagan &apos;s Star Wars dream of twenty years ago : NMD is supposed to catch only a modest number of warheads , not provide complete protection against enemy missiles . 
Nevertheless , the issue rekindles old debates over deterrence , mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control , and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers just when nuclear weapons had lost much of their relevance . 
Amazingly , debate is heating up even though it is uncertain that NMD will work . 
Even if it does work , it will be ten to fifteen years , possibly longer , before NMD is operational . 
So tempers are rising over something which , if and when it happens in the distant future , may or may not have much impact . 
Normally cautious governments are positioning themselves now as if the future were around the corner . 
What explains this odd behavior ? 
Not blind faith in technology . 
After all , the history of missile defense is a tale of technology constantly disappointing its advocates in and out of government . 
No one in his right mind can assume that something never achieved before , namely destroying a small number of warheads in flight , will happen over night . 
Of the three tests so far conducted , one failed almost , two entirely , which is why President Clinton left the matter to his successor . 
If President Bush , as he has hinted , now favors a different design , it will take even more time to develop the architecture and devise a test program . 
Nobody can be sure that it will work either . 
Governments are worried now , not because of capabilities , but because of America &apos;s real or imagined intentions . 
While Americans claim that NMD is not directed against anyone , that all the US wants is to protect its citizens against states like Iraq or North Korea , almost everyone else thinks differently : Russians fear that America wants to cement its military superiority ( and Russia &apos;s inferiority ) forever ; the Chinese are concerned that NMD signals American readiness to help Taiwan remain independent ; 
Europeans worry that America &apos;s plans invite tensions with Russia and may separate the US from Europe . 
Because political intentions , not technical capabilities matter , NMD creates problems now : it pushes Russia into confrontation , heightens Chinese nervousness , and underpins a European sense of estrangement from the US . 
Damage is done from the word go while the end of the road remains obscured . 
Inflating this political damage is the fact that , thirty years ago , the US and the then Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles . 
Normally , a US defense project in its infancy would not cause the excitement NMD generates . 
But the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits , for the indefinite future , systems to protect either country against such nuclear attack . 
As the US proceeds with NMD , it will either have to violate the Treaty or give six months notice to quit , something both signatories are entitled to do if they feel their vital security interests demand it . 
In the eyes of many , that would amount to America opting out of the structure of nuclear arms control built in the latter part of the Cold War . 
The Bush Administration argues that , because the Cold War is over , the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not mean a loss of nuclear stability . 
But stability is as much a matter of political perceptions as of technical calculations . 
By limiting strategic missile defense , the old treaty provides a certain predictability of deterrence for all nuclear weapon states . 
Its disappearance would affect all other arms control agreements . 
Russia threatens to scrap all of them once the US leaves the ABM-Treaty . 
While this threat lacks credibility ( it would harm Russian interests most ) it has a certain logic . 
The main question NMD poses is not how to prepare for a future world of missile defense but how to dampen today &apos;s political concerns . 
Such efforts are getting discretely underway . 
Legal experts in Washington suggest that modest preparations for building missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM-Treaty and so do not yet require a US notice to quit . 
For now , the Bush Administration will await the outcome of tests before deciding . 
Both Moscow and Washington hint at possible deep cuts in their offensive nuclear arsenals . 
Skeptical European allies are being mollified by US assurances of close consultation . 
The most important of confidence-building measures , a modification of the ABM-Treaty to allow for limited missile defense , is being explored . 
Russia &apos;s early &quot; nyet &quot; may not be the last word . 
So political turmoil with Russia and Europe might be calmed . 
But what about China ? 
In contrast to Europe and Russia , China is not party to an alliance ( as is Europe ) or to a network of arms control treaties through which political solutions can evolve ( like Russia ) , factors that contribute to Asian instabilities and Chinese sensitivity . 
Here confidence can only be built through the approach taken by the US to China . 
Regrettably , there are no indications yet that the problem is recognized in Washington as a serious one . 
All this comes as a disappointment to old Cold War strategists . 
While brushing up the vocabulary and abbreviations of the age of superpower deterrence , they discover that such a world has gone . 
Missile defense is not a threat to US-Russian strategic stability ; its mishandling is a threat to political predictability . 
By announcing its determination to go ahead with a distant NMD , the US has created political turbulence which it must address now if major damage is to be avoided .
