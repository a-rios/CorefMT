The Rise of Regionalism in Asia 
This week , America and Singapore ironed out the final stumbling blocks to a bilateral free trade agreement ( FTA ) . 
Such pacts are spreading like wildfire across Asia . 
Until recently , most East Asian countries pursued non-discriminatory trade policies through unilateral liberalisation , the Asian / Pacific Economic Community , and the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) . 
As the US / Singapore deal shows , discriminatory bilateral and regional initiatives are growing more popular . 
An East Asian economic bloc forming around either China and / or Japan now seems plausible . 
Will all this deal-making sideline the region in the WTO ? 
East Asian countries have relatively liberal trade policies and are reasonably well integrated into the global economy . 
This , however , masks huge differences . 
Hong Kong and Singapore are free ports . 
South Korea and Taiwan liberalised substantially in recent years . 
Malaysia is fairly open but with significant protection , especially in services . 
Thai protectionism remains high . 
Indonesia and the Philippines are mired in political and economic instability . 
Myanmar , Vietnam , Cambodia , and Laos , all very poor , have higher levels of protection . 
Now consider the two regional engines , Japan and China . 
Japan &apos;s sclerotic domestic economy makes it incapable of exerting regional leadership . 
On trade policy it is defensive , especially in its addiction to agricultural protectionism . 
China presents a different picture . 
Its WTO commitments are the strongest of any developing country . 
China narrowed the trade policy gap with other developing countries , bringing average tariffs down to Southeast Asian and Latin American levels ( about 10 % ) and establishing comparable openness to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . 
The upshot is that the emerging market policy environment is a lot more competitive , especially in terms of attracting FDI . 
Traces of the &quot; new regionalism &quot; can be found everywhere . 
Singapore pioneered this approach . 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) is talking to several third countries . 
To date only a proposed ASEAN-China FTA has got off the starting blocks . 
Similar initiatives are afoot in Northeast Asia . 
Both political and economic factors lie behind this . 
China views FTAs as a means to exercise strategic leadership in the region . 
The economic motivations are mostly defensive . 
But with the WTO stuck in drift and deadlock over the past few years , there is a race to secure preferential access to the markets of the major powers , and to defuse trade tension by locking into strong bilateral and regional partnerships . 
Given today &apos;s trends , a loose East Asian trade bloc revolving around China ( more likely than Japan ) could emerge alongside US-led and EU-led blocs , all interlinked by a cross-regional patchwork of bilateral and &quot; plurilateral &quot; FTAs . 
This scenario is worrying if the WTO does not get out of its rut , because a world economy that has been sliced up regionally will be dominated by discrimination , knots of red tape , and power plays . 
In such a world , poor and weak countries would be losers . 
However , if the global trade framework institutionalised in the WTO advances , especially through multilateral , non-discriminatory liberalisation in the present Doha Round , the new regionalism will probably turn out to be benign . 
Ultimately , as a region highly dependent on trade with and inward investment from the rest of the world , FTAs are not enough for East Asia . 
The region will continue to have a long-term stake in a WTO that delivers freer trade worldwide , that is , multilaterally rather than bilaterally or regionally . 
The WTO is important to East Asia , but the reverse is also true . 
Of the twenty or so active developing and newly developed countries in the WTO , almost half come from the region . 
The Doha Round will not make sustained progress without the active participation of East Asia , on individual issues and across the board . 
Because of its economic and trade muscle , China is bound to play a more prominent role as the Doha round unfolds . 
There are early , positive signs that it is adopting a &quot; Brazilian , &quot; as opposed to an &quot; Indian , &quot; strategy within the WTO . 
It is not being negative or obstructionist in blocking the liberalization process on several fronts , which is India &apos;s historic manner of conducting global trade negotiations . 
This is the right approach for those in China &apos;s leadership who wish to extract maximum benefits from the WTO to bolster domestic reform . 
Korea is active and constructive in the WTO , except on agriculture . 
Taiwan is also set to play a constructive role - if mainland China lets it . 
The city states , Hong Kong and Singapore , have clear-sighted WTO policies , focusing on market access and strong rules . 
Malaysia and Thailand are also fairly active in the WTO , with a mix of free-market and protectionist positions . 
Indonesia and the Philippines are weaker , overwhelmed by policy incoherence and fire-fighting at home , and with insufficient capacity to deal with the WTO &apos;s burgeoning and increasingly complicated agenda . 
Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia are in the queue for WTO accession . 
The WTO is at a crossroads . 
It sorely needs to liberalize trade progressively . 
Strong US leadership is required to push the WTO in this direction while avoiding an EU-style future ( regulatory overload ) or a UN-style future ( an irrelevant talking shop ) . 
This is more likely under a Bush administration with better open-market credentials and a more assertive foreign policy than any Democratic alternative . 
However , Robert Zoellick , President Bush &apos;s Trade Representative , needs allies . 
Many of them - including China - are to be found in East Asia .
