Obama &apos;s Middle East Malady 
PARIS - No sooner did US President Barack Obama welcome home American troops from Iraq and laud that country &apos;s stability and democracy than an unprecedented wave of violence - across Baghdad and elsewhere - revealed the severity of Iraq &apos;s political crisis . 
Is that crisis an unfortunate exception , or , rather , a symptom of the failure of Obama &apos;s Middle East diplomacy , from Egypt to Afghanistan ? 
Upon taking office , Obama set four objectives in the Middle East : stabilize Iraq before leaving it ; withdraw from Afghanistan from a position of strength and on the basis of minimal political convergence with Pakistan ; achieve a major breakthrough in the Middle East peace process by pushing Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to freeze settlements ; and open a dialogue with Iran on the future of its nuclear program . 
On these four major issues , Obama has clearly achieved little . 
With regard to Iraq , since George W. Bush &apos;s presidency , the United States has strived to exert a moderating influence on Shia power , so that the country can create a more inclusive political system - specifically , by passing a new law on sharing oil-export revenues among the Shia , Sunni , and Kurdish communities . 
Unfortunately , the precise opposite happened . 
Kurdistan has embarked on a path toward increased autonomy , while the Sunnis are increasingly marginalized by a sectarian and authoritarian Shia-dominated central government . 
This has implications for the regional balance of power , because Iraq is growing closer to Iran in order to offset Turkey , which is seen as protecting the Sunnis . 
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s remark during a recent trip to Washington that he was more concerned about Turkey than Iran exposed the huge gulf between Iraq and the US , which now appears to have lost all significant political influence on Iraqi affairs . 
Indeed , in a disturbing development , the US decided not to play its last remaining card in dealing with al-Maliki : arms sales . 
There can no longer be any doubt that the occupation of Iraq was a huge strategic defeat for the US , because it ultimately served only to strengthen Iran . 
Yet Obama lacks a medium-term vision to deal with the seriousness of the situation - an oversight that , sooner or later , will cost the US dearly . 
One of two things will happen : either tighter containment of Iran through sanctions on oil exports will produce positive results and weaken Iran , or containment will fail , leading the US inexorably toward a new war in the Middle East . 
It is not unlikely that some in US foreign-policy circles regard the deepening Iraqi crisis as a building block in constructing the case for military intervention in Iran . 
But Obama is nobody &apos;s fool . 
He has registered the US Congress &apos;s hostility toward Iran and the desire to confront the Islamic Republic militarily . 
He believes , however , that he can avoid extreme solutions ; in diplomacy , anything can happen , and the worst-case scenario is never guaranteed . 
The problem is that Obama has a strong tendency to overestimate America &apos;s ability to influence weaker actors . 
What is true for Iraq is also true for Afghanistan : Obama can pride himself on having eliminated Osama bin Laden , which was undoubtedly a success , but one that failed to address the root of the problem . 
Despite a 10-year military presence , involving the deployment of more than 100,000 troops at a cost of $ 550 billion , the US still has not succeeded in creating a credible alternative to the Taliban . 
Worse , its political alliance with Pakistan has frayed . 
Indeed , US-Pakistan relations have regressed to their level before September 11 , 2001 , a time marked by deep mutual distrust . 
Pakistani leaders obviously bear a heavy responsibility for this state of affairs . 
But if the US has been unable to involve Pakistan in resolving the Afghanistan conflict , that failure simply reflects America &apos;s refusal to give the Pakistanis what they wanted : a shift in the regional balance of power at the expense of India . 
Pakistan , accordingly , froze cooperation with the US , because its leaders no longer saw much to gain in fighting the Taliban . 
The risk is that when the American withdrawal from Afghanistan begins - a process that has just been brought forward to next year , from 2014 - the US will again seek to impose sanctions on Pakistan , an unreliable nuclear state that will react by strengthening ties with China and deploying Islamist terrorism . 
Obama also sought to use America &apos;s influence to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as part of his strategy for the broader Middle East . 
He initially thought that by pressuring Netanyahu to freeze settlements , he would succeed in reviving the peace process . 
But he was quickly and skillfully outmaneuvered by his ally , who knows how important the Israeli issue is to US domestic politics . 
By putting Obama at odds with the rest of the US establishment , Netanyahu forced him to retreat . 
In 2009 , Obama envisioned a settlement of the conflict through the strong commitment of the international community . 
In 2011 , he asserted that only both sides &quot; willingness could ensure a successful outcome . 
Clearly , the US cannot do much to resolve the conflict . 
There is no overarching explanation for Obama &apos;s successive Middle East failures , but there are a few factors worth considering : the increase in the number of asymmetrical conflicts , in which the traditional use of force is largely ineffective ; increasingly blurred lines between difficult allies and intransigent adversaries ; and major political differences between a centrist US president and a Congress that is dominated more than ever by extreme ideas . 
But Obama himself bears a large part of the blame . 
Contrary to what one might think , he does not have a real strategic vision of the world - a shortcoming reflected in his quick capitulation in the face of opposition to his proposals . 
Obama often has a plan A , but never a plan B. When it comes to conducting a successful foreign policy , plan A is never enough .
