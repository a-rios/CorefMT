The Reality of Virtual Power 
DAVOS - As Arab regimes struggle with demonstrations fueled by Twitter and Al Jazeera , and American diplomats try to understand the impact of WikiLeaks , it is clear that this global information age will require a more sophisticated understanding of how power works in world politics . 
That is the argument of my new book , The Future of Power . 
Two types of power shifts are occurring in this century - power transition and power diffusion . 
The transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern , but power diffusion is a more novel process . 
The problem for all states today is that more is happening outside the control of even the most powerful of them . 
As for power transition , much attention nowadays is lavished on a supposed American decline , often with facile historical analogies to Britain and Rome . 
But Rome remained dominant for more than three centuries after the apogee of its power , and , even then , it did not succumb to the rise of another state , but suffered a death by a thousand cuts inflicted by various barbarian tribes . 
Indeed , for all the fashionable predictions that China , India , or Brazil will surpass the United States in the coming decades , the greatest threats may come from modern barbarians and non-state actors . 
In an information-based world of cyber-insecurity , power diffusion may be a greater threat than power transition . 
What will it mean to wield power in the global information age of the twenty-first century ? 
Which resources will produce power ? 
Every age produces its own answers . 
In the sixteenth century , control of colonies and gold bullion gave Spain the edge ; seventeenth-century Holland profited from trade and finance ; eighteenth-century France gained from its larger population and armies ; and nineteenth-century British power rested on industrial and naval primacy . 
Conventional wisdom has always held that the state with the largest military prevails . 
In an information age , however , it may be the state ( or non-state ) with the best story that wins . 
Today , it is far from clear how to measure a balance of power , much less how to develop successful survival strategies for this new world . 
Most current projections of a shift in the global balance of power are based primarily on one factor : projections of countries &quot; GDP growth . 
They thus ignore the other dimensions of power , including both hard military power and the soft power of narrative , not to mention the policy difficulties of combining them into successful strategies . 
States will remain the dominant actor on the world stage , but they will find the stage far more crowded and difficult to control . 
A much larger part of their populations than ever before has access to the power that comes from information . 
Governments have always worried about the flow and control of information , and the current period is not the first to be strongly affected by dramatic changes in information technology . 
What is new - and what we see manifested in the Middle East today - is the speed of communication and the technological empowerment of a wider range of actors . 
The current information age , sometimes called the &quot; Third Industrial Revolution , &quot; is based on rapid technological advances in computers , communications , and software , which in turn have led to a dramatic fall in the cost of creating , processing , transmitting , and searching for information of all kinds . 
And this means that world politics can no longer be the sole province of governments . 
As the cost of computing and communication comes down , the barriers to entry decline . 
Individuals and private organizations , ranging from corporations to NGOs to terrorists , have thus been empowered to play a direct role in world politics . 
The spread of information means that power will be more widely distributed , and informal networks will undercut the monopoly of traditional bureaucracy . 
The speed of Internet time means that all governments will have less control over their agendas . 
Political leaders will enjoy fewer degrees of freedom before they must respond to events , and then will have to compete with an increasing number and variety of actors in order to be heard . 
We see this as American policymakers struggle to cope with today &apos;s Middle East disturbances . 
The fall of the Tunisian regime had deep domestic roots , but the timing caught outsiders , including the US government , by surprise . 
Some observers attribute the acceleration of the revolution to Twitter and WikiLeaks . 
As the Obama administration formulates policy towards Egypt and Yemen , it faces a dilemma . 
In Yemen , Ali Abdullah Saleh &apos;s regime has provided important assistance in dealing with the threat from Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorism . 
In Egypt , Hosni Mubarak &apos;s rule helped to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and balanced Iranian power in the region . 
Simplistic endorsement of democracy by George W. Bush &apos;s administration was costly both in Iraq and in Gaza , where elections gave rise to a hostile Hamas-led government . 
In an information age , smart policy combines hard and soft power . 
Given what the US is , the Obama administration cannot afford to neglect the soft-power narrative of democracy , liberty , and openness . 
Thus , Obama and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have issued public as well as private appeals for reform and change in Egypt and the wider Arab world , while also urging limits to violence by all parties . 
Moreover , they have aligned themselves with freedom of information in the face of efforts by the Egyptian regime to block Internet access . 
How events in the Middle East will play out is anyone &apos;s guess , but in today &apos;s information age , upholding the freedom to access it will be an important component of smart power .
