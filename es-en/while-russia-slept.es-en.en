While Russia Slept 
Elections in Russia usually somehow signal a political crisis : Boris Yeltsin &apos;s re-election as President in 1996 , for example , seemed to hold off a communist resurrection - not by revolution but through the ballot box . 
Elections to the State Duma ( the lower house of Russia &apos;s parliament ) are normally quieter affairs , and the just completed campaign and Duma elections ( NOTE TO EDITORS , the vote is December 7 th ) were certainly silent - deadly silent . 
Indeed , so omnipotent is President Vladimir Putin in Russia nowadays that the Duma election would have been scarcely noticed - by the world and Russia alike - were it not for the arrest and imprisonment this autumn of Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the oil industry oligarch who dared to put his money behind two liberal parties opposed to Putin . 
Khodorkovsky &apos;s arrest did not galvanize ordinary Russians , who increasingly see elections as beside the point in their difficult lives . 
His arrest did , however , shake international confidence in Putin , as well as arouse Russia &apos;s other oligarchs and democratic reformers to seriously fear for their freedoms . 
The greater the power , the more dangerous the abuse , said Edmund Burke in 1771 . 
Putin exercises a power greater than that allowed any other democratically elected leader , and the manner in which he exercises it is now causing serious concern . 
Lord Acton &apos;s phrase about the corrupting effect of power does not yet apply ; 
The presidency that Boris Yeltsin created for himself a decade ago - fattened when Yeltsin &apos;s tanks shelled an unruly Duma in 1993 - gives Putin astonishing freedom from accountability . 
Unlike America &apos;s or Mexico &apos;s president , he need not cajole a congress entrenched behind the ramparts of constitutionally separate powers . 
Unlike a British or Spanish prime minister , he cannot be removed by a vote of no confidence . 
Unlike Germany &apos;s Chancellor , he is not shackled to a coalition partner who can prevent him going too far . 
Unlike Berlusconi in Italy , Lula in Brazil , and Koizumi in Japan , he does not have to face down infighting within his own party . 
To the huge power of the Russian presidency Putin adds his own aloof temper and a familiarity , from his KGB years , with the subtle levers of Russia &apos;s bureaucracy . 
None of this is necessarily wrong : Russia &apos;s hard times demand a government that can act decisively . 
But Putin &apos;s power is pressing hard against the limits of what is permissible in a democracy . 
Yeltsin never spread his fingers into the nooks and crannies of government as comprehensively as Putin . 
Nothing escapes the eye of the Kremlin - whether it be which buildings are restored in Saint Petersburg or the appointment of minor Russian envoys abroad . 
When so much power is concentrated in one place , it is tempting to stifle criticism about how that power is used . 
Most complaints about Putin focus on his efforts to silence voices of independent criticism . 
In taming the oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky - who balked at accepting his &quot; settlement &quot; whereby Russia &apos;s richest men would keep their business empires , no matter how ill-gotten , if they kept out of politics - Putin did choke the media empires both men used to promote their causes . 
In a country where the president names the heads of all Russia &apos;s state television and radio channels , criticism is not so abundant that any of it can afford to be lost . 
But Putin &apos;s press policy does not add up to an argument that he ought not to be re-elected next March , when he stands again . 
Indeed , on the great issues of policy , as distinct from the murky corners of self-interest , Putin can still be seen as a good president . 
Abroad , he has drawn Russia into ever closer cooperation with the West : in much of the &quot; war on terror &quot; and the handling of North Korea , his policy parallels that of America ; elsewhere , rhetoric about &quot; independence &quot; persists , but the real doubts about who is a reliable partner for the West now point to Schroeder &apos;s Germany more than to Putin &apos;s Russia . 
At home , Putin has mostly done the right things for Russia &apos;s economy , leaving his government in office long enough to reap the benefits of consistency . 
His idea of a &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; satisfies enough Russians to put him solidly in command of the political center . 
What is worrying about Putin &apos;s rule is his inability to make Russia &apos;s government more transparent . 
All deals are private . 
Laws appear as if by magic . 
No one knows if the president ordered Khodorkovsky &apos;s arrest or even considered the devastating impact it would inevitably have on investment in Russia . 
The problem here is that , by keeping political decision-making in the dark , Russia &apos;s myriad power factions are never held to account . 
For example , what &quot; deal &quot;  - if any - was struck with Russia &apos;s nuclear industry to allow for the continued construction of nuclear plants in Iran ? 
No one knows . 
Would the military have been so successful in retarding reform if it had to act in the open ? 
In his efforts to &quot; get things done , &quot; Putin prefers to deal directly with powerful industries and lobbies , rather than shape laws through a rather tame Duma . 
It is the apparent inevitability of Putin &apos;s re-election next spring that justifies concern about his way of wielding power . 
Putin could earn the gratitude of future Russians by coolly re-examining the powers of his office . 
Power is best checked by democratically elected institutions - by a Duma with real power and a judiciary with real teeth - not by cutting deals with special interests and military / industrial insiders , or by stacking the government with ex-KGB men who can only intimidate , never inform . 
Putin should recognize that the sheer extent of his presidential power makes it essential that the darkest corners of Kremlin decision-making be exposed to daylight .
