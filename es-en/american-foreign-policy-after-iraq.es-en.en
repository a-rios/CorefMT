American Foreign Policy after Iraq 
What comes after Iraq ? 
If President George W. Bush &apos;s current troop &quot; surge &quot; fails to produce an outcome that can be called &quot; victory , &quot; what lessons will the United States draw for its future foreign policy ? 
Will it turn inward , as it did after its defeat in Vietnam three decades ago ? 
Will it turn from promoting democracy to a narrow realist view of its interests ? 
Even while discussion in Washington is fixated on Iraq , a number of thoughtful foreign observers are asking these longer-term questions . 
Analysts and pundits have often been mistaken about America &apos;s position in the world . 
For example , two decades ago , the conventional wisdom was that the US was in decline . 
A decade later , with the Cold War &apos;s end , the new conventional wisdom was that the world was a unipolar American hegemony . 
Some neo-conservative pundits drew the conclusion that the US was so powerful that it could decide what it thought was right , and others would have to follow . 
Charles Krauthammer celebrated this view as &quot; the new unilateralism , &quot; and it heavily influenced the Bush administration even before the attacks on September 11 , 2001 . 
But the new unilateralism was based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of power in world politics . 
Power is the ability to get the outcomes one wants . 
Whether the possession of resources will produce such outcomes depends upon the context . 
For example , a large , modern tank army is a powerful resource if a war is fought in a desert , but not if it is fought in a swamp - as America discovered in Vietnam . 
In the past , it was assumed that military power dominated most issues , but in today &apos;s world , the contexts of power differ greatly . 
I have likened the distribution of power in politics today as analogous to a three-dimensional chess game . 
On the top board - military relations among states - the world is , indeed , unipolar , and likely to remain that way for decades . 
But on the middle board of economic relations , the world is already multipolar , and the US cannot obtain the outcomes it wants without the cooperation of Europe , Japan , China , and others . 
And , on the bottom board of transnational issues outside the control of governments - including everything from climate change to pandemics to transnational terrorism - power is chaotically distributed , and it makes no sense at all to claim American hegemony . 
Yet it is on this bottom board that we find most of the greatest challenges we face today . 
The only way to grapple with these problems is through cooperation with others , and that requires the &quot; soft &quot; power of attraction as well as the hard power of coercion . 
There is no simple military solution that will produce the outcomes we want . 
The new unilateralists who dominated Bush &apos;s first administration made the mistake of thinking that the unipolar distribution of power in the military context was sufficient to guide foreign policy . 
They were like a young boy with a hammer who thinks that every problem resembles a nail . 
The danger of their approach is now obvious . 
Whoever plays a three-dimensional game by focusing on only one board is bound to lose in the long run . 
Fortunately , the pendulum has begun to swing back toward cooperation . 
In Bush &apos;s second term , some of the most extreme unilateralists have departed from the government , and the president has approached difficult problems like North Korea or Iran with a more multilateral approach than during his first term . 
Likewise , for all the complaints about the United Nations , the US and others turned to UN peacekeepers to sort out the mess after the Lebanon War last summer . 
The Iraq War , in particular , increased public awareness of the mistakes in Bush &apos;s first term , but other issues are changing as well . 
Americans now view cooperative action on global climate change more favorably . 
Similarly , the threat of pandemics means that Americans may come to recognize the importance of a stronger World Health Organization , just as the problem of nuclear proliferation is increasing awareness of the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
The nature of these problems means that the US does not have the luxury of turning inward no matter what the outcome in Iraq . 
These are not problems you can leave overseas . 
They follow you home . 
It also is unlikely that American foreign policy will return to a narrow realism and drop all emphasis on democracy and human rights . 
While the Iraq War discredited the idea of coercive democratization , both Republicans and Democrats have a strong strand of idealism in their foreign policy orientations . 
The problem for whoever is elected president in 2008 will be to find appropriate realistic means to advance democratic values and adjust official rhetoric accordingly . 
When rhetoric greatly outstrips reality , others view it as hypocrisy . 
Americans will need to find ways to assert their narrative of democracy , freedom , and rights in a manner that respects diversity and the views of others . 
What Iraq has taught is the importance of developing civil society and the rule of law before trying to hold broad-based elections . 
Democracy is more than voting , for it requires large investments in education , institutions , and promotion of non-governmental organizations . 
It must be rooted in the indigenous society and bear its characteristics , not be imposed from abroad . 
It is highly unlikely that the US will react after Iraq as it did after Vietnam . 
The paradox of American power is that the world &apos;s only military superpower cannot protect its citizens by acting alone .
