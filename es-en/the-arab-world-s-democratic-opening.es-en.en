The Arab World &apos;s Democratic Opening 
Roughly 400 million Muslims currently live in non-Arab Muslim majority states - including Turkey , Indonesia , Bangladesh , Senegal , Mali , and Albania - that have held relatively free elections for their highest political offices . 
These countries may not yet be full democracies , but , because they hold competitive elections , they have met a necessary condition for being a democracy . 
But since Lebanon was torn apart thirty years ago by civil war and violence , exacerbated by PLO , Israeli , Syrian , French , and US military incursions , not a single Muslim has lived in an electorally competitive Arab state . 
This is why it is so important for the world to think deeply about the current opportunities for democracy in Palestine and its neighbors . 
Modern democracies share at least seven preconditions : 
· a functioning state ; 
· a monopoly over the use of legitimate force ; 
· borders that have strong national and international recognition ; 
· agreement on who are its citizens ; 
· a government that rules from within the national territory ; 
· an elected government responsible to its citizens ; 
· a reasonably integrated legal system . 
Obviously , when the PLO was headquartered in Jordan , Lebanon , or Tunisia , and there was not yet a Palestinian Authority , Palestine did not meet any of these seven prerequisites . 
Indeed , partly owing to Yasir Arafat &apos;s own actions or inactions , at his death Palestine still had none of them . 
For example , while Palestine &apos;s state capacities were destroyed by Israel , especially following the second Intifada , Arafat made matters worse by constantly bypassing and eviscerating potential mechanisms of accountability , such as the elected Palestinian Legislative Council . 
He failed to do anything about Palestine &apos;s legacy of four different and contradictory legal systems . 
Moreover , Arafat contributed to the absence of a legitimate monopoly of force by ignoring the semi-autonomous armed actions of his own Fatah-based militia , as well as the Fatah-based Al-Aqsa Martyrs &quot; Brigades , not to mention other groups &quot; armed militias . 
But let us imagine what was unimaginable even a few months ago : a world where the present diminution of conflict holds , and where discussions between Israel and Palestine arrive at a mutually acceptable recognition of each state &apos;s sovereignty . 
To be sure , this is possible only if the United States pushes Israel much harder than it has so far to give Palestine viable borders . 
How might such a world affect prospects for peace and democracy in the Middle East ? 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas desperately wants to construct a functioning state . 
With cessation of Israeli incursions , and large-scale international aid from the European Union , the US , Japan , and some Arab League countries , he could begin to make a plausible go of it . 
With an effective state , and an inclusive and functioning electoral system , Abbas could then disarm his own Fatah-based militia . 
With peace , and the prospect of doing well in July &apos;s parliamentary election , in which it has agreed to participate , Hamas would have powerful incentives to transform itself from an armed movement outside the system into a political party committed to competing for power at the ballot box . 
By disarming any remaining militias , Abbas could claim what Max Weber called the necessary ingredient of any state , namely a &quot; monopoly of the legitimate use of force . &quot; 
Palestine has more elements of a vigorous civil society than virtually any other country in the Arab world , including an active human rights movement , which initially focused only on Israeli abuses , but that has increasingly criticized violations by the Palestinian Authority itself . 
Palestine also has a powerful women &apos;s movement ( Palestine being the first Arab country to give women the vote , in 1946 ) . 
Finally , and ironically , because so many Palestinians have worked in Israel , spent time in Israeli prisons , often speak and read Hebrew , and are regularly exposed to the Israeli media and the rough and tumble of Israeli politics , Palestine has more young citizens than any other Arab country who have observed life in a democracy at first hand . 
So democracy in an independent Palestinian state is possible . 
Lebanon has had regular elections since its civil war ended in 1990 . 
But a country without sovereignty , or control over its domestic politics , does not have a democratically serviceable state . 
Syria , bolstered by the 14,000 troops it stationed in Lebanon , has imposed its choice as Lebanon &apos;s president and otherwise interfered with Lebanese politics . 
So Lebanon cannot be considered electorally competitive . 
With a just and stable Israeli-Palestinian peace , Syria might be forced not only to withdraw its troops , but also to lessen its interference in Lebanese politics . 
Lebanon could return to the democratic track , and Hezbollah might use democratic , not military , politics as its survival strategy in the newly sovereign Lebanon , especially if an international peacekeeping force were consensually allowed to demilitarize the Golan Heights . 
The only two Arab countries ever to recognize Israel were Egypt in 1978 and Jordan in 1994 . 
But this was an asymmetrical peace . 
Both countries recognized Israel , but Israel did not recognize Palestine , and Israel &apos;s construction of settlements on occupied land continued . 
In Jordan and Egypt , protests against the asymmetrical peace led to growing social fragmentation and processes of regime-led domestic de-liberalization . 
A symmetrical peace between Israel and Palestine would , by contrast , incite much less Islamic resistance . 
A symmetrical peace agreement might also contribute to a new dynamic in Jordan and Egypt , namely re-liberalization of society . 
Palestine and its immediate neighbors have their best opportunity in thirty years to produce democratic states . 
They can do so if they seize the current opening , and if the international community intensifies its support for an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict .
