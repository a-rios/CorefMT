Neither Public nor Private 
It began with collecting rubbish . 
Since the 1980s , local communities everywhere have discovered that they could guarantee the service without actually providing it themselves . 
Private companies removed household rubbish more reliably and efficiently than the public service had done before . 
Suddenly there were no delays , no strikes , no bad manners . 
Since then the principle has been applied to many services : traffic wardens and airport security , then railway lines and flight control systems , hospital buildings and even prisons all came to be run by public-private partnerships , or &quot; PPPs &quot; as they are known in the United Kingdom . 
The principle is simple . 
Government guarantees certain services but private agents provide them . 
In this way citizens get what they need , but more efficiently and also cheaper . 
Originally , this was a project of the centre-right ; it was part of the privatisation wave which swept the United States and Europe in the Reagan-Thatcher years . 
Since then , the political left has adopted it and added its own theory . 
Britain &apos;s thoughtful Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown regards PPP as part of a sea change in Labour Party thinking . 
For a century ( he argues ) the left fought private privilege by strengthening the state . 
Now the state has given rise to its own vested , privileged interests which can only be broken by a new combination of public guarantees and private provisions . 
More recently , Mr. Brown extended the PPP principle to comprise not just the provision of services by private companies , but also by a &quot; third , &quot; voluntary or charitable , sector . 
Britain &apos;s &quot; New Deal &quot; to bring long-term unemployed youths into work includes the use of voluntary organisations as a vehicle to future employment . 
Britain &apos;s National Health Service now employs several hundred thousand volunteers . 
In the delivery of development aid NGOs have long played a crucial role . 
To PPPs , public-voluntary-partnerships - call them PVPs - have been added . 
Such developments are not confined to Britain ; examples of this approach can be found everywhere . 
But how can all this work ? 
There is an element of black magic about setting up public-private partnerships and suddenly everything is both cheaper and more efficient . 
But like black magic , the trick leaves room for doubt . 
Two risks in particular have come to the fore . 
The first is that state &quot; guarantees &quot; of services may turn out to cost more than fine promises by ministers . 
What if the partners , whether private or charitable , collapse ? 
The story of Railtrack in Britain is a warning . 
An insolvent company must be bailed out with taxpayers &apos; money . 
As this happens , questions are asked . 
What about the &quot; fat cats &quot; who made fortunes out of the PPP . 
Indeed , what about their not-so-fat shareholders who - in the end - also clamour for compensation from a state that promised much but failed to deliver . 
The other risk is most evident in PVPs . 
Such partnerships turn voluntary associations into 2 
Lured by tax concessions , third sector bodies hitch their destiny to governments and lose their independence . 
This destroys the liberty which defines civil society . 
Above all it adds new strength to governments ; it is centralisation by stealth . 
It could be argued that the same is true for PPPs . 
They create power without responsibility . 
Governments promise all sorts of things and invite , support and guarantee private or not-for-profit agents . 
In this way the state becomes the sole repository of public purposes . 
So is it time to reconsider the magic formula of PPPs and PVPs ? 
Any reversal of this trend seems too early . 
After all , there is much to be said for the principle of reducing the direct involvement of the state in the provision of services . 
Yet a few questions need answers if the principle is to command ongoing acceptance . 
One question is this : where do the limits of private provision for public purposes lie ? 
Many people find private prisons unacceptable . 
There are also those who wonder whether there is not an important difference between the provision of an infrastructure for services and these services themselves - public tracks and private trains as it were . 
More generally , there may well be limits to the usefulness of both PPPs and PVPs . 
Above all , however , the matter of control , of checks and balances has to be resolved . 
In the public sphere , we have democratic institutions to exercise control . 
In the private sphere , corporate governance is increasingly developed into a fairly transparent system . 
The voluntary sector admittedly raises more complicated issues . 
But PPPs fall between the stools . 
Governments can say that they did not have responsibility for the services , and the private providers can say that they merely did what government wanted . 
In the end , not just democracy but the taxpayer may be the victim . 
Democratising PPPs is therefore the next task .
