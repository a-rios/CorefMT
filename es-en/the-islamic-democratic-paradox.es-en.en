The Islamic Democratic Paradox 
The rage across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark ( months ago ) of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed , together with the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of Iran &apos;s politics , has made &quot; political Islam &quot; a fundamental question of international diplomacy . 
But a one-size-fits-all response won &apos;t work . 
Indeed , we need to abandon the idea that there is a holistic or global Islamist movement . 
Political Islam of all colors has emerged as the main alternative to secular Arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy , based on the struggle for national liberation , has evaporated due to their inability to resolve economic and social problems , establish the rule of law , and guarantee fundamental freedoms . 
In Palestine , for example , the Islamists triumphed over Fatah because of years of bad governance under the harsh conditions spawned by Israeli occupation . 
Successive European and American governments share an atavistic fear of the &quot; Islamic alternative &quot; to Arab secular nationalists like Fatah , and so have defended the status quo . 
But repression of all Arab opposition movements by the region &apos;s monarchs and secular dictators meant that &quot; protection of the Mosque &quot; became the only umbrella under which to engage politically . 
Now political Islam can no longer be contained , because democracy cannot be built by driving underground parties that have a strong social base , as was tragically demonstrated in Algeria 15 years ago . 
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to craft a transition that allows Islamists to participate in public life and encourages them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game . 
There are already many examples of more or less conservative Islamist parties that are willing to play along . 
It is no accident that there are Islamists in the legislatures of all the countries undergoing some form of political reform , including Lebanon , where Hezbollah is part of a freely elected government , as well as Jordan and Morocco . 
In Egypt , the Muslim Brotherhood has become a strong force in parliament despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups in last year &apos;s elections . 
In Iraq , free elections have revealed the enormous influence of Islamist currents . 
In Turkey , the transition to democracy led the Islamist Justice and Development Party to power . 
That government has undertaken various important democratic reforms and initiated accession negotiations with the EU . 
These Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda , even though some of the most conservative among them have adopted somewhat similar ideological positions . 
The risk of political transitions that may lead to the victory of Islamist parties is a democratic paradox that Europe and the US must accept if they are to devise inclusive reform policies - in other words , policies that are the polar opposite of the type of democratic imposition practiced in occupied Iraq . 
Indeed , one of the less fortunate consequences of the intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; between the West from Islam , which in turn serves to create a climate favorable to Islamist movements . 
After all , political reform movements in the Muslim world emerged long before the US-led &quot; war on terror , &quot; and reformists were not waiting for the EU to become stronger to press for change . 
These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11 , 2001 , and they will not wait for or depend on the US or the EU to act . 
Nevertheless , the success of Muslim moderates may well depend on how the EU and the US respond to pressure for reform and how they decide to encourage change . 
It is now necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to attain their national goals . 
This depends largely on the new Hamas government and its transformation into a democratic force that respects the rule of law , democracy , and international legality . 
But it also depends on Israel and the international community , which must do all they can to ensure a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Supporting Palestinian democratization does not mean that the international community should not demand that Hamas abandon terror for once and for all , demilitarize , respect the Palestinian constitution , and accept the existence of the state of Israel . 
But it also does not mean supporting sanctions that would hurt the Palestinian people after they have expressed their will democratically . 
This would be a terrible mistake in any effort to consolidate Palestine &apos;s new democracy , with a negative impact in other reforming countries in the Arab world . 
Similarly , accepting the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in public life does not mean giving up on the political and ideological struggle to defeat ultra-conservative , and in some cases totalitarian , conceptions of society . 
Combating racism , promoting tolerance , and respecting the religious sentiments of others does not mean that we need to question press freedom or accept Islamists &quot; demands for censorship , even when real religious sentiments are offended , as in the case of the Danish caricatures . 
Islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically . 
That political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy , which allows all ideas to compete freely with each other . 
Political Islam is a risk , but we can minimize it only by devising intelligent , case-sensitive strategies that promote democracy , not by denouncing the results of democratic choice .
