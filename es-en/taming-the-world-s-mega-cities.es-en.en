Taming the World \ u0027s Mega Cities 
It has recently been suggested that a wall be built around Rio de Janeiro &apos;s notorious shantytowns . 
It would have the same purpose as that infamous wall that once divided Berlin , and the wall that Israel is building to cut itself off from the Palestinian territories : to isolate people . 
In Rio , the people who would be isolated are the denizens of the city &apos;s vast and crime-infested favelas . 
The wall , of course , will never be built . 
Even if it was , the problems of mass urbanization in the twenty-first century will not be solved by such crude methods . 
What the United Nations calls the &quot; century of urbanization &quot; will require creativity and imagination , innovations and not brute brick walls or even more subtle security frontiers . 
Consider São Paulo , the world &apos;s fourth largest city and my home . 
Our past and present is the future for many others . 
Of the world &apos;s six billion people , more than 50 % live in cities and towns . 
Even in a country as big as Brazil , over 80 % of the population lives in urban areas . 
The pace of urbanization is astonishing . 
In 1975 , only 38 % of the world &apos;s population lived in cities ; by 1998 , the rate had grown to 47 % . 
By 2015 , the number will reach or exceed 55 % . 
In 1975 , only 100 cities topped one million in population ; by 2015 , 527 cities will exceed that mark . 
More critically , while there were only two &quot; mega cities &quot; with populations over 10 million in 1960 , and 18 now , some 26 will exist in 2015 . 
The new geography requires new relationships and planning strategies . 
Mega cities put demands on regional economies , peacemaking efforts , and economic and human development . 
Those factors are all the more complicated because of the massive global unbalance that characterizes current urbanization . 
Twenty-one of the mega cities estimated for year 2015 will be in developing and less developed countries , while 80 % of the global cities that play host to decision-making actors are in the northern hemisphere . 
This situation will be aggravated by some of the dangers associated with a global economy led by the financial sector . 
So far , unemployment has become increasingly concentrated in one hemisphere , while income and capital is concentrated in the other . 
The result has been a widening gap between rich and poor , together with a commensurate rise in the type of urban poverty that so bedevils cities like Rio de Janeiro . 
Eventually , the southern hemisphere &apos;s more dramatic urban problems will spill over into mass migration to northern cities . 
Imagine urban geography as an archipelago . 
On its islands live the modern consumers globally connected in their consuming behaviors , computers and abilities to earn sufficiently well to maintain their lifestyles and speedy rhythm . 
Surrounding these islands , however , are oceans of excluded people . 
New York City stands out as a very big island with a small ocean , while in Mumbai , we find a tiny island and a vast ocean . 
This image was very much on my mind when the mayor of São Paulo , Marta Suplicy , asked me to set up a new Strategic Master Plan for our 10.4 million people - a number that grows to 17.4 million when the greater metropolitan area is considered . 
The ten-year plan was prepared in six months and debated for another six months in more than 200 public meetings before being approved by the city council in 2002 . 
The main innovations were based on the perception that urban development is a collective task in which local government should orient and induce private investments to achieve more livable cities . 
With this in mind , we used a new planning tool that allows building rights to drift . 
This means that we can preserve acreage for watersheds , parks , or other environmental or historical sites , but allow property owners to sell and transfer their building rights elsewhere . 
That means the city gets more green space and retains more of its history without halting badly needed construction . 
We also reduced the free building floor area ; but we allowed builders to reach higher up . 
In exchange , they have to contribute to a public fund for housing , environmental , and infrastructure improvements . 
In other words , they have to purchase virtual land from the city . Starting this year , this mechanism is expected to produce $ 40 million annually . 
Moreover , higher density buildings will be near subway stations or other public mass transport . 
We also envisage detailed neighborhood planning aimed at adding more public space . 
Such physical innovations go hand in hand with other initiatives that seek to redistribute the fruits of development . 
These include income distribution programs , special schools in poor sectors that integrate education , cultural and sport facilities , and a recycling system for the 13,000 tons of waste produced daily , thereby creating new working opportunities for street collectors . 
Most importantly , these and other reforms - such as new transportation systems and a public-health system based on family doctors - must be undertaken with the participation of the people affected . 
It is the citizens of urban enclaves who are taking part in establishing budget priorities and counseling government through a decentralized policy of administration . 
These changes are meant to eventually benefit income distribution and to improve the quality of life for all of São Paulo &apos;s residents . 
Many of these innovations , I believe , can be reproduced in other large cities as well .
