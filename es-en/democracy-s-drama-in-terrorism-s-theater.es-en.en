Democracy &apos;s Drama in Terrorism &apos;s Theater 
CAMBRIDGE - President George W. Bush was famous for proclaiming democracy promotion as a central focus of American foreign policy . 
He was not alone in this rhetoric . 
Most US presidents since Woodrow Wilson have made similar statements . 
So it was a striking departure when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified to Congress earlier this year about the &quot; three D &apos;s &quot; of American foreign policy - defense , diplomacy , and development . 
The &quot; D &quot; of democracy was glaringly absent , suggesting a fundamental policy change by President Barack Obama &apos;s administration . 
Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush frequently referred to democracy &apos;s benefits for security . 
They cited social-science research showing that democracies rarely go to war with each other . 
But , more carefully stated , what scholars have shown is that liberal democracies almost never go to war with each other . 
Indeed , it might be that a liberal constitutional culture is more important than the mere fact of competitive elections . 
While free and fair elections are important , liberal democracy is more than &quot; electocracy . &quot; 
Elections in the absence of constitutional and cultural constraints can produce violence , as in Bosnia or the Palestinian Authority . 
And illiberal democracies have in fact gone to war with each other quite recently , as Ecuador and Peru did in the 1990 &quot; s . 
In the eyes of many critics at home and abroad , the Bush administration &apos;s excesses tarnished the idea of democracy promotion . 
Bush &apos;s invocation of democracy to justify the invasion of Iraq implied that democracy could be imposed at the barrel of a gun . 
Democracy came to be associated with its particular American variant , and took on an imperialist connotation . 
Moreover , Bush &apos;s exaggerated rhetoric was often at odds with his practice , giving rise to charges of hypocrisy . 
He somehow found it easier to criticize Zimbabwe , Cuba , and Burma than Saudi Arabia and Pakistan , and he quickly toned down his initial reproach of Egypt . 
There is a danger , however , in over-reacting to the Bush administration &apos;s policy failures . 
Democracy is not an American imposition , and it can take many forms . 
The desire for greater participation grows as economies develop and people adjust to modernization . 
Nor is democracy in retreat . 
Freedom House , a non-governmental organization , listed 86 free countries at the beginning of the Bush years , a total that increased slightly , to 89 , by the end of his term . 
Democracy remains a worthy and widespread goal , which should be distinguished from the means chosen to attain it . 
There is a difference between assertive promotion of democracy and more gentle support . 
Avoiding coercion , premature elections , and hypocritical rhetoric does not rule out a patient policy of economic assistance , quiet diplomacy , and multilateral efforts to support the development of civil society , the rule of law , and support for well-managed elections . 
Equally important to the foreign-policy methods used to support democracy abroad are the ways in which we practice it at home . 
When we try to impose democracy , we tarnish it . 
When we live up to our own best traditions , we can stimulate emulation and generate the soft power of attraction . 
This approach is what Ronald Reagan called the &quot; shining city on the hill . &quot; 
For example , many people both inside and outside the US had become cynical about the American political system , arguing that it was dominated by money and closed to outsiders . 
The election of Barack Hussein Obama in 2008 did a great deal to restore the soft power of American democracy . 
Another aspect of America &apos;s domestic practice of liberal democracy that is currently being debated is how the country deals with the threat of terrorism . 
In the climate of extreme fear that followed the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Bush administration &apos;s tortured legal interpretations of international and domestic law tarnished American democracy and diminished its soft power . 
Fortunately , a free press , an independent judiciary , and a contentious legislature helped to bring such practices into public debate . 
Obama has proclaimed that he will close the Guant√°namo detention facility within a year , and he has declassified the legal memos that were used to justify what is now widely regarded as torture of detainees . 
But the problem of how to deal with terrorism is not just a question of the past . 
The threat remains with us , and it is important to remember that people in democracies want both liberty and security . 
In moments of extreme fear , the pendulum of attitudes swings toward the security end of that spectrum . 
Abraham Lincoln suspended the right of habeas corpus during the Civil War , and Franklin Roosevelt interned Japanese-American citizens during the early days of World War II . 
When some of the more reasonable members of the Bush administration are asked today how they could have taken the positions that they did in 2002 , they cite the anthrax attacks that followed 9 / 11 , the intelligence reports of an impending attack with nuclear materials , and widespread public fear of a second attack . 
In such circumstances , liberal democracy and security are in tension . 
Terrorism is a form of theater . 
It works not by sheer destruction , but rather by dramatizing atrocious acts against civilians . 
It is like jiu jitsu : the weaker adversary wins by leveraging the power of the stronger against itself . 
Terrorists hope to create a climate of fear and insecurity that will provoke liberal democracies to harm themselves by undercutting their quality in terms of their own values . 
Preventing new terrorist attacks while understanding and avoiding the mistakes of the past will be essential if we are to preserve and support liberal democracy both at home and abroad . 
That is the debate that the Obama administration is leading in the US today .
