Going Against Conventional Wisdom 
CAMBRIDGE - When I finished my graduate studies in 1974 , I had the wonderful fortune of doing postdoctoral work with Harvard Medical School &apos;s Judah Folkman . 
Dr. Folkman had a theory that the progression of tumors could be arrested by cutting off their source of nourishment . 
He suggested that tumors emit a substance called tumor-angiogenesis factor , which causes surrounding blood vessels to grow toward it , supplying nutrition and removing waste . 
Folkman hypothesized that this process , angiogenesis , is crucial to the tumor &apos;s survival . 
This theory went strongly against conventional wisdom . 
Scientists who reviewed Folkman &apos;s grants said that the new blood vessels were simply due to inflammation . 
Today , four decades later , such substances have been used to treat more than 10 million people with neovascular diseases such as macular degeneration and many different forms of cancer . 
I had a similar experience when I was working in his lab , trying to isolate the first inhibitors of blood-vessel growth ( which were large-molecular-weight substances ) . 
Given that tumors take several months to grow , biocompatible systems had to be developed that could release proteins and other large-molecular-weight substances slowly and continuously in the body - something that scientists were convinced was impossible . 
However , after two years of work , I discovered that I could modify certain types of polymers to release molecules of virtually any size over a 100-day period . 
For several years , many of the field &apos;s most respected chemists and engineers said that our work had to be incorrect . 
The negative feedback had practical consequences , inhibiting my ability not only to secure research grants , but also to find faculty positions ( especially given the work &apos;s interdisciplinary nature , which made it difficult to fit into a single university department ) . 
Today , systems based on these principles have been used to treat more than 20 million people . 
Another area I started thinking about involved creating new polymer materials . 
Working in a hospital , I saw that almost all polymers used in medicine were derived from household objects . 
For example , the materials used in girdles for women are used in artificial hearts because of their good flex life . 
The polymers in mattress stuffing are used in breast implants . 
Yet such an approach often leads to problems . 
Artificial hearts , for example , can cause clots to form when blood hits their surface - the girdle material - and these clots can cause strokes and death . 
So I began thinking that we needed to find alternatives to solving medical problems other than by searching for materials in everyday settings . 
I believed that researchers could take an engineering-design approach : Ask the question , &quot; What do we really want in a biomaterial from the standpoints of engineering , chemistry , and biology ? &quot; and then synthesize the materials from first principles . 
As a proof of principle , we decided to synthesize a new family of biodegradable polymers , called polyanhydrides , for medical use . 
The first step was to select monomers - a polymer &apos;s building blocks - that would be safe in the human body . 
We then synthesized these polymers and discovered that by changing their composition , we could make them last in the body for a period ranging from days to years . 
With Henry Brem , now the chief of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital , we thought we could use these polymers to deliver drugs locally in the treatment of brain cancer . 
Their reviews were very negative . 
In our first grant proposal , in 1981 , the reviewers said that we would never be able to synthesize the polymers . 
Yet one of my graduate students synthesized the polymers for his doctoral thesis . 
We sent the proposal back for another review , only to be told that the grant should still not be funded , because the polymers would react with whatever drug we wanted to deliver . 
Several researchers in our lab showed that there was no reaction . 
We returned the proposal for another review ; it came back with the comment that the polymers were fragile and would break . 
This time , two other researchers addressed the problem . 
The revised proposal was sent again for evaluation , and now the reviewers &quot; reason for rejecting it was that new polymers would not be safe to test on animals or people . 
Another graduate student showed that the polymers were safe . 
Such reviews continued for a long time ; but , in 1996 , the Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment - the first new treatment for brain cancer to be approved in more than 20 years . 
Moreover , the FDA &apos;s approval of polymer-based local chemotherapy created a new paradigm in the drug-delivery field , helping to pave the way for drug-eluting stents and other local delivery systems . 
Something similar happened when Jay Vacanti , a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital , and I had an idea in the 1980 &quot; s to combine three-dimensional synthetic polymer scaffolds with cells to create new tissues and organs . 
Once again , the idea was met with great skepticism , and it was extremely difficult to obtain peer-reviewed government grants . 
Today , this concept has become a cornerstone of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine , leading to the creation of artificial skin for patients with burns or skin ulcers - and someday , one hopes , to the creation of many other tissues and organs . 
My experiences are hardly unique . 
Scientists throughout history have often had to fight conventional wisdom to validate their discoveries . 
In modern times , Stanley Prusiner &apos;s discovery of prions , Barry Marshall and Robin Warren &apos;s findings that bacteria can cause peptic ulcers , and Dan Shechtman &apos;s determination of the structure of quasicrystals are just a few examples ( all received Nobel Prizes for their research ) . 
The lessons are simple to understand , if difficult to master : Don &apos;t believe everything you read , be willing to challenge dogma , and recognize that you may pay a price for it career-wise in the short run , even if you are correct .
