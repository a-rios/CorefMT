The Snowden Effect 
MADRID - The continued leaking of classified information by the former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has provoked heated debate about privacy and international law , which , unfortunately , has overshadowed the geostrategic dimension of his actions . 
In fact , Snowden &apos;s revelations about US surveillance programs , and his own ongoing struggle to avoid extradition , reveal much about President Barack Obama &apos;s conception of US foreign relations . 
More than any other incoming American president in recent memory , Obama raised expectations worldwide . 
Yet he has proved to be mainly , if not solely , interested in domestic issues , resulting in a foreign policy of reaction . 
The Snowden affair highlights three elements of this : US-Russia relations , US influence in South America , and US relations with Europe . 
The Kremlin &apos;s handling of the affair is indicative of the tense state of US-Russia relations . 
In the aftermath of the bilateral relationship &apos;s ill-fated &quot; reset , &quot; Russia has been eager to maintain its global position as a foil to the US , causing many people on both sides to revert to a Cold War mentality . 
By falling into this trap , the US has provided President Vladimir Putin with endless fodder to score political points and solidify his domestic position . 
Putin regards anti-Americanism as an effective tool for short-circuiting domestic discontent . 
Developments like the US Congress &apos;s enactment of the Magnitsky Act , portrayed in Russia as an American provocation , have allowed the Kremlin to rally support at home with retaliatory measures such as a ban on foreign adoptions , while providing cover for a crackdown on domestic opponents . 
Following the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011 , which the Kremlin regarded as another example of Western overreach , Russia has been more aggressive in asserting itself internationally , mainly in opposition to the US . 
This is most obvious in Russia &apos;s dogged support for Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime in Syria . 
And Russia &apos;s refusal to hand over Snowden , under the pretext of strict adherence to the law , has allowed Putin to poke Obama in the eye once again - this time while posing as a defender of legality and human rights . 
This coup de théȃtre was magnified by Putin &apos;s cynical claim that Russia would allow Snowden to stay only if he stopped leaking information &quot; aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners . &quot; 
Presumably , Putin would not object to the infliction of such damage behind closed doors , during a debriefing with the Russian security services . 
Moreover , the Snowden affair reinforces the perception that the US is losing its sway in South America . 
With few notable exceptions , such as US Ambassador to Brazil Tom Shannon , US diplomacy has lacked a strategic vision for Latin America . 
Barack Obama &apos;s 2008 election created high expectations in this region , too ; but his administration &apos;s approach has been reserved , at best , and often obtuse . 
While China &apos;s influence in Latin America has soared , the US has remained aloof . 
Obama &apos;s visit in May was presented as an effort to reinvigorate relations in the context of the rise of the Asia-Pacific region . 
Unfortunately , the chickens of Obama &apos;s first term have already come home to roost . 
For example , the US is far and away Ecuador &apos;s largest trading partner , accounting for more than a third of its foreign trade . 
Yet , facing the possibility that Ecuador might grant Snowden asylum , the US felt the need to scramble , with Vice President Joe Biden personally pleading America &apos;s case to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa , even after Obama announced that he would not engage in &quot; wheeling and dealing &quot; over the extradition . 
The threat by US officials to cut off aid to Ecuador , which would amount to a measly $ 12 million in 2014 , further evinces a clumsy approach . 
America &apos;s traditional sources of influence - its soft power , regional alliances , and financial leverage - appear to be running dry . 
The message to the world is clear : the US is not the regional power that it should be . 
Finally , turning to Europe , Obama &apos;s flippant attitude concerning alleged US surveillance of the European Union and its member states shows that American exceptionalism is alive and well . 
Instead of acknowledging the legitimacy of European concerns , he shrugged them off as a frivolity : &quot; &#91; I &#93; guarantee you that in European capitals , there are people who are interested in , if not what I had for breakfast , at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with their leaders . &quot; 
The US certainly has an interest in gaining deeper analytical insight into its European allies &quot; decision-making than can be gained by simply calling , say , German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
Accepting that spying is realistically part of the US toolkit , we Europeans expect it to be conducted responsibly . 
By dismissing European concerns about how such surveillance is carried out , Obama has demonstrated one of America &apos;s worst habits - that of patronizing Europe . 
In fact , Europeans have raised serious questions about US intelligence practices . 
The bitter irony is that , at this suddenly inauspicious moment , Europe and the US are launching their most significant joint project since the creation of NATO - a transatlantic free-trade agreement . 
For the sake of its success , is it really too much to ask of the US that it play its part internationally with a bit more skill and professionalism , and that it treat its partners with respect ?
