The Extremists Unbound 
JERUSALEM - The pattern of policymaking in the Middle East , as it was defined since President Bush &apos;s &quot; axis if evil &quot; speech of January 2002 , is undergoing a momentous change of direction . 
Bush &apos;s foreign-policy paradigm of an alliance of &quot; moderates &quot; to defeat the &quot; extremists &quot; - a model too enthusiastically seconded by an unimaginative Israeli leadership and by those Arabs ( led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia ) who dread the forces of radical change - has collapsed . 
The &quot; extremists , &quot; whom Bush expected to be defeated through economic sanctions , diplomatic isolation , and military action , have prevailed . 
It is the &quot; moderates &quot; who must now adapt their policies . 
Israel and the United States failed resoundingly in their attempt to dislodge Hamas from Gaza , or in forcing it to accept conditions for an end to the international boycott . 
Fearing the costs of an invasion of Gaza &apos;s urban alleys , Israel handed a strategic victory to Hamas . 
It accepted a truce , brokered by an Egyptian government fearful of Iran &apos;s influence in neighboring Gaza , that not only gave Hamas political legitimacy and undermined the international community &apos;s policy of not negotiating with this fundamentalist group , but that also allowed it to continue rearming . 
Indeed , Hamas now poses a strategic threat to Israel &apos;s urban centers and military facilities . 
Israel &apos;s war in 2006 in Lebanon against Hezbollah , supported by the US and the entire Arab &quot; moderate &quot; camp , was no more successful . 
In fact , Hezbollah is now not only militarily stronger than ever - Security Council Resolution 1701 , which called for its disarmament , has proven to be an utter failure - but also more politically robust than before the war . 
Admirably adept at weaving together all of Lebanon &apos;s political , religious , and nationalists threads , Hezbollah &apos;s leader , Hassan Nazrallah , is today the undisputed master of Lebanon . 
The Syrian patron of Hezbollah , President Bashar al-Assad , another member of the &quot; axis of evil , &quot; is also doing well , thank you . 
Not only Israel and the US , but also Egypt and Saudi Arabia have hoped for the political demise of this friend of every radical regional cause - from Hamas and Iran to the anti-Western forces in Lebanon - that they oppose . 
But Assad managed to emerge from Syria &apos;s forced withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 to become the broker without whom a Lebanese government could not be created and a president could not be elected . 
This , and the indirect negotiations with Israel that are now underway in Turkey - which Assad knows cannot produce major results , given Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s political weakness and Bush &apos;s lame-duck status - have helped to open for Syria the gates of Europe , where he had also once been a pariah . 
Moreover , desperate to recover its relevance in Middle East politics , the US has now radically changed its attitude and agreed to a meeting between US Undersecretary of State for Near East Affairs David Welch and Riad Daoudi , Syria &apos;s chief negotiator with Israel . 
America &apos;s drive to force Iran to stop its nuclear program through an ineffective sanctions regime has been no more successful than any of its other schemes to isolate the region &apos;s extremists . 
Indeed , the US has now completely reversed its position of not negotiating with Iran until it stops uranium enrichment . 
The participation of Under Secretary of State William Burns in the European dialogue with Iran , together with plans to station American diplomats in Teheran for the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , represents a momentous shift in America &apos;s policy , and also an indication to Israel to refrain from a military strike . 
Bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan , America is in no mood to open a third front against the Islamic world . 
The consequences of an Israeli attack on Iran &quot; would be extremely stressful for us , &quot; warned Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Michael Mullen . 
With the defeat of his ideologically inspired foreign policy , Bush has finally decided not to remain blind to the benefits of engaging Syria and Iran . 
However isolated within the Arab family the Syrians may be , and however embattled their Iranian allies are , the two countries hold the keys to Middle East stability . 
They are crucial players in Lebanon , they have a role to play in pacifying Iraq , they can influence a change of attitude of powerful and extremely destabilizing non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah , and their leverage on Hamas is vital for the stability of the Palestinian front . 
Engaging Iran is also the only way to stave off a nuclear apocalypse in the region . 
Of course , the overall cooling of political tensions reflects the collapse of another misconception of the Bush administration - that the &quot; axis of evil &quot; is an irrational coalition interested only in spreading evil . 
Pursuing radical goals does not necessarily mean that a country will act irrationally . 
Neither Syria nor Iran - in fact , not even North Korea - has an interest in being the pariahs of the world community , and they fully understand the economic consequences of isolation . 
Their policies are about more than spreading terror and revolution ; they are about promoting negotiable interests . 
They are both mindful of the limits of the politics of destabilization , and they are clearly looking forward to a more dialogue-oriented American administration willing to address their political and strategic concerns .
