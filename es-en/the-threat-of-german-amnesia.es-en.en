The Threat of German Amnesia 
BERLIN - Europe &apos;s situation is serious - very serious . 
Who would have thought that British Prime Minister David Cameron would call on eurozone governments to muster the courage to create a fiscal union ( with a common budget and tax policy and jointly guaranteed public debt ) ? 
And Cameron also argues that deeper political integration is the only way to stop the breakup of the euro . 
A conservative British prime minister ! 
The European house is ablaze , and Downing Street is calling for a rational and resolute response by the fire brigade . 
Unfortunately , the fire brigade is being led by Germany , and its chief is Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
As a result , Europe continues to try to quench the fire with gasoline - German-enforced austerity - with the consequence that , in a mere three years , the eurozone &apos;s financial crisis has become a European existential crisis . 
Let &apos;s not delude ourselves : if the euro falls apart , so will the European Union ( the world &apos;s largest economy ) , triggering a global economic crisis on a scale that most people alive today have never experienced . 
Europe is on the edge of an abyss , and will surely tumble into it unless Germany - and France - alters course . 
The recent elections in France and Greece , together with local elections in Italy and continuing unrest in Spain and Ireland , have shown that the public has lost faith in the strict austerity forced upon them by Germany . 
Merkel &apos;s kill-to-cure remedy has run up against reality - and democracy . 
We are once again learning the hard way that this kind of austerity , when applied in the teeth of a major financial crisis , leads only to depression . 
This insight should have been common knowledge ; it was , after all , a major lesson of the austerity policies of President Herbert Hoover in the United States and Chancellor Heinrich Brüning in Weimar Germany in the early 1930 &quot; s . 
Unfortunately , Germany , of all countries , seems to have forgotten it . 
As a consequence , chaos looms in Greece , as does the prospect of subsequent bank runs in Spain , Italy , and France - and thus a financial avalanche that would bury Europe . 
And then ? 
Should we write off what more than two generations of Europeans have created - a massive investment in institution-building that has led to the longest period of peace and prosperity in the history of the continent ? 
One thing is certain : a breakup of the euro and the EU would entail Europe &apos;s exit from the world stage . 
Germany &apos;s current policy is all the more absurd in view of the bitter political and economic consequences that it would face . 
It is up to Germany and France , Merkel and President François Hollande , to decide the future of our continent . 
Europe &apos;s salvation now depends on a fundamental change in Germany &apos;s economic-policy stance , and in France &apos;s position on political integration and structural reforms . 
France will have to say yes to a political union : a common government with common parliamentary control for the eurozone . 
The eurozone &apos;s national governments already are acting in unison as a de facto government to address the crisis . 
What is becoming increasingly true in practice should be carried forward and formalized . 
Germany , for its part , will have to opt for a fiscal union . 
Ultimately , that means guaranteeing the eurozone &apos;s survival with Germany &apos;s economic might and assets : unlimited acquisition of the crisis countries &quot; government bonds by the European Central Bank , Europeanization of national debts via Eurobonds , and growth programs to avoid a eurozone depression and boost recovery . 
One can easily imagine the ranting in Germany about this kind of program : still more debt ! 
Loss of control over our assets ! 
Inflation ! 
It just doesn &apos;t work ! 
But it does work : Germany &apos;s export-led growth is based on just such programs in the emerging countries and the US . 
If China and America had not pumped partly debt-financed money into their economies beginning in 2009 , the German economy would have taken a serious hit . 
Germans must now ask themselves whether they , who have profited the most from European integration , are willing to pay the price for it or would prefer to let it fail . 
Beyond political and fiscal unification and short-term growth policies , Europeans urgently need structural reforms aimed at restoring Europe &apos;s competitiveness . 
Each of these pillars is needed if Europe is to overcome its existential crisis . 
Do we Germans understand our pan-European responsibility ? 
It certainly does not look that way . 
Indeed , rarely has Germany been as isolated as it is now . 
Hardly anyone understands our dogmatic austerity policy , which goes against all experience , and we are considered largely off-course , if not heading into oncoming traffic . 
It is still not too late to change direction , but now we have only days and weeks , perhaps months , rather than years . 
Germany destroyed itself - and the European order - twice in the twentieth century , and then convinced the West that it had drawn the right conclusions . 
Only in this manner - reflected most vividly in its embrace of the European project - did Germany win consent for its reunification . 
It would be both tragic and ironic if a restored Germany , by peaceful means and with the best of intentions , brought about the ruin of the European order a third time .
