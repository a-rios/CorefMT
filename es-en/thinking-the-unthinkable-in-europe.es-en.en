Thinking the Unthinkable in Europe 
CAMBRIDGE - When Greece was bailed out by a joint eurozone-IMF rescue package back in May , it was clear that the deal had bought only a temporary respite . 
Now the other shoe has dropped . 
With Ireland &apos;s troubles threatening to spill over to Portugal , Spain , and even Italy , it is time to rethink the viability of Europe &apos;s currency union . 
These words do not come easily , as I am no Euroskeptic . 
Unlike others , such as my Harvard colleague Martin Feldstein , who argue that Europe is not a natural monetary area , I believed that monetary union made perfect sense in the context of a broader European project that emphasized - as it still does - political institution-building alongside economic integration . 
Europe &apos;s bad luck was to be hit with the worst financial crisis since the 1930 &quot; s while still only halfway through its integration process . 
The eurozone was too integrated for cross-border spillovers not to cause mayhem in national economies , but not integrated enough to have the institutional capacity needed to manage the crisis . 
Consider what happens when banks in Texas , Florida , or California make bad lending decisions that threaten their survival . 
If the banks are merely illiquid , the Federal Reserve in Washington is ready to act as a lender of last resort . 
If they are judged to be insolvent , they are allowed to fail or are taken over by federal authorities , while depositors are made whole by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . 
Similarly , in case of bankruptcy , federal laws and courts readily adjudicate claims among creditors , and do so without regard to state borders . 
Regardless of the outcome , private debt is not socialized by state governments ( but by the federal government , if at all ) , and does not threaten public finances at the state level . 
State governments in turn have no legal power to abrogate debt contracts vis-Ã -vis out-of-state creditors , and no incentive to do so ( given the help they get from the federal government ) . 
So , even in the throes of a financial crisis , banks and non-financial firms can continue to borrow if their balance sheets are sound , uncontaminated by the &quot; sovereign risk &quot; of their state government . 
Meanwhile , the federal government makes up for a good chunk of the drop in state incomes by transfers or reduced taxes . 
Workers who nonetheless have it bad can move easily to better-performing states without worries about language differences or culture shock . 
Almost all of this happens automatically , without long , contentious negotiations among state governors and federal officials , assistance from the IMF , or calling into question the existence of the United States as a unified political-economic entity . 
So the real problem in Europe is not that Spain or Ireland has borrowed a lot , or that too much Spanish and Irish debt sits on banks balance sheets elsewhere in Europe . 
After all , who cares about Florida &apos;s current-account deficit - or even knows what it amounts to ? 
No , the real problem is that Europe has not created the union-wide institutions that an integrated financial market requires . 
This reflects the absence of adequate political institutions at the center . 
The European Union has taught us valuable lessons over the last few decades : first , that financial integration requires eliminating volatility among national currencies ; next , that eradicating exchange-rate risk requires doing away with national currencies altogether ; and now , that monetary union is impossible , among democracies , without political union . 
It should have been expected that the political side of the equation would take time to fall into place . 
It is easy to blame European politicians for lack of leadership . 
But let us not underestimate the magnitude of the task that European governments took on . 
In fact , the closest analogue to it is America &apos;s own historical experience with building a federal republic . 
As the long American struggle for &quot; states &quot; rights &quot; - and indeed the Civil War - shows , creating a political union out of a collection of self-governing entities is hardly a smooth or speedy process . 
States naturally cherish their sovereignty . 
Worse still , economic union itself can fan the fires of nationalism and endanger political integration . 
It places strains on each country &apos;s institutions ( seen in the pressure on Europe &apos;s welfare states ) , breeds resentment against foreigners ( witness the recent success of anti-immigration parties ) , and renders financial crises originating from abroad both likelier and costlier ( as the current situation makes all too clear ) . 
Alas , it may now be too late for the eurozone . 
It is hard to see how they can achieve both aims while remaining in the eurozone . 
The Greek and Irish bailouts are only temporary palliatives : they do nothing to curtail indebtedness , and they have not stopped contagion . 
Moreover , the fiscal austerity they prescribe delays economic recovery . 
The idea that structural and labor-market reforms can deliver quick growth is nothing but a mirage . 
So the need for debt restructuring is an unavoidable reality . 
Even if the Germans and other creditors acquiesce in a restructuring - not from 2013 on , as German Chancellor Angel Merkel has asked for , but now - there is the further problem of restoring competitiveness . 
This problem is shared by all deficit countries , but is acute in Southern Europe . 
Membership in the same monetary zone as Germany will condemn these countries to years of deflation , high unemployment , and domestic political turmoil . 
An exit from the eurozone may be at this point the only realistic option for recovery . 
A breakup of the eurozone may not doom it forever . 
Countries can rejoin , and do so credibly , when the fiscal , regulatory , and political prerequisites are in place . 
For the moment , the eurozone may well have reached the point where an amicable divorce is a better option than years of economic decline and political acrimony .
