India &apos;s Iraq Problem 
NEW DELHI - Iraq seems to be falling apart , with the rapid advance of the militant Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) threatening to lead to the country &apos;s division into Shia , Sunni , and Kurdish entities , while blurring its border with its turbulent western neighbor . 
Moreover , the tumult is now threatening to spread to two more nearby countries , Afghanistan and Pakistan , which already are facing myriad internal challenges . 
For India , the message is clear : its national security interests are at risk . 
After almost four decades of war , Afghanistan is , once again , teetering on the edge of a precipice . 
Just last week , following allegations of massive fraud during the country &apos;s recent presidential election , thousands of protesters marched on the presidential palace . 
Given that the aggrieved candidate &apos;s constituency comprises mainly ethnic Tajiks , the events have revived Afghanistan &apos;s deep-seated ethnic tensions . 
Pakistan &apos;s internal struggles - from inter-communal conflict to relentless terrorist activity - are well known . 
In fact , the country recently experienced a major terrorist attack , which not only led to more than 29 deaths , but also rendered Karachi &apos;s international airport - the country &apos;s largest - dysfunctional for nearly 12 hours . 
Just a couple of weeks later , gunmen fired at a Pakistan International Airlines plane as it was landing in the northern city of Peshawar , killing one passenger and injuring three crew members . 
Poorly considered American interventions , especially the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , have exacerbated the region &apos;s myriad animosities and security challenges . 
Far from bringing peace to Iraq , the military campaign - carried out on the pretense of eliminating weapons of mass destruction - fueled more violence . 
Unable to stabilize itself , Iraq - which initially demanded that the United States withdraw all of its troops - has been requesting renewed American involvement . 
Will Afghanistan , too , soon be asking the US to return should the Taliban stage an ISIS-like surge ? 
Iraq &apos;s struggle as a unified state is nothing new . 
It began almost exactly a century ago , when the United Kingdom and France created a new map of the Middle East via the Sykes-Picot Agreement . 
The Pakistani journalist Yasser Latif Hamdani has emphasized the imprudence of the British-French approach , which entailed drawing borders that roped in diverse peoples - the consequences of which are starkly apparent in countries like Iraq and Pakistan . 
In this context , as Richard Haass recently pointed out , &quot; the potential for prolonged political-religious wars within and across boundaries , involving both local and foreign forces and militias and governments , is great . &quot; 
Indeed , the region is &quot; unraveling by the hour . &quot; 
The momentum is now with ISIS - an Islamist organization even more extreme than Al Qaeda . 
Though ISIS has often been characterized as a Sunni organization , it is important to note , as Ali Khan Mahmudabad has observed , that the group &apos;s ideology closely resembles that of the radical seventh-century Kharijite sect , which also felt embolden to denounce , and then kill , other Muslims as nonbelievers . 
In any case , the Iraqi army is a defeated force . 
According to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , almost one-quarter of Iraq &apos;s combatant battalions no longer have an &quot; order of battle , &quot; with their equipment lost and their soldiers having abandoned their posts . 
Similarly , US officials say that more than one-third of Iraqi army divisions are &quot; combat ineffective . &quot; 
It is no surprise , therefore , that Iraq has lost control over its border crossings with Syria . 
In fact , the Iraqi government could even begin to lose its grip on its frontier with Jordan in the not-too-distant future , allowing an entirely new set of destabilizing forces to wreak havoc on its territory . 
An Iraqi commander recently summed up the challenge : &quot; We don &apos;t have enough intelligence information ; we don &apos;t have good air coverage ; we are battling very well-trained groups that have good experience in street fights , that are moving fast between cities and villages . &quot; 
The question now is whether the Middle East as we know it will remain intact for much longer . 
After World War I , the British field marshal Archibald Wavell presciently observed that , &quot; After &quot; the war to end war , &quot; &quot; the victors &quot; seem to have been pretty successful in Paris at making a &quot; Peace to end Peace . &quot; &quot; 
He foresaw what now seems obvious : the imposition of artificial arrangements in the Middle East would only engender conflict . 
For India , this uncertainty amounts to a serious security challenge , requiring that it transcend the role of silent spectator . 
After all , India itself is one of the world &apos;s largest Muslim countries , with some 177 million Muslims , both Sunni and Shia . 
With the forces destabilizing the Middle East unconfined by national borders , India simply cannot risk having the growing Sunni-Shia civil war spread to its population . 
The region needs a new security paradigm . 
For its own sake , and the sake of its neighbors , India must take an active role in creating it , and soon . 
Indeed , given China &apos;s growing influence in Pakistan and Afghanistan , this act of diplomatic creation could prove to be a key test of how China views its relations with India . 
The Chinese can decide to cooperate with India and others to forge a new structure of peace for the greater Middle East or , instead , to use the growing risks that India and its neighbors face to pursue small tactical advantages . 
India &apos;s relationship with China may depend on this choice for many years to come .
