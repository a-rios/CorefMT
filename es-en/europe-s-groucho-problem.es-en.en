Europe \ u0027s Groucho Problem 
Groucho Marx once famously quipped that he did not want to join any club that would have him as a member . 
But in today &apos;s European Union , Groucho need not apply . 
The Union now does not want to accept anybody who applies for membership , because the countries queuing up to join are too big or too poor , or both . 
On May 1 , the EU formally admits ten new members , eight from central Europe . 
All are far poorer than the EU average . 
Bulgaria , Romania , and possibly Croatia are supposed to join in 2007 . 
By the end of this year , the EU is to decide whether to open membership talks with Turkey - a country that is not only poor and big , but Muslim . 
If the EU is to talk about membership with Turkey , there is no legitimate reason for keeping out my country , Ukraine ? 
Current EU thinking , however , holds that Ukraine should be placed in the same framework as countries in North Africa and the Middle East . 
The EU &apos;s &quot; Wider Europe &quot; strategy does call for closer ties to Ukraine , and for allowing us increased access to the EU &apos;s &quot; single market . &quot; 
But it does not view Ukraine as a candidate for EU membership , at least not in the foreseeable future . 
One reason for this is that the EU does not want to pick a fight with Russia , which still sees us as its close ally , natural business partner , and as members of an enlarging Russian-led economic zone . 
Indeed , last week Ukraine &apos;s parliament ratified a treaty creating &quot; a single economic space &quot; with Russia . 
But this supposed free-trade zone seems more like a recipe to enrich oligarchs and stifle competition , not promote trade . 
Of course , Russia won &apos;t look on happily if the EU tries to lure Ukraine . 
But membership in the EU does not mean estrangement from Russia . 
Besides , excluding Ukraine from eventual EU membership will encourage Russia &apos;s imperial ambitions . 
This will diminish Russia &apos;s chances of ever becoming a full democracy , for it can rule an empire only as a militarized state . 
It is the mark of a good club that people clamor to become members . 
An ever-larger EU including Ukraine would create a political unit with a huge population , furthering the Union &apos;s ambitions to be a global power . 
As the latest round of enlargement proves , the EU is very effective at molding the governance and behavior of would-be members . 
Preparations for EU entry strongly motivated the eight former communist Central European states to entrench or restore democratic institutions and market economies . 
The further Europe export its laws and values , the more it expands a zone committed to peaceful , democratic , and prosperous co-existence . 
A country equipped to join the EU is a country equipped to make its way in the world peacefully , if it chooses to do so . 
Europe needs such countries on its border . 
So far , the Union &apos;s actions have achieved the opposite . 
For example , three years ago Ukrainians crossed the border with Poland six million times . 
Most were small traders buying goods for resale at home , boosting the economy of eastern Poland , the poorest part of that country . 
Others worked cheaply in Poland as cleaners and building workers . 
As a step towards imposing EU border controls and visa rules , Poland began demanding visas from its neighbors . 
Crossings at Polish border stations quickly fell by over two thirds . 
Thus the new EU border with Ukraine is making its presence felt in the most negative way imaginable - by hurting business on both sides of the border . 
In the EU , only Poland seems to want Ukraine as a prosperous , stable , and accessible neighbor , not as a poor and rickety one with a dodgy democracy and even dodgier nuclear power stations . 
Poland worries that the more Ukraine is shut off from the Union , the more it will fall behind , economically and politically . 
But today &apos;s other EU members view the prospect of an ever-expanding Union to include Ukraine with fatalism and dread , for several reasons . 
The first , inevitably , is money . 
The EU redistributes billions of euros from rich to poor members : more poor members mean more claimants on that purse . 
A second is immigration . 
One of the Union &apos;s fundamental principles is that there should be freedom to move from one member country to another . 
But anti-immigration parties are gaining ground across western Europe ; they could make huge political capital out of potential Ukrainian membership . 
There is also a feeling that a larger EU might simply be unable to function . 
Manufacturing plausible-sounding objections to Ukrainian membership is easy . 
We are not really European , we are too poor , we are too different . 
But the Union has consistently rejected the idea of insisting on a minimum income level for members . 
Its only serious economic demand - rightly so - is that members should have a &quot; functioning market economy . &quot; 
As for whether we are European , I submit that Balzac would never have asked that question during the years he lived here . 
Where Europe , Russia , Ukraine , Moldova , and Belarus rub up against one another , an economic fault line is forming . 
What the EU does now to bridge this fault line will determine whether these countries westernize or stagnate . 
The dream of a Europe free and whole , from the Atlantic to the Urals , remains to be completed .
