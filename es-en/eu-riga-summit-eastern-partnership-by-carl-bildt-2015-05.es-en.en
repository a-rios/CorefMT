Staying the Course in Europe &apos;s East 
STOCKHOLM - As the European Union &apos;s leaders gather in Riga for a summit with the six members of the EU &apos;s &quot; Eastern Partnership , &quot; many recall the dramatic meeting in Vilnius of November 2013 . 
It was there that Ukraine &apos;s then-president , Viktor Yanukovych , under heavy Russian pressure , refused to sign the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement that had been negotiated from 2007 to 2012 . 
Of course , when Yanukovych returned home , he had to face thousands of protesters in Kyiv &apos;s Maidan ( Independence Square ) . 
Yanukovych , failing to crush them with his security forces , simply fled . 
Russia &apos;s behavior in Ukraine since then has made the Eastern Partnership more important than ever . 
The Eastern Partnership was launched in 2009 on the initiative of Poland and Sweden , where I was the foreign minister at the time . 
The aim was to respond to the desire of Armenia , Azerbaijan , Belarus , Georgia , Moldova , and Ukraine for some of the instruments of integration that had helped transform the Central European and Baltic countries into the democracies - and now EU members - that they are today . 
The Eastern Partnership was also seen as a way to balance the EU &apos;s &quot; Russia first &quot; approach . 
Enormous resources had been invested in the relationship with Russia , but very little had gone into helping the countries in the neighborhood that the EU and Russia share - including the most important of these neighbors , Ukraine . 
Until 2013 , the EU &apos;s Eastern Partnership seemed to raise no concerns in the Kremlin . 
It was never brought up at any of the numerous high-level bilateral meetings , nor at any meeting in which I participated . 
The Kremlin probably regarded it as irrelevant . 
That changed after Vladimir Putin returned to Russia &apos;s presidency in 2012 . 
His main geopolitical project was now the creation of the Eurasian Union , which he knew could not succeed without forcing Ukraine off of its EU path and into his embrace . 
While the EU &apos;s vision of &quot; wider Europe &quot; relies on soft power , economic integration , and long-term institution building , Putin &apos;s &quot; wider Russia &quot; policy depends on intimidation and violence . 
The EU pursues long-term geo-economics , whereas the Kremlin plays short-term hardball geopolitics . 
That is why , soon after Yanukovych decided to flee to Russia , Putin &apos;s &quot; little green men &quot; began to appear openly in Crimea , while Russian Buk anti-aircraft missiles and Russian battalion battle groups appeared in Ukraine &apos;s eastern Donbas region not long after . 
In annexing Crimea and stoking separatist violence in Donbas , the Kremlin &apos;s aim has clearly been to destabilize Ukraine in order to bring it under Russia &apos;s thumb . 
Indeed , the very notion of an independent Ukrainian state is openly questioned by Russia &apos;s leaders , Putin included . 
In Riga , the EU &apos;s leaders will reaffirm the so-called deep and comprehensive free-trade agreements concluded with Ukraine , Moldova , and Georgia . 
The most important signal will be the EU &apos;s pledge that these agreements will take effect . 
Despite massive propaganda , intense economic pressure , and overt military aggression , the EU can and will stay the course in its Eastern Partnership and its offers to its neighbors . 
Clearly , no one in Europe should underestimate the challenges ahead . 
When I left the Vilnius meeting in 2013 , I could certainly see storm clouds gathering , but I did not know that Putin was prepared to unleash so much aggression and turmoil . 
Now we in Europe have every reason to prepare for the long-term effort needed to help our neighbors along their chosen paths . 
But this will require a greater European commitment , both politically and economically , than we have seen thus far . 
Ukraine has been misgoverned for decades , and it will have to pass through a valley of reform-induced tears before it starts to reap the benefits of association and integration with the EU . 
Unfortunately , it is far easier for Russia to fuel short-term volatility than it is for Europe to help build long-term stability . 
But to allow the Kremlin and its proxies to succeed would not only undermine the Eastern Partnership countries ; it might jeopardize peace in Europe itself . 
After all , the appetite grows with eating , which might well apply to the Kremlin &apos;s &quot; wider Russia &quot; strategy . 
At some point , the risk of an open confrontation between NATO and Russia could grow . 
Even China , as it poses as Russia &apos;s friend and patron , should consider the consequences for itself of such a risk . 
Such a clash must be prevented . 
By confirming the Eastern Partnership agreements , the EU &apos;s leaders will demonstrate that they are not prepared to acquiesce in a new Yalta-style division of the continent that would deprive these countries of their right to choose their own destiny . 
The Riga meeting is unlikely to produce any headline-grabbing new initiatives . 
But none is needed . 
With everything from massive disinformation to tanks and soldiers thrown against the Eastern Partnership since 2013 , just staying the course is a powerful sign of success . 
And , in the interest of long-term stability across Europe , that should be welcomed - even in Putin &apos;s nationalistically aroused Russia .
