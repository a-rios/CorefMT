Why Pick on BNP Paribas ? 
CAMBRIDGE - To Europeans with whom I speak , the $ 8.9 billion fine imposed on the French financial-services company BNP Paribas for violating American sanctions against Cuba , Iran , and Sudan seems excessive . 
Yes , BNP did something seriously wrong . 
But $ 8.9 billion ? 
Isn &apos;t that extremely disproportionate for an otherwise highly responsible bank ? 
French President Fran√ßois Hollande asked US President Barack Obama to intervene to have the fine reduced , as did the European Union &apos;s commissioner for the internal market and services , Michel Barnier . 
The fine is indeed much higher than those levied before . 
Hefty fines for currency-trading violations are not new ( HSBC , for example , was hit with a $ 1.9 billion fine in 2012 ) ; but a fine close to $ 10 billion is . 
Three factors , not all of which are being discussed , seem to explain the size of the penalty . 
First , BNP &apos;s infraction was part of a pattern of deliberate and repeated behavior . 
Second , the settlement came at a time when the American authorities faced heavy criticism for being soft on big banks during and after the 2008 financial crisis . 
Finally , and more speculatively , the United States &quot; effort to make finance a more efficacious foreign-policy tool could have affected its treatment of BNP . 
On the first issue , European businesspeople and media organizations need to appreciate fully how US prosecutors of financial crimes think . 
Once an investigation shows clearly that wrongdoing has occurred , the authorities expect the target to come clean , cooperate , and restructure the firm to ensure that the infractions do not recur . 
But BNP continued the banned transactions and knowingly sought to cover its tracks . 
The transfer documentation reportedly was regularly stripped of key details such as the destination of wire transfers , so that the transaction would be harder to investigate and less likely to provide evidence of malfeasance . 
In American corporate criminal actions , the targeted US firm often brings in a prominent figure - a former prosecutor or a former judge - to investigate the behavior and people involved and report to the target &apos;s board of directors . 
The latest example of this practice now in the news is that of General Motors , which hired Anton Valukas , a prominent former prosecutor who examined and reported on the dealings of the failed investment bank Lehman Brothers to the bankruptcy court . 
Valukas &apos;s task for GM was to investigate and report on the company &apos;s faulty ignition switches , which have been linked to 13 deaths . 
The targeted firm then typically fires the most egregious wrongdoers and puts management-control systems in place to reduce the chance that similar problems will arise in the future . 
Perhaps the investigation interprets ambiguity in a way most favorable to the organization and its senior management , but it is understood that the investigation will indeed uncover the core facts and lead to effective reforms . 
Some might view this way of proceeding as moralism , though some of it results from under-staffed , under-funded prosecutors economizing on resources . 
The target pays for its own investigation . 
BNP did not seem to do any of this with gusto ; its investigation did not match the effort made , for example , by GM . 
It did not prevent subsequent violations by implementing effective controls to detect problems . 
The second factor is that BNP &apos;s case came to a head at a time when US prosecutors were being accused of treating banks as &quot; too big to jail , &quot; for fear that pressing charges against them would weaken them too much and thus undermine the real economy . 
BNP just happened to be one of the next banks in line for prosecution and thus found itself in the crosshairs . 
BNP did lobby European authorities to make a too-big-to-jail plea to the US authorities . 
The European authorities made the plea , claiming that the large fine would cripple BNP ; it did not work . 
Finally , bear in mind that the case coincided with the crises in Ukraine and elsewhere , with the major US enforcement action being financial and economic sanctions on Russia , the largest of which are still being threatened . 
Recall BNP &apos;s transgressions : the US barred financial transactions with Sudan , Iran , and Cuba through banks that touched US soil ( or the US dollar ) in their dealings . 
Most banks complied . 
BNP did not , engineering secret transactions involving all three countries . 
At a time when the US is reluctant or unable to project military might to back up its foreign-policy goals , it is seeking to use financial might as a surrogate . 
The effort might induce a financial backlash in the future , but BNP &apos;s problems emerged when effective sanctions were at the forefront of policymakers &quot; minds - and , one suspects , not absent from prosecutors &quot; minds . 
If the US is to make its financial weaponry an effective foreign-policy tool , big banks cannot blithely proceed to do what US authorities have prohibited . 
It would take only a few noncompliant banks to render financial sanctions ineffective . 
And it is difficult to detect which banks are not complying and to what extent . 
So when one miscreant is discovered , the enforcement authorities hit it hard , to signal to others that , while they might not get caught , the financial penalties will far exceed the limited benefits of disobeying the government &apos;s foreign-policy edicts . 
This general move for criminal enforcement - greater penalties to account for the difficulties of detection - is a standard prosecutorial move in the US and around the world . 
Thus , European critics of the fine imposed on BNP Paribas are right to emphasize its disproportionate nature . 
What they overlook is that this was precisely the point .
