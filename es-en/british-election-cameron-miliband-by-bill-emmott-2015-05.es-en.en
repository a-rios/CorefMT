Britain &apos;s Silent Election 
LONDON - Other people &apos;s elections are usually baffling and boring , which is certainly true of the United Kingdom &apos;s coming vote on May 7 ; indeed , many Britons share the sentiment . 
The longest election campaign in UK history has been strikingly short of focus . 
Nonetheless , the campaign contains three important pointers for other Western democracies . 
The first pointer is that Bill Clinton &apos;s famous campaign slogan from 1992 - &quot; It &apos;s the economy , stupid &quot; - is itself stupid , or at least insufficient . 
If it was the economy that would decide Britain &apos;s election , Prime Minister David Cameron would be leading a much more confident campaign . 
For the past 18 months or so , the UK has had Europe &apos;s fastest-growing economy , and at times has even outpaced the United States . 
The unemployment rate , now 5.6 % , has fallen to less than half that of the eurozone . 
But favorable economic indicators have made little difference to the standing of Cameron &apos;s Conservatives in opinion polls , and have done nothing to save their coalition partner , the centrist Liberal Democrats , from a severe slump . 
Too many voters , it seems , still do not feel better off , and for good reason : average incomes have barely begun to rise , following seven painful years . 
So the right slogan in this campaign might be , &quot; It &apos;s the living standards , stupid . &quot; 
Either way , the point is straightforward : statistical recovery is not enough . 
This seems to be why , although it has only a small lead of 2-4 percentage points in the polls , the center-left Labour Party has had the best of the campaign . 
Labour &apos;s leader , Ed Miliband , was widely derided last year as weak , unconvincing , and unlikeable ; but , perhaps benefiting from low expectations , he has looked steadily more credible and statesmanlike as the campaign has gone on . 
The second pointer is that foreign affairs , though rarely a major factor in any country &apos;s national elections , can contribute to a general sense of unease about political leadership . 
It had been widely assumed that the UK &apos;s continued membership in the European Union would be a leading campaign issue , given the rise of the UK Independence Party and Cameron &apos;s pledge that , if re-elected , he would hold a referendum on the question by 2017 . 
Indeed , Cameron &apos;s promise is arguably the most consequential issue at stake in the British election : if he remains Prime Minister , there will be a referendum ; if Miliband takes over , there will not be . 
Britain &apos;s strategic future rests on this choice . 
Yet there has been near-silence on this choice . 
Both UKIP and its charismatic leader , Nigel Farage , have slipped in opinion polls and have struggled to get attention . 
More important , Cameron has said almost nothing about either Europe or immigration ; and , though Miliband &apos;s clearly stated pro-EU stance has endeared his candidacy to many business leaders , he , too , has played down the issue . 
Perhaps this reflects my own bias , but I suspect that this evasiveness on the part of Britain &apos;s main political parties has weakened support for them , by diminishing their status as valid representatives of the country . 
Voters may not list Europe or foreign affairs among the main issues that concern them . 
And yet Britain &apos;s defense forces are weaker than at any time since the 1930s . 
The general perception is that Britain &apos;s voice in international affairs is less influential than at any time since then , too . 
Whatever voters think Britain &apos;s foreign and defense policy should be , they believe their country should have one . 
The final pointer of the UK election may partly reflect the vacuum in national leadership that such silence epitomizes . 
Whatever the result of the election , the most striking phenomenon will be the rise of regionalism , most notably a surge in support for the pro-independence Scottish National Party ( SNP ) . 
No one can predict whether the SNP might end up in the paradoxical position of joining a coalition with Labour to govern a country that it was campaigning to leave in last September &apos;s independence referendum . 
The party appears to be attracting many people who voted against independence but who want more regional autonomy and a stronger voice for Scotland in the Westminster Parliament . 
The absence of a broader &quot; feel good &quot; factor from economic recovery , resentment of economic inequality , mistrust of national political leaders , and greater faith in localism : these are the main features of Britain &apos;s election campaign . 
Whether or not they make Miliband the next prime minister ( in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats , the SNP , or both ) , they are likely to characterize elections elsewhere as well in the years ahead .
