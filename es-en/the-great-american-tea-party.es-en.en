The Great American Tea Party 
NEW YORK - Who were those flag-waving , cheering , hollering , singing , and praying Americans who gathered in Washington DC on the last Saturday in August at a rally to &quot; restore the honor &quot; of the United States ? 
This tax-free jamboree of patriotism was ostensibly non-partisan ( otherwise it could not have been tax-free ) . 
The main organizer and speaker was Glenn Beck , the right-wing populist radio and TV personality , who promised to restore not only the nation &apos;s honor , but &quot; American values , &quot; too . 
The other star was Sarah Palin , the darling of the populist Tea Party crowds , who began by paying her respect to Martin Luther King , Jr . 
For it was here , on this very same spot and date , that he gave his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech in 1963 . 
She then quickly proceeded to give a long celebratory speech about the heroism of US soldiers &quot; fighting for freedom &quot; abroad . 
It seemed an odd - and to many offensive - transition : from King &apos;s great plea for civil rights to Palin &apos;s sentimental clich√©s about the military . 
But then there was something odd about the entire event , just as there is something odd about the Tea Party movement itself . 
This latest surge of American populism is financed by some extremely wealthy men , including a couple of oil billionaires named David and Charles Koch , who favor cutting taxes for the super-rich and abolishing government subsidies for the poor , such as Social Security and President Barack Obama &apos;s health-care plan . 
This agenda might seem selfish , though understandable from the point of view of an oil billionaire . 
But who are all those people wildly cheering for the billionaire &apos;s dream , on of all days the anniversary of Martin Luther King &apos;s speech ? 
They are almost uniformly white , largely middle-aged and above , and for the most part far from wealthy . 
The majority have no college degree . 
Many say that they are afraid of losing their jobs . 
No doubt quite a few of them would have trouble paying the astronomical costs of American health-care bills without government assistance . 
In other words , they would benefit from the publicly financed programs that the Tea Party &apos;s sponsors wish to abolish . 
And yet , there they are , denouncing as &quot; socialism &quot; Obama &apos;s health-care legislation , or a slight tax increase for the richest 1 % of the population . 
To them , &quot; socialism &quot; means &quot; European , &quot; or simply &quot; un-American . &quot; 
Unlike the movement &apos;s sponsors , the crowds chanting &quot; USA ! 
USA ! &quot; do not appear to be motivated by economic self-interest . 
It is possible that many Americans are still so convinced that anyone who works hard will end up rich that they will support anything that favors billionaires . 
But it is more likely that the grassroots of American populism are motivated by something else . 
Populism everywhere is driven by fear and resentment : fear of being powerless , without status or privilege , and resentment of those - educated liberal elites , foreigners who supposedly take our jobs , and Muslims , Jews , blacks , or illegal immigrants - who seem to enjoy undeserved benefits . 
These fears and resentments exist everywhere , now more than ever . 
But they are not expressed in the same way in every country . 
Rural Americans , living on the vast plains , uprooted and isolated from the outside world , have a history of expressing their longing for community and mystical identity by gathering in large numbers in churches and tents , listening to the grand statements of charismatic hucksters . 
Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck are heirs to a long line of preachers and politicians who made their fortunes by stirring up anxious crowds , promising them Heaven on Earth , or at least a place in Heaven . 
In the case of Beck &apos;s rally in Washington DC , the link with history of rural churches and religious &quot; revival &quot; meetings was overt . 
America , after &quot; wandering in darkness ... today begins to turn back to God , &quot; Beck declared , in the typical style of a TV evangelist . 
Part of such rabble-rousers &quot; stock-in-trade is to conflate patriotism , freedom , and God . 
This is the myth of the US , the God-blessed land of the free . 
Underlying Beck &apos;s &quot; non-partisan &quot; preacher &apos;s talk about restoring American honor and values was a message that everyone in the crowd understood : such un-American elements as the liberal elites in New York and Washington , Democrats , and other God-less socialists had robbed America of its honor and values . 
After the event , Beck gave an interview , in which he criticized Obama - not for his tax policies , but for having the wrong religious beliefs . 
Obama , he said , believes in &quot; liberation theology , &quot; which means that he must be a &quot; socialist , &quot; thus un-American . 
This is also what Palin means when she tells her Tea Party crowds that they are the &quot; real Americans , &quot; implying that all Americans who disagree with her views are not . 
They are aliens who have no right to govern the nation . 
The success of the Tea Party movement has made many Democrats ( and some sober Republicans ) nervous . 
There are calls for the Democrats to fight back . 
This is not impossible . 
Democratic politicians have a populist tradition , too . 
Talk of God , freedom , and nation is not unique to right-wing radicals or Republicans . 
Franklin D. Roosevelt knew how to inspire the patriotism of working men . 
John F. Kennedy was good at selling the American dream . 
Lyndon B. Johnson had the common touch of rural Texas . 
Barack Obama is from urban Hawaii but has all the rhetorical gifts of an old-fashioned preacher . 
Alas , he has several distinct disadvantages , too : he was educated at two elite universities , his middle name is Hussein , and his father was black . 
Any one of these would be a handicap at a time of rising populism , but the combination of all three is lethal . 
The Tea Party movement - an economic agenda for the rich masquerading as the salvation of God-fearing white Americans - knows that all too well .
