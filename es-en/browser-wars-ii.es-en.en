Browser Wars II 
PRINCETON - Ten years after its birth , Google is threatening to re-open the &quot; Browser Wars &quot; of the 1990 &quot; s , when Microsoft &apos;s Internet Explorer eliminated its rival , Netscape &apos;s Navigator . 
This time , however , it is Google &apos;s Chrome that promises to transform the economics underlying the entire software industry , and not only because of its technical innovation in linking very different kinds of software to an Internet browser . 
In doing so it eliminates the need for a program such as Windows , which previously controlled access to every kind of software . 
Google &apos;s new technology is impressive , and will no doubt prove convenient for many consumers once the initial security problems are resolved . 
But the fundamental innovation lies elsewhere . 
Chrome is a breakthrough because it offers a completely novel approach to a dilemma created by the legal and regulatory regime of competition policy in the world &apos;s two major legal jurisdictions , the United States and the European Union . 
Between 1995 and 1997 , Explorer almost completely eradicated Navigator , although Navigator had initially opened up the World Wide Web for most users and its dominance appeared unassailable . 
The major advantage of Explorer was not so much a technical one , but rather that Microsoft &apos;s Windows provided the operating software for the overwhelming majority of personal computers . 
As a result , an Internet browser - and , indeed , other media software - could be integrated into the Windows framework as an entire software package . 
The ability to have operating systems and software bundled together made life much easier for the average consumer . 
You simply got everything you wanted ( and probably much more ) with the purchase of a computer . 
Microsoft &apos;s critics have complained endlessly about this , claiming that the browser &apos;s integration into the operating system drove out inherently superior software solutions . 
For instance , many users preferred the word-processing program WordPerfect to Microsoft &apos;s Word , but the ease of having a bundled solution meant that Word had the advantage of being used more widely , and thus drove its rival into extinction . 
Microsoft &apos;s advantage , and its business model , goes back to another protracted legal struggle . 
Computer software was originally not a commodity to be bought , but a service . 
IBM built up a massively dominant position because it leased a carefully custom-designed and individualized package . 
It did not sell anything , computers or software . 
IBM &apos;s leasing model seemed to challenge the entire legal philosophy of US competition policy that was established in the New Deal era . 
President Franklin Roosevelt had originally wanted to control American business by setting price levels , but when the US Supreme Court rejected this approach , his administration started to use competition policy to challenge the positions of market-dominant companies . 
Competition policy , however , faces great difficulty in dealing with industries in which technical breakthroughs can create apparently instant monopolies . 
In line with the philosophy of challenging dominant positions , the US Department of Justice in 1969 started a major investigation of IBM , which had just revolutionized business computing with its 360 line . 
The case dragged on until it was dismissed in 1982 as being &quot; without merit . &quot; 
But so long as the anti-trust case remained a threat , IBM was nervous , and began to back away from its business model . 
Microsoft &apos;s current position is a direct outcome of the old anti-trust case pushed against IBM . 
When IBM launched its personal computer , it could easily have bundled it together with its own operating software , and in this way maintained its dominance . 
But , worried that the US authorities would accuse it of attempting to control a new market , IBM left the Disk Operating System ( DOS ) for the new PCs to a tiny new company that no one saw as a threat : Microsoft . 
Of course , Microsoft ran into its own legal troubles when it took over IBM &apos;s former dominant position , waging long drawn-out court cases on both sides of the Atlantic . 
The EU , which has looked increasingly to the US model for competition law , began proceedings against Microsoft in 1993 . 
The US started only after Microsoft &apos;s victory in the browser wars , with a case beginning in 1998 . 
Initially , both cases went decisively against Microsoft , with a US ruling in 2000 that would have required the company &apos;s break-up , although this was subsequently overturned on appeal . 
Google &apos;s position is so interesting and so powerful because the legal philosophy that challenges any ascendant position , even in an industry that seems naturally to produce monopoly , remains in place . 
Leasing software and hardware , as IBM initially did , is problematic . 
But so is selling computer services on a one-time basis , in the manner of Microsoft . 
By contrast , on the face of it , there cannot be anything wrong with offering services or products for free , and then simply using the resulting advertising possibilities . 
Google &apos;s model is a neat example of what might be termed &quot; post-modern economics . &quot; 
The amazing story of technical innovation is that it was , and remains , hard for innovators to benefit from radical technological breakthroughs . 
Industrial Revolution-era cotton makers in England did not make a great deal of money , even though their products revolutionized personal life and hygiene , and even extended life expectancy . 
In our own time , air travel has become much cheaper , but airlines lose money ; telephoning is no longer unaffordable , but the telecommunications companies lost fortunes by over-bidding for mobile telephony rights . 
Google has taken the logic of loss-making technology to its ultimate culmination of not charging at all for its product .
