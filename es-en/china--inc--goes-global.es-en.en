NEW YORK - China &apos;s economy is now taking its next great leap forward : parts of its manufacturing sector are now moving up the value-added chain and out of the country . 
The China challenge is now a global one . 
The reasons are not difficult to fathom . 
Production costs ( wages , office rents , land , capital , etc . ) in China &apos;s coastal provinces - where most of the country &apos;s manufacturing and service production , as well as foreign direct investment , are located - have been rising fast . 
Since last year alone , minimum wages in nine of twelve coastal provinces ( including Beijing ) rose by an average of more than 21 % . 
At the same time , the renminbi is appreciating , making domestic production of export-oriented goods and services even more expensive . 
This matters , especially for labor-intensive activities ( ranging from toy manufacturing to data-entry services ) , whether by affiliates of foreign multinational enterprises ( which account for more than half of China &apos;s exports ) or by local firms , which are losing competitiveness in international markets . 
To maintain its export-oriented production base , output must move up the value-added chain , toward more sophisticated products . 
Multinational enterprises can do that within their integrated global production networks , which allow them to organize an international intra-firm division of labor . 
Any part of these production chains can be located wherever it suits the firms &quot; international competitiveness best . 
They are helped in this effort by the rapid deepening of China &apos;s skills and technology base . 
This partly reflects training in foreign affiliates , but the main reason has been the Chinese government &apos;s sustained effort to foster education and training , encourage technology transfers from foreign to domestic firms , and , in particular , to build up research and development capabilities . 
In short , producers of more sophisticated goods and services in developed and emerging-market countries need to be prepared for growing competition from China . 
At the same time , China &apos;s labor-intensive production will increasingly move to countries with lower labor costs - including Bangladesh , India , Indonesia , and neighboring Vietnam ( where Chinese firms have already established about 1,000 affiliates ) , as well as various African countries . 
This process has already begun , and has been supported since the beginning of the last decade by the government &apos;s &quot; Going Global &quot; policy , through which it encourages outward FDI from China . 
The data bear this out : FDI outflows more than doubled in 2008 , to $ 52 billion , from $ 23 billion in 2007 , and rose even further in 2009 ( when world FDI flows collapsed by about 50 % , owing to the Western financial and economic crisis ) , before reaching $ 68 billion in 2010 . 
This development creates new opportunities for other developing countries to reap the trade benefits of inserting themselves into the international division of labor . 
These countries &quot; investment-promotion agencies - indeed , those of all countries , including developed ones - should increasingly target firms in China to lure them to their shores . 
In so doing , they should aim not only for big state-owned companies , but also for the rising number of vibrant , private small and medium-size enterprises in China that can be found in all sectors of the economy . 
But an important caveat is in order : China has a vast interior that is far less developed than the coastal provinces . 
The government is making special efforts to develop these areas in the framework of its &quot; Great Western Development Strategy , &quot; including by building modern infrastructure , promoting high-quality education , supporting science and technology ( all key determinants of the location of production ) , and encouraging investment there . 
As a result , firms based in the coastal provinces that have to move their production ( and see no need to diversify away from China ) can choose to relocate to China &apos;s interior , rather than going abroad . 
The pattern is clear : this sort of transition away from labor-intensive manufacturing happened before in today &apos;s developed countries , when firms headquartered in Europe , Japan , and the United States moved production to developing countries . 
In Asia , Hong Kong , South Korea , Singapore , and Taiwan were ( and have been ) among the beneficiaries . 
When costs for labor-intensive goods and services became too high in these countries , production was shifted elsewhere . 
This relocation of manufacturing has since been accompanied by the off-shoring of services whose information-intensive components have become tradable . 
China itself has benefited from today &apos;s open international trade and investment regime , which allows firms to locate production where it is most beneficial for their international competitiveness - and is now beginning to shed labor-intensive industries itself . 
Governments need policies to adapt to this global shift in production . 
They should help their countries &quot; firms to adapt to the departure of some producers by establishing training programs , stimulating innovation , and maintaining or creating a competitive environment that encourages &quot; creative destruction &quot; while providing for a social safety net . 
Likewise , governments that attract the production that was shed elsewhere need to have policies in place that enable them to benefit as much as possible from this global shift , thereby furthering their own economic development .
