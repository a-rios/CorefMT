Europe &apos;s Two Futures 
Europe today presents a contradictory picture . 
It is a land of peace , democracy , and the rule of law . 
It is also a land of prosperity : its economy is competitive , its currency strong , inflation is low , and its standards of living are among the highest in the world . 
Europeans benefit from very high levels of social protection , inexpensive , high-quality education , strict environmental standards , and excellent infrastructure . 
In addition , Europe has unmatched cultural diversity and great natural beauty . 
It all sounds like a utopian dream . 
With its 500 million people and the world &apos;s largest single market , Europe , even if not seen by the world as a real union , is still an economic giant . 
But politically it is a dwarf - and shrinking . 
Ours is a century of large states , and the further rise of China , India , the United States , and Japan will soon make the largest European powers look puny . 
Even today the three largest EU members barely manage to offset Europe &apos;s loss of political weight , much less to stem the tide . 
Without a strong EU , this development will only intensify . 
The world outside Europe is changing rapidly , and it won &apos;t wait for Europeans mired in an agonizing process of self-discovery . 
The alternatives are clear : keep up or be left behind . 
In America , despite the current obsession with Iraq , a strategic view is taking hold that defines the twenty-first century mainly in terms of the triad of China , India , and the US . 
Japan &apos;s role as an American ally is viewed as a given . 
The relationship with Russia is placed somewhere between partnership and renewed rivalry , but Russia is not really seen as a strategic challenge . 
And , in strategic terms , the rest is silence - which applies also to Europe . 
The bottom line for America is that while Europe no longer creates problems , for the foreseeable future , Europe , due to its lack of unity , will not be willing or able to contribute to solving the world &apos;s problems . 
Europe &apos;s involvement in NATO &apos;s efforts to stabilize Afghanistan only emphasizes this ambiguity . 
On the one hand , Europe &apos;s role in Afghanistan is appreciated by the US , but on the other , it also exposes the Europeans &quot; weakness and the Alliance &apos;s limited capabilities . 
While the US political elite has not written off NATO , expectations about its crisis-solving competence are fast being scaled down . 
This view of Europe as a negligible political entity is fully shared in Beijing , Moscow , and New Delhi . 
This is the starting point at which a new generation of leaders is taking over the reins in the EU &apos;s three largest member states . 
Gerhard Schr√∂der , Jacques Chirac , and Tony Blair are history . 
In Germany , the government of Angela Merkel has been in power for one and a half years . 
Nicolas Sarkozy has just assumed the French presidency . 
Gordon Brown will soon take over as prime minister in the UK . 
Within just a few weeks , this trio will be called on to make a vital decision on the future of the EU . 
That decision concerns the Constitutional Treaty and its prospects . 
What the new foundational document is called in the end is a minor point ; what is essential for Europe &apos;s future is that constitutional reform is revived and gives Europe a strong foundation . 
The question , then , is whether the new leaders , as early as next month , succeed in a new effort to adopt the vital institutional reforms that the enlarged Union requires . 
The best way to proceed is to focus on the essentials . 
Part III of the blocked Constitutional Treaty is merely a compendium of the existing EU treaties , which - because these treaties will remain in force regardless of whether they are part of the new document - can be decoupled from the rest . 
Part II of the stalled document , the Charter of Fundamental Rights , can be postponed . 
To be sure , this would be painful because , as the EU bureaucracies gain more authority , the EU &apos;s democratic deficit will widen without clearly defined fundamental rights . 
If Part II is postponed , the European Court will have to define these fundamental rights for the time being . 
This is only a second-best solution , but it is better than nothing . 
Part I of the treaty , however , is indispensable , as is the new voting procedure , with its &quot; double majority &quot; rule balancing the role of the states and the population . 
To reopen this part of the debate , and thus to allow a dilution of its substance , would be a historic failure and a major setback for Europe &apos;s future . 
If this is the price of going ahead with the treaty , it is better to do nothing at all and bide one &apos;s time . 
The stakes are thus very high for Europe in the coming weeks . 
If the substance of the Constitutional Treaty is saved , Europe will increasingly develop into a global player . 
Only then will the transatlantic alliance also have a future . 
To be sure , this process will take time , and there will be other setbacks . 
But the fundamental direction will be correct , and there will be real cause for optimism . 
If , on the other hand , this attempt , too , should fail , or end in a lazy , useless compromise , Europe &apos;s decline will accelerate and transatlantic relations will become increasingly turbulent . 
It is now up to Merkel , Sarkozy , and Brown to prove - despite all the differences that may exist between them - that they understand the challenges that globalization poses for Europe : the EU member states will be able to defend their interests in the world of the twenty-first century only to the extent that the EU itself is strong .
