Europe &apos;s Bad Trade Gamble ? 
PARIS - The start of negotiations for a free-trade agreement between the European Union and the United States - officially called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) - marks a key turning point for EU and world trade . 
It also reinforces both sides &quot; shift away from multilateral trade policy in recent years . 
That might be the right move for America , but it could spell serious trouble for Europe . 
Over the past half-century , the EU , which represents only 7 % of the global population , has managed to maintain an exceptionally strong trade position , despite the rise of emerging markets like China . 
So , while the US and Japan have seen their respective shares of global exports fall , the EU &apos;s share has remained stable , at around 20 % . 
Indeed , EU trade power contrasts sharply with the perception of a weakened Europe . 
Most important , Europe was able to achieve it only by investing heavily in a multilateral trade system through the GATT and then the World Trade Organization . 
And yet , while the EU owes much to the multilateral trade system , since 2006 , it , too , has shifted to bilateralism , scoring its biggest successes with free-trade agreements with Latin America and South Korea . 
An agreement with Canada is now within reach ( though bilateral negotiations with India seem to have stalled , probably because the Indians do not believe that a free-trade agreement would help them much ) . 
Officially , the EU considers a bilateral approach to trade to be perfectly compatible with a return to multilateralism . 
But the facts belie this . 
First , it is clear that bilateralism is growing as multilateralism wanes . 
Since 2008 , when the WTO &apos;s Doha Round of global free-trade talks collapsed , the Europeans have proved unable to bring the US , China , and India back to the multilateral negotiating table . 
More important , they evidently have given up trying . 
This is reflected in the EU &apos;s reluctance to press emerging countries to become parties to the WTO &apos;s multilateral Agreement on Government Procurement , as if it has accepted that this issue can be resolved only bilaterally . 
Moreover , since 2008 , US trade policy has deliberately abandoned multilateralism in order to pursue containment of China via a two-pronged strategy : the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and the TTIP . 
The reason for this change is simple : The US no longer has the power to set the rules of the global trade system , but it considers itself strong enough to work around them . 
The EU partly shares America &apos;s strategic objective here , because it , too , has grievances against emerging powers in terms of market access , compliance with intellectual-property rights , access to government procurement , and subsidies to state companies . 
But Europe must avoid alignment with this new and narrow US trade focus for several reasons . 
First , Europe does not have an Asian strategy or TPP equivalent . 
Granted , an agreement between the EU and Japan would be very beneficial to Europe and would diminish America &apos;s advantages in Asia . 
But if the US concludes the TPP before the Europeans secure an agreement with Japan , the Japanese government &apos;s bargaining power vis-Ã -vis the EU would automatically increase . 
In this sense , for both the US and Europe , agreement with Japan will be the key measure of bilateralism &apos;s success or failure . 
Second , and more fundamentally , the US is a political-military power in addition to being an economic power . 
As a result , its partners &quot; trade calculus will always be shaped by strategic considerations , which are not a factor for them when dealing with Europe . 
This is especially relevant with respect to China . 
The US very clearly wants to check China by raising global trade standards . 
But , if broader geopolitical considerations brought these two countries to an agreement , Europe could suffer . 
Something akin to this happened during the climate-change conference in Copenhagen in 2009 , where the US and China decided to oppose a comprehensive global agreement , effectively dismissing Europe . 
Likewise , the US has no real interest in revitalizing multilateral trade negotiations , because bilateralism is much more effective in extracting concessions from emerging powers . 
Europe has neither the same geopolitical interests as the US , nor , more important , the same means , which implies that it has a greater stake in revitalizing multilateral trade . 
Indeed , the proliferation of bilateral agreements , with their own mechanisms for resolving differences , will inevitably weaken the WTO &apos;s dispute-settlement mechanism , further undermining multilateralism . 
The need to revive multilateralism is all the more important given that EU-US negotiations will likely be difficult and prolonged , owing especially to resistance from European and American regulators . 
European regulators have already decided to tighten conditions for authorizing genetically modified organisms , as if to show US trade negotiators that they will not move easily from cherished positions . 
Now that the TTIP talks have officially been launched , Europe must try to obtain the best terms that it can . 
Above all , the EU must accept that global trade is a merciless political game , played according to a paramount rule : keep all of one &apos;s options open at all times .
