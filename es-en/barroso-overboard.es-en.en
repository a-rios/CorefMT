Barroso Overboard ? 
BRUSSELS - It is time for José Manuel Barroso to start selling himself . 
His chances of being re-appointed as President of the European Commission depend on the case he makes . 
Until the global financial crisis broke , Barroso looked fairly certain to get a second five-year term . 
Now , it is becoming increasingly hard to find diplomats or policymakers who support him . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy is said to have been disappointed by Barroso &apos;s performance during last autumn &apos;s financial meltdown , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel also seems to have fallen silent on the matter of his future . 
No one doubts that Barroso is in an awkward position . 
The European Commission has few powers of its own with which to confront the recession as it spreads throughout the European Union ; most powers belong to the European Central Bank . 
The perceived lack of leadership from the Commission at this time of deepening economic gloom is just the tip of the iceberg . 
The events of recent months have crystallized more deep-seated concerns . 
When Barroso , the former Portuguese prime minister , was awarded the EU post by his fellow heads of government , he appeared to be a dynamic new broom who would sweep away the cobwebs left by his predecessor , Italy &apos;s Romano Prodi . 
Even before the clouds of recession began to gather , Euroskepticism was on the rise , with the Commission blamed , rightly or wrongly , for the EU &apos;s failure &quot; to reach out to the citizen . &quot; 
The job of Commission President is arguably among the most difficult in the world . 
The institution has been in near-imperceptible decline for almost 20 years , thanks to the rise of the European Parliament and the way EU member governments have whittled away its authority while consolidating their own powers as the EU &apos;s true legislators . 
The Commission &apos;s own internal culture of cautiousness and red tape is a constraint that nobody in Brussels much likes to talk about . 
It is not a structure that is conducive to political coups de theâtre , and most of the Commission &apos;s work is the relentless grind of EU regulation and re-regulation . 
For reasons that are now obscure , there is an unwritten rule that Commission presidents must be drawn from the ranks of past or current prime ministers . 
This has in large part accounted for Barroso &apos;s high hopes of getting a second term . 
There was , it appeared , no other credible candidate to challenge him . 
For his part , Barroso is widely seen as having avoided controversy throughout 2008 in order not to risk offending any governments that might have been inclined to block his reappointment . 
That seeming passivity is now his greatest problem . 
France &apos;s presidency of the EU during the second half of 2008 showed that dynamic leadership is a quality widely appreciated by the European public . 
With his sense of showmanship , Sarkozy almost effortlessly eclipsed Barroso when handling the Russia-Georgia crisis in August , followed by the EU &apos;s responses to the autumn crisis of cascading bank collapses . 
The Commission was left on the sidelines . 
What is to be done ? 
France &apos;s successful presidency has intensified doubts about the effectiveness of the Commission and its president , so much so that even in Paris concerns are being voiced that the Brussels executive must somehow be strengthened if it is not to become a mere secretariat . 
EU governments have wanted a pliable Commission , but now the cost could be the death of the &quot; community method &quot; that protects the EU against national frictions . 
Barroso needs to respond to all these doubts . 
If he is to reassure EU national leaders that they should re-appoint him , then he needs to signal that his second term can hold out fresh promise . 
He is good at giving upbeat speeches , but this will not be enough . 
Some sort of plan is needed . 
When he arrived in Brussels in 2004 , Barroso was repeatedly asked whether he had a &quot; big idea &quot; for Europe &apos;s future . 
Back then , he did not need one to be appointed . 
This time , he must produce one if he is to save his skin .
