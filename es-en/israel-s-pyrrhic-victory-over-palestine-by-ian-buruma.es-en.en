The Observer State of Palestine 
NEW YORK - Palestine is no longer an &quot; entity , &quot; but a state - or , to be precise , a non-member observer state of the United Nations , just like the Holy See . 
The Palestinian bid received the support of 138 member countries ( Germany , Britain , and 39 other countries abstained ) , while only seven , including the Marshall Islands , Palau , and Panama , joined the US and Israel in opposing it , leaving both more isolated than ever . 
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was furious ; he called Palestinian Authority ( PA ) President Mahmoud Abbas a liar , and gave permission for 3,000 new Jewish homes to be constructed on occupied Palestinian territory . 
His foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , had already threatened to crush the PA government on the West Bank if the UN vote went ahead . 
But Israel has only itself to blame for what happened . 
Abbas and his prime minister , Salam Fayyad , have been more moderate , and more open to serious negotiations with Israel , than any Palestinian leaders before . 
The Palestinian police have cooperated with the Israelis to contain violence on the West Bank . 
Improving the economy , rather than violent confrontation , has been the PA &apos;s main concern . 
But , by continuing to build settlements on Palestinian land , the Israeli government has undermined the authority of Abbas and his Fatah government almost to the point of impotence . 
More and more Palestinians , fed up with the futility of what is still called the &quot; peace process , &quot; believe that Fatah &apos;s fierce rival , Hamas , the Islamist movement that rules Gaza , has more effective ways to break the current impasse . 
The failure of Abbas &apos;s peaceful methods has made the alternative of violence look increasingly attractive . 
Hamas also emerged as the moral victor after the latest - but surely not the last - military clash . 
Far from intimidating the Palestinians by bombing Gaza and mobilizing troops , the Israelis made Hamas look heroic in its resistance . 
Once again , Abbas looked feeble in comparison . 
This is why he desperately needed his victory at the UN . 
The diplomatic promotion of Palestine offered him a lifeline . 
Did the Israelis really want a resurgence of Islamist violence in Gaza , the potential collapse of peaceful politics on the West Bank , and now the right of a recognized Palestinian state to take Israel to the International Criminal Court for war crimes ? 
If not , why are they so ham-fisted ? 
It appears that Israel is making the same mistake that others have made in the past . 
It has been proven repeatedly that military intimidation of civilians does not break their morale and turn them against their own leaders , however terrible the regime . 
On the contrary , shared hardship usually strengthens the ties between citizens and their rulers . 
So it was in bombed German cities during World War II ; so it was in Vietnam ; and so it is turning out to be in Gaza . 
But there is another way of looking at the situation . 
To call the Israeli government clumsy is to miss the point . 
Israel has few illusions about Palestinians toppling their own leaders . 
In fact , a strengthened Hamas may play into the hands of the Israeli hardliners currently in power . 
They can point to the violent , anti-Zionist , and , yes , anti-Semitic rhetoric of radical Islamists , and argue that no deal with the Palestinians is possible . 
The threat of a large stick is the only language that the natives understand . 
Keeping the Palestinians divided between Islamist revolutionaries and the more business-minded Fatah suits Israeli purposes admirably . 
As long as Fatah keeps things more or less under control on the West Bank , and all Hamas can do is periodically lob missiles across the Israeli border or occasionally blow up a bus , Israel can easily live with the status quo . 
Those Israelis who believe that a two-state solution cannot be achieved feel vindicated ; those who simply do not want two states to coexist are equally well served . 
From the current Israeli government &apos;s perspective , then , the correct strategy is to keep the Palestinian government on the West Bank weak and off balance , without quite bringing it down , and to contain Hamas with periodic displays of military power ( while destroying long-range missiles that can do serious damage to Israel ) . 
Israeli policies are not genocidal , as some commentators , not always free from anti-Semitic animus , like to claim . 
Many Palestinians have been killed under Israeli rule , but their number is not even close to the number of Muslim civilians who are still being tortured , murdered , and maimed by Muslim governments every day . 
Israel is , however , a semi-imperial power , using traditional colonial methods : ruling by proxy , dividing potential rebels , rewarding obeisance , and punishing opposition . 
Colonial history shows that this type of rule is fragile . 
Humiliation is not a firm basis for long-term stability . 
There comes a point when promises of independence no longer convince anyone . 
Fomenting violent resistance by demoralizing those who might still listen to reason is an invitation to disaster . 
The chances of a peaceful settlement vanish . 
Violence is all that is left . 
It is one thing for colonies to blow up on the other side of the world . 
It is quite another if the colony is just next door , and the colonial power is surrounded by countries with limited sympathy for a mess that is largely of its own making .
