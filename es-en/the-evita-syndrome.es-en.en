The Evita Syndrome 
On the day last month that Argentina commemorated the 50th anniversary of the death of Eva Perón , patron saint of the descamisados and of jobs for everyone , the worst unemployment rate in the country &apos;s history , 24 % , was announced . 
Four years of recession and devaluation of the peso , has seen Argentina descend into a veritable economic hell . 
Only a head of household - one third of the population - may draw monthly government assistance equal to $ 1.30 per day . 
This amount cannot begin to cover basic needs . 
More than 19 million people , 53 % of the population , live in poverty . 
The middle class continues to cling to the hope that their savings can be salvaged , but these funds , which are now frozen in the nation &apos;s banks , are unlikely ever to be at anyone &apos;s disposal . 
Under the rule of President Carlos Menem , who rid the country of inflation and opened the economy to the world , Argentina became the darling of international investors and institutions . 
After half a century of stagnation , Menem looked good . 
But Argentina , a society that historically lacked the means to defend itself against authoritarianism , has long been the agreeable victim of populist and autocratic rulers . 
So it was not hard to convince such a nation that &quot; menemismo &quot; was the price that had to be paid to become a member of the &quot; first world . &quot; 
Shopping sprees by the rich and famous became synonymous with popular approval for the corruption , legal impunity , and frivolity that surrounded Menem &apos;s cronies and his sales of state assets . 
The country &apos;s already thin social fabric frayed . 
In the end , shopping sprees could not keep reality at bay . 
After Menem handed over the presidential sash to Fernando De la Rua , Argentina began to unravel : President de la Rua resigned his office well before the official end of his term . 
Four temporary heads of state later , Eduardo Duhalde , a senator and powerful peronista chieftain , is now trying to hold the country together . 
To the three constitutionally established branches of government ( executive , legislative , and judicial ) , a fourth power has been added : the provincial governors , the &quot; barons of peronismo . &quot; 
Determined to carry on as they always have , no matter what , the governors turn a deaf ear to the IMF and resist instituting fiscal reforms . 
Many have their sights set on the presidency . 
The real title-holders of internal power , the governors owe their long incumbencies to the generosity with which they hand out state jobs . 
At times charming , at times eccentric , and often behaving like bandits , these provincial chieftains share several attributes : high rates of poverty in their provinces , comfortable lifestyles for themselves , and a disdain for democratic institutions . 
Their misrule has made Argentina into a kind of global pariah . 
Because of them , we won &apos;t pay our debts or reform the financial system . 
Poverty grows and the indecisive Peronista government ( governors included ) inspires little trust . 
Argentina cannot hope to reach an accommodation with the IMF so long as these officials retain a virtual veto . 
The call to schedule elections for March of next year , although demanded by most Argentines , has failed to calm nerves . 
Everyone knows that lacking a true opposition to the current government , the presidential candidate will emerge from today &apos;s divided and fragmented brand of peronismo . 
But the only remaining vestige of Perón &apos;s rule is embodied in the worst habits of his heirs , who , with the least provocation , demonstrate their propensity for authoritarianism , demagoguery , and a mentality always favorable to corruption . 
Indeed , today &apos;s peronismo , known officially as the &quot; Partido Justicialista , &quot; unites individuals only in a desire to perpetuate their power . 
Everything they do turns on this , including the hatred between Menem and Duhalde . 
In November the party will hold open internal talks , an occasion that will increase competition between each governor . 
Their differences are slight . 
There is the &quot; progressive feudalism &quot; of the governor of the depopulated Patagonian province of Santa Cruz ; the &quot; feudal populism &quot; of Adolfo Rodríguez Sáa , briefly the country &apos;s president during last December &apos;s saga of successive presidential resignations . 
Rodríguez Sáa is also the ex-governor of San Luis , where he governed with a sure despotic hand for 19 years - a reign the poor endured because he bribed them as well . 
There is also the &quot; liberalism &quot; of José Manuel de la Sota , who steered the indebted province of Córdoba and who is President Eduardo Duhalde &apos;s dauphin . 
Finally , casting a long shadow over everything , is Menem . 
Although hectored by criminal accusations and the discovery of a Swiss bank account in his name , he is trying to rise above scandal to recapture the presidency . 
One newspaper refers to this political infighting as &quot; the peronista carnage . &quot; 
First to fall victim was Carlos Reuteman , the ex-backer of Formula 1 auto racing who is now governor of Santa Fe . 
The first anointed dauphin of President Duhalde , Reuteman &apos;s joy at this prospect was short-lived . 
He declined to put himself forward , his exit speech reviving memories of Argentina &apos;s &quot; dirty war &quot; and &quot; disappeared &quot; : &quot; I have seen something that I cannot discuss , and may never be able to discuss . &quot; 
Argentines are left to endure wretched hours languishing in economic and political chaos . 
People in the streets increasingly fear that they will never get to cast their ballot or have their say .
