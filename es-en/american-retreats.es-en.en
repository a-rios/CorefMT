American Retreats 
Los Angeles - As Barack Obama &apos;s incoming administration debates the pace and consequences of withdrawal from Iraq , it would do well to examine the strategic impact of other American exits in the final decades of the twentieth century . 
Although American commitments to Lebanon , Somalia , Vietnam , and Cambodia differed mightily , history reveals that despite immediate costs to America &apos;s reputation , disengagement ultimately redounded to America &apos;s advantage . 
In all of these cases , regional stability of sorts emerged after an American military withdrawal , albeit at the cost of a significant loss of life . 
America &apos;s former adversaries either became preoccupied with consolidating or sharing power , suffered domestic defeat , or confronted neighboring states . 
Ultimately , America &apos;s vital interests prevailed . 
The evidence today suggests that this pattern can be repeated when the United States departs Mesopotamia and leaves Iraqis to define their own fate . 
Of the four withdrawals , arguably the 1982-1984 American intervention in Lebanon marks the closest parallel to Iraq today . 
A country torn by sectarian violence beginning in 1975 , Lebanon pitted an even more complex array of contestants against each other than Iraq does today . 
Their objective was to create a military buffer between the PLO and Israeli forces that were then fighting in Beirut in order to promote the departure of both . 
The massacres in Palestinian refugee camps prompted a new commitment to &quot; restore a strong and central government &quot; to Lebanon , to quote President Ronald Reagan . 
But the result of intervention was that US forces became just one more target , culminating in the 1983 bombing of a US Marine barracks that killed 241 American soldiers . 
A similar suicide bombing two days later claimed the lives of 58 French soldiers . 
In February 1984 , facing a quagmire , Reagan acceded to Vice President George H.W. Bush &apos;s recommendation to get out of Lebanon . 
The civil war continued for another six years , followed by a bumpy political aftermath : Syrian intervention and expulsion ( two decades later ) , as the Lebanese defined their own fate with the US exercising only background influence . 
In 1992 , the sirens of Somalia &apos;s political collapse lured the US into another civil war to save a country from itself . 
The US humanitarian mission to that benighted country sought to salvage a failed United Nations enterprise to secure and feed Somalia &apos;s ravaged population . 
The US committed 28,000 troops , which for a time imposed a modicum of security . 
But ill-equipped and poorly led UN replacement forces for the American presence put the remaining US troops in the bull &apos;s eye as they attempted to bring to justice the Somali warlord responsible for the death of Pakistani peacekeepers . 
The ensuing bloodbath of US soldiers generated images that the American public could not stomach , prompting the exit of American and then UN forces . 
As unrest mounted with these military retreats , offshore US forces monitored and intercepted jihadists who sought to enter Somalia , while Kenya and Ethiopia blocked the unrest from metastasizing across the region . 
In 2006 , the capture of Somalia &apos;s capital , Mogadishu , by the Islamic Courts raised the specter of a jihadist state . 
Following Ethiopia &apos;s intervention , the Islamists found themselves out of power . 
Today , Somalia remains a dysfunctional state , as rival clans , jihadists , and an interim government with Ethiopian support compete for power . 
The US , now out of the quagmire , exercises limited influence from afar . 
While Lebanon and Somalia remain damaged and failed states , respectively , regional and domestic factors have cauterized the consequences of America &apos;s retreat from Vietnam and Southeast Asia . 
The result is the stable region that the world sees today . 
As President George W. Bush argued about the war in Iraq , US President Lyndon Johnson predicted that defeat in Vietnam &quot; would be renewed in one country and then another . &quot; 
What Johnson failed to foresee were the domestic and regional constraints that would prevent the dominos from falling in the way he predicted . 
Although the US bombed northeastern Cambodia intensely throughout the Vietnam War years , it had no stomach for a ground commitment there . 
Still within congressional restraints , the Nixon administration attempted to bolster Cambodia &apos;s military government . 
Rather than the dominos falling following America &apos;s retreat from Saigon in 1975 , a Vietnam-Cambodian War ensued . 
This in turn stimulated China &apos;s unsuccessful intervention in North Vietnam . 
None of these American exits was without consequence . 
America &apos;s departure from Mesopotamia will likewise put the burden of problem solving onto Iraqis and other regional players , leaving the US offshore to assist when and where it deems appropriate . 
History suggests that , in fits and starts , Iraq , like Vietnam and Lebanon , will find itself able to sort out its own affairs .
