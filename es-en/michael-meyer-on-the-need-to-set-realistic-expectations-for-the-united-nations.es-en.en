The UN &apos;s Half-Full Glass 
NAIROBI - Families trapped by the fighting in Syria are reportedly eating &quot; salads &quot; &quot; made of leaves and grass to stave off hunger . 
According to the United Nations refugee agency , more than two million Syrians have fled to neighboring countries . 
Back home , many more face a brutal winter without adequate food , medicine , or shelter . 
And , as if conditions could not be worse , the country is facing a polio outbreak . 
The international response to Syria &apos;s crisis has been nothing short of disastrous . 
Indeed , Syria seems to be the embodiment of failure on the part of the UN . 
The Security Council is deadlocked . 
In Damascus , would-be peacemakers come and go , talking diplomacy but achieving nothing . 
Relief agencies are blocked from operating where they are needed most . 
Yet it is clear that without the UN , the situation would be even worse . 
Lebanon , Jordan , and Turkey would be under even more pressure from the refugees flooding across their borders . 
And while efforts to achieve a ceasefire have failed , diplomacy has not - at least not entirely . 
In October , UN inspectors took initial steps to destroy Syria &apos;s chemical-weapons stockpiles and facilities , with the government &apos;s full cooperation . 
In Syria - as in so many other conflict-affected areas , where the UN is fighting to promote peace and stability - there is no such thing as a clear victory . 
As an experienced statesman once told me , &quot; At the UN , we do not settle for failure , nor do we expect success . &quot; 
In diplomatic negotiations , you take what you can get . 
In humanitarian crises , you do what is possible - usually too little , and often too late . 
&quot; We drink from a cup that is eternally half full , &quot; he concluded . 
This conflicted view aligns with public perceptions of the UN . 
In the United States , for example , a recent poll by Better World Campaign suggested that 57 % of Americans view the UN favorably ; but , according to a more recent Gallup survey , only 35 % of Americans believe the UN is doing a good job . 
When the UN was founded in 1945 , polls showed similarly conflicted views . 
While slightly more than 60 % of Americans embraced the importance of the UN and its global mission , only 39 % believed that its lofty goals for peace and human development were achievable . 
This discrepancy reflects a deep divide - in the US and elsewhere - between people &apos;s hopes for the UN and their expectations of its ability to deliver . 
In fact , the UN &apos;s contribution to peace and development should not be understated , though its successes clearly do not receive the publicity they deserve . 
For example , UN peacekeepers were recently deployed successfully in Mali . 
Last month , they defeated the M23 rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo , ending a major threat to regional peace and security . 
But most of the UN &apos;s achievements have had shortcomings . 
In 2011 , after Côte d &apos;Ivoire &apos;s President Laurent Gbagbo refused to cede power following his electoral defeat the previous year , the UN , backed by French forces , arrested him and transferred him to the International Criminal Court , cutting short a potentially devastating civil war . 
Nonetheless , their intervention came too late for the hundreds of civilians who were killed in the city of Duékoué . 
When Libya &apos;s Muammar el-Qaddafi threatened to kill his rebellious detractors like &quot; rats , &quot; a UN coalition intervened under an emerging global doctrine : the responsibility to protect . 
But three years after Qaddafi &apos;s ouster , Libya remains hobbled by weak national institutions and roiled by factional fighting . 
During the early days of the Arab Spring protests , the UN , led by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , spoke out forcefully for human rights and democracy . 
But the UN &apos;s capacity to ensure desirable outcomes is limited ; while the hope that drove the Arab Spring may not be depleted , it has clearly diminished significantly . 
In just a few years , the UN has managed to push climate change - which , until recently , was barely understood by world leaders - toward the top of the global agenda . 
But a comprehensive agreement on climate change remains a distant hope . 
And while the Millennium Development Goals have produced remarkable progress in key areas - including education , infant mortality , and diseases like malaria and tuberculosis - there is still a long way to go . 
In pursuing a political solution in Syria , it is important to set realistic expectations . 
The country has descended into warlordism - a take-no-prisoners fight among armed groups , some allied with the government , others with Al Qaeda , and all preying on innocent civilians . 
In such an environment , the prospects for diplomacy are dim . 
The UN must settle for what it can get and do the most it can to help those in need . 
After all , a half-full glass is better than an empty one .
