Absent-Minded Killers 
As a species , human beings have a major self-control problem . 
We humans are now so aggressively fishing , hunting , logging , and growing crops in all parts of the world that we are literally chasing other species off the planet . 
Our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life . 
In 1992 , when the world &apos;s governments first promised to address man-made global warming , they also vowed to head off the human-induced extinction of other species . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity , agreed at the Rio Earth Summit , established that &quot; biological diversity is a common concern of humanity . &quot; 
The signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity , by saving species and their habitats , and to use biological resources ( e.g. , forests ) in a sustainable manner . 
In 2002 , the treaty &apos;s signatories went further , committing to &quot; a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss &quot; by 2010 . 
Unfortunately , like so many other international agreements , the Convention on Biological Diversity remains essentially unknown , un-championed , and unfulfilled . 
That neglect is a human tragedy . 
For a very low cash outlay - and perhaps none at all on balance - we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods . 
We kill other species not because we must , but because we are too negligent to do otherwise . 
Consider a couple of notorious examples . 
Some rich countries , such as Spain , Portugal , Australia , and New Zealand , have fishing fleets that engage in so-called &quot; bottom trawling . &quot; 
Bottom trawlers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom , destroying magnificent , unexplored , and endangered marine species in the process . 
Complex and unique ecologies , most notably underground volcanoes known as seamounts , are ripped to shreds , because bottom trawling is the &quot; low cost &quot; way to catch a few deep sea fish species . 
One of these species , orange roughy , has been caught commercially for only around a quarter-century , but already is being fished to the point of collapse . 
Likewise , in many parts of the world , tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops . 
The result is massive loss of habitat and destruction of species , yielding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost . 
After cutting down a swath of rainforest , soils are often quickly leached of their nutrients so that they cannot sustain crops or nutritious grasses for livestock . 
As a result , the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned , with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems . 
Because these activities &quot; costs are so high and their benefits so low , stopping them would be easy . 
Bottom trawling should simply be outlawed ; it would be simple and inexpensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities . 
Forest clearing , on the other hand , is probably best stopped by economic incentives , perhaps combined with regulatory limits . 
Simply restricting the practice of land clearing probably would not work , since farm families and communities would face a strong temptation to evade legal limits . 
On the other hand , financial incentives would probably succeed , because cutting down forest to create pastureland is not profitable enough to induce farmers to forego payments for protecting the land . 
Many rainforest countries have united in recent years to suggest the establishment of a rainforest conservation fund by the rich countries , to pay impoverished small farmers a small amount of money to preserve the forest . 
A well-designed fund would slow or stop deforestation , preserve biodiversity , and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the burning of cleared forests . 
At the same time , small farmers would receive a steady flow of income , which they could use for micro-investments to improve their household &apos;s wealth , education , and health . 
Aside from banning bottom trawling and establishing a global fund for avoided deforestation , we should designate a global network of protected marine areas , in which fishing , boating , polluting , dredging , drilling , and other damaging activities would be prohibited . 
Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species , but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas . 
We also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abundance and extinction , just as we now have such a process for climate change . 
Politicians don &apos;t listen very well to individual scientists , but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice . 
Finally , the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow human-induced climate change . 
There can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species &quot; viability . 
As the planet warms , and rain and storm patterns change dramatically , many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival . 
Some can migrate , but others ( such as polar bears ) are likely to be driven to extinction unless we take decisive action to head off climate change . 
These measures are achievable by 2010 . 
They are affordable , and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits . 
Most importantly , they would allow us to follow through on a global promise . 
It is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species - and jeopardize our own future - in a fit of absent-mindedness .
