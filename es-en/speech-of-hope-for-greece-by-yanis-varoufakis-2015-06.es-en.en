A Speech of Hope for Greece 
ATHENS - On September 6 , 1946 US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes traveled to Stuttgart to deliver his historic &quot; Speech of Hope . &quot; 
Seven decades later , it is my country , Greece , that needs such a chance . 
Until Byrnes &quot; &quot; Speech of Hope , &quot; the Allies were committed to converting ... &quot; Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in character . &quot; 
That was the express intention of the Morgenthau Plan , devised by US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. and co-signed by the United States and Britain two years earlier , in September 1944 . 
Indeed , when the US , the Soviet Union , and the United Kingdom signed the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945 , they agreed on the &quot; reduction or destruction of all civilian heavy-industry with war potential &quot; and on &quot; restructuring the German economy toward agriculture and light industry . &quot; 
By 1946 , the Allies had reduced Germany &apos;s steel output to 75 % of its pre-war level . 
Car production plummeted to around 10 % of pre-war output . 
By the end of the decade , 706 industrial plants were destroyed . 
Byrnes &quot; speech signaled to the German people a reversal of that punitive de-industrialization drive . 
Of course , Germany owes its post-war recovery and wealth to its people and their hard work , innovation , and devotion to a united , democratic Europe . 
Prior to Byrnes &quot; speech , and for a while afterwards , America &apos;s allies were not keen to restore hope to the defeated Germans . 
Its rebirth was underway , facilitated by the Marshall Plan , the US-sponsored 1953 debt write-down , and by the infusion of migrant labor from Italy , Yugoslavia , and Greece . 
Europe could not have united in peace and democracy without that sea change . 
Someone had to put aside moralistic objections and look dispassionately at a country locked in a set of circumstances that would only reproduce discord and fragmentation across the continent . 
The US , having emerged from the war as the only creditor country , did precisely that . 
Today , it is my country that is locked in such circumstances and in need of hope . 
Moralistic objections to helping Greece abound , denying its people a shot at achieving their own renaissance . 
Greater austerity is being demanded from an economy that is on its knees , owing to the heftiest dose of austerity any country has ever had to endure in peacetime . No offer of debt relief . 
It is the mark of ancient societies , like those of Germany and of Greece , that contemporary tribulations revive old fears and foment new discord . 
So we must be careful . 
Teenagers should never be told that , due to some &quot; prodigal sin , &quot; they deserve to be educated in cash-strapped schools and weighed down by mass unemployment , whether the scene is Germany in the late 1940s or Greece today . 
As I write these lines , the Greek government is presenting the European Union with a set of proposals for deep reforms , debt management , and an investment plan to kick-start the economy . 
Greece is indeed ready and willing to enter into a compact with Europe that will eliminate the deformities that caused it to be the first domino to fall in 2010 . 
But , if Greece is to implement these reforms successfully , its citizens need a missing ingredient : Hope . 
A &quot; Speech of Hope &quot; for Greece would make all the difference now - not only for us , but also for our creditors , as our renaissance would terminate the default risk . 
What should such a declaration include ? 
Just as Byrnes &quot; address was short on detail but long on symbolism , a &quot; Speech of Hope &quot; for Greece does not have to be technical . 
It should simply mark a sea change , a break with the past five years of adding new loans on top of already unsustainable debt , conditional on further doses of punitive austerity . 
Who should deliver it ? 
In my mind , the speaker should be German Chancellor Angela Merkel , addressing an audience in Athens or Thessaloniki or any Greek city of her choice . 
She could use the opportunity to hint at a new approach to European integration , one that starts in the country that has suffered the most , a victim both of the eurozone &apos;s faulty monetary design and of its society &apos;s own failings . 
Hope was a force for good in post-war Europe , and it can be a force for positive transformation now . 
A speech by Germany &apos;s leader in a Greek city could go a long way toward delivering it .
