Righting the Wrongs of Leprosy 
TOKYO - At its 15th session , which ended at the beginning of October , the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution encouraging governments to eliminate discrimination against people affected by leprosy - and their family members . 
As the World Health Organization &apos;s Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination , I have long campaigned for this outcome . 
Leprosy is one of the world &apos;s oldest diseases . 
It has a physical dimension , but also social and psychological components . 
For much of its long history , there was no known cure . 
It was only in the latter part of the twentieth century that a truly effective chemotherapy became available . 
Since the introduction of multidrug therapy in the early 1980 &quot; s , roughly 16 million people around the world have been cured . 
In virtually every country in the world , leprosy is no longer regarded as a public-health problem . 
Caught early and addressed promptly , leprosy need leave no trace . 
Only when the disease goes untreated does the damage caused to the peripheral nerves lead to loss of sensation and invite ulceration and wounds . 
Unchecked , leprosy disfigures and can result in permanent disability . 
Down the ages , the appearance of those with the disease , and the absence of a known cure , contributed to the fear that it caused - and thus to the stigmatization of its sufferers . 
Even today , many mistaken notions about leprosy persist . 
The stigma surrounding the disease remains hard to dispel , and results in discriminatory attitudes and practices that continue to blight the lives of millions of people . 
But the facts about leprosy are hardly so odious . 
The disease is caused by a bacillus called Myobacterium leprae , first identified in 1873 by G.H. Armauer Hansen . 
Leprosy is thus an infectious disease ; it is not hereditary , let alone a divine punishment . 
Transmission is believed to be airborne , through close and frequent contact with an infected , untreated person . 
But leprosy is very hard to develop ; most people have a built-in immunity to it and have nothing to fear . 
It is important to emphasize , too , that leprosy can be cured at any time . 
The first dose of MDT kills 99.9 % of the bacteria that cause leprosy , rendering the person no longer infectious . 
But if treatment has been delayed , the patient may be left with recurring ulcers and permanent damage . 
Last year , there were under 250,000 new cases of leprosy reported in the world , over half of them in India . 
Brazil and Indonesia also contribute a significant number of new cases . 
Compared to the numbers who fall ill with diseases such as HIV / AIDS , malaria , and tuberculosis , however , leprosy almost pales into insignificance . 
But what is not acceptable is the way that people with leprosy , those cured of it , and even their family members continue to be discriminated against on the basis of fears , myths , and outdated notions about a disease that is today completely curable . 
The Principles and Guidelines that were unanimously adopted by the Human Rights Council convey the nature and scale of the problem . 
In affirming the rights to which people affected by leprosy and their family members are entitled , the Principles and Guidelines reveal the extent of discrimination and the forms that it has taken . 
For example , the Principles and Guidelines note that people affected by leprosy , including sufferers &quot; family members , are entitled to the same rights as everyone else with respect to marriage , family , and parenthood . 
So leprosy should not be grounds for denying anyone the right to marry , or for divorce ; nor should it constitute grounds for separating a child from his or her parents . 
People who have been infected with leprosy also are entitled to the same rights as everyone else with respect to full citizenship and obtaining identify documents . 
They have the right to serve the public , on an equal basis with others , including the right to stand for elections and to hold office at all levels of government . 
Likewise , they have the right to work and be treated on an equal basis with others vis-Ã -vis recruitment , hiring , promotion , and salary . 
They are not to be denied admission to or expelled from schools or training programs on the grounds of leprosy . 
In other words , people should not be discriminated against on the grounds of having or having had leprosy - or , indeed , any disease . 
The landmark resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council encourages governments to give due consideration to the Principles and Guidelines in formulating policies . 
I hope that governments will do more than that . 
I hope that they will take them to heart and address once and for all the long-standing injustices that for too long have pushed too many people with leprosy to the margins of society .
