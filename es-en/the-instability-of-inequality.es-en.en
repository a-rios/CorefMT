The Instability of Inequality 
NEW YORK - This year has witnessed a global wave of social and political turmoil and instability , with masses of people pouring into the real and virtual streets : the Arab Spring ; riots in London ; 
While these protests have no unified theme , they express in different ways the serious concerns of the world &apos;s working and middle classes about their prospects in the face of the growing concentration of power among economic , financial , and political elites . 
The causes of their concern are clear enough : high unemployment and underemployment in advanced and emerging economies ; inadequate skills and education for young people and workers to compete in a globalized world ; resentment against corruption , including legalized forms like lobbying ; and a sharp rise in income and wealth inequality in advanced and fast-growing emerging-market economies . 
Of course , the malaise that so many people feel cannot be reduced to one factor . 
For example , the rise in inequality has many causes : the addition of 2.3 billion Chinese and Indians to the global labor force , which is reducing the jobs and wages of unskilled blue-collar and off-shorable white-collar workers in advanced economies ; skill-biased technological change ; winner-take-all effects ; early emergence of income and wealth disparities in rapidly growing , previously low-income economies ; and less progressive taxation . 
The increase in private- and public-sector leverage and the related asset and credit bubbles are partly the result of inequality . 
Mediocre income growth for everyone but the rich in the last few decades opened a gap between incomes and spending aspirations . 
In Anglo-Saxon countries , the response was to democratize credit - via financial liberalization - thereby fueling a rise in private debt as households borrowed to make up the difference . 
In Europe , the gap was filled by public services - free education , health care , etc . - that were not fully financed by taxes , fueling public deficits and debt . 
In both cases , debt levels eventually became unsustainable . 
Firms in advanced economies are now cutting jobs , owing to inadequate final demand , which has led to excess capacity , and to uncertainty about future demand . 
But cutting jobs weakens final demand further , because it reduces labor income and increases inequality . 
Because a firm &apos;s labor costs are someone else &apos;s labor income and demand , what is individually rational for one firm is destructive in the aggregate . 
The result is that free markets don &apos;t generate enough final demand . 
In the US , for example , slashing labor costs has sharply reduced the share of labor income in GDP . 
With credit exhausted , the effects on aggregate demand of decades of redistribution of income and wealth - from labor to capital , from wages to profits , from poor to rich , and from households to corporate firms - have become severe , owing to the lower marginal propensity of firms / capital owners / rich households to spend . 
The problem is not new . 
Karl Marx oversold socialism , but he was right in claiming that globalization , unfettered financial capitalism , and redistribution of income and wealth from labor to capital could lead capitalism to self-destruct . 
As he argued , unregulated capitalism can lead to regular bouts of over-capacity , under-consumption , and the recurrence of destructive financial crises , fueled by credit bubbles and asset-price booms and busts . 
Even before the Great Depression , Europe &apos;s enlightened &quot; bourgeois &quot; classes recognized that , to avoid revolution , workers &quot; rights needed to be protected , wage and labor conditions improved , and a welfare state created to redistribute wealth and finance public goods - education , health care , and a social safety net . 
The push towards a modern welfare state accelerated after the Great Depression , when the state took on the responsibility for macroeconomic stabilization - a role that required the maintenance of a large middle class by widening the provision of public goods through progressive taxation of incomes and wealth and fostering economic opportunity for all . 
Thus , the rise of the social-welfare state was a response ( often of market-oriented liberal democracies ) to the threat of popular revolutions , socialism , and communism as the frequency and severity of economic and financial crises increased . 
Three decades of relative social and economic stability then ensued , from the late 1940 &quot; s until the mid-1970 &quot; s , a period when inequality fell sharply and median incomes grew rapidly . 
Some of the lessons about the need for prudential regulation of the financial system were lost in the Reagan-Thatcher era , when the appetite for massive deregulation was created in part by the flaws in Europe &apos;s social-welfare model . 
Those flaws were reflected in yawning fiscal deficits , regulatory overkill , and a lack of economic dynamism that led to sclerotic growth then and the eurozone &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis now . 
But the laissez-faire Anglo-Saxon model has also now failed miserably . 
To stabilize market-oriented economies requires a return to the right balance between markets and provision of public goods . 
That means moving away from both the Anglo-Saxon model of unregulated markets and the continental European model of deficit-driven welfare states . 
Even an alternative &quot; Asian &quot; growth model - if there really is one - has not prevented a rise in inequality in China , India , and elsewhere . 
Any economic model that does not properly address inequality will eventually face a crisis of legitimacy . 
Unless the relative economic roles of the market and the state are rebalanced , the protests of 2011 will become more severe , with social and political instability eventually harming long-term economic growth and welfare .
