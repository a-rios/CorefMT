Publish or Perish 
OXFORD - A few years ago , two Norwegian researchers presented their version of a scientific-research slippery slope , with honest errors ( mistaken observations and analyses ) at the top and intentional fraud ( plagiarism , falsification , and fabrication ) at the bottom . 
They placed &quot; publication bias &quot; about halfway down the scale - but it should have been much lower . 
Indeed , failure to publish research results is by far the most common and worrying form of scientific and ethical misconduct in health research - and it has had lethal consequences . 
Anecdotal evidence of publication bias has existed for a long time . 
Studies with &quot; negative &quot; results are particularly unlikely to see the light of day . 
For example , anti-arrhythmic drugs were prescribed widely - with the United States Food and Drug Administration &apos;s approval - to heart-attack victims for more than a decade , under the assumption that reducing heart-rhythm abnormalities would decrease mortality rates . 
Following this revelation , a British research team reported a clinical trial that they had carried out more than a decade earlier . 
Their study had found a higher death rate among patients receiving a new anti-arrhythmic drug than among those receiving a placebo . 
They had not published the results , they explained , because the drug &apos;s development had been abandoned for commercial reasons . 
In retrospect , however , they observed that their results &quot; might have provided early warning of trouble ahead . &quot; 
Beyond avoidable suffering and death , failure to report research also slows the pace of scientific discovery . 
It is widely acknowledged that the high current level of investment in pharmaceutical research is yielding too few substantive discoveries . 
At a meeting on &quot; translational research , &quot; a senior member of a contract-research organization - a company that provides outsourced research services to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries - articulated the problem . 
&quot; What really frustrates us , &quot; he commented , &quot; is to be commissioned by a pharmaceutical company to design an early-phase trial when we know already that it is going up a blind alley . 
In other words , the drug-discovery process suffers from built-in inefficiency , owing to inadequate reporting . 
Drug-trial volunteers should not accept this abuse of their participation in research . 
Failing to publish the results of clinical trials is a betrayal of the implicit trust that they have placed in researchers to use their contribution to increase and improve the stock of scientific knowledge . 
Nor should the public accept this squandering of resources . 
There is simply no justification for withholding the results of health-research studies . 
Publication is a moral imperative .
