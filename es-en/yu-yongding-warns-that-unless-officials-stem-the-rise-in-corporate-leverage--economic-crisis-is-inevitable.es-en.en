China &apos;s Fire Next Time 
BEIJING - Earlier this year , rumors of China &apos;s impending financial doom - triggered by either a housing-market crash or local-government debt defaults - were rampant . 
But , in recent months , the economy has stabilized , leaving few doubts about China &apos;s ability to grow by more than 7 % this year . 
Given that the Chinese government had ample scope for policy intervention , this turnaround should come as no surprise . 
But the moment of financial reckoning has merely been postponed , not averted . 
The fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place - including real-estate bubbles , local-government debt , rapid growth in shadow-banking activity , and rising corporate leverage ratios - remain unresolved . 
Of these , the most immediate threat to China &apos;s economic and financial stability is the combination of high borrowing costs , low profitability for nonfinancial corporations , and very high corporate leverage ratios . 
According to a study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , the debt / GDP ratio for China &apos;s nonfinancial corporations was 113 % by the end of 2012 . 
Standard 
Poor &apos;s found that , a year later , these firms &quot; total debt amounted to $ 14.2 trillion , eclipsing the $ 13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world &apos;s largest issuer of corporate debt . 
There is no indication that the ratio will decline anytime soon , which is particularly worrisome , given the low profitability and high borrowing costs that China &apos;s industrial enterprises face . 
Indeed , Chinese firms &quot; profitability amounted to just over 6 % last year , with 2012 profits for China &apos;s 500 largest ( mostly state-owned ) corporations barely exceeding 2 % . 
Meanwhile , interest rates on bank loans to nonfinancial enterprises remain close to 7 % , despite having fallen slightly over the last year . 
And , in the second quarter of this year , the annualized interest rate on loans to small nonfinancial corporations surpassed 25 % . 
With insufficient profits to use for investment , nonfinancial corporations will become increasingly dependent on external finance . 
As their leverage ratios increase , so will their risk premiums , causing their borrowing costs to rise and undermining their profitability further . 
This destructive cycle will be difficult to break . 
For example , if companies reduce investment , they will weaken growth and boost their leverage ratio further . 
To be sure , China overcame a similar challenge in its public sector from 1998 to 2001 . 
It pursued growth-boosting investment in infrastructure and real-estate development to eliminate deflation , while maintaining artificially low interest rates to contain the rise of public debt . 
But a lot has changed since then . 
In fact , the investment-led growth model that facilitated double-digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses , which must now be addressed . 
Indeed , China must stem the pace of real-estate investment , which accounted for more than 13 % of GDP in recent years - a move that will undoubtedly lead to slower economic growth and , in turn , reduce the profitability of China &apos;s nonfinancial corporates further . 
Moreover , ongoing interest-rate liberalization - which has occurred both openly and surreptitiously - means that artificially low borrowing costs have become far more difficult to maintain . 
Though the People &apos;s Bank of China still officially caps interest rates on deposits , commercial banks - in cooperation with nonbank financial institutions , especially trust companies - are using wealth-management products to attract deposits with de facto free-market interest rates . 
As a result , the PBOC is losing control over interest rates on corporate loans , and thus has few options for constraining leverage ratios . 
Despite these risks , it is too early to bet on a corporate-debt crisis in China . 
For starters , no one knows at what corporate leverage ratio a crisis will be triggered . 
In 1996 , when Japan &apos;s public debt / GDP ratio reached 80 % , many Japanese economists and officials worried about a looming crisis . 
Almost two decades later , the ratio has surpassed 200 % - and still no crisis has erupted . 
Furthermore , China has not yet completed its market-orientated reforms , which could unleash major growth potential in many areas . 
Given the role that institutional factors play in China &apos;s corporate-debt problem , such reforms could go a long way toward resolving it . 
China &apos;s leaders should take advantage of this respite from instability and low confidence to redouble their reform efforts . 
Otherwise , they can expect alarm bells to begin ringing again - and , next time , they may not have the tools they need to silence them .
