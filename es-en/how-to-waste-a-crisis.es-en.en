How to Waste a Crisis 
The global financial crisis is reaching a bottom , and yet political frustration is growing , because the low point of the collapse seems to offer a last opportunity to promote dramatic change , and that opportunity may be missed . 
Last year , President Obama &apos;s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel remarked that a good crisis should never be wasted . 
Disaster is an opportunity for thinking of ways to make the world fundamentally better - and also prevent future crises . 
People do a great deal of thinking , but sometimes they think so much that they come up with contradictory responses . 
Indeed , what really makes a crisis profound is precisely the broad variety of differing diagnoses and different remedies . 
The political passions aroused by the clashes of interpretation often make the crisis seemingly insoluble . 
It was those conflicts , rather than some technical flaw in the operation of the economy , which made the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s such a dismal and destructive event . 
Responses to a crisis fall into two categories . 
The first type aims at an institutional reordering , so that inefficiencies and perverse incentives are removed , and the economy functions more smoothly and efficiently . 
The second , more radical approach , tries to improve not the economy but the way people themselves go about their lives . 
No institutional solution is purely neutral in its effects on relative incomes - and it is relative income and wealth around which political debate typically revolves . 
Bailout operations invariably bring bitter controversy because they help some but not others . 
Rescuing automobile producers looks good to their employees and suppliers . 
But the costs must be borne by everyone , including firms that are not rescued - probably because they operate more efficiently - and are put at a competitive disadvantage as a result . 
Such rescues , in short , appear to help big companies with bad managers . 
Small businesses will always complain that they do not have the organizational clout to extract public funds from governments . 
And bank bailouts , involving the direct use of public money to recapitalize failing institutions , are even more costly and politically unpopular . 
Advocates of monetary stimulation sometimes argue that it is preferable because it is more neutral in its distributional effects , and that its benefits are spread more widely . 
But monetary stimulus is often in reality just as selective as bailouts . 
The analogy popularized by the great monetarist economist Milton Friedman was that the central bank could always deal with deflationary problems by dropping money from a helicopter . 
But , in the real world , not everyone is underneath the helicopter when it makes the drop . 
In fact , it is likely that the helicopter pilot will hover over friends and relatives when dropping the money . 
And even if the pilot is completely non-corrupt , the crowd on the ground will always assume that there is some hidden and partisan plan . 
That has been precisely the problem with the aggressive provision of liquidity , quantitative easing , and the reduction of central bank interest rates used to address the current crisis . 
In today &apos;s credit crunch , as in the Great Depression , central banks lend at practically zero interest rates . 
Depositors are paid almost nothing on their deposits . 
But when businesses and consumers try to borrow , they find that it is very costly , if not impossible . 
Lenders ( the bankers ) are suspicious , worried about creditworthiness , and demand high risk premia . 
As a consequence , in most countries , credit is still contracting . 
In practice , it is only banks that have access to cheap borrowing , so they can reconstitute their balance sheets by borrowing cheaply and lending expensively . 
This is why banks suddenly look so unexpectedly profitable . 
But the contrast between bank profitability and the woes of everyone else turns up the political heat on the central banks , which have to explain why it is only their &quot; friends , &quot; the banks , who are standing under the helicopter when it drops money . 
Frustration with the complexities of trying to provide ready fixes leads to attempts to find even more radical solutions . 
Some try to deal with basic human proclivities , and to modify behavior to make people better . 
It is in times of crisis that Utopian ideas about ways of guaranteeing human happiness flourish , often claiming some scientific basis . 
For example , long before the financial collapse , experimental economists joined psychologists in attempting to measure varying propensities to greediness . 
Some evidence suggests that there is a link between the level of dopamine , addiction , and greedy behavior . 
Since a common diagnosis of the problems generated in the financial services business holds that human greed is to blame , a German think tank recently suggested that people with a genetic proclivity to high dopamine levels should be barred from taking leading positions in financial institutions . 
But such apparently attractive strategies aimed at making better people turn out to be exclusionary - and based on rather arbitrary testing . 
If implemented , the German proposal would most likely exclude behavior that involves acceptable risk , as well as sidelining those who take wild and inappropriate decisions . 
Both the institutional and the behavioral responses to a crisis are fundamentally problematical . The search for technical solutions leads to political polarization , and may produce stalemate . 
The search for deep human roots of the crisis , by contrast , leads to attempts to change human nature , which are futile - and also inherently much more dangerous .
