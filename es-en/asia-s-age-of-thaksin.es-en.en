Asia &apos;s Age of Thaksin ? 
The retirements from frontline politics of Singapore &apos;s Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysia &apos;s Mahathir Mohamed have deprived Southeast Asia of its senior leaders . 
Can Thailand &apos;s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra fill the regional leadership vacuum ? 
A series of bold foreign-policy strokes - the Asia Cooperation Dialogue , the Economic Cooperation Strategy for the development of mainland Southeast Asia , and America &apos;s designation of Thailand as a &quot; major non-NATO ally &quot; - turned the international spotlight on Thaksin during his first term . 
Violence in Thailand &apos;s predominantly Muslim south seemed to dent his ambitions last year , but his Thai Rak Thai ( TRT ) party &apos;s landslide victory last February gave his bid for regional leadership a new lease on life . 
With the TRT capturing over 75 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament , Thaksin is now politically invincible at home . 
Indeed , he has become the first elected Thai leader to finish a four-year term , be re-elected , and preside over a one-party government . 
Thaksin &apos;s dominance of Thai politics is unprecedented , and his resilient popularity in the face of a fickle electorate is unparalleled . 
Apart from his complete control of domestic politics , Thaksin commands other prerequisites of regional leadership . 
Already eyeing a third term , he can count on political longevity on the order of Mahathir &apos;s 22-year rule . 
Notwithstanding the one-party system that the TRT is cultivating , Thaksin is armed with democratic legitimacy in a global arena bent on democracy promotion , and he speaks English decently enough to articulate his views and vision to a global audience . 
He even has his own development strategy , dubbed &quot; Thaksinomics , &quot; a self-styled approach that blends neo-liberal export-led growth with grassroots-based domestic demand . 
The Thai economy emerged out of its post-1997 crisis doldrums under Thaksin &apos;s watch , and is now firmly positioned on a 6 % annual growth trajectory . 
While it relies on profligate subsidies and cash handouts , Thaksinomics also banks on structural reforms to propel economic growth . 
The strategy &apos;s most promising prospects include the promotion of industrial upgrading , niche industries , and competitiveness-boosting cluster projects that aim to make Thailand a global and regional hub for food , fashion , tourism , automobiles , and healthcare . 
A vibrant economy - GDP growth is second only to China &apos;s in Asia - is indispensable for regional leadership . 
Of the policies that will determine his future role in the region , the Asia Cooperation Dialogue and Economic Cooperation Strategy stand out . 
Based on the concept of &quot; Asia for Asians , &quot; the nascent ACD &apos;s membership straddles the Asian landmass from the Korean Peninsula to the Middle East , with Thailand at the geographic center . 
Although its future directions are uncertain , this 26-member forum trumps Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , and ASEAN Plus Three , which includes China , Japan , and South Korea . 
The region-wide crisis in 1997 , weak progress on free trade , and the region &apos;s security vulnerabilities have made Thaksin aware of ASEAN &apos;s limitations . 
As Indonesia &apos;s size makes it a natural leader of ASEAN , the ACD lends Thaksin a broader platform that stresses Thailand &apos;s geographical advantages . 
It allows him to trumpet Thailand &apos;s strategic objectives and the region &apos;s major issues , sometimes in confrontation with the interests and the demands of the West . 
Within the ACD framework , Thaksin launched the $ 1 billion &quot; Asia Bond &quot; last year in an effort to match Asia &apos;s financial capital with its financing requirements . 
In a smaller sphere of operations , the ECS envisages economic development in Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar , and Vietnam . 
Under Thaksin , Thailand graduated from aid recipient and became a donor country for the first time , having turned away development assistance from countries like Japan . 
A Thai fund of 10 billion baht was established to provide outright aid and soft loans to the ECS members . 
Like the ACD , the ECS shifts Thai foreign policy priorities to the Southeast Asian mainland , highlighting Thailand &apos;s role and Thaksin &apos;s canny leadership . 
Two major obstacles stand in Thaksin &apos;s way . 
The raging violence in southern Thailand over the past 15 months has made him look bad , as his myriad strategies and tactics have failed repeatedly . 
Nor have his bluster and ill temper improved matters . 
Thaksin initially dismissed the violent attacks as the work of bandits . 
Only late last year did he admit that southern Muslim separatism was the cause . 
Signs of a symbiotic relationship between local separatists and regional terrorists have emerged . 
If the attacks widen beyond the three southernmost provinces of Yala , Pattani , and Narathiwat , Thaksin &apos;s regional leadership chances will be dimmed . 
Thaksin knows this . 
Since his sweeping re-election , he has been surprisingly modest and magnanimous . 
He has appointed Anand Panyarachun , a former Thai prime minister who recently headed a United Nations reform panel , to select and direct a blue-ribbon national commission to seek reconciliation with the southern separatists . 
In addition , Thaksin will have to do something about Myanmar if the international community is to accept his wider role . 
To many , Thai-Myanmar relations are too cozy . 
Critics accuse Thaksin of conflicts of interest , as his family-owned telecommunications conglomerate holds sizeable investments in Myanmar . 
It is now largely up to Thaksin himself . 
If he is enlightened enough to make amends with disaffected southerners and move beyond his vested interests in Myanmar , he retains a good shot at becoming Asia &apos;s next spokesman .
