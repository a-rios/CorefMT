Is International Justice the Enemy of Peace ? 
It is only a little more than fifteen years ago that the first of the contemporary international courts was created to prosecute those who commit war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide . 
That court , the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , may soon mete out justice to a new defendant , following the arrest in Belgrade of Radovan Karadzic , wartime leader of Bosnia &apos;s Serbs . 
Yet there is already a persistent theme in criticism of such tribunals : in their effort to do justice , they are obstructing achievement of a more important goal , peace . 
Such complaints have been expressed most vociferously when sitting heads of state are accused of crimes . 
The charges filed by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court against Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for crimes against humanity and genocide in Darfur are the latest example . &amp; Indeed , the denunciations of the justice process this time are more intense and more vehement than in the past . 
The complaints were also loud in 1995 , when the ICTY &apos;s prosecutor indicted Karadzic and his military chief , General Ratko Mladic , and even louder when they were indicted again later in the same year for the massacre at Srebrenica . 
The timing of that second indictment especially aroused critics , because it came just before the start of the Dayton peace conference . &amp; Because they faced arrest , Karadzic and Mladic did not go to Dayton . 
But , as matters turned out , their absence did not hinder the parties from reaching an agreement . 
Indeed , it may have helped as the leaders of Bosnia , Croatia , and Yugoslavia negotiated an end to the war in Bosnia . 
In 1999 , the ICTY indicted Slobodan Milosevic , President of Yugoslavia , for crimes committed in Kosovo . 
Again , there were denunciations that focused on timing . 
NATO &apos;s intervention in Kosovo was underway , and critics claimed that prosecuting Milosevic made the tribunal an arm of NATO and would prevent a settlement . 
That prediction was wrong . 
Milosevic capitulated two weeks after he was indicted , and the war ended . 
The next sitting head of state to be indicted was Liberian President Charles Taylor . 
Although the prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone indicted Taylor in March 2003 for his crimes in the war that had devastated that country , the indictment was not disclosed publicly until three months later . 
Again , timing was a principal factor in sparking outrage . 
The indictment was made public in June 2003 , while Taylor was attending a peace conference in Ghana that was intended to settle the civil war in his own country . 
As hosts of the conference , the Ghanaians were particularly incensed at being asked to make an arrest under such circumstances , and refused to do so . 
Though it is possible to sympathize with the Ghanaians , who were placed in a very awkward position , the indictment intensified demands for Taylor &apos;s removal . 
Taylor is now being tried in The Hague , and , after two decades of horrendous conflict , Liberia is at peace and rebuilding under a democratic government . 
We cannot rule out the possibility that doing justice in Darfur will make it more difficult to achieve peace there . 
Justice and peace are independent values . 
Each is immensely important in its own right . 
In the long run , doing justice seems a way to contribute to peace , but one cannot be sure that things will work out that way every time . 
On the basis of the record so far , however , some skepticism seems in order over the claim that justice will obstruct peace . 
After all , the conflict in Darfur has been underway for five and a half years . 
An estimated 300,000 people have been killed by forces ultimately controlled by al-Bashir , and an estimated 2.7 million have been forcibly displaced . 
Just a week before the indictment , seven African Union and UN peacekeepers were killed and 22 injured during an ambush by well-armed militiamen . 
No peace settlement is under serious consideration . 
What settlement is there to obstruct ? 
It should be noted that the Darfur case was referred to the ICC by the UN Security Council . 
The treaty establishing the ICC empowers the Security Council to delay a prosecution if this is needed to bring about a peace settlement . 
So critics of the indictment should at least be made to bear the burden of demonstrating to the Security Council that a peace settlement is likely if they wish the Council to act . 
The world embarked on the creation of international criminal tribunals a decade and a half ago in order to end the impunity with which heads of state and leaders of guerrilla groups commit atrocious crimes . 
As the arrest of Karadzic shows , that effort is gradually succeeding .
