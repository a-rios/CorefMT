Where Obama Went Wrong on Iran 
JERUSALEM - The pros and cons of the accord with Iran over its nuclear program will be debated extensively over the next two months , in the run-up to a vote on the deal by the US Congress . 
But the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action will be judged by its implementation , which will take years . 
Nonetheless , two things are already clear . 
First , the JCPOA &apos;s weakest provisions - both cumbersome and open to competing interpretations - are those covering compliance and verification . 
So some skepticism about implementation is in order . 
Second , and more immediately , the very achievement of an agreement between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany ( the P5 + 1 ) has already begun to affect the regional balance of power . 
Indeed , it is legitimate to ask whether Western ( and especially US ) negotiators were aware of the geopolitical implications of the deal . 
Even at this early stage , it is apparent that the agreement has empowered Iran regionally . 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s minority Alawite regime lavished praise on the agreement , rightly recognizing that enhanced international legitimacy and financial resources will enable Shia Iran to provide greater backing . 
Assad &apos;s other major regional ally , Lebanon &apos;s Hezbollah ( which the US classifies as a terrorist organization ) also supports the deal . 
Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia is also happy to have received US assistance , however indirectly , in strengthening Assad &apos;s hold on power . 
Understandably , Iran &apos;s empowerment has made America &apos;s closest allies in the region extremely uncomfortable . 
In their different ways , Israel , Saudi Arabia , and some of the smaller , more vulnerable Gulf states have let their unease be known . 
Turkey - an uncertain US ally nowadays , yet still a NATO member - may be too preoccupied with domestic political turmoil to respond in detail . 
But President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan certainly is skeptical of an agreement that Obama describes in almost messianic terms . 
The Egyptian leadership , also fighting internal challenges , is similarly unhappy with the JCPOA . 
And , whether Israel benefits or loses , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is sure to come out ahead . 
A crafty fear monger , he will be able to present the agreement as further proof of Israel &apos;s isolation and abandonment by the world , enabling him to leverage public anxiety into enhanced political support for his government . 
Netanyahu may even succeed in bringing Yitzhak Herzog &apos;s Zionist Union into his government , thereby shoring up his shaky coalition . 
His comparison of the Iranian threat to the Holocaust may be absurd and obscene , but it is politically effective . 
Nothing helps the Israeli right more than heightening the electorate &apos;s sense of being under siege . 
Obama &apos;s defense of the JCPOA may be helping Netanyahu in this regard , thanks to some historical claims that may be even more dubious than his arguments regarding Iran &apos;s nuclear policies . 
In some of his statements , and in his recent interview with Thomas Friedman of the New York Times , Obama compared the deal with Iran to Richard Nixon &apos;s opening to China in 1972 . 
This is a savvy and enticing claim . 
But it is also a misleading one . 
Nixon &apos;s secretary of state , Henry Kissinger , was pursuing a brilliant strategy to weaken Communism by exploiting the Sino-Soviet split . 
Emulating the French statesman Cardinal Richelieu , Kissinger helped the weaker power against the stronger one . 
No such overarching strategy underlies Obama &apos;s policy , even if it may be justified on the more limited grounds of nuclear non-proliferation . 
In this interview with Friedman , Obama also maintained that one should try to understand Iranian history and culture . 
This sounds unexceptional , even innocuous , until one realizes what Obama means . 
&quot; The fact is that we had some involvement in overthrowing a democratically elected regime in Iran , &quot; he says , referring to the 1953 coup that toppled Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh &apos;s government . 
Moreover , the US &quot; had in the past supported Saddam Hussein when he used chemical weapons against Iran . &quot; 
Therefore , according to Obama , the Iranians have &quot; their own security concerns and their own narratives . &quot; 
This is an extraordinarily ahistorical claim . 
Similarly , one could claim that Germany had its own &quot; security concerns and narratives &quot; during the 1938 Munich crisis . 
Is Obama suggesting that the US should have supported Mosaddegh in the midst of the Cold War , or tilted toward Iran during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s ? 
All of this may say something essential about Obama &apos;s approach to the nuclear deal with Iran . 
Above all , while his negotiators &quot; unremitting focus on the issues before them - centrifuges , enrichment levels , the fate of spent fuel , and so on - undoubtedly permitted the deal to be done , the &quot; success &quot; of this approach has left the future of the region blurrier than ever .
