Consolidation or Competition for Financial Regulators ? 
How many financial regulatory agencies does a country need ? 
Perhaps three or four ? 
How about two hundred ? 
Such questions are gaining in urgency as more and more countries , and the European Union itself , debate whether or not to consolidate financial regulation under the umbrella of one all-powerful body . 
Financial regulators &apos; activities focus on maintaining the integrity of a country &apos;s financial system : its financial institutions and financial transactions . 
Their domain encompasses banks , other depository institutions , insurance companies , securities firms , pension funds , finance companies - indeed , just about any entity that conducts financial transactions . 
The current trend is for countries to consolidate their financial regulatory apparatus into a single agency , with Britain &apos;s Financial Services Agency ( FSA ) a leading example . 
I believe that this trend is a serious mistake which , quite myopically , overlooks the potential for mistakes in regulation . 
Though I do not necessarily advocate 200 financial regulatory agencies ( more about this below ) , I believe that a structure involving multiple financial regulators in a country is likely to create a healthier financial system than would a single all-encompassing regulator . 
The argument for a single regulator is deceptively simple : after all , a single country has a single national government , so why not have a single regulator for all financial regulation ? 
If the European Union is to have a single market , the argument continues , then it needs a single financial regulator . 
Agency rivalries will be avoided . 
No one will be confused as to who is responsible . 
There can be &quot; one stop shopping . &quot; 
Government will speak with &quot; one voice . &quot; 
Fine , as far as it goes . 
But consider another possibility : suppose that the financial regulator is mistaken in its approach to a particular issue . 
A promising financial instrument , capable of improving the efficiency of credit markets , is rejected ; or the agency &apos;s investigative and review procedures become stultified . 
After all , government agencies are not omniscient ; they do make mistakes ; they can become ossified . 
What happens then ? 
With a single financial regulator , where can a rejected financial innovator turn ? 
Where is the alternative forum ? 
How can an agency &apos;s procedures be reformed ? Where are the competitive pressures for innovative thinking in government ? 
Now consider the alternative structure of multiple financial regulatory agencies - say , one for banks , another for other deposit institutions , yet another regulator for insurance , another for securities , maybe another for pensions . 
Yes , this sounds messy , and may duplicate work or become overly compartmentalized . 
But it also creates safety valves , alternative forums , bases of comparison , sources of new ideas , and potential arenas for innovation . Regulatory competition is possible . 
Won &apos;t this mean a regulatory &quot; race to the bottom ? &quot; 
It need not . 
There are many aspects of financial regulation - e.g. , information requirements , entry limitations , facilities limitations - where more choice and competition will often be beneficial . 
An exception may be prudential ( safety-and-soundness ) standards for banks , insurance companies , and some forms of pension plans , which should be tough , because national governments almost always will bear the losses in the event of failures of these types of financial institutions . 
Even here , multiple agencies can lead to beneficial innovations that can reduce the regulatory burden on institutions while maintaining effective levels of safety . 
I write from the perspective of a former American financial regulator . 
In the US there are three national agencies that regulate commercial banks , one that regulates savings institutions , one that regulates credit unions , one that regulates securities markets , one that regulates commodity and financial options / futures markets , and two that regulate pension funds . In addition , the 50 American states each have separate bank regulators ( with overlapping jurisdictions with the national regulators ) , most have savings bank regulators , all have credit union regulators , all have insurance regulators ( which is solely a state responsibility ) , and all have securities regulators . 
Phew ! 
Of course , this system is a little messy ; it does have the problem of duplicated efforts . 
( It &apos;s nearly impossible to explain the details to anyone who hasn &apos;t been an American financial regulator or a lawyer . ) 
But the system works . 
In fact , it works pretty well , though mistakes do occur ( as they do in any regulatory system ) . 
Most important , this multiple agency structure ensures regulatory competition - each agency generally wants to expand its domain of chartering and jurisdiction - that is generally beneficial for the financial system and for the health of the American economy . 
I am not arguing for the world to replicate the American system of 200-plus regulatory agencies . 
Far fewer will suffice for most countries . 
But the next time that someone advocates a single financial regulator and its simplicity , remember that there is another side to that coin : where are the safety valves ? 
Where are the alternatives ? 
What about errors ? 
How will innovation occur ? 
In government ( as well as in the private sector ) a golden rule is that more competition and less monopoly is likely to be beneficial .
