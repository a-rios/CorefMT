The Meaning of Chernobyl 
KYIV - It began as a grey and muddy spring day , like so many others in my homeland . 
Of course , none of us knew the precise moment when catastrophe struck at Chernobyl 25 years ago . 
Back then , we lived under a system that denied ordinary people any right whatsoever to know about even essential facts and events . 
But the more bizarre fact about the Chernobyl disaster , we now know , is that Mikhail Gorbachev , General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , was also kept in the dark about the magnitude of the disaster . 
Indeed , it may be this very fact that finally condemned the old system to the dustbin of history a mere five years later . 
No regime built on limitless self-delusion is capable of retaining a shred of legitimacy once the scale of its self-deception is exposed . 
Because only fragments of reliable information reached ordinary Ukrainians at the time , my memories of Chernobyl are necessarily sketchy . 
I recall now only the first hushed , frightened whispers of disaster from a family friend . 
I remember the abject fear I felt for my young daughter . 
A virtual torrent of near hysterical hearsay and trickledown stories about the disaster soon followed . 
But even 25 years later I find it difficult to connect what I really know of the disaster with when I came to know it . 
Today , the Chernobyl meltdown is judged severely in both moral and metaphysical terms . 
It cast a dark shadow over humanity , one unseen since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 . 
But , unlike Japan &apos;s Fukushima nuclear crisis , Chernobyl &apos;s real lesson is not about nuclear-plant safety . 
Ukrainians are being reminded of the consequences of this mindset right now - by a government that has slashed health benefits for the men who heroically fought to contain the Chernobyl disaster . 
So , what was the source of the carelessness with which the Chernobyl crisis was handled ? 
What caused such arrogant unconcern for the health of those who lived near the plant , for those heroic men and women who tried to limit the damage ( whom officials still treat as pawns ) , and for the millions who lived beneath the radioactive cloud as it spread ? 
Government indifference is a strange and unnatural state of mind , in which the lines between crime and punishment , cruelty and compassion , and good and evil blur . 
Having grown up in the USSR , I know that Soviet leaders practically made contempt for suffering and moral concerns a foundation of their philosophy of rule . 
Unaccountable governments are almost inevitably unconcerned about their citizens &quot; fate . 
Can indifference ever be a virtue ? 
Of course , in times of horror such as the Holocaust and Ukraine &apos;s Holodomyr , isolated and powerless individuals may swaddle themselves in indifference simply to retain some shred of sanity . 
It is official indifference , however , that is truly unpardonable , perhaps because indifferent officials never feel the guilt of which Levi wrote . 
Indeed , for some political leaders , indifference is seductive . 
It is so much easier to avert your eyes from citizens than to grapple with their plight . 
It is so much easier - and often less costly - to avoid individuals &quot; tragic circumstances than it is to adjust your policies to their needs . 
For the state official who turns his back on suffering , his country &apos;s citizens lack consequence . 
Their lives are meaningless . 
Their hidden or even visible anguish is worthless , a cipher &apos;s despair . 
Such indifference is more dangerous than anger and hatred . 
Anger can actually be artistically and politically creative . 
Pushkin wrote some of his greatest poems as a result of anger ; 
Beethoven &apos;s great symphonies were written in the grip of overpowering emotions ; and Nelson Mandela , VÃ¡clav Havel , and Aung San Suu Kyi all endured imprisonment because they were angry at the injustice they had witnessed . 
Indifference , by contrast , is never creative , for it means that no response to injustice , and no help for the suffering , will ever come . 
It is the tool of governments that are , in fact , the enemy of their people , for it benefits only the ruler - never the victim , whose pain is magnified by neglect . 
Political prisoners , hungry children , the homeless Chernobyl refugees , or the irradiated workers in need of a lifetime of medical help - to dismiss their plight , to refuse to offer some spark of hope , is to exile them to a netherworld of helplessness . 
Government officials who deny human solidarity in this way deny their own humanity . 
From his prison cell awaiting his execution by Hitler &apos;s Gestapo , Dietrich Bonhoeffer declared that we must all &quot; share in God &apos;s suffering . &quot; 
Indifference for Bonhoeffer was not only a sin , but also a type of punishment . 
This is perhaps the central lesson of Chernobyl : governments that systematically turn a blind eye to their citizens &quot; fate ultimately condemn themselves .
