To Cure the Economy 
NEW YORK - As the economic slump that began in 2007 persists , the question on everyone &apos;s minds is obvious : Why ? 
Unless we have a better understanding of the causes of the crisis , we can &apos;t implement an effective recovery strategy . 
And , so far , we have neither . 
We were told that this was a financial crisis , so governments on both sides of the Atlantic focused on the banks . 
Stimulus programs were sold as being a temporary palliative , needed to bridge the gap until the financial sector recovered and private lending resumed . 
But , while bank profitability and bonuses have returned , lending has not recovered , despite record-low long- and short-term interest rates . 
The banks claim that lending remains constrained by a shortage of creditworthy borrowers , owing to the sick economy . 
And key data indicate that they are at least partly right . 
After all , large enterprises are sitting on a few trillion dollars in cash , so money is not what is holding them back from investing and hiring . 
Some , perhaps many , small businesses are , however , in a very different position ; strapped for funds , they can &apos;t grow , and many are being forced to contract . 
Still , overall , business investment - excluding construction - has returned to 10 % of GDP ( from 10.6 % before the crisis ) . 
With so much excess capacity in real estate , confidence will not recover to its pre-crisis level anytime soon , regardless of what is done to the banking sector . 
The financial sector &apos;s inexcusable recklessness , given free rein by mindless deregulation , was the obvious precipitating factor of the crisis . 
The legacy of excess real-estate capacity and over-leveraged households makes recovery all the more difficult . 
But the economy was very sick before the crisis ; the housing bubble merely papered over its weaknesses . 
Without bubble-supported consumption , there would have been a massive shortfall in aggregate demand . 
Instead , the personal saving rate plunged to 1 % , and the bottom 80 % of Americans were spending , every year , roughly 110 % of their income . 
Even if the financial sector were fully repaired , and even if these profligate Americans hadn &apos;t learned a lesson about the importance of saving , their consumption would be limited to 100 % of their income . 
So anyone who talks about the consumer &quot; coming back &quot; - even after deleveraging - is living in a fantasy world . 
Fixing the financial sector was necessary for economic recovery , but far from sufficient . 
To understand what needs to be done , we have to understand the economy &apos;s problems before the crisis hit . 
First , America and the world were victims of their own success . 
Rapid productivity increases in manufacturing had outpaced growth in demand , which meant that manufacturing employment decreased . 
Labor had to shift to services . 
The problem is analogous to that which arose at the beginning of the twentieth century , when rapid productivity growth in agriculture forced labor to move from rural areas to urban manufacturing centers . 
With a decline in farm income in excess of 50 % from 1929 to 1932 , one might have anticipated massive migration . 
But workers were &quot; trapped &quot; in the rural sector : they didn &apos;t have the resources to move , and their declining incomes so weakened aggregate demand that urban / manufacturing unemployment soared . 
For America and Europe , the need for labor to move out of manufacturing is compounded by shifting comparative advantage : not only is the total number of manufacturing jobs limited globally , but a smaller share of those jobs will be local . 
Globalization has been one , but only one , of the factors contributing to the second key problem - growing inequality . 
Shifting income from those who would spend it to those who won &apos;t lowers aggregate demand . 
By the same token , soaring energy prices shifted purchasing power from the United States and Europe to oil exporters , who , recognizing the volatility of energy prices , rightly saved much of this income . 
The final problem contributing to weakness in global aggregate demand was emerging markets &quot; massive buildup of foreign-exchange reserves - partly motivated by the mismanagement of the 1997-98 East Asia crisis by the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury . 
Countries recognized that without reserves , they risked losing their economic sovereignty . 
But , while the buildup of reserves - currently around $ 7.6 trillion in emerging and developing economies - protected them , money going into reserves was money not spent . 
Where are we today in addressing these underlying problems ? 
To take the last one first , those countries that built up large reserves were able to weather the economic crisis better , so the incentive to accumulate reserves is even stronger . 
Similarly , while bankers have regained their bonuses , workers are seeing their wages eroded and their hours diminished , further widening the income gap . 
Moreover , the US has not shaken off its dependence on oil . 
With oil prices back above $ 100 a barrel this summer - and still high - money is once again being transferred to the oil-exporting countries . 
And the structural transformation of the advanced economies , implied by the need to move labor out of traditional manufacturing branches , is occurring very slowly . 
Government plays a central role in financing the services that people want , like education and health care . 
And government-financed education and training , in particular , will be critical in restoring competitiveness in Europe and the US . 
But both have chosen fiscal austerity , all but ensuring that their economies &quot; transitions will be slow . 
The prescription for what ails the global economy follows directly from the diagnosis : strong government expenditures , aimed at facilitating restructuring , promoting energy conservation , and reducing inequality , and a reform of the global financial system that creates an alternative to the buildup of reserves . 
Eventually , the world &apos;s leaders - and the voters who elect them - will come to recognize this . 
But how much pain will we have to bear in the meantime ?
