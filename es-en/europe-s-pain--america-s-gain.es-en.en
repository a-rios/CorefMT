Europe \ u0027s Pain , America \ u0027s Gain 
Is economic recovery around the corner , as promised by the leaders of the G8 , the group of the world &apos;s richest countries that held their annual meeting in Evian , France last week ? 
Many economic stars are indeed aligned for recovery , both in the US and in Europe . 
Oil prices are coming down from their highs during the Iraq war and , under plausible scenarios , may be heading for a greater fall . 
Investors all over the world are emerging from their Brazil-Enron-Iraq jitters . 
The risk premium is falling , pushing stock prices higher and lowering yields on long-term bonds . 
Moreover , the overhang of excess capital that accumulated during the crazy high-tech boom of the 1990 &apos;s has now been mostly worked out . 
Investment rates have been low for three years in a row . 
Now only a few sectors suffer from excess capital accumulation . 
Firms are ready to invest again . 
All good news . 
But there , alas , the similarities between Europe and America end . 
Monetary and fiscal policy are working at full throttle in the US , but are muzzled in Europe . 
In the US , Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did his job in 2001 and 2002 , aggressively cutting interest rates . 
When monetary policy could not do much more , the Bush administration took up the charge - and with relish . 
The US budget has gone from a surplus of 1.4 % of GDP in 2000 to a forecast deficit of 4.6 % in 2003 , a 6 % swing - of which about 5 % is due to changes in policy rather than the weak economy . 
This may be fiscally irresponsible ( together with the tax cuts put in place for the future , it surely is irresponsible ) , but in the short run , it provides an enormous boost to demand . 
In Europe , however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has been far more careful . 
True , as a new institution it has had to establish its credibility , but the result is a smaller , slower decrease in interest rates . 
Fiscal policy in Europe is constrained by the Stability and Growth Pact . 
The budget for the Euro area has gone from a surplus of 0.1 % in 2000 to a forecast deficit of 2.4 % for 2003 , nearly all of it due to the weak economy , not to changes in fiscal policy . 
Governments tinker at the margin , cheating a bit , and get reprimanded by the European Commission in Brussels . 
In the best of scenarios , what will happen is likely to fall short of the major short-run fiscal expansion Europe needs . 
This would require Europe &apos;s governments to increase their deficits in the short run , while improving the long run outlook through serious pension reform . 
Some governments - most notably France and Germany - are trying to do the second . 
They should feel freer to do the first . 
America and Europe are not only following divergent economic policies , but their currencies are also diverging because the world is going through a major exchange-rate realignment . 
The dollar is depreciating , while the Euro is appreciating mightily . 
There is a deep and sad irony to the current depreciation of the dollar . 
The depreciation is the price America must pay for past sins - i.e. , a huge current account deficit that foreign investors are no longer willing to finance , at least not at the size of 4 % or more of US GDP . 
The irony is that this dollar adjustment is unambiguously good news for America , and unambiguously bad news for Europe : 
For the US , the dollar &apos;s fall means a boost to exports , and a further increase in demand , a further push for recovery . 
It also means a bit more inflation , but in today &apos;s world , a bit more inflation is good , not bad . 
For Europe , the rising Euro means lower competitiveness and further economic contraction . 
The effects are far from negligible : The best estimates are that a 10 % appreciation of the Euro will bring a decrease in demand and output of 0.6 % of GDP in the Euro area . 
So far , the Euro &apos;s appreciation is close to 30 % from the lows of two years ago , and there is every reason to believe that even more strengthening is to come . 
The Euro is the only currency against which the dollar can depreciate . 
( The last thing Japan needs is an appreciation of the yen . ) 
It will take more than what we have seen so far to return the US current account deficit to reasonable proportions . 
With contraction and Euro appreciation comes the specter of falling prices , with which Europe is already flirting . 
The Euro &apos;s appreciation may well be the tipping factor that triggers deflation . 
As the now ten-year-old Japanese slump tells us , once deflation and contraction have established themselves , standard policies stop working . 
Europe does not want to find itself in this position . 
So , the G8 leaders are half right . 
Between falling oil prices , aggressive fiscal and monetary policies , and the dollar &apos;s depreciation , it is hard to see what stands in the way of a strong recovery in the US . 
But this does not translate into recovery in Europe . 
In Europe , monetary caution , self-imposed fiscal constraints , and the Euro &apos;s appreciation all lead to clear dangers : deflation and a prolonged slump . 
This is not preordained ; many fundamentals in Europe are right , and a simple change in mood may spur recovery . 
But this is the time for strong contingency plans . 
Sadly , I do not see them being prepared .
