Thai Lessons for China 
BEIJING - Whatever the effects of political turmoil in Thailand , they are not helping the cause of democracy in China . 
The images of pro-democracy protesters and the subsequent military crackdown in downtown Bangkok have been openly shown in Chinese media without any apparent bias . 
Indeed , there is no need to embellish the political message for China . 
If a relatively well-off and religious country known as the &quot; land of smiles &quot; can so rapidly degenerate into bloody class warfare , what would happen if the Chinese Communist Party lost its monopoly on power ? 
It is not hard to imagine a Chinese-style red-shirt rebellion , with populist leaders tapping resentment and hot-headed youth torching symbols of power and privilege in Beijing . 
If multi-party democracy leads to violent and uncompromising electoral blocs , then most reflective people will prefer one-party rule that ensures social stability . 
Still , it would be a mistake for the Chinese government to treat the events in Thailand as an excuse to postpone political reform . 
The gap between rich and poor is about the same in both countries , and there are tens of thousands of class-based &quot; illegal disturbances &quot; in China every year . 
The Chinese government is promoting social welfare in the countryside , but it must also give more institutional expression to social grievances . 
Can China open up without going the way of multi-party rule ? 
In fact , the great nineteenth-century British political thinker John Stuart Mill advocated liberal government without multi-party rule . 
In his classic work Considerations on Representative Government , he denounced &quot; the shibboleth of the party . &quot; 
In a democracy , the party of the majority is most likely to be constituted by those &quot; who cling most tenaciously to the exclusive class interest . &quot; 
Instead of multi-party politics , Mill favored democratic elections constrained by such mechanisms as extra votes for the educated and institutional mechanisms to protect the rights of minorities . 
In Mill &apos;s view , an open society ruled mainly by educated elites is the most desirable form of government . 
In a similar vein , the Confucian tradition has long emphasized the value of political meritocracy . 
Confucius himself emphasized that everybody should have an equal opportunity to be educated . 
Hence , an important task of the political process is to select those with above-average morality and ability . 
In subsequent Chinese history , the meritocratic ideal was institutionalized by means of the Imperial examination system . 
Confucians do not oppose electoral democracy , but they argue that it must be constrained by meritocratically selected political leaders who look after the interests of non-voters . 
Democracies can do a good job of representing the interests of voters , but nobody represents the interests of non-voters - including future generations and foreigners ( consider global warming ) - who are affected by government policies . 
That should be the task of meritocratically selected elites . 
As it happens , the Chinese Communist Party is becoming more meritocratic . 
Since the 1980 &quot; s , an increasing proportion of new cadres have university degrees , and cadres are promoted partly on the basis of examinations . 
The elites are also supposed to rule in the interest of all , and to allow for their voices to be heard . 
In practice , it means a more open and representative political system , but not necessarily multi-party politics .
