Double-Dip Days 
NEW YORK - The global economy , artificially boosted since the recession of 2008-2009 by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus and financial bailouts , is headed towards a sharp slowdown this year as the effect of these measures wanes . 
Worse yet , the fundamental excesses that fueled the crisis - too much debt and leverage in the private sector ( households , banks and other financial institutions , and even much of the corporate sector ) - have not been addressed . 
Private-sector deleveraging has barely begun . 
Moreover , there is now massive re-leveraging of the public sector in advanced economies , with huge budget deficits and public-debt accumulation driven by automatic stabilizers , counter-cyclical Keynesian fiscal stimulus , and the immense costs of socializing the financial system &apos;s losses . 
At best , we face a protracted period of anemic , below-trend growth in advanced economies as deleveraging by households , financial institutions , and governments starts to feed through to consumption and investment . 
At the global level , the countries that spent too much - the United States , the United Kingdom , Spain , Greece , and elsewhere - now need to deleverage and are spending , consuming , and importing less . 
But countries that saved too much - China , emerging Asia , Germany , and Japan - are not spending more to compensate for the fall in spending by deleveraging countries . 
Thus , the recovery of global aggregate demand will be weak , pushing global growth much lower . 
The global slowdown - already evident in second-quarter data for 2010 - will accelerate in the second half of the year . 
Fiscal stimulus will disappear as austerity programs take hold in most countries . 
Inventory adjustments , which boosted growth for a few quarters , will run their course . 
The effects of tax policies that stole demand from the future - such as incentives for buyers of cars and homes - will diminish as programs expire . 
The likely scenario for advanced economies is a mediocre U-shaped recovery , even if we avoid a W-shaped double dip . 
In the US , annual growth was already below trend in the first half of 2010 ( 2.7 % in the first quarter and estimated at a mediocre 2.2 % in April-June ) . 
Growth is set to slow further , to 1.5 % in the second half of this year and into 2011 . 
Whatever letter of the alphabet US economic performance ultimately resembles , what is coming will feel like a recession . 
Mediocre job creation and a further rise in unemployment , larger cyclical budget deficits , a fresh fall in home prices , larger losses by banks on mortgages , consumer credit , and other loans , and the risk that Congress will adopt protectionist measures against China will see to that . 
In the eurozone , the outlook is worse . 
Growth may be close to zero by the end of this year , as fiscal austerity kicks in and stock markets fall . 
Sharp rises in sovereign , corporate , and interbank liquidity spreads will increase the cost of capital , and increases in risk aversion , volatility , and sovereign risk will undermine business , investor , and consumer confidence further . 
The weakening of the euro will help Europe &apos;s external balance , but the benefits will be more than offset by the damage to export and growth prospects in the US , China , and emerging Asia . 
Even China is showing signs of a slowdown , owing to the government &apos;s attempts to control economic overheating . 
The slowdown in advanced economies , together with a weaker euro , will further dent Chinese growth , bringing its 11 % -plus growth rate towards 7 % by the end of this year . 
This is bad news for export growth in the rest of Asia and among commodity-rich countries , which increasingly rely on Chinese imports . 
An important victim will be Japan , where anemic real income growth is depressing domestic demand and exports to China sustain what little growth there is . 
Japan also suffers from low potential growth , owing to a lack of structural reforms and weak and ineffective governments ( four prime ministers in four years ) , a large stock of public debt , unfavorable demographic trends , and a strong yen that gets stronger during bouts of global risk aversion . 
A scenario in which US growth slumps to 1.5 % , the eurozone and Japan stagnate , and China &apos;s growth slows below 8 % may not imply a global contraction , but , as in the US , it will feel like one . 
The potential sources of such a shock are legion . 
The eurozone &apos;s sovereign-risk problems could worsen , leading to another round of asset-price corrections , global risk aversion , volatility , and financial contagion . 
A vicious cycle of asset-price correction and weaker growth , together with downside surprises that are not currently priced by markets , could lead to further asset-price declines and even weaker growth - a dynamic that drove the global economy into recession in the first place . 
And one cannot exclude the possibility of an Israeli military strike on Iran in the next 12 months . 
If that happens , oil prices could rapidly spike and , as in the summer of 2008 , trigger a global recession . 
Finally , policymakers are running out of tools . 
Additional monetary quantitative easing will make little difference , there is little room for further fiscal stimulus in most advanced economies , and the ability to bail out financial institutions that are too big to fail - but also too big to be saved - will be sharply constrained . 
So , as the optimists &quot; delusional hopes for a rapid V-shaped recovery evaporate , the advanced world will be at best in a long U-shaped recovery , which in some cases - the eurozone and Japan - may be long enough to stretch into an L-shaped near-depression . 
In such a world , recovery in the stronger emerging markets - the great hope for the global economy - will suffer , because no country is an island economically . 
Indeed , growth in many emerging-market economies - starting with China - is highly dependent on retrenching advanced economies . 
Fasten your seat belts for a very bumpy ride .
