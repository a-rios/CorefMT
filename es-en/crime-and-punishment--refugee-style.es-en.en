Crime and Punishment , Refugee Style 
The horrible murder of Giovanna Reggiani that took place near a Romanian refugee camp in the suburb of Tor di Quinto in Rome shocked both Italy and Romania . 
The case gained significance by adding fuel to the fiery public debates now underway not only in Italy but across Europe on the status of refugees and foreign residents . 
Some Italians responded violently ; some Italian and Romanian politicians , eager to offer quick and tough solutions , made scandalous statements that echoed the xenophobic and totalitarian slogans of the past . 
We are encountering , not without irony , a kind of grotesque reverse of the &quot; national pride &quot; seen when cultural and sporting stars are appropriated by the state and presented as part of the collective patrimony . 
Although the murder was an individual crime , to compound the tragedy of a crime through measures that target an entire minority is irresponsible , and will have grave moral and social consequences not only for the unjustly punished but also for the punishers . 
No minority is , after all , homogenous , which was demonstrated by the fact that the person who alerted the police was a compatriot of the killer and from the same camp of refugees . 
Collective punishment also means not only a type of amnesia by Italians and Romanians about what happened under fascism , nazism , communism , but also for their own national histories . 
Italians , after all , migrated not only from Italy &apos;s south to its north , but also to other countries looking for a better life . 
They , too , know what it is like to be a refugee , an exile , a stranger . 
Romania , for its part , has a history not at all admirable in regard to it its &quot; Roma &quot; minority , whose shortcomings and deeds always attract blame but never any real action by the state to improve their condition . 
The Roma minority first appeared in Romania in the 14th century , but only in 1856 was its slavery abolished ! 
Romanian society nowadays is dealing with the consequences of decades of terror and lies , of demagogy and poverty that scarred several generations . 
These wounds cannot be instantly healed . 
Communism &apos;s fall unleashed a huge surge of human energy , but this started with a bizarre and cynical transfer of privileges and assets within the old &quot; nomenklatura , &quot; and with a new general Darwinian struggle . 
Although economic progress is visible across Romania , and a gradual renewal of a civic conscience through the arrival of democracy has appeared , Romania &apos;s burlesque of a political life - despite its European Union membership - shows how persistent its bad old habits of duplicity , inconsistency , fatalism , inertia , and corruption are . 
Corruption , indeed , now seems to be the society &apos;s engine . 
There remain in Romania today disadvantaged and neglected groups who are pushed to society &apos;s sordid margins . 
The Roma population , indeed , has 41 % seasonal workers , 33.5 % lack any professional skills , 38.7 % are illiterate . 
This is not only a Romanian problem , but has become a problem for all of Europe . 
Nicolae Romulus Mailat , the young man of 25 accused of Giovanna Reggianni &apos;s murder , had been interned at age 14 in a school for re-education . 
He was later condemned again for theft , but was pardoned a year before arriving in Italy . 
Was poverty the cause of his juvenile offenses in Romania and his crime in Italy ? 
In Dostoievski &apos;s great novel Crime and Punishment , Raskolnikov is pushed to committing his crime not only by his nihilism and rebelliousness , but also by poverty . 
His social identity is not the same as Mailat &apos;s , his spiritual &quot; entity &quot; is drastically different , but his double crime is no less abominable . 
For now , there is no reason to hope that Mailat will find through his crime a new start towards salvation through suffering and spiritual renewal . 
But perhaps we should hear again the words of one of Raskolnikov &apos;s interlocutors when he speaks about the &quot; disgusting Sodome &quot; in which he wanders and says that poverty is not a vice , but misery . 
In poverty one still keeps a kind of &quot; innate noble sentiment , &quot; while in misery moral collapse is inherent and disastrous . 
Mailat sought escape from his Romanian misery and his Romanian past , but could not imagine that he would find in an Italian refugee camp as much misery as before ; that the image in the mirror of his daily new life would be that of a killer . 
People who know the frightening neighborhood of Tor di Quinto , where Giovanna Reggiani was killed have harsh words to say about the neglect and indifference of Rome &apos;s city government . 
This isn &apos;t , of course , an excuse for this crime or for any crime , but it cannot be ignored . 
Although we cannot expect a miraculous reincarnation of the criminal Mailat , we can and must ask for a radical review of the situation that marginalized people like him face . 
That review must be done not only by Romanian and Italian states , but by the Roma community in Romania and Italy and also by the European community itself . 
We hear voices now who are exasperated by the EU &apos;s enlargement and the social tensions it provoked . 
Increased migration is , indeed , a daily fact in our centrifugal and global modernity , but it isn &apos;t only a negative one . 
The free movement of people doesn &apos;t only mean more social conflict and criminality . 
When I visited Barcelona and Madrid last year , I was delighted to receive enthusiastic news about the successes of the growing Romanian community in these cities . 
Some Romanian refugees were already candidates for the local elections , praised for their hard work and honesty . 
It will happen , I hope , also in other places and not only with Romanians but with all the people ready to face the provocations of our time . 
For these are examples not only of individual success , but are victories for the community as well . 
Europe deserves to prove that it is a real community , one diverse , democratic , spiritual , free , and prosperous .
