Playboy and the Mullah 
Indonesia recently witnessed a pair of dramatic releases : one a radical Muslim cleric from prison , the other a saucy men &apos;s magazine from its editors . 
Both Abu Bakar Ba &apos;asyir and Playboy are now out on the streets and in the public eye , but neither is as significant as its opponents claim . 
Their releases and the public debate to which they have contributed , however , cut straight to the heart of the ongoing struggle for Indonesia &apos;s self-identity - a struggle which has taken a dramatic turn of late . 
Abu Bakar Ba &apos;asyir is a radical Muslim cleric who was convicted of blessing the original 2002 Bali bombing , and suspected by some of providing much more . 
His name is on a UN list of terrorists , and undoubtedly Indonesia and the rest of the world would be safer if he were still in prison . 
But his release in itself is not , as some charge , evidence that Indonesia is becoming more radicalized . 
Ba &apos;asyir was released for the simple reason that the law required it : he had completed his 30-month sentence . 
Indonesia &apos;s government would undoubtedly prefer to see Ba &apos;asyir languish in jail , but without any legal measure to justify continued detention , it had little option but to release him . 
Having done so , the government has been quick to impose a travel ban , freeze his bank accounts , and make clear that it will monitor his activities closely . 
Ba &apos;asyir &apos;s release is undeniably unfortunate and possibly dangerous - but it is the consequence of legal proceedings , not any sudden radicalization of Indonesia . 
The case of Playboy is a much more accurate barometer of the state of religious radicalism in Indonesia . 
When Playboy unveiled plans for a nudity-free Indonesian edition early this year , it was denounced by politicians and conservative religious leaders as a threat to traditional values . 
The national parliament introduced an &quot; Anti-Pornography Bill , &quot; which turned out to be a vaguely-worded document with the potential to outlaw not only pornography , but also certain traditional dances , sunbathing , and public kissing . 
The proposed bill attracted support from moderate Muslim leaders , but its most vocal advocates were a collection of radical religious groups with a predilection for violence , led by the Islamic Defenders Front ( known by its Indonesian acronym , FPI ) . 
This year alone , these self-appointed moral vigilantes have ransacked bars and nightclubs , attacked the American and Danish embassies , and stoned the offices of Playboy after its first edition - all with only occasional protests from the police . 
The FPI and its brethren took up the anti-pornography bill with vigor , organizing demonstrations in support and denouncing anyone who dared oppose it . 
In the months following Playboy &apos;s announcement , the public backlash against the magazine appeared to have pushed the Indonesian mainstream firmly to the right , an impression only furthered by the high visibility and loud belligerence of radical groups . 
Moderate Muslim activists and intellectuals tried valiantly to counter the radicals , but seemed unable to gain traction . 
Late this spring , something changed , and within a few weeks moderates made dramatic public advances . 
The most striking demonstration of this political shift came after an incident in central Java , in which a speech by former President Gus Dur was interrupted by FPI members who denounced him for supporting pluralism and opposing the anti-pornography bill . 
It was a public attack on a respected national and religious leader , and it was answered quickly by the leaders of the two most important Muslim organizations in the country . 
Newly emboldened , the government pledged to crackdown on groups that engage in violence , and announced plans to empower authorities to disband organizations that threaten &quot; security and order . &quot; 
The Jakarta police have begun acting with new vigor : they charged one prominent radical leader with defamation for publicly calling women opposed to the anti-pornography bill &quot; evil , wretched , and immoral , &quot; and then arrested the chairman and twenty members of FPI for attacking a group of cafes . 
A national dialogue about fostering pluralism is now in progress , and has inspired renewed public interest in Pancasila , the national philosophy discredited during the Suharto years but now seen by some as a symbol of Indonesia &apos;s historic pluralism . 
Meanwhile , legislators have said they will work to transform the controversial anti-pornography bill into a more targeted anti-smut ordinance . 
As for the Playboy , it has been met with the expected criticism - but no attacks and indeed , not even any demonstrations . 
In sum , a remarkable shift in the national debate  -  from how to make Indonesia more conservatively Islamic , to how to sustain Indonesia &apos;s tradition of religious pluralism into the future - has taken place . 
The releases of Ba &apos;asyir and publication of Playboy , however controversial , will not themselves alter this new discourse , but they offer an insightful glimpse into just how dramatically things are changing in Indonesia . 
The moderate agenda has gained important ground this month - but the struggle to establish Indonesia &apos;s political and religious identity is far from over .
