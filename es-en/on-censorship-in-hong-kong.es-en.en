On Censorship in Hong Kong 
No jackboots are to be seen marching through Hong Kong &apos;s sleek shopping malls , but a distinct whiff of totalitarianism is in the air . 
The tell-tale phrases are on everyone &apos;s lips : talk of the need for anti-subversion laws , press controls , strong leadership , of adjusting to Hong Kong &apos;s new reality . 
Everyone looks to the great Northern neighbor for direction and mutters about expediency . 
Most of the world lost interest in Hong Kong after 1997 when the &quot; Anschluss &quot; with China did not instantly deliver vast changes . 
Over the last year or two , however , the pace of integration into the People &apos;s Republic of China has quickened decisively . 
Life at the South China Morning Post , Hong Kong &apos;s leading English language newspaper , and so a visible political gauge , offers a window into what is going on all across Hong Kong &apos;s institutions . 
The atmosphere at the paper began to darken noticeably as one after another of its leading editorial lights was pushed out . 
It would be an exaggeration to compare the situation to the way the Nazis took over institutions in Germany in the 1930s , and to how people back then fell in line , because no one is disappearing into concentration camps . 
Hong Kong remains a rich and prosperous place . 
Yet the dictatorship in Beijing has made its presence felt , if only through proxies and collaborators . 
Before I chose to protest to the editor who sacked me a week ago , I was guilty of complicity too . 
I stayed silent when the paper &apos;s popular cartoonist ( Larry Feign ) was unjustly dismissed , and remained silent even after its best satirical writer ( Nury Vittachi ) was sacked . 
I only became uneasy when the British editor ( Jonathan Fenby ) was fired and replaced . 
&quot; I am still OK , &quot; I reasoned . 
&quot; They still let me write what I want ... &quot; 
My job as bureau chief in Beijing isolated me from the struggles in the head office in distant Hong Kong . 
Besides , working in Beijing is itself a constant struggle of conscience and compromise . 
Foreign reporters are under constant surveillance and risk compromising their contacts . 
That means one begins to avoid tough subjects , like the repression of Falun Gong and its followers . 
Gradually , you also noticed a change in the behavior of your HK colleagues . 
As the government proposed to introduce an anti-subversion law and strengthened its control over the civil service , they became guarded in what they said and tightlipped about mentioning the pressures from above . 
Whispered rumors of daily interference from management were only confirmed in private . 
Some people responded opportunistically , seeing the way to promotion open as talented colleagues disappeared . 
So the internationally recognized editor , Willy Lam , was replaced by a mainlander , Wang Xiangwei . 
Those who organized this coup hoped that it would lead to greater things for themselves ; those who signed a petition of protest were fired not long after . 
Management then began to quietly spread word that the paper needed people able to &quot; negotiate &quot; with the sensibilities of the Communist Party . 
Curiously , some officials in Beijing complained about the crude tactics of those sent to run Hong Kong . 
It seemed the urge to collaborate actually ran ahead of the party &apos;s demands . 
The paper &apos;s tone began to change , becoming increasingly deferential toward China &apos;s rulers . 
Reporting became blander and blander . 
Management talked of the virtues of writing to allow readers to read between the lines . 
These changes speeded up over recent months . 
Even the office photographer began to notice different photographic choices . 
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office took charge of the paper &apos;s correspondents based on the mainland , demanding that they be replaced by ethnic Chinese . 
Then they began to offer guidance on reporting in exchange for favors like access to officials . 
Despite the obviousness as to where all this was leading , individuals responded differently . 
Some continued to deny what was happening , and became indignant if the issue was raised . 
Others reasoned that if they kept their head down and compromised , the crisis would pass . 
A sort of listlessness now grips Hong Kong , particularly the civil service . 
The business sector remains unaffected and continues to talk optimistically of the prospects opened up by closer integration with the mainland . 
But Hong Kong is surrendering the uniqueness and exceptional position it once held over the Chinese world . 
As other Chinese cities become more free and more confident , Hong Kong is submissively abandoning the freedoms it once held with pride . 
In 1997 , China promised to preserve these freedoms for 50 years under the one county , two systems mantra . 
Now Hong Kong itself is undoing the system . 
Many of its tycoons ( one of whom , Robert Kuok , controls the South Morning China Post ) are jettisoning their autonomy for the sake of business - even when such action is not requested . 
They seem blind to the value of what they are sacrificing . 
The intangibles of freedom will determine the vitality and future of Hong Kong . 
Tragically , such losses never appear on the profit sheets measured by accountants .
