The Changing Development Order 
DUBAI - The Millennium Development Goals established a successful framework for the world to address fundamental social issues such as poverty , health , hunger , and education . 
As discussions commence on the shape and scope of the global development agenda that will succeed the MDGs , which expire in 2015 , it would be helpful to consider the role of the private sector and rethink the international community &apos;s overall approach to development . 
Economic development is the best way - indeed , the only way - to achieve sustainable poverty reduction . 
Growth creates jobs , and jobs reduce poverty . 
The private sector has a key role to play . 
Private-sector capital flows now dwarf traditional public-sector aid flows . 
For example , of the $ 200 billion in total US resources dedicated to development in 2010 , 87 % came from private flows . 
By contrast , in the 1960 &quot; s , official overseas development assistance accounted for 70 % of capital flows into developing countries . 
A similar picture prevails globally . 
Domestic resource mobilization , remittances from expatriate workers , private debt and equity flows , and philanthropic contributions exceed official international aid by a wide margin . 
Private flows are no longer the tail , but the dog that wags the development agenda . 
Nonetheless , much of the development-policy community remains stuck in the distant past . 
For example , policymakers insist on the importance of &quot; public-private partnerships &quot; and argue that the private sector needs &quot; to learn to work with the public sector . &quot; 
But today &apos;s reality would be better described as &quot; private-philanthropic-public partnerships &quot; ( expressed in that order to reflect each component &apos;s relative importance ) , or &quot; P-4 . &quot; 
We need to persuade public institutions to focus on how to work better with their private counterparts , not vice versa , because the public and private sectors have a shared interest in accelerating economic development and ensuring that everyone benefits from globalization . 
This is not meant to diminish the important role played by the public sector , which alone can create the conditions - the rule of law , sound macroeconomic policies , and good regulatory regimes - needed for the private sector to flourish . 
For example , they catalyze the development of supportive property and customs regimes , including the establishment of credit bureaus and laws to protect creditors &quot; rights - all necessary prerequisites to channel financing flows . 
Possibly the biggest prize in aligning private- and public-sector development efforts lies in the relatively unexplored area of blended finance . 
We have barely scratched the surface in integrating the efforts of development finance institutions ( DFIs ) with private and philanthropic initiatives , which could make the whole greater than the sum of its parts . 
A World Economic Forum study estimates that , when aligned , an annual increase of only $ 36 billion in public-sector investment in climate change could be leveraged to 16 times that amount by mobilizing $ 570 billion of private capital . 
In fact , to improve alignment and reflect the new P-4 order , government agencies and DFIs should be encouraged to establish explicit targets for leveraging private capital . 
Particularly in an age of lean governments and public austerity , success in meeting such targets should become a key performance indicator . 
What should the private sector do better ? 
While there are many examples of responsible companies that want to &quot; do well by doing good , &quot; sustainability and development goals are not always integrated into businesses &quot; core agenda . 
Total shareholder return ( TSR ) and corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) often seem completely divorced from each other . 
The thinking , mostly implicit , is that maximizing TSR by polluting the environment is acceptable as long as some compensating contributions are made to CSR initiatives - the corporate equivalent of bathing in the Ganges to wash away one &apos;s sins . 
We need a new standard that requires companies to report not just their financial metrics , but also their performance on social , developmental , and environmental issues . 
For maximum impact , and in order to restore public trust in corporations , the standards must be global , clear , and consistent . 
The other reality of the post-MDG world is the multi-directionality of development flows . 
Traditionally , development flows were unidirectional , going from the wealthy North to the impoverished South . 
But the world order has changed . 
Emerging markets and developing countries now account for 50 % of global GDP and 75 % of global growth , and demographics will further accentuate the shift in the center of economic gravity . 
&quot; Southern &quot; countries such as Brazil , China , and India , to name only a few , are enhancing their contributions to overseas development . 
Domestic resources and diaspora remittances are increasingly funding development . 
Indeed , people in developing countries are increasingly demanding a stronger voice in determining what is good for them . 
The North &apos;s old &quot; we know what is good for you &quot; approach , however well-informed or well-intentioned , will no longer work . 
A more inclusive approach that reflects local conditions and preferences is essential . 
The P-4 approach reflects the new global realities and seeks to leverage the best qualities of the private , philanthropic , and public sectors .
