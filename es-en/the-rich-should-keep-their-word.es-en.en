The Rich Should Keep Their Word 
For the first time in human history , the world is within striking distance of ending global poverty . 
A preposterous claim ? 
Perhaps . 
After all , the poor seem to be everywhere and are increasing in numbers due to global recession , population growth , and economic mismanagement from Argentina to Zimbabwe . 
Yet , I &apos;ll stick to my claim . 
If the world - especially the US and other rich countries - shift a small amount of their military spending to meeting the needs of the world &apos;s poorest people , our generation could free humanity from poverty &apos;s iron grip . 
I am not speaking of relative poverty , the nearly inevitable fact that some members of society are worse off than others , though to some extent that varies society to society . 
I am speaking of the gut-wrenching , life-threatening poverty of living on less than $ 1 per day . 
For the first time ever , the world has it in its power to eliminate those extreme conditions . 
Why is this ? 
The world &apos;s richest countries have continued their economic ascent for generations , carried forward by the flowering of science and technology . 
Even though poor countries seem to be falling ever farther behind , the truth is more heartening . 
Large parts of the so-called developing world , especially in Asia , have made incredible strides away from absolute poverty . 
China is the most striking success here , with hundreds of millions of people enjoying higher living standards in the past twenty years , including better health , nutrition , and sanitation . 
India achieved notable successes more recently , though much remains to be accomplished . 
The poorest of the poor in sub-Saharan Africa and in remote areas of Latin America and Central Asia have not shared these successes . 
At least 1 billion people , perhaps nearly twice that number , live in squalid conditions of hunger , disease , and impoverishment . 
In many of these countries , the past twenty years have marked a time of regress , not progress . 
Disease has swept Africa , with the AIDS pandemic and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis . 
Hunger afflicts hundreds of millions , as world weather patterns seem to become more erratic , with more dangerous droughts and floods associated perhaps with long-term changes in the climate . 
Millions die each year of poverty - lives that could be saved if the poor had access to better health care , nutrition , and other essential needs . 
The extreme poverty of the bottom billion people is shocking , morally intolerable , and dangerous - a breeding ground of disease , terrorism , and violence . 
Yet with the richest countries richer than ever before , and with much of the developing world already escaped from the horrors of extreme poverty , the balance has shifted in favor of ending global poverty . 
Rich countries could enable the poorest of the poor to escape from misery by providing just a tiny fraction of their yearly national income - or , indeed , of their military spending - to overcome the crises of hunger , education , and disease . 
That aid , combined with the market-based economic growth , could end extreme poverty . 
Importantly , rich countries are committed to working with the poorest countries to meet these objectives . 
But as with many promises , America and other donor countries have so far failed to live up to their pledges . 
At the UN &apos;s Millennium Summit in September 2000 , the world &apos;s leaders made solemn pledges to tackle global poverty . 
They issued a declaration calling for action now , so that extreme poverty can be dramatically reduced by the year 2015 . 
They even pledged to mobilize financial assistance . 
Within the broad Millennium Declaration is a set of specific targets for reducing poverty , disease , hunger , illiteracy , and environmental degradation . 
They provide explicit , detailed commitments . 
For example , rich and poor countries together have committed to reducing infant mortality rates by two-thirds as of 2015 , compared with the levels in countries as of 1990 . 
Sadly , for dozens of countries around the world , that target is not being met , because too little money is invested in health . 
Many studies , including those that I did for the World Health Organization , show that for a modest amount of money worldwide , perhaps an extra $ 50 - $ 100 billion per year in aid from rich countries , the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved . 
That may seem like a lot of money , but not in comparison with the $ 25 trillion in income each year earned by rich countries , or the roughly $ 500 billion spent each year on their militaries . 
Much of the world looks at the US and other rich countries with resentment , feeling that they don &apos;t keep their commitments to help less fortunate countries . 
The rich world can redeem itself , indeed promote its interests in global peace and prosperity , by proving that the Millennium Development Goals are not empty words . 
The key test of those commitments will come next month at a UN Conference in Monterrey , Mexico on Finance for Development . 
The conference will focus on the bottom line - where is the money to fight poverty and disease ? 
Will the rich follow promises with actions ? 
In Monterrey , rich countries can show the rest of humanity , especially the poorest of the poor , that they &apos;ve gotten the message . 
Let &apos;s hope , for our common future , that the world &apos;s leaders get it right this time around .
