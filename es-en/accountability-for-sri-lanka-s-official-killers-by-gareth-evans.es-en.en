Remembering Sri Lanka &apos;s Killing Fields 
NEW YORK - One of the worst atrocity crime stories of recent decades has barely registered in the world &apos;s collective conscience . 
We remember and acknowledge the shame of Cambodia , Rwanda , Bosnia , and Darfur . 
We agonize about the failure to halt the atrocities being committed almost daily in Syria . 
But , at least until now , the world has paid almost no attention to war crimes and crimes against humanity comparable in their savagery to any of these : the killing fields of Sri Lanka in 2009 . 
Three years ago , in the bloody endgame of the Sri Lankan government &apos;s war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , some 300,000 civilians became trapped between the advancing army and the last LTTE fighters in what has been called &quot; the cage &quot; - a tiny strip of land , not much larger than New York City &apos;s Central Park , between sea and lagoon in the northeast of the country . 
With both sides showing neither restraint nor compassion , at least 10,000 civilians - possibly as many as 40,000 - died in the carnage that followed , as a result of indiscriminate army shelling , rebel gunfire , and denial of food and medical supplies . 
The lack of outrage mainly reflects the Sri Lankan government &apos;s success in embedding in the minds of policymakers and publics an alternative narrative that had extraordinary worldwide resonance in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
What occurred in the cage , according to this narrative , was the long-overdue defeat , by wholly necessary and defensible means , of a murderous terrorist insurrection that had threatened the country &apos;s very existence . 
The other key reason behind the world &apos;s silence is that the Sri Lankan government was relentless in banning independent observers - media , NGOs , or diplomats - from witnessing or reporting on its actions . 
And this problem was compounded by the timidity of in-country United Nations officials in communicating such information as they had . 
President Mahinda Rajapaksa &apos;s government claimed throughout , and still does , that it maintained a &quot; zero civilian casualties &quot; policy . 
Officials argued that no heavy artillery fire was ever directed at civilians or hospitals , that any collateral injury to civilians was minimal , and that they fully respected international law , including the proscription against execution of captured prisoners . 
But that narrative is now being picked apart in a series of recent publications , notably the report last year of a UN Panel of Experts , and in two new books : UN official Gordon Weiss &apos;s relentlessly analytical The Cage : The Fight for Sri Lanka and the Last Days of the Tamil Tigers , and BBC journalist Frances Harrison &apos;s harrowingly anecdotal Still Counting the Dead : Survivors of Sri Lanka &apos;s Hidden War . 
Nobody underplays the LTTE &apos;s contribution to the 2009 savagery ; but , with the Tigers &quot; leaders all dead , international attention should now be focused overwhelmingly on holding the government accountable for its failure to accept its responsibility to protect its own people . 
For far too long , Rajapaska &apos;s government has been evading accountability with an endless stream of diversionary maneuvers ( usually involving committees of inquiry intended to lead nowhere , and duly complying ) , denial of physical access , outright dissimulation , and relentless verbal intimidation of anyone daring to question it . 
Real international pressure is at last being placed on the government to explain its actions , most significantly by the much-maligned UN Human Rights Council in Geneva , which will consider Sri Lanka &apos;s response in March 2013 . 
In doing so , it is likely to be armed with a full brief of evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity now being compiled from eyewitness accounts by the Australian-based International Crimes Evidence Project . 
One of the most tragic aspects of the whole story , just now emerging , is the failure of UN officials on the ground to publicize at the time , when it really mattered , credible information that would have undercut the government &apos;s narrative . 
Specific estimates of casualties in the combat area were compiled by a UN team in Colombo from early 2009 , based on regular radiophone contact with a handful of reliable sources - NGO , medical , and local UN Tamil staff - still on the ground . 
The information was incomplete , but it was solid - and alarming . 
But an institutional decision was taken not to use this information on the grounds that it could not be &quot; verified . &quot; 
The real reasons are now emerging . 
In part , the UN team wanted to keep humanitarian assistance lines open . 
The team was also subjected to shameless verbal bullying by Sri Lankan officials ( a deeply unpleasant experience to which I , too , have been subjected ) . 
The team &apos;s members also knew that Sri Lanka &apos;s government had wide support among UN member states , and that the LTTE had none at all . 
But , as the Lakhdar Brahimi Panel concluded a decade ago , after reviewing some of the catastrophic failures of peace processes in the 1990 &quot; s , the responsibility of the UN Secretariat must be to tell the UN Security Council what it needs to hear , not what it wants to hear . 
An internal review panel studying what went wrong in the UN system &apos;s response to Sri Lanka , commissioned by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and headed by the distinguished diplomat Charles Petrie , is due to report to Ban next month . 
All indications are that it will not be a pretty story . 
It is crucial that its findings be made public and acted upon . 
Selective memory is a defense mechanism with which we are all familiar . 
For governments and international organizations , as with individuals , moral failure is easier to live with if we can pretend that it never happened . 
But mass atrocity crimes did happen in Sri Lanka , there was moral default all around , and if we do not learn from this past , we will indeed be condemned to repeat it .
