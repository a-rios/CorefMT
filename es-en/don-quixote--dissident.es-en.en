Don Quixote , Dissident 
It is now four centuries since the birth of a masterpiece whose author and hero both seem younger than we do . 
The simplest explanation for this may be found in Flaubert &apos;s words about Don Quixote : &quot; I found my origins in this book , which I knew by heart before I learned how to read . &quot; 
Indeed , at the core of Don Quixote is something essential that we knew even before we read it but which became part of our nature only after we completed its mesmerizing journey . 
This is the unmistakable stamp of greatness in a writer . 
Hunting after his own ghost - an obvious sign of inner unhappiness - Hidalgo searched for a place where dreams , reality , sainthood , love , and justice coexist . 
In their burlesque approach to humanity , Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are the most enduring and endearing clownish couple in world literature . 
It is no surprise , then , that for the last 400 years Don Quixote and Panza have bred many relatives and successors , including countless buffoonish boss-and-servant couples . 
Even the history of the circus is focused on such a pairing : the vain , dignified White Clown and Augustus the Fool , the humble loser who is kicked in the pants by his stiff , pompous partner . 
For an East European like myself , it is not easy to ignore the history of the circus - or history itself . 
The solemn Communist Manifesto announced the specter of the Great Utopia haunting Europe , but failed to warn us of the bloody tyranny . 
The gullible Sancho Panza was meant to adopt the revolution &apos;s deceptive dogma as entitlement to wage a brutal war against all . 
The dream of improving the world disguised a farce that affected not only a single life , as in Cervantes &quot; story , and affected not only the misleading army of buffoons believed to be missionaries . 
This dream destroyed generations of victims . 
In the world circus , the poet looks like a Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance , and Augustus the Fool appears ill-equipped for everyday life . 
Like Don Quixote - and Cervantes himself - the artist dreams of other rules and rewards than his fellow men , who are content to digest their everyday lives . 
In the socio-political arena , Augustus the Fool faces the Clown of Power . 
Cervantes &quot; political parody can be read in many twentieth-century East European stories . 
Its incomparable vitality and language , for example , find their way into the work of the Soviet writer Andrei Platonov . 
A communist who considered himself an honest proletarian writer , but called by Stalin , the Red Clown of Power , &quot; svoloc &quot; ( scoundrel ) and &quot; balagancik &quot; ( buffoon ) , Platonov lived a lifelong ordeal . 
His carnivalesque odyssey of totalitarianism displays a world of misery , boredom , and obedience in its dark journey to an unreachable paradise . 
The communist Knight , the new &quot; caballero de la triste figura , &quot; a kind of enlightened idiot , blinded by his loyalty to the unreal and by his harsh political correctness , considers Lenin a new Moses . 
He rides the Rosinante of the Proletarian Force , falls in love with the dead Rosa Luxemburg in her role as Comrade Dulcinea and has intercourse with a locomotive . 
In today &apos;s free-market carnival , nothing seems visible unless it is scandalous and nothing is scandalous enough to be memorable . 
So we pay homage to Cervantes at a time when we routinely co-habit with a very different outrageousness : religious fanaticism and terrorism , political manipulation , the cacophony of perverted simplification , the belligerent marriage between a new messianism and an aggrandizing quixotic blindness . 
So long as we celebrate Cervantes , however , perhaps all is not lost .
