Justice Is Reconciliation 
In South Africa , indeed around the world , we are raised on a strict diet of justice as retribution . 
With violent crimes on a shocking upsurge , with the hideous crimes of child rape and abuse on the increase , there are nowadays frequent calls - backed by wide public support - to restore capital punishment . 
Mercifully , South Africa &apos;s Constitutional Court has ruled that the death penalty - which South Africans eliminated at the same time we were liberated from apartheid - is unconstitutional . 
Sadly , in many places in the world , it seems that men and women have not advanced beyond the biblical admonition of &quot; an eye for an eye &quot; in their yearning for retribution . 
Indeed , some Muslim countries amputate the hands of convicted thieves in public . 
&quot; An eye for an eye &quot; asks that the culprit should be the sole target , and not others , whose only crime was to be related to him . 
So the &quot; eye for an eye &quot; adage was not intended to mean what it has come to mean , namely that killing be paid for by another killing . 
Given the brutality of the apartheid era , that would have never worked in my homeland . 
Some South Africans called for Nuremberg-type trials , especially for perpetrators of those atrocities that were designed to maintain the vicious apartheid system . 
There were demands that the guilty be brought to book . 
But we were fortunate in that Nuremberg was not really an option for us . 
Nuremberg happened because the Allies inflicted unconditional surrender on the Nazis and so could impose a so-called victor &apos;s justice . 
In our case , neither the apartheid government nor the liberation movements could defeat each other . 
We had a military deadlock . 
Moreover , in the case of Nuremberg , the prosecutors and judges could pack up their bags after the trial and leave Germany for their several homes . 
We had to make our homes in this , our common motherland , and learn to live with one another . 
Such trials would probably have gone on nearly forever , leaving gaping wounds open . 
It would have been difficult to procure the evidence to get convictions . 
We all know just how cunning bureaucrats can be in destroying incriminating evidence . 
So it was a mercy that our country chose to go the way of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission - granting amnesty in exchange for the truth . 
This was ultimately based on the principles of restorative justice and ubuntu . 
At the TRC hearings we were exposed to gruesome details about atrocities that were committed to uphold or to oppose apartheid . 
&quot; We gave him drugged coffee and shot him in the head and then we burned his body . 
As it takes 7 - 8 hours for a human body to burn , we had a braaivleis on the side , drinking beer and eating meat . &quot; 
How low men can sink in our inhumanity ! 
Each time such horrible stories were published , we had to remind ourselves that , yes indeed , the acts were demonic , but the perpetrators remained each a child of God . 
A monster has no moral responsibility and so cannot be held accountable ; but even more seriously , designating someone a monster closes the door to possible rehabilitation . 
Restorative justice and ubuntu are based firmly on the recognition of the fundamental humanity of even the worst possible offender . 
We cannot give up on anybody . 
If it was true that people could not change , once a murderer always a murderer , then the whole TRC process would have been impossible . 
It happened because we believed that even the worst racist had the capacity to change . 
And I think we in South Africa have not done badly ; at least that is what the rest of the world seems to think of our transformation and the TRC process . 
Because an &quot; eye for an eye &quot; can never work when communities are in conflict - reprisal leads to a counter-reprisal in the sort of blood spiral we are seeing in the Middle East . 
The type of justice South Africa practiced , what I call &quot; restorative justice &quot; is , unlike retribution , not basically concerned with punishment , it is not fundamentally punitive . 
It sets high store by healing . 
The offence has caused a breach in relations and this breach needs to be healed . 
It regards the offender as a person , as a subject with a sense of responsibility and a sense of shame , who needs to be reintegrated into the community and not ostracised . 
There is a wealth of wisdom in the old ways of African society . 
Justice was a communal affair and society set a high store by social harmony and peace . 
The belief was that a person is a person only through other persons , and a broken person needed to be helped to be healed .What the offence had disturbed should be restored , and the offender and the victim had to be helped to be reconciled . 
Justice as retribution often ignores the victim and the system is usually impersonal and cold . 
Restorative justice is hopeful . 
It believes that even the worst offender can become a better person . 
This does not mean being soft on crime . 
Offenders must realize the seriousness of their offences by the kind of sentences they get , but there must be hope , hope that the offender can become a useful member of society , after paying the price they owe to society . 
When we act as if we really believe that someone can be better , is better , then they will often rise to our expectations .
