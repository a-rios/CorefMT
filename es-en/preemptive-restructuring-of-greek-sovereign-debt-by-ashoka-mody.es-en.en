Greece &apos;s Bogus Debt Deal 
PRINCETON - The process of official forgiveness of Greek debt has begun . 
Referred to as &quot; official sector involvement &quot; ( OSI ) , it includes several initiatives aimed at reducing Greece &apos;s debt / GDP ratio to 124 % in 2020 , from roughly 200 % today . 
Even as the deal was announced , however , newspaper reports suggested that officials recognized that the measures would be insufficient to meet the target ; further negotiations on additional steps would be needed at a politically more convenient moment . 
The economist Larry Summers has invoked the analogy of the Vietnam War to describe European decision-making . 
&quot; At every juncture they made the minimum commitments necessary to avoid imminent disaster - offering optimistic rhetoric , but never taking the steps that even they believed could offer the prospect of decisive victory . &quot; 
This strategy needs to be inverted - and Greece offers a real opportunity to get ahead of the curve . 
Instead of driblets of relief , a sizeable package , composed of two elements , is the way forward . 
First , as Lee Buchheit , the attorney who oversaw the Greek private restructuring , has proposed , maturities on official Greek debt could be greatly extended . 
A simple structure would be to make all debt payable over 40 years , carrying an interest rate of 2 % . 
This would move Greece and its official creditors beyond the continuous angst that now prevails . 
The second element of the debt-relief package would be more innovative : If Greece &apos;s economy performs well , the generous extension of maturities can be clawed back or the interest rate raised . 
A formula for this could be linked to the debt / GDP ratio - a scheme with advantages that transcend the Greek case . 
The idea of linking debt relief to a country &apos;s debt / GDP ratio has been around for a while , but has never gained significant acceptance . 
Applying it in Greece would be a highly visible test ; if successful , it would set a valuable precedent . 
Why bother ? 
Because the very premise of the current deal and the expectations it sets out are wrong . 
First , the notion that there is a smooth transition path for the debt / GDP ratio from 200 % to 124 % is fanciful . 
Second , even if , by some miracle , Greece did reach the 124 % mark by 2020 , the claim that its debt will then be &quot; sustainable &quot; is absurd . 
Thus , continuing down this path will further erode policymakers &quot; credibility - not that they seem to care - while imposing on the rest of the world a persistent sense of crisis and uncertainty , with real financial and economic costs . 
Make no mistake : policymakers &quot; track record on forecasting Greek economic performance during the crisis has been an embarrassment . 
In May 2010 , the International Monetary Fund projected - presumably in concurrence with its European partners - that Greece &apos;s annual GDP growth would exceed 1 % in 2012 . 
Instead , the Greek economy will shrink by 6 % . 
The unemployment rate , expected to peak this year at 15 % , is now above 25 % - and is still rising . 
The debt / GDP ratio was expected to top out at 150 % ; absent the substantial write-down of privately held debt , which was deemed unnecessary , the ratio would have been close to 250 % . 
In September 2010 , four months after the official Greek bailout was put in place , the IMF issued a pamphlet asserting that &quot; default in today &apos;s advanced economies is unnecessary , undesirable , and unlikely . &quot; 
The conclusion was that official financing would carry Greece past its short-term liquidity problems . 
Calls for immediate debt restructuring went unheeded . 
Six months later , after substantial official funds had been used to pay private creditors , the outstanding private debt was substantially restructured . 
Such were the errors committed over short time horizons . 
Relatively speaking , 2020 is an eternity away . 
Even assuming better forecasts , the projection of 124 % could be a gross underestimate . 
The precision of the numbers underpinning the deal is a façade , if not a reflection of an alternate reality . 
And , again , even if Greece somehow did achieve the 124 % milestone , its debt would still not be sustainable . 
At that point , Greece would merely be where it started in May 2010 . 
The most reasonable comparison is with Latin American countries during their debt crises in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
Despite significantly lower debt / GDP ratios and continuous debt restructuring , they eventually needed the large debt reduction that came with the issuance of Brady bonds to achieve some breathing room . 
Getting ahead of the curve will give Greece a realistic chance of controlling its own destiny . 
It will also be a reminder of the dangers of rushing in with official money where private debts have become unsustainable . 
Staying the course , as Summers warns , will lead only to &quot; needless suffering &quot; before that course inevitably collapses , bringing Greece - and much else - ­ crashing down .
