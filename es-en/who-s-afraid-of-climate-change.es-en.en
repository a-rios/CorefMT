Who &apos;s Afraid of Climate Change ? 
COPENHAGEN - Imagine that over the next 70 or 80 years , a giant port city - say , Tokyo - found itself engulfed by sea levels rising as much as 15 feet or more . 
Millions of inhabitants would be imperiled , along with trillions of dollars worth of infrastructure . 
This awful prospect is exactly the sort of thing global-warming evangelists like Al Gore have in mind when they warn that we must take &quot; large-scale , preventive measures to protect human civilization as we know it . &quot; 
The rhetoric may sound extreme , but with so much hanging in the balance , surely it &apos;s justified . 
Without a vast , highly coordinated global effort , how could we possibly cope with sea-level rises on that order of magnitude ? 
Well , we already have . 
In fact , we &apos;re doing it right now . 
Since 1930 , excessive groundwater withdrawal has caused Tokyo to subside by as much as 15 feet , with some of the lowest parts of the downtown area dropping almost a foot per year in some years . 
Similar subsidence has occurred over the past century in a wide range of cities , including Tianjin , Shanghai , Osaka , Bangkok , and Jakarta . 
In each case , the city has managed to protect itself from such large sea-level rises and thrive . 
The point isn &apos;t that we can or should ignore global warming . 
More often than not , what sound like horrific changes in climate and geography actually turn out to be manageable - and in some cases even benign . 
Consider , for example , the findings of climate scientists Robert J. Nicholls , Richard S.J. Tol , and Athanasios T. Vafeidis . 
In research funded by the European Union , they studied what the global economic impact would be if global warming were to result in a collapse of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet . 
An event of this magnitude would likely cause the oceans to rise by perhaps 20 feet over the next hundred years - precisely the sort of thing that environmental activists have in mind when they warn about potential end-of-the-world calamities . 
Not according to Nicholls , Tol , and Vafeidis . 
Here are the facts . 
That &apos;s a lot of people , to be sure , but hardly all of mankind . 
In fact , it amounts to less than 6 % of the world &apos;s population - which is to say that 94 % of the population would not be inundated . 
That &apos;s because the vast majority of those 400 million people reside within cities , where they could be protected relatively easily , as in Tokyo . 
As a result , only about 15 million people would have to be relocated . 
In all , according to Nicholls , Tol , and Vafeidis , the total cost of managing this &quot; catastrophe &quot; - if politicians do not dither and pursue smart , coordinated policies - would be about $ 600 billion a year , or less than 1 % of global GDP . 
This figure may seem surprisingly low , but that is only because so many of us have accepted the widespread view that we lack the capacity to adapt to large rises in sea levels . 
Not only do we have this capacity , but we have demonstrated it many times in the past . 
Like it or not , global warming is real , it is man-made , and we need to do something about it . 
Climate science is a subtle and fiendishly convoluted discipline that rarely yields unambiguous forecasts or straightforward prescriptions . 
There is an understandable desire to want to cut through the verbiage and shake people by the shoulders . 
Unfortunately , trying to scare the socks off of people doesn &apos;t help matters . 
Yes , a startling statistic , combined with some hyperbolic prose , will make us sit up and pay attention . 
As the scare stories become more inflated , so , too , does the likelihood that they will be exposed for the exaggerations that they are - and the public will end up tuning the whole thing out . 
This may explain recent polling data showing that public concern about global warming has declined precipitously in the last three years . 
In the United States , for example , the Pew Institute reported that the number of Americans who regard global warming as a very serious problem had declined from 44 % in April 2008 to only 35 % last October . 
More recently , a BBC study found that only 26 % of Britons believe that man-made &quot; climate change is happening , &quot; down from 41 % in November 2009 . 
Fear may be a great motivator in the short term , but it is a terrible basis for making smart decisions about a complicated problem that demands our full intelligence for a long period .
