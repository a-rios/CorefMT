Defusing Iran &apos;s Oil Weapon 
Like North Korea , the Iranian government will not shy from a showdown over its nuclear program . 
Why should it ? 
A nuclear weapon is the ultimate guarantee that the United States can never do to Iran what it did to Iraq . 
Moreover , this struggle with the US rallies much-needed domestic support . 
What , then , can the US do to undermine Iran &apos;s position ? 
As the world &apos;s fourth largest oil exporter , Iran has profited mightily from the tripling of global oil prices over the last four years . 
Its economic stability is dependent on oil revenues , so it is here that Iran &apos;s rulers are vulnerable . 
American diplomats are never going to persuade the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran &apos;s energy exports . 
But the Bush administration can seek ways to contain global energy prices - and it should begin by refusing to be baited into escalating tensions whenever Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pleases . 
Ahmadinejad has proven resourceful in driving the diplomatic conflict . 
His government has rejected international calls to halt uranium enrichment , ignored UN-imposed deadlines , armed Iraqi militias , supplied Hezbollah with weapons for attacks on Israel , denied the Holocaust , and staged military exercises near the Strait of Hormuz , through which 40 % of the world &apos;s sea-traded oil passes . 
All these provocations add upward pressure on oil prices , enriching the Iranian government . 
When Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hinted that Iran could play the oil card , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed the idea . 
&quot; Let &apos;s just remember that Iran is some 80 % dependent on oil in its budget , &quot; she said , so it is &quot; not really able to live with a disruption . &quot; 
But if Iran pulls modest amounts of its oil from international markets , price increases are likely to offset ( perhaps completely ) any loss in revenue from the supply cut . 
In addition , threats to the Strait of Hormuz would allow Iran to force prices up without any reduction in output . 
It is not an accident that virtually every public move Iran &apos;s government has made in the international arena over the past year has added risk to energy markets . 
At times , the US has effectively - if unintentionally - undercut Iran &apos;s position . 
This summer , the Bush administration offered Iran direct talks . 
In September , Bush made an unexpectedly low-key speech to the UN General Assembly . 
Resistance to sanctions from Russia , China , and France has persuaded US officials to &quot; allow more time for diplomacy &quot; before pushing for punitive action in the Security Council . 
All of these choices helped return slack to energy markets . 
Oil prices have fallen from above $ 78 per barrel in mid-July to less than $ 60 in early October . 
The drop - due in no small measure to an easing of tensions over Iran &apos;s nuclear program - is costing the Iranian government money , compounding the regime &apos;s domestic problems . 
Inflation in Iran is rising , perhaps to as high as 20 % . 
On October 1 , Khamenei called on Ahmadinejad to address the growing problem . 
There are price freezes on certain subsidized goods and services , and rising inflation makes these subsidies even more expensive for the government . 
Indeed , the government indicates that it may begin rationing gasoline . 
Unemployment stands at about 12 % , and is probably twice as high among young people . 
The US can undermine the Iranian regime by avoiding statements and actions that help drive energy prices higher and bolster Iran &apos;s economy . 
Administration officials should lower the political temperature . 
They should again offer Iran direct talks . 
Bush should invite Ahmadinejad to Washington . 
Better yet , invite him to Crawford . 
Make him breakfast . 
Washington can also press the Saudis , who control virtually all of the world &apos;s spare capacity , to keep their output high to contain prices . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling Sunnis are more threatened than is the US by Iran &apos;s support for a shift in the regional balance of power toward Shia Muslims . 
Yes , Ahmadinejad will probably find a way to re-escalate the conflict . 
No one can stop Iran from threatening the Strait of Hormuz . 
But no one can blame the US for that when Bush is offering to talk . 
Iran probably needs two or three years to develop a nuclear weapon . 
How strong will Ahmadinejad &apos;s domestic position be then ? 
If the US does not provide him with threats that help rally domestic support , his failure to revitalize Iran &apos;s economy will erode his standing at home . 
Lower oil prices would mean less money to spend on domestic projects that buoy his popularity - or on the nuclear program . 
If cutting into Iran &apos;s oil income fails to weaken Ahmadinejad , the US would retain military options . 
But undermining his domestic standing by limiting Iran &apos;s revenues stands a better chance of succeeding than diplomatic efforts to persuade the regime to suspend uranium enrichment voluntarily , or coercive sanctions . 
Easing tensions will not win Bush points with those who prefer a muscular strategy . 
But the administration &apos;s confrontational approach is failing , because it is precisely what Iran &apos;s rulers want .
