Peace this Time ? 
JERUSALEM - The imminent resumption in Washington of direct Israeli-Palestinian peace talks is good news . 
But whether these talks will lead to an agreement , let alone within one year as US President Barack Obama hopes , is another matter . 
When Obama , two days into his presidency , appointed former Senator George Mitchell as his special envoy to the Middle East , many hoped that within two years his efforts would lead to an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians - and to a comprehensive peace between Israel and all its Arab neighbors . 
Whether these exaggerated hopes should be traced to Obama &apos;s inexperience or to hubris - or both - is a moot point : what is clear is that , after 18 months and numerous visits to the region , Mitchell was able to achieve only an agreement in principle by Israel and the Palestinians to start talking to each other . 
The problem is that they have been talking to each other now for 17 years , under different Israeli and Palestinian leaders , and under two US Presidents . 
To bring them to the negotiating table again is not a breakthrough , but rather an attempt at damage control . 
And , while Mitchell &apos;s successful track record in achieving reconciliation in Northern Ireland seemed like an excellent credential for his current job , it may have hindered him in the Middle East . 
The conflict in Northern Ireland was always territorial : not even the most radical Irish Republican group ever denied the legitimacy of Great Britain - only its rule over the six northern provinces of what they consider United Ireland . The crux of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict , by contrast , only partly concerns Israel &apos;s borders . 
The Palestinians contest not just the post-1967 occupation of the West Bank ; since the United Nations partition plan of 1947 - which called for the establishment of two states , one Jewish and one Arab - Palestinians have refused to recognize Israel &apos;s right to exist , and most Israelis are not convinced that they have totally abandoned that stance . 
Being tone-deaf to these fundamental issues , Mitchell started on the wrong foot by initially acceding , with Obama &apos;s encouragement , to the Palestinians &quot; demand for a freeze on further construction in Israeli settlements on the West Bank prior to the start of negotiations . 
A stop to settlement activities in Palestinian territories is a reasonable demand , and the Palestinians could naturally insist on it in the negotiations . 
But making a settlement freeze a precondition for negotiations was obviously unacceptable to the Israeli government , which maintained that no preconditions for negotiations should be set . 
More than a year was wasted on this , causing , among other things , tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s government and the Obama administration . 
With a lack of grace , Netanyahu finally agreed to a temporary freeze - due to expire at the end of September - and eventually the Palestinians , this time under US pressure , relented to open negotiations without an explicit Israeli assurance that the freeze would be continued . 
Not only was precious time wasted , but further damage was done . 
Even Israelis who do not agree with Netanyahu &apos;s hard-line positions didn &apos;t like to see their prime minister treated by the US as if he were the leader of Upper Volta . 
Indeed , he did , after all , announce last year that contrary to his Likud Party &apos;s previous position , he was now willing to accept a two-state solution - a position that is still anathema to many Likud members , as well to at least three of the smaller parties in his government coalition . 
Now that the talks are to begin , will they achieve anything substantial , or will the summit in Washington merely be another photo opportunity , like President George W. Bush &apos;s Annapolis summit in 2007 ? 
Only an unreconstructed optimist would give the talks more than a 50 % chance of succeeding . 
The reasons are more immediate than the intractable character of Middle East peace-making . 
Even if Netanyahu is willing to bow to realism , some of his coalition partners might leave his government . 
On the Palestinian side , Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s Palestinian Authority lost control in 2006 of the Gaza Strip - now ruled by an illegitimate Hamas-led government - and thus cannot speak anymore for all Palestinians . 
With more than 600 Palestinians killed in Gaza since Hamas &apos;s violent putsch , making peace among the Palestinians may be as difficult as making peace between them and Israel . 
Moreover , before Israeli-Palestinian talks broke down two years ago , the previous Israeli government , under Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , negotiated for two years with the Palestinian Authority . 
This was the most moderate Israeli government conceivable , and the same can be said about the Fatah movement controlling the Palestinian Authority . 
Yet , after dozens of meetings , public and private , the two sides failed to reach an agreement . 
Even the most moderate leaders on both sides could not agree on the core issues of the conflict : borders , settlements , Jerusalem , and the fate of 1947-1948 Palestinian refugees and their descendants . 
Both sides had an immediate stake in reaching an agreement : for Olmert , an agreement might have rescued his position as prime minister , and it would have been a trump card for Abbas in Fatah &apos;s de facto civil war with Hamas . 
The failure to reach agreement under such apparently auspicious conditions does not bode well for the coming talks . 
But Netanyahu has said that once negotiations start , &quot; we will surprise everyone , &quot; and the Palestinians have gone further than ever before in building the institutions needed for national independence . 
Even a lapsed optimist can see that this time the chances for reconciliation just might be better after all .
