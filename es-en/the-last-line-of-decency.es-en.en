The Last Line of Decency 
JERUSALEM - Every Friday afternoon for more than a year , hundreds of Israeli Jews have gathered on a dusty little square in the middle of Arab East Jerusalem . 
There are some Palestinians there , too , including a couple of boys selling fresh orange juice . 
The people gather there , in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood , to protest the eviction of Palestinian families from their homes to make way for Israeli settlers . 
These evictions are humiliating , sometimes violent , and frightening to other Palestinian families - who are in danger of losing their homes as well . 
Israeli students were the first to organize a protest , known as the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement . 
They were followed by distinguished professors , famous novelists , and a former attorney general , among others . 
At first , the Israeli police used force against the protesters , even though such demonstrations are perfectly legal in Israel . 
This provoked such bad publicity that the police backed off , while still blocking the road to the new settlements . 
All the demonstrators can do is hold up signs , bang drums , chant slogans , and show solidarity just by turning up . 
The background to the evictions is not exactly straightforward . 
Some Jews did live in the district before they were kicked out in the 1948 war of Israeli independence . 
Many more Palestinians were kicked out at the same time from neighborhoods in West Jerusalem , and found new homes in areas like Sheikh Jarrah , which came under Jordanian jurisdiction until the Israelis took back East Jerusalem in 1967 . 
These people were largely left in peace until a few years ago , when Jews began to lay claim on properties lost in 1948 . 
Palestinians who might wish to make similar claims on properties in West Jerusalem cannot do so . 
Because they settled after 1948 in &quot; enemy territories , &quot; such as Jordanian Sheikh Jarrah , they are barred by Israeli law from reclaiming lost property . 
Some Arab properties in Jerusalem are purchased by Jewish businessmen or organizations . 
But some are simply appropriated . 
Documents , going back to the Ottoman period , are sometimes produced , but their authenticity and provenance are often in doubt . 
In any case , as is so frequently the case in Israel , the Palestinians are given a raw deal . 
Sheikh Jarrah is far from the worst case . 
Other Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem are cut off from the rest of the city by Israel &apos;s so-called &quot; security wall , &quot; which means that their inhabitants do not receive proper municipal services , despite being obliged to pay city taxes . 
Uncollected garbage piles up in the streets . 
Water supplies are erratic . 
Children can no longer go to their schools . 
People lose their jobs . 
Things are even worse in Palestinian towns farther afield , such as Hebron , where Israeli settlers often behave like Wild West gunslingers , flouting the laws of their own country as they drive away Palestinians by cutting down their trees , poisoning their livestock , and subjecting them to other forms of torment , including fatal shootings , which have gone unpunished . 
When American diplomats complained about Jewish settlers &quot; forcible intrusion into Palestinian neighborhoods , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu responded that Jerusalem was not a settlement , but the capital of Israel . 
This implies that Jews can push farther and farther into East Jerusalem , as well as build settlements on Palestinian territories around the city , which Israel now claims to be part of Jerusalem . 
The ultimate aim , it appears , is to make Jerusalem Jewish , by purchase , by invoking historical claims , and , if necessary , by force . 
This effort is so systematic , and backed so vigorously by the Israeli government , that there seems to be little prospect of a few hundred protesters , however distinguished , managing to stop it . 
So is it all a waste of time ? 
Is it just a radical-chic outdoor cocktail party ? 
At least one Palestinian gentleman thought not . 
He lives a few streets away from the spot where the protesters gather . 
&quot; If it weren &apos;t for you people , &quot; he said with a joyful smile , &quot; we would all be doomed . &quot; 
He may be expecting too much . 
But the show of Jewish solidarity no doubt makes some Palestinians feel less alone . 
Moreover , it is harder for Palestinians to demonstrate themselves , because they risk losing their precious residency permits in Jerusalem . 
But the protests are worthwhile for another reason : they are good for Israel . 
Protests , or civil resistance , in the face of government force , rarely have immediate , tangible results . 
Under dictatorships , they can even be counterproductive , leading to violent reprisals . 
This is especially true of violent resistance , which simply invites greater violence . 
Israel is not a dictatorship . 
On the contrary , it is the only functioning democracy in the Middle East . 
Despite all the segregation , discrimination , and ethnic and religious tensions , Jerusalem is also one of the Middle East &apos;s last truly diverse cities . 
There are precious few Jews left in Tehran , Damascus , or Cairo . 
By contrast , the Arab population in Jerusalem is 36 % , and growing . 
Israel must also defend itself against much Arab hostility . 
But systematic humiliation of Palestinians , by allowing settlers to get away literally with murder , has a corrupting effect on Israeli society . 
Citizens are coarsened by the casual brutality meted out to a minority , and become inured to it . 
Even if most Israelis never see a roadblock , the security wall , or forcible evictions , the habit of looking away , not wishing to know , is a form of corruption . 
This is why the Friday afternoon protests , however ineffectual in the short run , are essential . 
The demonstration of solidarity makes Israel a more civilized place . 
It keeps alive a sense of decency , a hope that a better society is still possible - for Palestinians and Israelis alike .
