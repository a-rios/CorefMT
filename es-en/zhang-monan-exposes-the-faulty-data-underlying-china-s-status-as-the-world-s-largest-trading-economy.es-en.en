The Tricks of China &apos;s Trade 
BEIJING - Last year , China ostensibly reached another milestone in its meteoric rise , surpassing the United States to become the world &apos;s largest trading country , with its total trade turnover valued at CN Â¥ 25.83 trillion ( $ 4.16 trillion ) . 
Since the 1990s , China &apos;s has been building up its &quot; processing trade &quot; - whereby it imports intermediate inputs from other countries , processes or assembles them , then exports them - causing the ratio of intermediate-product trade to overall external trade to grow rapidly . 
Intermediate inputs comprise around 28 % of global exports , but 40 % of China &apos;s total exports . 
Given that traditional trade accounting is based on country of origin , the resulting global segmentation of value added and the multilayered international division of labor can distort trade figures . 
For example , the &quot; triangular trade &quot; model - whereby China imports significant quantities of intermediate inputs from East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea , then exports the assembled products to the US - allows for substantial redundancy in trade records . 
In 2010 , more than one-quarter of the world &apos;s $ 19 trillion in exports was counted more than once . 
China &apos;s dependence on low value-added activities like processing and assembly is rooted in its historical lack of capacity to invest in research and development . 
For a long time , the country was able to overcome this deficiency by capitalizing on its abundant labor force to become a global leader in low-cost , labor-intensive manufacturing . 
But China &apos;s low-cost advantage in manufacturing is diminishing rapidly , owing to rising wages and a declining demographic dividend . 
This combination of rising labor costs and low value added is clearly unsustainable . 
If China is to transform itself from a large trading country into a powerful one , it must raise its productivity , with the manufacturing sector adding more value to exports ( and , increasingly , to goods for domestic consumption ) . 
To be sure , China &apos;s enduring comparative advantage in processing and assembling industrial products has enabled it to retain its status as the world &apos;s largest exporter . 
As massive quantities of labor-intensive processing and assembly work have been transferred to China from Japan , South Korea , Singapore , Taiwan , and Hong Kong , so have these economies &quot; trade surpluses . 
Moreover , this has contributed to large - and widely criticized - trade imbalances with the US and the European Union , the primary end markets for Chinese-processed industrial products . 
But , again , the data may not be what they seem . 
Consider China &apos;s growing re-import trade , whereby goods that have been exported to nearby countries , particularly Hong Kong , return to the mainland . 
China &apos;s re-imports have increased more than 12-fold since 2000 , and now dwarf those of other re-importing leaders as a share of total trade . 
Given Hong Kong &apos;s advanced logistics and infrastructure , it is a relatively inexpensive and efficient conduit through which products can be shipped . 
In 2011 , Hong Kong handled about 14 % of mainland China &apos;s exports and 13 % of its imports , with more than 60 % of Hong Kong &apos;s total re-exports originating from the Chinese mainland . 
Meanwhile , by exporting products through designated export-processing zones , companies gain access to export-tax refunds and , once the intermediate cargo is imported and processed , advantageous export tariffs . 
Re-imports from China &apos;s trading partners are counted as part of total imports - and , in this context , China treats Hong Kong as a trading partner , rather than as a free-trade zone . 
In this way , re-imports serve to inflate China &apos;s trade data , meaning that the trade imbalance between China and the advanced countries has been exaggerated significantly . 
Furthermore , model simulations show that the Chinese export sectors that have greater ratios of value added abroad are concentrated in the manufacturing industry - the industry upon which China &apos;s economy is most dependent . 
Indeed , 26 % of the value added by the primary manufacturing sector is not created by China . 
Taking this into account , China &apos;s trade surplus with the US declines by 36 % . 
China &apos;s surpluses with Europe and India also fall considerably , and its deficit with Japan grows even larger . 
These figures carry the unmistakable message that the amount of &quot; filler &quot; in China &apos;s total trade volume should not be underestimated . 
Given the importance of moving up the value chain to China &apos;s future industrial competitiveness - not to mention the challenge posed by &quot; reindustrialization &quot; in advanced countries like the US - China &apos;s leaders must act now to give the economy a new edge that can replace abundant , low-cost labor . 
To this end , they should promote investment in research and development , as well as in the health and education of the labor force . 
Likewise , China should cultivate its own transnational corporations to engage in worldwide manufacturing and sales . 
While these activities may seem like the simple cross-border export of intermediate products , they amount to the deployment and extension of domestic production , enhancing the home country &apos;s role in shaping global value chains . 
Finally , China should participate actively in the global movement toward bilateral , trilateral , and regional free-trade agreements , accelerating negotiations for agreements with Japan and South Korea , and with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations . 
At the same time , in order to elevate China &apos;s position in the revenue distribution of global value chains , China should seek negotiations for agreements with the US and Europe . 
Before any of this can occur , however , China &apos;s leaders much change their perspective . 
China &apos;s recognition as the world &apos;s largest trading country is not the fetchingly redundant &quot; landmark milestone &quot; that its leaders declared . 
That charmed point will be reached when Chinese industry raises its position within - and influence over - global value chains .
