Bush the Negligent Neighbor 
After ignoring Latin America for years , President George W. Bush is desperately trying to improve hemispheric relations . 
But his just completed trip to Brazil , Uruguay , Colombia , Guatemala , and Mexico came too late . 
Years of neglect could not possibly be erased by a trip long in photo opportunities and short in substance . 
In the capitals of Latin America , Bush &apos;s visit has been interpreted as a reaction to Venezuelan President Hugo Ch치vez &apos;s increasing influence and popularity in the region . 
Certainly , Ch치vez seems to have seen it that way , as he consistently heckled Bush from afar . 
Before flying to Brazil , Bush said that his administration doesn &apos;t get enough credit for its Latin American policy . 
But , in 2007 , the United States will provide economic assistance to Latin American and the Caribbean worth $ 1.8 billion , which is $ 200 million less than in 2006 . 
Moreover , almost half of the total comes in the form of military aid , while $ 716 million will go to one country , Colombia . 
In an effort to increase its low popularity in Latin America , the Bush administration recently announced an additional $ 75 million for education , and $ 385 million to help finance mortgages for the poor . 
Also , the US Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort will make port calls in a number of Latin countries . 
But these aid figures are absurdly low from a historical perspective . 
During the 1960 &quot; s - the years of President John F. Kennedy &apos;s Alliance for Progress - annual aid to the region exceeded $ 10 billion in today &apos;s dollars . 
The first sign that the Bush administration didn &apos;t take Latin America seriously came on January 1 , 2002 , when Luiz In치cio &quot; Lula &quot; Da Silva was sworn in as Brazil &apos;s president . 
The occasion was solemn and charged with symbolism . 
After all , Lula was the first trade union leader ever elected to the presidency of a Latin American country . 
Numerous heads of state and dignitaries from around the world attended the ceremony . 
But Bush was not among them ; nor was Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Colin Powell , or any other prominent member of the US cabinet . 
With his traditional sense of humor , Lula dismissed the slight . 
Other Latin American heads of state , however , were not so casual ; in fact , they were deeply offended . 
According to them , this was a reminder that , with only a few exceptions - Cuba and possibly Mexico - Latin America was not a political priority for the US . 
During the years that followed , the US administration &apos;s attitude towards Hispanic undocumented immigrants alienated an increasing number of Latin American voters . 
As a result , in country after country they have elected presidents that are openly critical of the US and its policies . 
Six years after Lula &apos;s inauguration , and despite Bush &apos;s trip , Latin American politicians continue to believe that their region is being neglected . 
It is true , they say , that the Bush administration launched the Free Trade Area of the Americas , but hemispheric free trade looks as distant today as ever . 
Moreover , the handful of free-trade agreements signed with individual countries , or groups of countries , are lopsided and overwhelmingly favor US interests . 
In order to regain Latin America &apos;s support - and to dent Ch치vez &apos;s popularity - the Bush administration will need much more than a short trip . 
Passing a comprehensive Immigration Bill that normalizes the legal status of millions of Latin American workers in the US may help .
