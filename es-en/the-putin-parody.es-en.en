The Putin Parody 
MOSCOW - The history of authoritarian rule in Russia displays a certain depressing regularity . 
Such regimes rarely perish from external shocks or оррosition pressure . 
As a rule , they die unexpectedly from some internal disease - from irresistible existential disgust at themselves , from their own exhaustion . 
Czarist rule withstood many harsh tests during its long history : peasant revolts , conspiracies , and the alienation of the educated class . 
In January 1917 , from his Swiss exile , Lenin noted with bitterness and hopelessness that : &quot; We , the old , will hardly live till the decisive battles of that forthcoming revolution . 
But ... the young maybe will be lucky not only to fight , but finally win in the approaching proletarian revolution . &quot; 
By the following March , however , Czar Nicolas II was forced to abdicate . 
General Secretary Yuri Andropov died in 1984 , leaving behind a country cleansed of dissidents . 
But when in several years one of his former regional First Secretaries , Boris Yeltsin that is , signed a decree banning the Communist Party none of 18 million party members went to the streets to protest . 
Today , before our very eyes , Vladimir Putin &apos;s once seemingly impregnable regime may be fading in the same way as its predecessors . 
In just ten years , Putinism , which was consciously designed by its image-makers as a simulacrum of a great ideological style has run through all the classical stages of Soviet history . 
Indeed , Putinism now seems like a trite parody of all of them . 
First comes the creation of a formative myth for the new system , one that generates a demiurge-hero , the nation &apos;s father . 
Where the Bolsheviks had the October Revolution and the subsequent civil war to deify Lenin , Putinists used the second Chechen war , triggered by blowing up of Moscow apartments , to raise up Vladimir Putin as national saviour . 
The second stage is the time of the tempest - the period when the country is stoically remade through the leaders &apos;s iron will . 
Where Stalin had his barbarous yet monumental drive to industrial modernization , Putin boasted of making Russia a great energy power . 
Next comes heroic triumph . 
The Soviets had the great victory over Hitler &apos;s Germany in World War II , which left Russia one of the world &apos;s two superpowers . 
Putin &apos;s supposedly heroic victory came in the war with Georgia of 2008 , followed by the subsequent virtual annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
From heroic victory , however , exhaustion invariably follows . 
Under the Soviets , this stage lasted about 40 years . 
But Putin &apos;s simulacrum of Sovietism began to collapse much faster , partly by virtue of the fact that his regime &apos;s ideology never had much substance to begin with , and so couldn &apos;t begin to be used as a prop . 
Indeed , at the onset of the financial crisis , Putin tried to bestride the world , portraying Russia as an island of stability and demanding the creation of a new global financial order , with the rouble to become one of the world &apos;s reserve currencies . 
But that megalomaniac position was quickly reversed . 
Putinomics , however , proved to be even more vulnerable to the financial crisis than the economies of the West . 
At such moments of decline in Russia , the clans always come to the fore in a mad scramble of self-preservation and self-enrichment . 
Even Putin &apos;s truest followers are now beginning to speak of their leader and the results of his governance in impertinent and disrespectful ways . 
Of course , no one should think that Putinism will disappear tomorrow , even though its jackals are already circling . 
Let us remember that Soviet communism took four decades to rot away - decades during which the inner circle knew that the regime was disintegrating from within but lacked any real idea of how to save it . 
So now we hear pathetic echoes of all the reform communist efforts of the long years of Soviet decline : Putinism without Putin , Putinism with a human face , etc . 
And on the street , other echoes are heard . 
Our &quot; father &quot; did not turn out to be a father at all . 
Even among Putin &apos;s kleptocracy of ex-KGB men , as among the communist apparatchiks in the dying days of Gorbachev &apos;s rule , there is a growing realization that the jig is nearly up , and that it is time to look after oneself . 
So , as Putinism atrophies , the great hope among his immediate circle is that they will be able to do what the communist elite did in the early 1990 &quot; s - hijack whatever new system emerges and put it to work in the service of their own interests .
