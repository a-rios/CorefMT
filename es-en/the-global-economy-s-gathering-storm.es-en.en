The Global Economy \ u0027s Gathering Storm 
MUNICH - From 2004 to 2007 , the world economy experienced an unusually long and strong boom , with growth rates of nearly 5 % and with many countries participating . 
The European Union ( EU15 ) recorded 2.4 % growth on average during these years . 
In Germany , where growth averaged 1.8 % during this period , some journalists proclaimed a new economic miracle . 
Now , however , increasingly bad news is giving rise to serious doubts ; dark clouds are hovering over the United States , in particular . 
Is the world economy on the brink of recession ? 
In the US , real-estate prices remain in free fall , and the banking crisis is still claiming new victims ( Bear Stearns , IndyMac , First Heritage Bank , First National Bank of Nevada , First Priority Bank , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , etc . ) . 
In the banking world as a whole , expected write-offs now considerably exceed the â‚¬ 400 billion mark projected just last spring . 
Unemployment , moreover , is rising at its fastest rate in seven years . 
Overall employment , which is still high in historical terms , has been declining continuously since the beginning of 2008 . 
It is surprising that America &apos;s stock market hasn &apos;t crashed yet , since all other indicators are pointing downward . 
The Standard ampamp ; 
Poor &apos;s price / earnings ratio recently stood at around 20 , well above the long-term average of around 16 since 1881 . 
Disturbing signals for the world economy have also come from recent surveys of economic activity . 
The Ifo World Economic Climate index deteriorated in the third quarter of 2008 for the fourth consecutive time . 
That decline was primarily the result of more unfavorable appraisals of the current economic situation , but also reflected another downward revision of expectations for the next six months . 
Today , the index is at its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2001 . 
The cooling of the Ifo World Economic Climate index was particularly marked in Western Europe and Asia . 
This has dispelled hopes that Asia economic activity could develop separately from that of the US , thereby offsetting European exporters &quot; losses in America . 
In the third quarter of 2008 , the Ifo index for Asia was at its lowest level since the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 , with particularly poor economic assessments coming from Japan . 
In the US , the climate indicator declined again , after having sunk dramatically in the second quarter , bringing it to its lowest level since 1991 . 
The University of Michigan &apos;s Consumer Sentiment Index fell in June 2008 to its lowest level in decades and has since recovered only insignificantly . 
Also for the euro area , the Ifo Economic Climate index registered a dramatic decline . 
Europe &apos;s largest economy , Germany , is now going into the doldrums . 
The Ifo Business Climate index , which , though based on a survey for Germany , is regarded as Europe &apos;s most important economic activity indicator , has been falling with few interruptions since the autumn of last year . 
It is now clearly in territory that implies an economic downturn . 
In addition , export expectations for German manufacturing are heading south . 
Incoming orders in manufacturing , the most important indicator in the official statistics , fell more sharply in the first two quarters of 2008 than at any time since the beginning of 1993 . 
In the second quarter , the German economy shrank at an annualized , seasonally and calendar adjusted rate of 2 % . 
All in all , there is now hardly any doubt that the economic upturn in Germany that began in the summer of 2005 is now coming to an end . 
Amid this gloomy outlook , we anxiously look for encouraging signs . 
The price of crude oil , which hit a record level of $ 148 a barrel in July , has since fallen almost 25 % , or $ 36 . 
Whether recent developments in America &apos;s economy give reason for hope is now the question . 
With an annualized 1.9 % quarterly rise in GDP in April-June , growth was twice as high as in the first quarter ( 0.9 % ) . 
This largely reflects the impact of $ 152 billion in tax rebates ( roughly 1 % of GDP ) , but , given the continuing and intensifying real-estate crisis , this boost to growth still does not mark a turnaround . 
In Japan , with an economy of about half the size of the US , growth forces remain weak . In the second quarter of 2008 , the Japanese economy shrank at an annualized rate of 2.4 % , primarily due to weak exports . 
With all this discouraging news , it is little comfort that some areas of the world are still displaying considerable growth rates : China is expected to grow by 9.5 % this year and in 2009 , with India growing by 8 % , Russia up by 6.5 % , owing to higher oil prices , and Latin America growing by 4.5 % on average during this period . 
Unfortunately , the weight of these countries and regions is small ; 
China , the biggest of them , accounts for only 5 % of the world economy . 
So the signs of a worldwide economic slowdown have increased . 
The American crisis is now spreading to other areas of the world . 
Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may be right when he says : &quot; This crisis is different - a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions . &quot;
