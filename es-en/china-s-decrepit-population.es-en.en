China &apos;s Decrepit Population 
China &apos;s government finally appears to be acknowledging the urgent challenges presented by the country &apos;s aging population . 
On December 12 , it released a cabinet-level White Paper on the problem - the first of its kind Â­ - in an effort to grapple with the prospect of rising social-security and healthcare costs , a tightening labor market , and other potential obstacles to continue rapid economic growth . 
Looking back , it is ironic that the Chinese government &apos;s draconian &quot; one-child &quot; policy , imposed in 1979 , was implemented at the same time as the &quot; open door &quot; policy , aimed at capturing labor-intensive foreign manufacturing investment . 
While both policies must be regarded as successes , over the years the family planning program has contributed to an aging population that may diminish China &apos;s attractiveness as a low-cost , labor-intensive manufacturing hub . 
During the nearly three decades since the &quot; one-child &quot; policy was introduced , live births have dropped from 22.5 million per year in the early 1980 &quot; s to around 16-17 million by the middle of this decade . 
Moreover , with the number of elderly growing as a result of rising life expectancy , this low birth rate has pushed the share of those aged 65 and above from 4.9 % of the total population to 7.7 % . 
According to the United Nations Population Division &apos;s ( UNPD ) &quot; medium-variant &quot; projections , without reform of the &quot; one-child &quot; policy , the share of China &apos;s population aged 15 and below would decline from 24.8 % in 2000 to 15.7 % in 2050 , while the share of those aged 65 and above would soar from 6.8 % to 23.6 % . 
With fewer children to replenish the workforce , the working-age cohort of those 15-64 years old would shrink from 68.4 % to 60.7 % . 
The elderly would thus account for a far greater share of China &apos;s population than in other large emerging economies , such as Brazil , India , Indonesia , and Mexico . 
China &apos;s demographic trends hold several adverse implications for its economy . 
With a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce , tax revenue will contract , while expenditure on pensions and health care will expand , undermining the fiscal position . 
Various estimates by private-sector economists and World Bank officials suggest that the government &apos;s accumulated &quot; net implicit pension debt &quot; could balloon to 75-110 % of GDP . 
Furthermore , the decline in the working-age cohort would squeeze labor supply , fueling wage growth and eroding the country &apos;s economic competitiveness . 
Already , in the Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas , where manufacturing activity is the densest , labor shortages have appeared . 
In 2004 , for example , Guangdong Province had to raise the mandatory minimum wage by as much as 20 % to attract workers from other regions . 
To hire and retain skilled workers , many foreign-invested enterprises routinely pay above the minimum wage . 
But some foreign manufacturers , seeking to cap rising labor costs , are shifting production from China to cheaper destinations such as Vietnam , where average monthly wages for factory workers is $ 50-60 - half that of China . 
Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Vietnam grew by 40 % in 2005 , led by investors from Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan . 
China &apos;s inward FDI fell 1.2 % in the first seven months of 2006 , after a 0.5 % decline in 2005 , while combined investment from Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan plummeted 31 % in the first half of 2006 , compared to the 6.5 % decline in 2005 . 
These figures are only the early warnings of an emerging trend . 
In the long run , as labor shortages become acute , China will need to relinquish some low-end , labor-intensive manufacturing activities , which will translate into decelerating export performance and lower economic growth . 
Aside from abandoning the &quot; one-child &quot; policy , China could avoid this outcome by climbing the value chain in manufacturing and services , as Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , and Taiwan have done . 
However , for China to succeed , higher investment in research and development , together with a fundamental overhaul of the educational system , is essential . 
According to OECD estimates , China &apos;s current expenditure on R D amounts to only 1.3 % of GDP , compared to 3.2 % in Japan and an average of 2.5-2.6 % in South Korea , Taiwan , and the United States . 
Although the government recently announced that it intends to increase R D spending to 2 % of GDP by 2010 , this remains below the OECD average of 2.2 % . 
As for China &apos;s backward educational system , the large number of university graduates is offset by their overall sub-standard quality . 
According to a recent survey by McKinsey 
Company , of the more than three million graduates churned out by China &apos;s universities and colleges every year , less than 10 % are suitable for employment with international companies , owing to their deficiencies in practical training and poor English . 
In view of these systemic weaknesses , China &apos;s ability to overcome its labor deficit by shifting to an innovation- and productivity-driven economy remains dubious .
