From Football to Fascism in Russia 
MOSCOW - In Russia , 2010 ended with an unprecedented upsurge of ultra-nationalist violence . 
Images of rioting , fascist-minded thugs have dominated TV broadcasts . 
The violence began following an ordinary conflict between two small groups of young people over a taxi . 
One group consisted of young people from the Northern Caucasus , the other of fans of a Moscow football ( soccer ) club . 
One of the leaders of the Moscow fans , Yegor Sviridov , was murdered . 
Rumors raced around the city the next day that the police had released all those accused of Sviridov &apos;s murder ( as it happens , the rumors were true ) . 
Spontaneous protests erupted in front of police headquarters , but the police did not intervene . 
On December 11 , another rally was held at site of the murder , and moved into the very center of Moscow , Manezhnaya Square , just outside the Kremlin &apos;s walls . 
The crowd began to chant nationalist slogans , and then proceeded to beat up passersby who did not look Slavic . 
The police were slow to arrive . 
The beatings continued and spread to the subway , where the police were essentially powerless . 
The night finished with many wounded and one more killed . 
The next day , back on Manezhnaya Square , beside the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier , a huge swastika appeared . 
These events are not without precedent . 
In 2002 , Moscow authorities mounted huge TV-screens on Manezhnaya Square to broadcast a World Cup match between Russia and Japan . 
By the start of the game , tens of thousands of young fans were on the square , many of them drunk and agitated . 
When the final whistle sounded on a 1-0 victory for Japan , the crowd , infuriated , burst into spontaneous pogroms and beatings . 
Those events were preceded by a propaganda campaign in which government-controlled newspapers , television stations , and radio broadcasters took part . 
It was decided to exploit the forthcoming world championship for &quot; patriotic &quot; purposes . 
In pumping up football-induced hysteria , Russian politicians - headed by then-President Vladimir Putin - took the lead . 
The government had erected the TV screens outside the Kremlin in order to ensure patriotic exultation of the victory that they assumed was coming . 
No one was prepared for defeat . 
Clearly , careless manipulation by the authorities of patriotic sentiments has proven to be a risky business in Russia . 
Indeed , the vast popular protests that took place during the &quot; Orange Revolution &quot; in Ukraine five years ago convinced the Kremlin that they could not allow any spontaneous outburst of public emotions . 
Officials evidently decided that it is better to flirt with and control public passion than allow it to erupt on its own . 
Back then , the Kremlin was frightened by the possibility of a so-called &quot; color revolution &quot; breaking out in Russia . 
As a result , enormous resources - both funds and officials &quot; time - were invested in youth movements created by Kremlin puppeteers , with two aims : control street political activity and prepare brigades for a future struggle - which might include ballot rigging - against political opponents . 
For this purpose , contingents of football fans were also used . 
This sort of manipulation is now a Kremlin staple . 
Indeed , by coincidence , on the Sunday the young football fan was murdered in Moscow , Vladislav Surkov , the first deputy in President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s administration , was meeting Michael McFaul of President Barack Obama &apos;s National Security Council . 
That meeting was taking place as part of a gathering , led by Surkov , of Russian youth-movement activists . 
One quote from Surkov that day is particularly telling : &quot; Make ready for the elections , train your brains and muscles . 
You can always rely on our support . &quot; 
Those muscles were put to use outside the Kremlin walls that very day . 
To understand what is at stake , it is sufficient to consider the name of the main youth movement fathered by the Kremlin : Nashi , or &quot; Ours . &quot; 
It is difficult to invent a more potentially explosive moniker , for the name proudly proclaims a division between &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them &quot; - the most ancient and most destructive of human instincts . 
And it is hard to rationalize so atavistic an effort being initiated by a government and supported with taxpayers &quot; money . 
As a result , special youth brigades fostered by the Kremlin nowadays beat up activists of &quot; not ours . &quot; 
If the policedetain Nashi members , a telephone call from the President &apos;s administration follows , and the detainees are released . 
That is why the police fail to take tough action against rioting young thugs . 
Only when the Kremlin was seized by panic at the level of the disturbances that Nashi had initiated , did it demand that the police take control of events . 
It is not clear yet whether the nationalist youth rebellion has been suppressed , and whether Muscovites will be able to use the subway without fear during Russia &apos;s New Year and Orthodox Christmas holidays . 
In a society with weakened immunity to extremism - and with an utterly dysfunctional government - the authorities are , perhaps literally , playing with fire .
