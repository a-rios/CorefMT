Can We Increase Gross National Happiness ? 
PRINCETON - The small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan is known internationally for two things : high visa fees , which reduce the influx of tourists , and its policy of promoting &quot; gross national happiness &quot; instead of economic growth . 
The two are related : more tourists might boost the economy , but they would damage Bhutan &apos;s environment and culture , and so reduce happiness in the long run . 
When I first heard of Bhutan &apos;s goal of maximizing its people &apos;s happiness , I wondered if it really meant anything in practice , or was just another political slogan . 
Last month , when I was in the capital , Thimphu , to speak at a conference on &quot; Economic Development and Happiness , &quot; organized by Prime Minister Jigme Y. Thinley and co-hosted by Jeffrey Sachs , Director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University and Special Adviser to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , I learned that it is much more than a slogan . 
Never before have I been at a conference that was taken so seriously by a national government . 
I had expected Thinley to open the conference with a formal welcome , and then return to his office . 
Instead , his address was a thoughtful review of the key issues involved in promoting happiness as a national policy . 
He then stayed at the conference for the entire two and a half days , and made pertinent contributions to our discussions . 
At most sessions , several cabinet ministers were also present . 
Since ancient times , happiness has been universally seen as a good . 
Problems arise when we try to agree on a definition of happiness , and to measure it . 
One important question is whether we see happiness as the surplus of pleasure over pain experienced over a lifetime , or as the degree to which we are satisfied with our lives . 
The former approach tries to add up the number of positive moments that people have , and then to subtract the negative ones . 
If the result is substantially positive , we regard the person &apos;s life as happy ; if negative , as unhappy . 
So , to measure happiness defined in that way , one would have to sample moments of people &apos;s existence randomly , and try to find out whether they are experiencing positive or negative mental states . 
A second approach asks people : &quot; How satisfied are you with the way your life has gone so far ? &quot; 
If they say they are satisfied , or very satisfied , they are happy , rather than unhappy . 
On surveys that use the first approach , countries like Nigeria , Mexico , Brazil , and Puerto Rico do well , which suggests that the answer may have more to do with the national culture than with objective indicators like health , education , and standard of living . 
When the second approach is taken , it tends to be the richer countries , like Denmark and Switzerland , that come out on top . 
We may agree that our goal ought to be promoting happiness , rather than income or gross domestic product , but , if we have no objective measure of happiness , does this make sense ? 
John Maynard Keynes famously said : &quot; I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong . &quot; 
He pointed out that when ideas first come into the world , they are likely to be woolly , and in need of more work to define them sharply . 
That may be the case with the idea of happiness as the goal of national policy . 
Can we learn how to measure happiness ? 
The Center for Bhutan Studies , set up by the Bhutanese government 12 years ago , is currently processing the results of interviews with more than 8,000 Bhutanese . 
The interviews recorded both subjective factors , such as how satisfied respondents are with their lives , and objective factors , like standard of living , health , and education , as well as participation in culture , community vitality , ecological health , and the balance between work and other activities . 
It remains to be seen whether such diverse factors correlate well with each other . 
Trying to reduce them to a single number will require some difficult value judgments . 
Bhutan has a Gross National Happiness Commission , chaired by the prime minister , which screens all new policy proposals put forward by government ministries . 
If a policy is found to be contrary to the goal of promoting gross national happiness , it is sent back to the ministry for reconsideration . 
Without the Commission &apos;s approval , it cannot go ahead . 
One controversial law that did go ahead recently - and that indicates how willing the government is to take tough measures that it believes will maximize overall happiness - is a ban on the sale of tobacco . 
Bhutanese may bring into the country small quantities of cigarettes or tobacco from India for their own consumption , but not for resale - and they must carry the import-tax receipt with them any time they smoke in public . 
Last July , the UN General Assembly passed , without dissent , a Bhutanese-initiated resolution recognizing the pursuit of happiness as a fundamental human goal and noting that this goal is not reflected in GDP . 
The resolution invited member states to develop additional measures that better capture the goal of happiness . 
The General Assembly also welcomed an offer from Bhutan to convene a panel discussion on the theme of happiness and well-being during its 66th session , which opens this month . 
These discussions are part of a growing international movement to re-orient government policies towards well-being and happiness . 
We should wish the effort well , and hope that ultimately the goal becomes global , rather than merely national , happiness .
