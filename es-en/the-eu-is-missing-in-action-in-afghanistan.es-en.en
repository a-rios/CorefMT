The EU is Missing in Action in Afghanistan 
The withdrawal of Britain &apos;s Paddy Ashdown as a candidate for the post of UN envoy in Afghanistan means that the international community still has some way to go before it speaks with one voice in that country . 
Such a unified voice is needed , for six years of war and the biggest military operation in NATO &apos;s history have failed to subdue the Afghan insurgency , leaving President Hamid Karzai &apos;s increasingly corrupt government dependent on the continued presence of international forces . 
Afghanistan remains the world &apos;s fifth poorest country and its biggest opium producer , with a weak central state that is further debilitated by warlordism and the Taliban insurgency . 
There are many reasons for this outcome , but at least some of the blame lies with the European Union . 
On paper , the EU effort looks impressive . 
Twenty-five EU nations have contributed troops to NATO &apos;s 35,000-strong army in Afghanistan , and now represent more than half of all troops . 
EU states command a third of all Provincial Reconstruction Teams ( PRTs ) , and , together with the European Commission , have paid for a third of the country &apos;s post-2001 reconstruction . 
But European support for the Afghan mission is in fact limited , and cooperation between the biggest EU donor governments and the European Commission remains inadequate . 
Public support for Europe &apos;s engagement has been plummeting , and most EU governments have failed to act on NATO &apos;s request to boost troop levels . 
One exception is the United Kingdom , which has recently pledged to increase its troop numbers in the restive poppy-growing province of Helmand . 
But European troop contributions continue to fall short of the 17,000 US troops deployed with the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) and its 8,000 Coalition Force troops outside of ISAF . 
Apart from 1,500 Dutch soldiers in the neighboring Uruzgan province and a Polish and Romanian presence in Ghazni , Paktika , and Zabul , no other EU nations are willing to operate in the insurgency-ridden southern and eastern parts of the country , giving the Taliban free reign . 
Overall , there are at least 60 such operating restrictions - known as &quot; caveats &quot; - on European troops , preventing commanders from deploying military assets where they are most needed . 
In areas such as policing , the rule of law , and counter-narcotics , EU states have pursued policies entirely independently of each other . 
The EU Police Mission ( EUPOL ) , launched in June 2007 , was meant to address this lack of coordination , but in the end its focus was narrowed to police reform , with the Commission funding a separate judicial program . 
EUPOL started poorly , losing its first commander , and faces serious problems recruiting high-caliber staff . 
Finally , the Commission &apos;s annual development assistance to Afghanistan is falling this year , from € 200 million to € 150 million . 
Individual commitments are also being cut - for example , France &apos;s five-year , € 33 million pledge for reconstruction support is strikingly low compared to its total foreign-aid budget of € 9 billion . 
The EU cannot alter the international coalition &apos;s strategy alone . 
But a united EU can act as a powerful advocate for a better and more coordinated international approach . 
The US has argued that more troops are needed to dominate the terrain , lambasting EU governments for failing to step up their efforts as the US commits 3500 additional marines to the fray . 
European countries , meanwhile , criticize the current military strategy . 
They fear that more troops may only lead to more civilian casualties , antagonizing Afghans . 
Without a grand bargain between the US and the EU that ensures increased European support and troops , success in Afghanistan will be elusive and alliance-testing tensions with the US will remain . 
Such a bargain must contain two elements . 
First , the EU should commit to sending more troops , trainers , and civilians to the Afghan mission , as well as lifting all remaining &quot; caveats &quot; on its troops . 
The mission needs a 10 % troop increase , more military and police trainers , and more military equipment , including helicopters . 
In addition , the Commission should reverse the decline in assistance and spend more money though local governments and the PRTs . 
In exchange , the US should accept a strategic shift from combat operations to human security . 
Such a strategy means focusing more attention on ordinary Afghans , gradually expanding NATO &apos;s security presence outward from population centers , and working hand-in-glove with state and local authorities . 
This new strategy would be further strengthened if the international community abandoned the current counter-narcotics policy - including an end to aerial eradication - and helping Karzai reach a political settlement with mid-ranking , &quot; moderate &quot; insurgents . 
All of this will require leadership that cuts across institutional boundaries , which can be provided only by the UN and a strong-willed individual . 
The appointment of a new UN envoy should prove a more efficient way of coordinating Afghanistan &apos;s international helpmates . 
And it is to be hoped that whoever is chosen may be able to foster the grand bargain between the US and EU that is so badly needed . 
Despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan , all is not lost . 
But turning the situation around will require changing the way the international community operates . 
By striking a bargain with the US , the EU should lead the way .
