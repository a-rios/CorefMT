A Peace Agenda for Global Development 
MONROVIA , LIBERIA - This week , the 27 members of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda gather in Monrovia , Liberia , to advise United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . 
At the meeting , the Panel will establish a &quot; bold yet practical &quot; vision for joint action on sustainable development . 
While these discussions - hosted by Liberian President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , and British Prime Minister David Cameron - take place , the nearby Sahel and the Great Lakes region continue to be plagued by violence and conflict . 
Indeed , large-scale displacement of people and unspeakable human suffering are occurring in many African countries ( not to mention in Syria and elsewhere ) , threatening to reverse the continent &apos;s unprecedented economic progress during the last decade . 
The Panel ( of which I am a member ) must seize the opportunity presented by the Monrovia meeting to contribute to a global development agenda that addresses the vicious cycle of conflict and poverty that hampers economic activity and undermines human well-being . 
For more than a decade , the Millennium Development Goals , which expire in two years , have provided the framework for international development cooperation , with a focus on combating poverty worldwide . 
In developing a new , comprehensive follow-up agenda , global leaders should recognize that , although the MDGs have enabled millions of people worldwide to escape illiteracy , disease , and hunger , their overall impact has been inadequate , particularly in fragile , conflict-ridden countries . 
World Bank statistics show that no conflict-affected low-income country has achieved a single MDG , reflecting the framework &apos;s failure to address problems caused by organized violence and insecurity effectively . 
That is why the post-2015 agenda should be centered on peace , security , and freedom from fear . 
It should aim to make justice and prosperity a reality for everyone . 
And it should reflect the understanding that development is impossible without peace , just as peace is impossible without development - and that lasting peace and sustainable development are impossible without respect for human rights and the rule of law . 
Furthermore , as the Monrovia meeting &apos;s theme , &quot; National Building Blocks for Sustained Prosperity , &quot; suggests , post-2015 global development initiatives should emphasize support for national efforts to achieve strong , stable , long-term prosperity . 
Strategies that would help countries to overcome domestic insecurity and conflict , transform their economies , and , ultimately , meet their potential include strengthening governance institutions and the rule of law , ensuring multi-stakeholder participation , and guaranteeing that all citizens have equal access to justice . 
International support for such efforts would mean giving African leaders and stakeholders the opportunity - and the responsibility - to eliminate underdevelopment and boost prosperity . 
Moreover , while poverty eradication will remain a paramount concern after 2015 , the focus must shift from national averages to local disparities . 
Measures must move beyond overall social needs to bolster progress in productive job-creating and income-generating sectors . 
And strong efforts must be made in conflict-affected countries to promote reconciliation and prevent the revival of violence . 
Given Liberia &apos;s recent success in post-conflict reconstruction and human development , following a 14-year civil war , it is a fitting setting for the Panel &apos;s deliberations . 
Since 2003 , domestic vision and commitment , together with international support , have enabled Liberia to hold democratic elections , reintroduce some essential public services , reestablish a public-finance management system , and make progress in addressing endemic corruption , rebuilding public institutions , and reconstructing national infrastructure . 
The Panel should view Liberia &apos;s ongoing efforts to secure peace , maintain stability , and initiate economic and social transformation as a blueprint for successful post-conflict transition . 
Other inspiring models can be found in Rwanda , Mozambique , and Sierra Leone . 
The Panel is committed to creating an ambitious , coherent , and practical proposal for a sustainable global development agenda . 
The process will be open , inclusive , and transparent , and will be informed by the opinions and experiences of experts and stakeholders representing young people , women , the elderly , and the disabled , as well as legislative , academic , and inter-governmental actors . 
The Panel will also take advantage of extensive online and offline efforts to engage with people worldwide and gain insight into the future that they envision . 
Their perspectives will enrich efforts to develop an agenda that addresses their priorities . 
In a world roiled by conflict , development efforts will always fall short . 
The post-2015 global development agenda must take a comprehensive approach , combining poverty-reduction measures with peace-building initiatives and strategies for economic transformation . 
In this way , global leaders can begin to lay the foundations for prosperity , justice , and sustainable development worldwide . 
Future generations are counting on it .
