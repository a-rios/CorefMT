Fighting the Aids Pandemic 
CAMBRIDGE : After a wasted decade , the world is rousing itself against the AIDS pandemic sweeping through the world &apos;s poorest countries , especially in Africa and South-Asia . 
The pandemic has claimed 19 million lives , and created 13 million orphans . 
34 million more people live with the HIV virus that causes AIDS ; virtually all are marked for early death . 
While first identified in the US in the early 1980s , Aids is now concentrated in poor countries : 25 million people suffer from it in Africa ; 6 million more in Asia . 
In parts of Southern Africa more than 20 % of adults are afflicted . 
Poor countries suffer more than rich countries for multiple reasons . 
Poverty leads to lower comprehension of the disease , with individuals less likely to protect themselves by using condoms . 
Poverty makes medical treatment expensive , so poor people with AIDS often hide their disease because there is no point in having tests if treatment doesn &apos;t follow . 
Poverty also induces husbands to work away from home as migrant laborers , creating an environment in which sex with multiple partners is more likely . 
Poverty also renders women powerless to reject unwanted sexual advances from men who may infect them . 
Even the biology of the disease may be different . 
HIV / AIDS may be more readily transmitted in Sub-Saharan Africa because of the prevalence of other diseases , especially other sexually transmitted diseases , that facilitate the transmission of HIV . 
The genetic characteristics of HIV in Southern Africa are also different from HIV in America and Europe . 
Some scientists believe Africa &apos;s genetic sub-type is more easily transmitted . 
HIV / AIDS is the greatest pandemic in modern history . 
Because it is concentrated in poor countries , it seems , the world has shrugged . 
The World Bank provides only a few millions dollars , not the billions needed to combat the disease in Africa . 
It &apos;s almost as if China possessed a cure for the bubonic plague in the 14th century , but decided to stand by and watch as Europe succumbed to the Black Death . 
It is time to shift from inaction to urgent combat against the pandemic , backed by billions of dollars in assistance from rich countries . 
While no overall action plan exists yet , the outlines of such a plan have taken shape . 
A proper plan of action should have three components : prevention , treatment , and new research and development towards medical approaches to controlling the disease . 
Prevention is mostly the responsibility of poor countries . 
Their leaders should speak out publicly and repeatedly against the disease , helping educate their people about how to reduce risky behavior . 
Special programs to induce prostitutes to use condoms have helped to reverse the epidemic in Thailand ; similar approaches are needed in Africa . 
Rich countries must provide urgent funding for medical treatment of those with HIV / AIDS . 
This includes : funds to stop the transmission of AIDS from mothers to infants ; funds to help fight infections such as tuberculosis that accompany AIDS ; and with good program design , even funds for anti-retroviral therapies . 
With specially designed , low-cost combinations of drugs , and with the drugs provided to the poorest countries at the lowest possible production costs , it may be possible to extend ARV therapies to even very poor countries at an acceptable price . 
The third step must be an expanded program of research and development into new and more effective approaches to controlling the disease . 
The most promising answer for the long term is a vaccine to protect against the disease . 
Recent breakthroughs in basic science give hope that a vaccine can be developed within a decade , if the billions of dollars of research and development funds are mobilized by both public and private sectors . 
A full-fledged fight against AIDS in Africa might require support from rich countries of around $ 5 billion per year for this three-pronged strategy of prevention , treatment , and research . 
Perhaps $ 4 billion is needed for prevention and care , and $ 1 billion for research specifically directed at the disease in Sub-Saharan Africa ( in addition to more general AIDS research already underway ) . $ 5 billion amounts to a mere $ 5 per person per year , since there are 1 billion people living in rich countries that can donate . 
At such a modest cost , and with the stakes so high , it is hard to imagine the world failing to act decisively . 
At the G-8 summit in Japan last week , rich-country leaders pledged action . 
They agreed to convene in Japan by the end of the year to chart a practical plan of action . 
For the sake of humanity , let us insist that rhetoric is turned into real financial support to organize efforts to save millions of lives in the poorest countries .
