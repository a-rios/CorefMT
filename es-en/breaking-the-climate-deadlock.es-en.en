Breaking the Climate Deadlock 
LONDON - On July 9 , the leaders of the world &apos;s largest economies will meet in L &apos;Aquila , Italy , at the Major Economies Forum ( MEF ) to discuss progress towards a new global climate agreement . 
In six months , a deal is supposed to be struck in Copenhagen , so the MEF meeting comes at a vital moment . 
When many of the same leaders met in April to address the economic crisis , they rightly pledged to do &quot; whatever is necessary . &quot; 
The same spirit needs to animate the L &apos;Aquila meeting . 
There is enormous good will to do so . 
The new US administration is supporting strong American action . 
China is setting ambitious targets for reducing energy intensity and making massive investments in renewable energy . 
India has put forward its own action plan . 
Europe has set a goal of cutting emissions by 30 % below 1990 levels by 2020 if there is an ambitious global agreement . 
Japan has published its proposals for major carbon reductions . 
Across the world , commitments are forthcoming . 
But practical challenges remain . 
What is being asked is that global emissions be less than half their 1990 levels by 2050 , having peaked before 2020 . 
Since emissions from the developing countries are on the whole lower than those of the developed world - and will need to continue to rise in the short-term as they maintain economic growth and address poverty - it has been proposed that developed countries cut emissions by at least 80 % relative to 1990 by 2050 , with major steps towards this goal over the next decade . 
Developing countries will also need to play their part , significantly slowing and peaking emissions growth in the coming decades . 
For the US , such commitments would mean cutting emissions to around one-tenth of today &apos;s per capita level , while for China it would mean creating a new low-carbon model of economic development . 
For all countries , this is a major challenge - a revolution that implies a huge shift in policy . 
The good news is that if we focus on clear , practical , and achievable goals , major reductions can be made in order to ensure that , whatever the precise interim target , the world will fashion a radical new approach within a manageable timeframe . 
A new report from the &quot; Breaking the Climate Deadlock &quot; project , a strategic partnership between my office and The Climate Group , shows how major reductions even by 2020 are achievable if we focus action on certain key technologies , deploy policies that have been proven to work , and invest now in developing those future technologies that will take time to mature . 
Perhaps the most interesting fact to emerge is that fully 70 % of the reductions needed by 2020 can be achieved by investing in three areas : increasing energy efficiency , reducing deforestation , and use of lower-carbon energy sources , including nuclear and renewables . 
Implementing just seven proven policies - renewable energy standards ( e.g. , feed-in tariffs or renewable portfolio standards ) ; industry efficiency measures ; building codes ; vehicle efficiency standards ; fuel carbon content standards ; appliance standards , and policies for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ( REDD ) - can deliver these reductions . 
All seven policies have already been successfully implemented in countries around the world , but they need scaling up . 
While cap-and-trade systems or other means of pricing carbon emissions can help provide incentives for businesses to invest in low-carbon solutions , in the short term at least , these seven policy measures - and direct action and investment by governments - are needed to achieve the targets . 
In the longer term , we also need technologies such as carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) , expanded nuclear power , and new generations of solar energy , together with the development of technologies whose potential or even existence is still unknown . 
The important thing for Copenhagen is that decisions are taken now for investments that will yield benefits later . 
For example , the overwhelming majority of new power stations in China and India - necessary to drive the industrialization that will lift hundreds of millions out of poverty - will be coal-fired . 
That is just a fact . 
So developing CCS or an alternative that allows coal to become clean energy is essential for meeting the 2050 goal . 
But we need to invest now , seriously and through global collaboration , so that by 2020 we are in a position to scale up CCS or be ready to deploy other alternatives . 
Renaissance of nuclear power will require a big expansion of qualified scientists and engineers . 
Electric vehicles will need large adjustments to infrastructure . 
Smart grid systems can enable big savings in emissions , but require a plan for putting them into effect . 
These measures will take time , but require investment now . 
Meanwhile , in the short term , low energy lighting and efficient industrial motors may sound obvious , but we are nowhere near using them as extensively as we could . 
So we know what we need to do , and we have tools available to achieve our goals . 
MEF leaders can therefore have confidence in adopting the interim and long-term targets recommended by the scientific community : keeping warming to below two degrees Celsius ; peaking emissions within the next decade ; and at least halving global emissions by 2050 versus 1990 . 
Developed countries will be able to commit to reducing their emissions by 80 % versus 1990 by mid-century , as many have already done , and provide the necessary financial and technology support for developing countries &quot; adaptation and mitigation efforts . 
With that support , developing countries in turn will need to design and implement &quot; Low-Carbon Growth Plans &quot; that significantly slow and eventually peak their emissions growth . 
By making these commitments , the MEF leaders , whose countries account for more than three-quarters of global emissions , would lay a firm foundation for success in Copenhagen . 
Between L &apos;Aquila and Copenhagen , there will undoubtedly be difficult discussions over interim targets for developed countries . 
While such targets are important , what matters most is agreement on the measures that ultimately will set the world on a new path to a low carbon future . 
For years , the emphasis has rightly been on persuading people that there must be sufficient &quot; will &quot; to tackle climate change . 
But leaders , struggling to cope with this challenge even amidst economic crisis , need to know that there is also &quot; a way . &quot; 
Only by combining the two will we succeed . 
Fortunately , such a way - immensely challenging but nonetheless feasible - exists .
