A New-State Solution for Israel and Palestine 
PRINCETON - Imagine a two-state solution in Israel and Palestine in which Palestinians would have the right of return ; 
Israelis could settle wherever they could purchase land in the West Bank ; and Jerusalem need not be divided . 
This is not a fanciful vision , but a creative and eminently sensible reinvention of twenty-first century statehood . 
And US President Barack Obama &apos;s just-completed visit to Israel provides an opportunity to explore genuinely new thinking . Ever since Bill Clinton nearly succeeded in brokering a comprehensive settlement in 2000 , the mantra among supporters of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been that , while a solution exists , Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are willing to reach it do not . 
The solution is a version of the deal that Clinton sought : two sovereign states based on the 1967 borders , with negotiated land swaps to reflect existing settlement patterns . 
The agreement would include a land corridor connecting Gaza and the West Bank ; a divided Jerusalem with guaranteed access for all to religious sites ; 
But suppose that the reason that no Palestinians and Israelis willing to conclude such a deal have emerged is that the solution itself is domestically unsupportable on both sides . 
Suppose that as long as a version of this deal is the only game in town , the creeping physical expansion of the Israeli state and the demographic expansion of Israeli Arabs will continue to erode its foundation . 
For all the dire warnings that the window for a two-state solution is rapidly closing ( or has already closed ) , it is the solution itself that is the problem . 
In 2008 , a Princeton University graduate student in philosophy named Russell Nieli gave a talk at the Princeton Center for Jewish Life that was so well received that he later expanded it into an article for the US-based magazine Tikkun , founded by Rabbi Michael Lerner . 
The article , &quot; Toward a Permanent Palestinian / Israeli Peace - the Case for Two-State Condominialism , &quot; was published with the express aim of stimulating &quot; productive thinking among a younger generation of Jews and Arabs not bound by the restricted vision and failed policies of the past . &quot; 
&quot; Two-state condominialism &quot; is as visionary as the name is clunky . 
The core idea is that Israelis and Palestinians would be citizens of two separate states and thus would identify with two separate political authorities . 
Palestine would be defined as a state of the Palestinian people , and Israel as a Jewish state . 
Think about that for a minute . 
As Nieli describes it , Palestinians &quot; would have the right to settle anywhere within Israel just as Jews would have the right to settle anywhere within the territory of the Palestinian state . 
Regardless of which of the two states they lived in , all Palestinians would be citizens of the Palestinian state , all Jews citizens of Israel . &quot; 
Each state would have the authority and the obligation to provide for the economic , cultural , religious , and welfare needs of its citizens living in the other state &apos;s territory . 
These would be extraterritorial rights and responsibilities , just as the United States , for example , provides for its large numbers of expatriates , such as civilian dependents of US military personnel based abroad . 
To make this work , the borders of each state would first have to be defined - presumably on the basis of the 1967 borders , with mutually agreed territorial swaps . 
Israeli Arabs would then be required to transfer their citizenship , national identity , and national voting rights - but not their residence - to the new Palestinian state . 
They would have a permanent right to live in Israel and would retain the benefits to which they are currently entitled as Israeli citizens , but they would now vote as citizens of Palestine . 
All other Palestinians living in Israel would have rights and benefits only under Palestinian law . 
Condominialism recognizes the reality of the deep interconnectedness of Israeli settlers in the West Bank with the rest of Israel - through roads , water supplies , electricity grids , administrative structures , and economic relationships ( just as Israeli and Palestinian parts of Jerusalem are interdependent ) . 
Instead of trying to separate and recreate all of these structures and relationships , it makes far more sense to build on them in ways that benefit both states &quot; peoples and economies . 
And , in a world in which many citizens spend an increasing proportion of their time in virtual space , de facto condominialism is already happening . 
In the 1950 &quot; s , after four decades of war across Europe , the idea of a European Union in which member states &quot; citizens could live and work freely across national borders while retaining their political allegiance and cultural identity seemed equally far-fetched . 
( Indeed , the name of the political process by which the EU was to be constructed , &quot; neo-functionalism , &quot; was every bit as abstract and cumbersome as &quot; two-state condominialism . &quot; ) 
Yet French and German statesmen summoned the vision and the will to launch a bold experiment , one that has evolved into a single economy of 500 million people . 
Why shouldn &apos;t another site of ancient enmities be the source of a new conception of statehood ? 
Interestingly , many young people in the 1950 &quot; s , like my Belgian mother , ardently supported the vision of a new Europe . 
Today &apos;s young Israelis and Palestinians pride themselves on their entrepreneurialism , with all the risk and vision that starting something new entails . 
Supporting and contributing to an innovative political start-up would be their generation &apos;s defining act .
