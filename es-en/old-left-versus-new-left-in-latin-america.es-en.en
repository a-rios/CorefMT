Old Left Versus New Left in Latin America 
There are two ways to interpret Latin America &apos;s recent election results . 
First , and most obviously , the supposed turn to the left is running out of steam , fast . 
In recent weeks , the hyper-nationalist Ollanta Humala , a clone of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , was defeated in Peru , the conservative Alvaro Uribe won a landslide victory in Colombia , with 62 % of the vote , and Andrés Manuel López Obrador has fallen behind in Mexico &apos;s July 2 presidential election . 
All of these isolated developments seemingly contradict the leftward trend in Latin America . 
But there is another way of looking at these events . 
Yes , President Uribe won re-election , but the big surprise in Colombia was the end of the two-party system that had dominated the country for decades , and the emergence of the left-wing Polo Democrático as the second largest political force in the nation . 
Similarly , while Alan García won in Peru , he does not come from a hard-left party that has finally seen the light ( like Lula da Silva in Brazil , Michelle Bachelet in Chile , and Tabaré Vázquez in Uruguay ) . 
His APRA party , founded by Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre in the 1920 &quot; s , is one of the region &apos;s oldest and most anachronistic populist organizations . 
Like Chávez in Venezuela , Kirchner in Argentina , Evo Morales in Bolivia , and López Obrador in Mexico , President García belongs to the unreconstructed left that springs from the great Latin American populist tradition . 
He may have learned many lessons from his disastrous presidency in the 1980 &quot; s , but he is much closer to the wrong left than to the right one . 
In Mexico , López Obrador has both begun picking up in the polls in recent days , and showing his true colors , promising the stars and the moon to the Mexican electorate . 
In fact , the more important recent developments within the Latin American left may lie not so much in the horserace results of elections , but in the growing differences between modernists and revanchists , between national interests and ideology . 
As Morales cozies up to Chávez and Fidel Castro more quickly than most people expected - nationalizing Bolivia &apos;s natural gas , inviting large numbers of Cuban doctors and advisers to his country , and signing myriad cooperation agreements with Venezuela - he is also fueling increasing tensions with Brazil and Chile . 
Both countries are his neighbors , and in theory at least , their leaders are his ideological soul mates . 
But the differences between the modern and archaic left , and the three countries &quot; contradictory national interests , seem to be trumping more superficial political affinities . 
For example , Saõ Paulo , Brazil &apos;s industrial powerhouse , now depends for most of its energy on Bolivian natural gas . 
As a result , Petrobras , the Brazilian energy company , has invested huge sums in Bolivia in everything from exploration to pipelines . 
Now , with the election of Evo Morales , the main source of Petrobras &apos;s natural gas has suddenly been nationalized . 
Indeed , domestic royalties on Bolivian gas production are being increased by more than 50 % , and the price charged to Bolivia &apos;s foreign clients may well be doubled . 
Contracts are being respected only in the breach , and technicians and lawyers from PDVESA , the Venezuelan oil giant , are auditing Petrobras installations in Bolivia . 
Lula wants to be nice to Morales , but he can &apos;t be nice to his expropriating neighbor and at the same time keep the industrialists and consumers of Saõ Paulo happy . 
Similar frictions are arising with Chile . 
President Bachelet would like to solve the century-old problem of landlocked Bolivia &apos;s access to the Pacific , but she is finding this task to be trickier than expected , as Morales increases gas prices and reduces gas exports to Argentina , Chile &apos;s largest foreign supplier of energy . 
Nor does Morales &apos;s rhetoric help : accusing the United States of attempting to assassinate him , as he did last week , does not endear him to the elites of a country that has signed a free-trade agreement with the US and whose president will be visiting Washington soon . 
At the end of the day , Bolivia &apos;s immediate national interests may be served by Morales &apos;s strategic alliance with Cuba and Venezuela . 
On the other hand , Chávez &apos;s unabashed meddling in the Peruvian elections may have so alienated Alan García that he actually becomes a European-style social democrat , and López Obrador may deliver on his promises to respect NAFTA , adhere to macro-economic orthodoxy , and pursue good relations with the US . 
But the cleavage between the two lefts in Latin America is steadily deepening . 
This is inevitable , because that rupture is being fueled by the simple acknowledgement that responsible governments must place national interests ahead of nostalgia , grandstanding rhetoric , and strident ideology .
