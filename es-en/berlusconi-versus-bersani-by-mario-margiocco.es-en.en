Italy &apos;s Taxing Election 
MILAN - A winter election is not to Italian tastes . 
But , on February 24-25 , up to 50 million voters will go to the polls to elect a new parliament , delivering Italy &apos;s 62nd government in the last 65 years . 
Since November 2011 , Italy has been led not by a politician , but by an academic economist and a former European Union commissioner , Mario Monti . 
His emergency technocratic government , supported by the left and right , was a masterstroke of outgoing President Giorgio Napolitano . 
Napolitano &apos;s move was crucial , filling Italy &apos;s need to replace the inefficient and scandal-ridden Silvio Berlusconi , in whom fellow leaders and global markets had lost all confidence , with an internationally respected figure . 
Under Monti &apos;s leadership , reforms were finally initiated and markets were calmed . 
To enhance the credibility of public finances , Monti &apos;s government substantially increased taxes , particularly on real estate , while preserving the already record-high income-tax rate . 
The tax plan highlighted that Italy , like Japan , is a country of public debt and private wealth . 
As the economist Marco Fortis points out , Italian family wealth is still , if not for long , second to none in Europe . 
Beyond growing international credibility , two major changes to the Italian political landscape have shaped the election campaign . 
The first is Monti &apos;s surprise resignation in December , after losing the backing of Berlusconi &apos;s party . 
While he will not run as a candidate ( he is already a senator for life ) , he formed a centrist coalition - affiliated with neither the left nor the right - to contest the election , and has declared his willingness to resume his leadership role if the coalition is victorious . 
The second change is that , after almost two decades of striving for a workable political system dominated by the center-left and center-right parties , Italy is experiencing a remarkable dispersion of forces . 
The ballot will include dozens of competing parties , most of which will not win parliamentary seats , owing to a 2005 electoral law requiring at least 4 % of the national vote to enter the Chamber of Deputies ( the lower house ) and 8 % on a regional basis to enter the Senate . 
According to public-opinion polls , the center-left Democratic Party , led by Pier Luigi Bersani , along with some more left-leaning allies , has the support of roughly 33 % of the electorate , down since late January , while backing for Berlusconi &apos;s center-right coalition has risen to 28 % . 
Meanwhile , Monti &apos;s centrist grouping has only 16 % support , while the populist Five Star Movement , founded by the comedian Beppe Grillo in 2009 , has 17 % backing - a figure that could go higher if those who previously stayed at home decide to cast a protest vote . 
The real battle , therefore , is between the Bersani and Berlusconi coalitions . 
Most observers believe that Bersani will carry the day , thanks to the much-criticized electoral law , which will give him control of the lower chamber if he wins a majority - regardless of how many people vote or how slim the margin . 
The law favored Berlusconi in 2008 ; it is likely to benefit Bersani now . 
But , in order to govern , Bersani would need both chambers , and he is unlikely to muster 50.1 % in the Senate . 
At the same time , with Monti &apos;s coalition failing to gain traction , reflecting the historically limited appeal of classic bourgeois parties in Italy , many observers are wondering what his role in the next government will be . 
For Bersani , creating a coalition with Monti may well be the key to gaining control of the upper house and , in turn , of the government . 
Amid these plans and predictions , a growing banking scandal has reminded Italians that , in politics , luck can sometimes make the difference . 
When Monte dei Paschi di Siena - Italy &apos;s third-largest bank - revealed that it faced losses of up to € 720 million ( $ 970 million ) from complex derivatives deals carried out in 2006-2009 , support for Bersani &apos;s coalition slipped , owing to the PD &apos;s long-standing ties to the bank . 
Given that Italians tend to vote against , rather than for , issues , mistrust of the PD has translated into increased support for Berlusconi &apos;s coalition . 
Another issue with the potential to undermine the PD &apos;s standing is the party &apos;s advocacy of a new wealth tax . 
Italians already shoulder heavy taxes : an individual taxpayer with annual income of € 50,000 pays € 15,000 in income tax ; with two children , that total drops by only € 1,000 . 
By contrast , a French taxpayer with the same income pays only € 9,000 ; with two children , the tax bill plummets to € 3,000 , and a € 1.5 million fortune would mean an additional wealth tax of only € 4,230 . 
In other words , with or without children , the French citizen &apos;s annual tax payment would be smaller than that of the Italian taxpayer with no additional wealth . 
In this context , a new wealth tax could be a dangerous proposition for the PD . 
One feature of Italy &apos;s turbulent politics remains consistent : the control exercised by entrenched interests , and the dominance of a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy . 
With less than one-fifth of the population of the United States , Italy &apos;s parliament has twice as many members as the US Congress , and they are among the world &apos;s best-compensated and most privileged MPs . 
Meanwhile , Italy &apos;s top bureaucrats are the highest paid in history , according to OECD data , with several retired officials drawing larger pensions than former US presidents receive . 
The salaries of Italy &apos;s military chiefs of staff and chief of police are almost triple those of their American counterparts . 
But prospects for political reform do not inspire optimism . 
While Grillo &apos;s supporters may ignite fireworks in protest of these gilded giveaways for a few months , a consistent assault leading to genuine reform seems doubtful . 
More broadly , the outcome of Italy &apos;s election will undoubtedly have a far-reaching impact on a still-fragile eurozone , though the nature of that impact remains impossible to predict - unless Berlusconi returns to power , in which case the consequences will be all too clear .
