An Assassination in Belgrade 
Not since Archduke Franz Ferdinand &apos;s assassination has a murder shaken Belgrade as much as the killing of Serbian Premier Zoran Djindjic . 
The bullets that killed Djindjic may also have slain Serbian hopes for normalcy at the very moment that we were emerging from the nightmare of Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s long misrule . 
With the bloody wars of the Yugoslav succession still etched deeply in everyone &apos;s minds , does Djindjic &apos;s assassination herald the end of an era of political violence or the dawn of a new one ? 
Milosevic &apos;s ouster two years ago was turbulent , but no one was killed . 
Serbs were justly proud : a dictatorship was ended in a democratic , peaceful way . 
Milosevic &apos;s extradition to face charges of war crimes before the Hague Tribunal - a trial that has proceeded without incident in Serbia - was also peaceful . 
With relations in the region and with the West approaching something like normalcy , Serbs were beginning to feel , at long last , that they were finding peace with themselves and the world . 
Of course , assassinations are nothing new in Serbia . 
&quot; Arkan , &quot; the leader of the most murderous paramilitary group in the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo , and a political power even after Milosevic &apos;s fall , was murdered in Belgrade last year . 
Djindjic himself narrowly escaped a highway assassination attempt only last month . 
But most Serbs were beginning to believe that the ballot and not the gun was becoming the dominant tool of politics . 
Djindjic &apos;s effective leadership brought about this change . 
Although the most popular politician of the uprising against Milosevic was Vojislav Kostunica , who replaced him as president , it was Djindjic who skillfully coordinated the volatile coalition that opposed the regime . 
His boundless energy and quick thinking delivered success from behind the scenes . 
As Serbia &apos;s prime minister after Milosevic , he resembled a corporate CEO more than the Heidelberg-educated philosophy professor that he was . 
Djindjic remained pragmatic , never doctrinaire . 
As a result of Serbia &apos;s predicament , he accumulated more power than prime ministers typically wield . 
Milosevic &apos;s regime left behind crippled institutions , with large sections of the police and judiciary and many state-owned companies remaining under the control of Milosevic &apos;s clique . 
With little trust in existing institutions to implement reforms , Djindjic often took shortcuts , using extra-legal means and improvised parliamentary majorities to push through legislation . 
Only prosperity and a &quot; European Serbia &quot; mattered . 
Did these short cuts help incite his death ? 
Who can say ? 
They certainly did little to build respect for the rule of law . 
Yet the immediate consequences of Djindjic &apos;s death will be tragic . 
He was seen in the West as a reformer , and reform may not proceed without him . 
If it does not , urgently needed Western investment won &apos;t materialize . 
Serbia will again seem a benighted and lawless land . 
Although Djindjic was not popular , only extreme nationalists and die-hard Milosevic supporters are cheering . 
They regard his murder as just punishment for the &quot; traitor &quot; Djindjic &apos;s decision to extradite Milosevic - and other Serbian &quot; heroes &quot;  - to The Hague . 
The more dangerous outcome is that the assassination may reinforce the belief in Serbia that only authoritarian rule is possible . 
Given the prevalence of this belief , Djindjic &apos;s death creates a serious power vacuum precisely because his vast personal power was moving Serbia in some of the right directions . 
Now , it is feared , organized crime will intimidate his less talented successors . 
For now , Serbia &apos;s government has imposed a state of emergency . 
But effective or quick suppression of the organized criminals who were almost certainly behind Djindjic &apos;s murder is unlikely . 
The reason for this also explains why Djindjic could not rely on the Serb state to carry out his policies . 
Many policemen and intelligence officers are on the crime bosses &apos; payrolls . 
The fact that a former president of Serbia , Ivan Stambolic , could disappear without a trace in 1999 is grim testimony to the power of Serbia &apos;s criminal underworld . 
Indeed , Djindjic may well be a victim of his recent moves to root out organized crime . 
He was initially slow in fighting organized crime , because he did not want to alienate the bulk of Milosevic &apos;s mafia-infested establishment at once . 
He preferred to confront corrupt institutions one at a time as he consolidated his rule . 
Sadly , he may also have needed the support of some crime bosses at the outset . 
Djindjic &apos;s murder will make the fight against crime the country &apos;s main political goal . 
In this , politicians will at last have something like united public support . 
But crime would not be as powerful as it is , and the police and judiciary would not be as corrupt , if Serbia &apos;s economy were in better shape . 
Serbia is poor and Western aid is desperately needed . 
Djindjic &apos;s murder shows that the situation is so dire that aid should no longer be strictly conditional on harsh reforms . 
For the moment , extreme nationalists and Milosevic supporters may feel triumphant . 
But the one certain success of Djindjic &apos;s era is that they will never return to power . 
Their vision of a chauvinistic , inward-looking Serbia has been discredited , while Djindjic &apos;s stance may become more popular due to his martyrdom . 
Moments of defeat have always been history &apos;s turning points in Serbia . 
Once again , Serbs face such a moment . 
This time , however , we must resolve to remember Zoran Djindjic &apos;s cause - political and economic liberty - more than his blood sacrifice .
