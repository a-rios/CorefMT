Fighting Terror Among the Believers 
The flames of Islamic fundamentalism are not confined to the Middle East and Central Asia . 
Indonesia is increasingly in the news because of its large Muslim population , the rise of fundamentalist rhetoric , and purported connections to international terrorism . 
The emergence of violent Muslim vigilante groups employing jihadist rhetoric and mobilizing followers for jihad is one of the most conspicuous new phenomena in Indonesian Islam . 
The bomb blasts that rocked Kuta , Bali near midnight last October 12th profoundly effected almost every aspect of Indonesian life . 
After years of official denial , that horrifying incident triggered awareness that terrorism does exist in Indonesia and that Indonesia &apos;s home grown fanatics are connected to a global terrorist network . 
Soon after the Bali bomb conspiracy was uncovered , earlier explosions that rocked various parts of the country were reexamined . 
Not all of them were definitively connected , but the renewed investigations revealed ties between a number of disparate terrorist groups . 
The perpetrators of these bomb blasts are now understood to belong to linked , hard-line Islamist organizations . 
Recently , the International Crisis Group , a Brussels-based NGO , revealed the links between Islamist radicalism in Indonesia , and international terrorism . 
The document , &quot; Al-Qaeda In Southeast Asia : The Case Of The &quot; Ngruki Network , &quot; is an exhaustive review of reliable public data , and identifies a handful of individuals with possible direct or indirect links with Al-Qaeda . 
The good news , however , is that the ICG finds no evidence of an extensive Al-Qaeda network in Indonesia . 
The evidence of international penetration of Indonesian radical groups is quite limited . 
Nevertheless , Indonesians would be mistaken in thinking that they have nothing to fear . 
The ICG report was narrowly conceived and intended to focus on a single issue , namely the evidence for an Al-Qaeda presence in Indonesia . 
Some important questions remain . 
Is radical Islamism ratcheting up its influence in post-Suharto Indonesia ? 
Are elements within the military continuing to support radical Islamist militias opportunistically , as they began to do in recent years ? 
Are elements of the political elite appealing to radical Islamist sentiment , as a way of leveraging their power ? 
Are moderate Islamic intellectuals facing increasing criticism and challenge ? 
Unfortunately , the answer to all these questions is yes . 
The stakes for Indonesia are high . 
When the United States declared war against terrorism , Bush administration officials characterized Indonesia as a strategic partner in the struggle against terrorism . 
Paul Wolfowitz , Deputy Secretary of Defense and former US Ambassador to Indonesia , said that the US must bring new seriousness to helping Indonesia in its quest to secure a stable democracy and prosperous economy . 
But Indonesia can do so only if it demonstrates an unrelenting commitment to anti-terrorist policies . 
Foreign investment is already at its nadir , due to the lingering political crisis following the fall of the Suharto dictatorship , and to doubts about the soundness of the country &apos;s institutional and legal capacity . 
Backtracking on official resolve to fight terrorism would hardly convince international business to start investing in Indonesia again . 
The authorities have natural allies in the large , moderate Muslim organisations , especially the Nahdhatul Ulama and the Muhammadiyah , that lead Indonesian civil society . 
These groups are fed up with how radicals have smeared Islam in Indonesia , and they are beginning to work together to challenge the extremists head on . 
This is not to say that they agree with the American critique of Indonesian policy . 
But these two prominent , national membership organizations may succeed in dampening Islamic militancy where the government , afraid of waging the battle it must fight , has failed dismally . 
The real conflict ignited by the terrorist attacks is not between Islam and an American-led , Judeo-Christian &quot; crusade . &quot; 
The greater challenge is the ongoing struggle within the worldwide Islamic community , the Ummah , between moderate , progressive Muslims on the one hand and fundamentalist extremists on the other . 
This battle for the hearts and minds of believers will be fought on two fronts : the first is theological and educational , while the second concerns socioeconomic issues and the civil society agenda . 
In both cases the experiences of Indonesia will be critical . 
In essence , extremism and fundamentalism can be countered only from within the faith . 
No amount of American intervention will turn the tide against bigotry and ignorance . 
In fact , too much meddling by Westerners could radicalize the community even more . 
Moderate believers must look to examples such as Indonesia , where Islam has encountered and interacted with new and alien forces . 
In Indonesia ( and to a lesser extent Malaysia ) , science and technology , commerce and modern management as well as the all-important challenges of democracy , human rights , and gender equality are being tackled head-on in authentic terms of Muslim discourse . 
Finally , moderate Muslims must explore Indonesia &apos;s vibrant and indigenous Islamic traditions . 
The country &apos;s rich vein of Islamic scholarship has embraced new ideas and sought to interpret the Koran in a manner that reveals its compatibility with democracy , human rights , gender equality and social justice . 
Indonesians have the tools to thwart radicals &apos; efforts to usurp Islam . 
The fight will not be easy , but it can be won .
