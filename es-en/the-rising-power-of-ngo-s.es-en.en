The Rising Power of NGO \ u0027s 
When Human Rights Watch declared last January that the Iraq War did not qualify as a humanitarian intervention , the international media took notice . 
According to the Internet database Factiva , 43 news articles mentioned the report , in publications ranging from the Kansas City Star to the Beirut Daily Star . 
Similarly , after the abuses of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison were disclosed , the views of Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross put pressure on the Bush administration both at home and abroad . 
As these examples suggest , today &apos;s information age has been marked by the growing role of non-governmental organizations ( NGO &apos;s ) on the international stage . 
This is not entirely new , but modern communications have led to a dramatic increase in scale , with the number of NGO &apos;s jumping from 6,000 to approximately 26,000 during the 1990 &apos;s alone . 
Nor do numbers tell the whole story , because they represent only formally constituted organizations . 
Many NGO &apos;s claim to act as a &quot; global conscience , &quot; representing broad public interests beyond the purview of individual states . 
They develop new norms by directly pressing governments and businesses to change policies , and indirectly by altering public perceptions of what governments and firms should do . 
NGO &apos;s do not have coercive &quot; hard &quot; power , but they often enjoy considerable &quot; soft &quot; power - the ability to get the outcomes they want through attraction rather than compulsion . 
Because they attract followers , governments must take them into account both as allies and adversaries . 
A few decades ago , large organizations like multinational corporations or the Roman Catholic Church were the most typical type of transnational organization . 
Such organizations remain important , but the reduced cost of communication in the Internet era has opened the field to loosely structured network organizations with little headquarters staff and even to individuals . 
These flexible groups are particularly effective in penetrating states without regard to borders . 
Because they often involve citizens who are well placed in the domestic politics of several countries , they can focus the attention of media and governments onto their issues , creating new transnational political coalitions . 
A rough way to gauge the increasing importance of transnational organizations is to count how many times these organizations are mentioned in mainstream media publications . 
The use of the term &quot; non-governmental organization &quot; or &quot; NGO &quot; has increased 17-fold since 1992 . 
In addition to Human Rights Watch , other NGO &apos;s such as Transparency International , Oxfam , and Doctors without Borders have undergone exponential growth in terms of mainstream media mentions . 
By this measure , the biggest NGO &apos;s have become established players in the battle for the attention of influential editors . 
In these circumstances , governments can no longer maintain the barriers to information flows that historically protected officials from outside scrutiny . 
Even large countries with hard power , such as the United States , are affected . 
NGO &apos;s played key roles in the disruption of the World Trade Organization summit in 1999 , the passage of the Landmines Treaty , and the ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in May 2003 . 
The US , for example , initially had strong objections to the Convention on Tobacco Control , but dropped them in the face of international criticism . 
The Landmines Treaty was created despite the opposition of the strongest bureaucracy ( the Pentagon ) in the world &apos;s largest military power . 
Similarly , transnational corporations are often targets of NGO campaigns to &quot; name and shame &quot; companies that pay low wages in poor countries . 
Such campaigns sometimes succeed because they can credibly threaten to damage the value of global brand names . 
Royal Dutch Shell , for example , announced in 2003 that it would not drill in any spots designated by UNESCO as World Heritage sites . 
This decision came two years after the company acceded to pressure from environmentalists and scrapped plans to drill in a World Heritage site in Bangladesh . 
Transnational drug companies were shamed by NGO &apos;s into abandoning lawsuits in South Africa in 2002 over infringements of their patents on drugs to fight AIDS . 
Similar campaigns of naming and shaming have affected the investment and employment patterns of Mattel , Nike , and a host of other companies . 
NGO &apos;s vary enormously in their organization , budgets , accountability , and sense of responsibility for the accuracy of their claims . 
It is hyperbole when activists call such movements &quot; the world &apos;s other superpower , &quot; yet governments ignore them at their peril . 
Some have reputations and credibility that give them impressive domestic as well as international soft power . 
For better and for worse , NGO &apos;s and network organizations have resources and do not hesitate to use them . 
Do NGO &apos;s make world politics more democratic ? 
Not in the traditional sense of the word . 
Most are elite organizations with narrow membership bases . 
Some act irresponsibly and with little accountability . 
Yet they tend to pluralize world politics by calling attention to issues that governments prefer to ignore , and by acting as pressure groups across borders . 
In that sense , they serve as antidotes to traditional government bureaucracies . 
Governments remain the major actors in world politics , but they now must share the stage with many more competitors for attention . 
Non-governmental actors are changing world politics . 
After Abu Ghraib , even US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld must take notice .
