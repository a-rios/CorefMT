The Limits of Energy Innovation 
Winnipeg - President Barack Obama has promised an energy revolution in the world &apos;s largest economy , with renewable sources of power and &quot; green &quot; technologies breaking America &apos;s - and ultimately the world &apos;s - dependence on conventional fuels . 
The environmental , strategic , and economic benefits - including lower use of carbon-emitting fossil fuels , less reliance on politically volatile oil-and-gas exporters , and the creation of millions of well-paid jobs - are uncontroversial . 
But how realistic is this vision ? 
There is only one kind of primary energy ( energy embodied in natural resources ) that was not known to the first high civilizations of the Middle East and East Asia and by all of their pre-industrial successors : isotopes of the heavy elements whose nuclear fission has been used since the late 1950 &quot; s to generate heat that , in turn , produces steam for modern electricity turbo-generators . 
Every other energy resource has been known for millennia , and most of them were harnessed by pre-modern societies . 
The fundamental difference between traditional and modern uses of energy consists not in access to new or better energy resources , but in the invention and mass deployment of efficient , affordable , reliable , and convenient &quot; prime movers , &quot; devices that convert primary energies into mechanical power , electricity , or heat . 
History could be profitably subdivided into eras defined by the prevailing prime movers . 
The longest span ( from the first hominids to the domestication of draft animals ) is made up of the age when human muscles were the only prime mover . 
Then came the addition of draft animals and gradual supplementation of animal prime movers by mechanical prime movers , such as sails and wheels , that capture natural energy flows . 
A fundamental break with this millennia-long pattern came only with widespread adoption of the first practical mechanical prime mover able to convert the heat of fuel combustion - James Watt &apos;s improved steam engine , designed in the 1780 &quot; s . 
More efficient versions of this prime mover dominated the modernization of the Western world until the first decade of the twentieth century . 
During the 1830 &quot; s , the first water turbines marked the beginning of the end of the waterwheel era . 
The next two key milestones came during the 1880 &quot; s , with the invention by Benz , Daimler , and Maybach of the gasoline-fuelled Otto-cycle internal combustion engine and the patenting of Charles Parsons &quot; steam turbine . 
The 1890 &quot; s witnessed the arrival of Rudolf Diesel &apos;s inherently more efficient version of the liquid-fueled internal combustion engine . 
There is only one more prime mover to add to this sequence . 
The gas turbine was conceived at the beginning of the twentieth century , but its first working prototypes ( both stationary and for flight ) came only during the 1930 &quot; s , and began to be rapidly diffused in the 1950 &quot; s . 
Today &apos;s most ubiquitous mechanical prime mover - installed in nearly a billion road and off-road vehicles , water vessels , airplanes , and countless machines and tools - is the gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine , fundamentally unchanged since the 1880 &quot; s . 
Economic globalization would have been impossible without the diesel engines that power enormous crude and liquefied natural gas tankers , bulk cargo vessels transporting iron ore and grain , and massive container ships : some of them now have unit capacities close to 100 MW , but their basic design was mastered within two decades of Diesel &apos;s test of his final engine prototype in 1897 . 
Most of the world &apos;s electricity is generated by steam turbines in fossil-fuel-burning and nuclear power plants , and , except for much larger capacities and higher efficiencies , Parsons would recognize in them every key feature of his invention , now more than 120 years old . 
And intercontinental flights would be an even greater trial without the gas turbines invented in the 1930 &quot; s by Frank Whittle ( who thought about turbofans , now the dominant commercial design , even before he built the first turbojet ) and Joachim Pabst von Ohain . 
These realities offer three obvious but under-appreciated conclusions about the mechanical prime movers that are the foundations of our economic progress . 
First , because of their large numbers and their associated ( and often expensive and extensive ) infrastructures , prime movers are remarkably inert . 
There has been little real innovation ever since these prime movers were first commercialized more than a century ago ( water turbines , steam turbines , internal combustion engines ) or more than 50 years ago ( gas turbines ) . 
Second , any transition to new prime movers is an inherently prolonged affair , taking decades to accomplish . 
Even today , for example , there are few indications that steam turbines will not continue to generate the bulk of our electricity in the decades ahead , or that gas turbines will be replaced anytime soon . 
Recent developments show that even automotive internal combustion engines will not yield to electric motors or fuel cells as rapidly as many enthusiasts have hoped . 
Finally , the wider the scale on which an energy prime mover is deployed , the longer it will take for substitutions to appear . 
A century ago , the world used coal and a relatively small volume of oil at the rate of 0.7 TW , but in 2008 established commercial energies - fossil fuels and primary ( water and nuclear ) electricity - flow at the rate of nearly 15 TW . 
Obviously , this scale limits the speed with which new prime movers can be introduced to replace any significant share of the old devices . 
For example , if 20 % of the world &apos;s electricity were to be generated by wind turbines , then , considering their inherently low load factor of about 25 % ( compared to 75 % for thermal stations using steam turbines ) , we would need to install new capacity of some 1.25 TW in these machines . 
Even with large 3-MW turbines , this would require more than 400,000 new tall towers and giant triple blades . 
That is a task for many decades .
