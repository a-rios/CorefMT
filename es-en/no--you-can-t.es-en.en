No , You Can &apos;t 
COPENHAGEN - Several thousand officials from 194 countries just gathered in Cancún , Mexico , for yet another global climate summit . 
Dissatisfied with the pace of climate diplomacy , many individuals are now wondering what they can do about climate change on their own . 
For years now , climate activists from Al Gore to Leonardo DiCaprio have argued that individual actions like driving more economical cars and using more efficient light bulbs are a crucial element in the effort to address global warming . 
The United Nations &quot; climate panel and the International Energy Agency both echo this sentiment , insisting that higher energy efficiency could reduce energy consumption by up to 30 % - making improved efficiency an effective remedy for climate change . 
But is this really true ? 
Here &apos;s something to think about . 
Since then , of course , we have made great strides in energy efficiency . 
As The Washington Post recently reported , dishwashers now use 45 % less power than they did two decades ago , and refrigerators 51 % less . 
So how much energy do Americans use in their homes today ? 
On a per capita basis , the figure is roughly what it was 40 years ago : 70 million BTUs . 
This surprising lack of change is the result of something economists call the &quot; rebound effect . &quot; 
It &apos;s a phenomenon familiar to urban planners , who long ago discovered that building more roads doesn &apos;t ease traffic jams - it merely encourages more people to get in their cars and drive . 
The underlying principle is a decidedly counterintuitive fact of life . 
You might think that learning to use something more efficiently will result in your using less of it , but the opposite is true : the more efficient we get at using something , the more of it we are likely to use . 
Efficiency doesn &apos;t reduce consumption ; it increases it . 
The Breakthrough Institute recently highlighted on its blog some startling - and important - research findings along these lines , published in August in The Journal of Physics by energy economist Harry Saunders and four colleagues from the US Department of Energy &apos;s Sandia National Laboratories . 
For this reason , the proportion of resources that we expend on lighting has remained virtually unchanged for the past three centuries , at about 0.72 % of gross domestic product . 
As Saunders and his colleagues observe in their journal article , &quot; This was the case in the UK in 1700 , is the case in the undeveloped world not on grid electricity in modern times , and is the case for the developed world in modern times using the most advanced lighting technologies . &quot; 
The conclusion that Saunders and his co-authors draw from this is both surprising and hard to dispute : rather than shrinking our electricity use , the introduction of ever more efficient lighting technologies is much more likely to lead to &quot; massive ... growth in the consumption of light . &quot; 
It &apos;s difficult to overstate what these findings mean for climate policy . 
In a nutshell , they tell us that , while increasing energy efficiency is undoubtedly a good thing , it is most assuredly not a remedy for global warming . 
Or , as Saunders puts it , &quot; energy efficiency may be a net positive in increasing economic productivity and growth , but should not be relied upon as a way to reduce energy consumption and thus greenhouse gas emissions . &quot; 
This is not an argument that should encourage anyone to go out and buy a Hummer . 
But we shouldn &apos;t fool ourselves into thinking that swapping our current car for a Prius , or replacing our incandescent lights with energy-efficient fluorescent bulbs , will strike a meaningful blow against climate change . 
The real fix to this problem will come when governments focus on research and development aimed at boosting the proportion of green energy sources in overall consumption . 
It may be reassuring to believe there are cheap and easy things we can do as individuals to stop global warming , or that the answer is to continue chasing a chimerical global agreement on carbon cuts , as in Cancún . 
But the real action that we can take is to press our politicians to put smarter ideas on the table .
