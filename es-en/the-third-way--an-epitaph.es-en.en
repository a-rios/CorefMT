The Third Way : an Epitaph 
The last half-century has seen the end of ideological politics in much of the world . 
First came the apocalyptic collapse of fascism as Hitler took Germany with him into a collective suicide . 
Fascism &apos;s demise was followed by the more gradual disintegration of communism after Stalin &apos;s death and Khrushchev &apos;s revelations of Stalin &apos;s crimes . 
The failed revolutions in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968 foreshadowed the eventual failure of the Soviet empire in 1989 . 
While these pseudo-religions collapsed , a benevolent ideology of social democracy dominated much of Europe . 
Its core was the belief that the state could provide both stable economic growth and social welfare to cushion the negative side effects of free markets . 
Not everyone subscribed to this theory , but it was the West &apos;s strongest political force for several decades . 
Christian Democrats , and even conservative parties , adopted its tenets . 
But by the early 1980 &apos;s social democracy had exhausted itself . 
It had simply been too successful to remain a force for change . 
Moreover , it had brought about new rigidities , notably bureaucratization and that deadly phenomenon of the 1970 &apos;s , stagflation - economic stagnation and high unemployment coupled with galloping inflation . 
The reaction to this malaise came swiftly , and it had a name - well , two names : Ronald Reagan and , above all , Margaret Thatcher . 
&quot; Thatcherism &quot; was not really much of an ideology ; it was more a gut reaction to the stagnant 1970 &apos;s , an attempt to loosen the bureaucratic straitjacket of the state and to reveal that not everything that arose from state benevolence was good . 
Even the word &quot; neo-liberal &quot; exaggerates the intellectual coherence of this counter force . 
This change in political direction coincided with ­ - indeed , was perhaps responsible for - the process that we now call globalization . 
Thatcherism plus globalization had many liberating consequences , but the combination also created new social problems , begetting losers as well as winners . 
The Thatcherite counter-revolution was so successful that it , too , began to incite countervailing pressures . 
By the late 1990 &apos;s , the political scene almost everywhere came to be dominated by the desire to combine competitiveness and growth-induced wealth creation on the one hand with solidarity , justice , and social cohesion on the other . 
Both were to be achieved within a liberal order . 
This is the main political project in most free societies , and it is in principle acceptable to all major parties . 
Yet some tried to turn it into a new ideological edifice . 
They believed that a new age of social democracy had dawned , and for a while they sought to prove their point : Bill Clinton , Tony Blair , Gerhard Schroeder , Romano Prodi , even some of those elected in the postcommunist countries seemed to belong to this political camp . 
The new &quot; Third Way &quot; spreading from Washington to London to the rest of the world seemed to embody these leaders &apos; own ideology . 
As it turned out , this episode was even shorter-lived than the conservative counter-revolution . 
Indeed , it was no more than an episode . 
Some of us always suspected that the Schroeder-Blair idea of &quot; New Labour &quot; or , in German , the &quot; New Center , &quot; had no real basis . 
Soon it emerged that not all its apparent supporters actually supported it ; when Chancellor Schroeder &apos;s proposed reforms caused squeals within his own party , he quickly dropped much of the Third Way program like a hot potato . 
At the same time , Blair found more sympathy for the Third Way with his Spanish conservative colleague José María Aznar than among many social democrats . 
The apparent hegemony of neo-social democrats began to crumble after only a few years . 
Aznar was not the only conservative to replace a socialist government in the Mediterranean world , and the recent defeat of the socialists in Greece is unlikely to be the last . 
The Benelux countries , some Scandinavian states , and many of the new Europeans of East Central Europe have chosen traditionally right-of-centre parties . 
The German Chancellor and his &quot; red-green &quot; coalition still clings to power but is today severely weakened . 
Even Tony Blair is struggling to hold on . 
All this does not augur a new change of direction in Europe . 
If Schroeder gave way to the Christian Democrats , indeed even if President Bush lost to his Democrat challenger , this would not imply the dawn of a new age . 
Domestically the one and only issue in most countries remains the same : how to provide a sustainable basis for economic growth in the harsh climate of the global marketplace while at the same time maintaining solidarity and a sense of fairness throughout society . 
Whoever governs must try to square this circle . 
This would truly be the end of ideology at last , were it not for the new challenges arising from the temptations of various kinds of fundamentalism . 
Versions of nationalism as well as the ascendancy of religiously tinted forms of integrisme threaten the fabric of a free world . 
The inventors of the Third Way mostly overlooked the value of individual liberty , but it is this that remains the single most important issue in a world where open societies still face mortal enemies .
