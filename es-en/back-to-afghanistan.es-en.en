Back to Afghanistan 
While the unremitting violence in Iraq grabs the world &apos;s headlines , Afghanistan still struggles for peace . 
The country &apos;s parliament is packed with warlords , the drug trade is thriving , and violence is on the rise . 
This week , world leaders have an opportunity to steer developments onto a new and more hopeful path when they meet in London to forge a new compact with Afghanistan . 
The need for renewed attention to Afghanistan could hardly be greater . 
Decades of neglect coupled with foreign intervention left the country in ruins , with reverberations across the world . 
It is now in everyone &apos;s interest to help Afghanistan rebuild . 
The drug trade exemplifies the far-reaching impact of domestic instability . 
Last year , the value of drugs produced in Afghanistan - the world &apos;s largest supplier of opiates - is estimated to have reached up to 25 % of GDP . 
Security , too , remains a serious concern . 
In 2005 , more than 125 Coalition troops were killed , while suicide bombing emerged as a new and increasingly common tactic of the insurgency . 
Corruption is rampant , with government officials accused of cronyism and drug trafficking . 
Several members of the newly elected parliament are known warlords with bloody records . 
With international aid poorly coordinated and the United States reducing its troop strength , many Afghans believe that the outside world is abandoning them . 
But the massive scale of the challenges facing Afghanistan should not overshadow the opportunities for positive change . 
The Bonn process established the principle of democratic accountability , gave Afghanistan its first directly elected president , and provided a new constitution that - approved after genuine debate and compromise - created a legitimate central government . 
It also paved the way for a parliament in which over a quarter of the members are women - this in a country where , just five years ago , women were not even allowed to leave the house without a male relative . 
Moreover , most of the 20,000 village councils were elected through secret ballot . 
In a nod to the importance of the councils to realizing change at the most local level , the World Bank and its partners have adopted a highly innovative program that channels rural development aid through the councils , which have been empowered to decide how the funds will be spent . 
At the national level , the government recently approved a new development strategy that goes far to advance a vision for Afghanistan &apos;s future stability and growth . 
Public opinion reflects widespread support for the latest changes . 
A recent poll shows that Afghans overwhelmingly favor their country &apos;s new direction - backing the participation of women in public life and international intervention against al Qaeda , the Taliban , and the drug economy . 
But Afghanistan &apos;s potential for progress must be bolstered by concerted international action . 
At the London Conference , world leaders should support the counter-narcotics strategy recently approved by the Afghan government , which would reduce economic dependence on opium production , punish traffickers and dealers , and provide sustainable economic alternatives for poppy farmers . 
Afghanistan is grappling with the world &apos;s biggest narcotics problem and donors must commit to a long-term drug control strategy . 
The conference should follow up on a resolution by the European Parliament to consider whether Afghanistan should become one of the countries licensed to produce opium for medical purposes . 
Furthermore , instead of pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into technical assistance and short-term capacity-building programs , the London conference should strive to help meet the Afghan government &apos;s benchmark for equipping young people with the skills and education necessary to lead their nation to a future of peace and prosperity . 
International support could help educate 40,000 Afghans each year in urgently needed fields , such as engineering , management , agriculture , law , and economics . 
Judicial reform is another pressing issue . 
Currently , the judiciary is incapable of trying a case of petty theft much less of ensuring human rights . 
A Supreme Court dominated by conservative factions has selected judges and prosecutors , and Afghans have little legal redress in a system that allows local commanders , who hold sway over the judiciary , to act with impunity . 
Without a viable legal system , foreign investment will remain elusive . 
Even Afghan expatriates in the Gulf states , who have invested roughly $ 5 billion in regional and global trading networks , are reluctant to invest in their homeland . 
Reform is nonetheless clearly possible . 
Last month , the Afghan leadership finally adopted - albeit half-heartedly - a transitional justice plan that could remove from power the biggest war criminals who have consolidated their grip on the country over the past five years . 
Implementation of this plan would not only give a boost to the rule of law , but also would enhance security and lead to better governance . 
Failure to act would mean a betrayal of the Afghan people , who in 2001 welcomed the US army and NATO forces as liberators .
