The Crisis of Putinism 
PARIS - Why is Russian President Vladimir Putin resorting to increasingly repressive measures against his opponents ? 
After all , the Putin regime , in place for nearly 14 years , controls most public institutions and the entire security apparatus , including the public prosecutors , and can close or censor any media outlet at any time without notice . 
So why target journalists , small entrepreneurs , and NGOs - an approach that inevitably stifles social and economic life and condemns the country to stagnation ? 
Is the lion scared of the mouse ? 
Or is the mouse actually not that small and harmless ? 
The government &apos;s recent record is depressing : in just a few months , the authorities have imposed several new repressive laws , forced influential journalists out of their jobs , and prosecuted human-rights defenders , mayors , lawyers , and prominent politicians . 
Political leaders , government officials , and judges do not even pretend that the judicial system is independent and fair . 
Kompromaty - fake , compromising charges - are used liberally and openly . 
The closure of the United States Agency for International Development &apos;s operations in Russia , and of Radio Svoboda , are emblematic of efforts to restrict freedom of opinion and limit foreign cooperation . 
But the recent clampdown has not deterred the opposition or silenced criticism . 
The Internet remains vibrant , and street protests continue to be held in major cities . 
Even prosecuted opponents , like Sergei Udaltsov and Alexei Navalny , have managed to &quot; remain in the game . &quot; 
The Opposition Coordination Council was chosen in an online election in October , with tens of thousands participating in the vote , notwithstanding threats and hacking . 
This is the first sign of institutionalization of organizations and movements outside Putin &apos;s orbit , and outside captive public institutions , like the State Duma and government-controlled television . 
Alternative modes of action remain limited and vulnerable , but they exist and will not disappear ; in an authoritarian regime , that is already a significant achievement . 
The Internet cannot be fully controlled , and will thus develop into Russia &apos;s main sphere of communication and free speech . 
In this new context of institutionalization of anti-establishment groups , the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights looks even more outmoded and useless after it added 39 new members , for a total of 62 ( the most authoritative independent figures quit last year ) . 
At its first meeting with Putin in November , Council Chairman Mikhail Fedotov looked uncomfortable and admitted that it will be difficult to work effectively . 
To many observers in Russia , however , the regime &apos;s post-electoral offensive against &quot; unfriendly &quot; forces seems certain to be counterproductive in the longer term . 
They may be right . 
The protests mobilized hundreds of thousands of Russians , putting huge pressure on central , regional , and local government authoritiesfor several months . 
They showed that the Kremlin cannot reduce a new and powerful social trend - memorialized by countless Web sites , blogs , and online archives - to &quot; isolated outbursts &quot; fomented by &quot; foreign agents . &quot; 
Second , Putin and his cronies know full well that their legitimacy is shaky , given their failure to dispel the widespread perception that the elections in December 2011 and March 2012 were rigged . 
And , while talk of &quot; modernization &quot; has subsided since Putin regained his presidential seat in May , corruption has not , and ordinary Russians now hold senior officials responsible for it . 
For the first time in years , they question their leaders &quot; real intentions and their capacity to deliver better living standards . 
Third , a widening generation gap has spread to the ruling elites . 
Putin &apos;s men are seen by their own children , whose horizon is not limited to Russia , as outdated and out of touch . 
The younger generation feels stifled by their elders &quot; stale , protectionist policies . 
They did not experience the dull but stable certainties of the Soviet party-state , and few yearn for its resurrection . 
This is why former President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s &quot; rise and fall , &quot; staged like a soap opera , has played a socially corrosive role . 
While holding Putin &apos;s place until he could return for a third presidential term , Medvedev actually rallied public support . 
As President , he achieved virtually nothing in terms of the rule of law , decentralization , or economic modernization ; nonetheless , a significant part of Russia &apos;s elite and middle class pinned their hopes on him as a counterweight to the Putin clans and siloviki ( security officials ) . 
It was wishful thinking , but it permeated the political and social climate . 
The spell was broken when Putin reasserted his grip on executive power . 
His current term will be different from his previous presidential administrations , and more uncertain . 
Putin and his government lack a forward-looking strategy , an innovative spirit , and political agility . 
While Putin still has considerable resources at his disposal , using them will become increasingly costly - politically , economically , and socially . 
Authoritarian clientelist regimes depend on the silent assent of their populations and the loyalty of their elites . 
Unfortunately for Putin , when the former is called into question by popular protest , the latter can no longer be taken for granted .
