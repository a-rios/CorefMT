Thaksin Returns 
Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has returned to Bangkok 17 months after being deposed in a military coup . 
Thaksin has repeatedly denied that he intends to reenter politics , from which he has been barred for five years . 
Thaksin already is believed by many to be providing advice to the government of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej . 
Indeed , Samak &apos;s People Power Party ( PPP ) is widely considered a proxy for Thaksin . 
It was , after all , formed from the remains of Thaksin &apos;s Thai Rak Thai party , which was disbanded after the coup . 
Of course Thaksin &apos;s political revival can &apos;t get underway unless and until he has been acquitted of corruption charges . 
After all , Thaksin is too serious a man to risk freedom for the sake of sentimentality . 
Moreover , he remains very popular in Thailand , if not in Bangkok . 
His presence in the country might well spark a clamor for his &quot; reluctant &quot; return to politics . 
Now , add to all this a soccer team . 
Thaksin &apos;s ownership of the Manchester City football club might not seem of great importance to observers outside Thailand and Asia . 
But Thais are soccer enthusiasts and even bigger fans of the English Premier League . 
His proprietorship provides Thais with a direct connection to an elite team in the world &apos;s most popular sport . 
This , in turn , gives him a substantial popularity dividend to add to his store . It was not for nothing that he had two Man City players accompany him on his return to Thailand . The PPP &apos;s victory in the December polls has also been seen as vindication of sorts for Thaksin . 
Given the opportunity to vote , voters turned to a party not unlike Thaksin &apos;s pre-coup Thai Rak Thai . 
Obviously , none of this will please Thaksin &apos;s opponents . 
The situation is all the more uncertain in view of a problem facing the PPP . 
Just hours before Thaksin returned to Bangkok , Thailand &apos;s Election Commission convicted the speaker of the parliament &apos;s lower house of fraud after he paid civil servants to campaign on behalf of the party . 
The Supreme Court must uphold the ruling , but if it does , the speaker will lose his parliamentary seat . 
Thus , under almost any scenario , Thaksin &apos;s return could well mark a return to those fraught days of 2006 just before the last coup .
