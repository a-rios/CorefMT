The Davos Apocalypse 
FORT LAUDERDALE - At the World Economic Forum &apos;s annual meeting in Davos last month , leading participants called for a rapid shift to cleaner energy to tackle climate change . 
There is something unsettling about the global power elite jetting into an exclusive Swiss ski resort and telling the rest of the world to stop using fossil fuels . 
The apocalyptic bombast is even more disturbing . 
According to Angel Gurría , Secretary-General of the OECD , &quot; our planet is warming dangerously , &quot; and we need to act now &quot; to avoid catastrophe &quot; ; the United Nations climate chief , Christiana Figueres , maintains that global warming means that &quot; the world economy is at risk . &quot; 
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan takes the prize for the most extreme rhetoric , claiming that not curbing global warming is &quot; a terrible gamble with the future of the planet and with life itself . &quot; 
Yet , the rhetoric is unconvincing . 
Yes , global warming is real and man-made . 
But creating panic and proposing unrealistic policies will not help in tackling the problem . 
Both Annan and Gurría cited Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last November as evidence of increased climate-change-related damage . 
Never mind that the latest report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) found that &quot; current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century &quot; and reported &quot; low confidence &quot; that any changes in hurricanes in recent ( or future ) decades had anything to do with global warming . 
Annan and Gurría also neglected to note that global Accumulated Cyclone Energy , an index for total hurricane activity , is hovering at the lowest values seen since the 1970 &quot; s . 
Indeed , the trend for strong hurricanes around the Philippines has declined since 1951 . 
Similarly , Gurría tells us that Hurricane Sandy , which slammed into New York City in 2012 , is an example of inaction on climate change , costing the United States &quot; the equivalent of 0.5 % of its GDP &quot; each year . 
In fact , the US currently is experiencing the longest absence of intense landfall hurricanes since records began in 1900 , while the adjusted damage cost for the US during this period , including Hurricane Sandy , has fallen slightly . 
Figueres claims &quot; that current annual losses worldwide due to extreme weather and disasters could be a staggering 12 % of annual global GDP . &quot; 
But the study she cites shows only a possible loss of 1-12 % of GDP in the future , and this is estimated not globally but within just eight carefully selected , climate-vulnerable regions or cities . 
By contrast , according to the IPCC , &quot; long-term trends in economic disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate change . &quot; 
On the contrary , the bulk of peer-reviewed economic evidence indicates that , up to around 2050-2070 , the net global economic impact of rising temperatures is likely to be positive . 
Although global warming will create costs stemming from more heat-related deaths and water stress , they will be outweighed by the benefits from many fewer cold-related deaths and higher agricultural productivity from higher levels of CO2 . 
Global warming is a long-term problem . 
Most models indicate that the cost toward the end of the century will be 1-5 % of world GDP . 
This is not a trivial loss ; but nor does it put &quot; the world economy at risk . &quot; 
For comparison , the IPCC expects that by the end of the century , the average person in the developing world will be 1,400-1,800 % richer than today . 
Such incorrect statements by leading officials reinforce wasteful policies based on wishful thinking . 
Figueres sees &quot; momentum growing toward &quot; climate policies as countries like China &quot; reduce coal use . &quot; 
In the real world , China accounts for almost 60 % of the global increase in coal consumption from 2012 to 2014 , according to the International Energy Agency . 
While Figueres lauds China for dramatically increasing its solar-power capacity in 2013 , the increase in China &apos;s reliance on coal power was 27 times greater . 
Figueres &apos;s weak grasp on the facts has led her not only to conclude that China is &quot; doing it right &quot; on climate change , but also to speculate that China has succeeded because its &quot; political system avoids some of the legislative hurdles seen in countries including the US . &quot; 
In other words , the UN &apos;s top climate official seems to be suggesting that an authoritarian political system is better for the planet . 
The fact remains that global wind and solar power usage in 2012 cut , at most , 275 million tons of CO2 , while soaking up $ 60 billion in subsidies . 
With the electricity worth possibly $ 10 billion , the average cost of cutting a ton of CO2 is about $ 180 . 
The biggest peer-reviewed estimate of the damage cost of CO2 is about $ 5 per ton . 
This means that solar and wind power avoid about $ 0.03 of climate damage for every dollar spent . 
Compare this to smarter technological solutions . 
In the short run , the US shale-energy revolution has replaced high-polluting coal with cheaper , cleaner natural gas . 
This has cut about 300 million tons of US emissions - more than all the world &apos;s solar and wind power combined - and at the same time has profited Americans by saving them $ 100 billion in energy costs . 
In the long run , current investment in green research and development will help drive the price of future renewable energy below that of fossil fuels , enabling a choice that is both environmentally and economically sound . 
In the meantime , even dramatic cuts in CO2 emissions will have very little impact on hurricanes 50-100 years from now . 
Lifting billions of people out of poverty , however , would not only be intrinsically good ; it would also make societies much more resilient in the face of extreme weather , whether caused by global warming or not . 
Unfortunately , as we saw at Davos , the global climate debate is polluted with myths and wishful thinking . 
If we want to do more good at lower cost , we should start by cleaning it up .
