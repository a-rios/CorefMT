Finding the Policy Exit 
NEW YORK - There is a general consensus that the massive monetary easing , fiscal stimulus , and support of the financial system undertaken by governments and central banks around the world prevented the deep recession of 2008-2009 from devolving into Great Depression II . 
Policymakers were able to avoid a depression because they had learned from the policy mistakes made during the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s and Japan &apos;s near depression of the 1990 &quot; s . 
As a result , policy debates have shifted to arguments about what the recovery will look like : V-shaped ( rapid return to potential growth ) , U-shaped ( slow and anemic growth ) , or even W-shaped ( a double-dip ) . 
During the global economic free fall between the fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009 , an L-shaped economic and financial Armageddon was still firmly in the mix of plausible scenarios . 
The crucial policy issue ahead , however , is how to time and sequence the exit strategy from this massive monetary and fiscal easing . 
Clearly , the current fiscal path being pursued in most advanced economies - the reliance of the United States , the euro zone , the United Kingdom , Japan , and others on very large budget deficits and rapid accumulation of public debt - is unsustainable . 
These large fiscal deficits have been partly monetized by central banks , which in many countries have pushed their interest rates down to 0 % ( in the case of Sweden to even below zero ) , and sharply increased the monetary base through unconventional quantitative and credit easing . 
In the US , for example , the monetary base more than doubled in a year . 
If not reversed , this combination of very loose fiscal and monetary policy will at some point lead to a fiscal crisis and runaway inflation , together with another dangerous asset and credit bubble . 
So the key emerging issue for policymakers is to decide when to mop up the excess liquidity and normalize policy rates - and when to raise taxes and cut government spending ( and in which combination ) . 
The biggest policy risk is that the exit strategy from monetary and fiscal easing is somehow botched , because policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don &apos;t . 
If they have built up large , monetized fiscal deficits , they should raise taxes , reduce spending , and mop up excess liquidity sooner rather than later . 
The problem is that most economies are now barely bottoming out , so reversing the fiscal and monetary stimulus too soon - before private demand has recovered more robustly - could tip these economies back into deflation and recession . 
Japan made that mistake in 1998-2000 , just as the US did in 1937-1939 . 
But , if governments maintain large budget deficits and continue to monetize them as they have been doing , at some point - after the current deflationary forces become more subdued - bond markets will revolt . 
When that happens , inflationary expectations will mount , long-term government bond yields will rise , mortgage rates and private market rates will increase , and one would end up with stagflation ( inflation and recession ) . 
So how should we square the policy circle ? 
First , different countries have different capacities to sustain public debt , depending on their initial deficit levels , existing debt burden , payment history , and policy credibility . 
Smaller economies - like some in Europe - that have large deficits , growing public debt , and banks that are too big to fail and too big to be saved may need fiscal adjustment sooner to avoid failed auctions , rating downgrades , and the risk of a public-finance crisis . 
Second , if policymakers credibly commit - soon - to raise taxes and reduce public spending ( especially entitlement spending ) , say , in 2011 and beyond , when the economic recovery is more resilient , the gain in markets &quot; confidence would allow a looser fiscal policy to support recovery in the short run . 
Third , monetary policy authorities should specify the criteria that they will use to decide when to reverse quantitative easing , and when and how fast to normalize policy rates . 
Even if monetary easing is phased out later rather than sooner - when the economic recovery is more robust - markets and investors need clarity in advance on the parameters that will determine the timing and speed of the exit . 
Avoiding another asset and credit bubble from arising by including the price of assets like housing in the determination of monetary policy is also important . 
Getting the exit strategy right is crucial : serious policy mistakes would significantly heighten the threat of a double-dip recession . 
Moreover , the risk of such a policy mistake is high , because the political economy of countries like the US may lead officials to postpone tough choices about unsustainable fiscal deficits . 
In particular , the temptation for governments to use inflation to reduce the real value of public and private debts may become overwhelming . 
In countries where asking a legislature for tax increases and spending cuts is politically difficult , monetization of deficits and eventual inflation may become the path of least resistance .
