Europe &apos;s Harmony Overdose 
PRAGUE - One pillar of the European Union &apos;s single market is harmonization . 
At first sight , that makes a lot of sense . 
Harmonized systems of rules make it easier for capital and labor to move around in search of their best use . 
Alas , some Europhiles &quot; unifying zeal has all too often spilled beyond the bounds of economic reason , even common sense . 
More unification and harmonization does not necessarily lead to effective - or even reasonable - solutions to the EU &apos;s troubles . 
The main point of the new European regulatory measures under consideration ( apart from the so-called new Basel III rules ) is to bring more stability to the financial system . 
The indirect effect will be to reduce the financial sector &apos;s size - in absolute terms and relative to the economy - and to hinder its growth in the future . 
But these effects will also occur in EU countries whose financial sectors have maintained a high degree of stability in the current crisis . 
Delivery of financial services will be made more difficult and expensive everywhere , even though some countries &quot; banks are financed by stable long-term deposits rather than short-term interbank loans , with few toxic assets and local loans that are more than comfortably covered by local deposits . 
This is why one can hear many voices opposing the idea of a harmonized EU-wide bank levy or tax . 
This levy , strongly backed by those countries whose financial sectors are in tatters after the crisis , is hard to swallow for EU states that did not intervene to bail out their banks . 
The levy is an easy way to spread the political and financial costs of the crisis from some to all EU members . 
If applied , bank capital will be scarcer , the flow of credit slower , and bank fees higher in countries with pretty stable financial sectors , simply because others have spent a fortune to support their financial systems - and because the European Commission never misses an opportunity to unify rules across the EU . 
The same is true , for instance , for the derivatives trading system . 
The post-crisis harmonization fervor in this area means that it will now be more costly everywhere in the EU to insure against currency volatility or unexpected changes in interest . 
But such harmonization is neither necessary nor justified in every EU country . 
We are also soon likely to have a unified , harmonized , and enforced-from-above system for euro payments , be they intrastate or interstate . 
The Commission reckons that it is rather suspicious that every country currently has its own system , and that these national systems are used by more customers and for more transactions than the harmonized Single Euro Payment Area ( SEPA ) system of payments . 
The irony here is that , at its beginning , participation by private banks in SEPA was strictly voluntary . 
But many of the national systems have been evolving for many years . 
Millions of customers have willingly relied on them for their debit and credit payments , and simply have not found reason to switch to the SEPA system , with its different codes , abbreviations , and symbols . 
This is the system that the Commission wants to prescribe for the whole Union , while banning all SEPA-incompatible products . 
Customers will have to change their payment orders and habits just because harmonization has become an end in itself for many in the EU . 
One simple rule should be applied as rigorously in this sensitive area as anywhere else : if it ain &apos;t broke , don &apos;t fix it . 
Dubious harmonization and unification is in the pipeline in another area as well : macroeconomic performance . 
Over the last decade , we have watched as the Stability and Growth Pact ( in which EU countries pledge to keep their public debts and deficits low ) has dissipated in a mist of permissiveness . 
Recently , it almost looked as if the EU had finally come to understand that , given a lack of will , no pact - however commendable its purpose - can ensure sound fiscal policies . 
But European institutions are now not only trying to repair the Pact , but are looking for ways to broaden its scope , making it possible to punish EU countries for &quot; macroeconomic imbalances . &quot; 
Just look at some of the proposals of EU President Herman Van Rompuy &apos;s task force on economic governance . 
For example , if a poorer member country undergoes a period of real convergence and has a temporary current-account deficit - as is usual in such cases - it may be punished for not being sufficiently &quot; harmonized . &quot; 
The same is true of a country that undergoes a period of strong productivity growth because it has reformed its labor market or kept real wages low and has a current-account surplus . 
Being too innovative , too competitive , too flexible , growing too much , and exporting too much might become &quot; a problem &quot; in this perverted logic of harmonization . 
So , Germans and others , are you listening carefully to these voices ? 
Aren &apos;t you afraid ? 
There are many areas of economic life in the EU where harmonization does help . 
We praise competition , not monopolies , in economic life . 
Competition in the rules that govern it might serve us better as well .
