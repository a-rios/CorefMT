Is Central Bank Independence All It &apos;s Cracked up to Be ? 
Alan Greenspan attained an almost iconic status as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board . 
So , as his term draws to a close and his mantle of infallibility is passed on to his successor , it is worth examining whether his legacy will measure up and what we can expect from the new Fed chief , Ben Bernanke . 
Few central bank governors have the kind of hagiography lavished upon them , especially in their lifetime , that Greenspan has had . 
But what makes for a great central bank governor in our modern societies , great institutions or great individuals ? 
In economics , we seldom have a clearly defined counterfactual : Would the economy have performed even better or a little differently if someone else had been at the helm ? 
We can &apos;t know , but there is little doubt that those &quot; managing &quot; the economy receive more credit than they deserve , if sometimes less blame . 
Many forces behind the boom of the 1990 &quot; s , including advances in technology , were set in motion before Bill Clinton took office ( just as the legacy of President George W. Bush &apos;s deficits will be felt long after he leaves ) . 
So Greenspan cannot be given credit for the boom . 
But , while no central bank governor can ensure economic prosperity , mismanagement can cause enormous harm . 
Many of America &apos;s post-World War II recessions were caused by the Fed hiking interest rates too fast and too far . 
There is little doubt that Greenspan had great moments , when one could at least imagine a less deft governor doing the &quot; wrong &quot; thing with disastrous consequences . 
One such moment was the stock market crash of 1987 . 
Perhaps another occurred in 1998 , when the Fed lowered interest rates in the face of what appeared to be an impending global financial crisis . 
These successes , combined with the 1990 &quot; s boom and the seeming durability of price stability , reinforced Greenspan &apos;s exalted status . 
But they also led many to forget less successful moments . 
The Fed failed to avert the economic downturn of 1990 , and a reading of Greenspan &apos;s testimony to Congress during that period makes clear that the basic nature of the economy &apos;s problems was not well understood . 
But the real problem for Greenspan &apos;s legacy concerns what happened to the American economy in the last five years , for which he bears heavy responsibility . 
Greenspan supported the tax cuts of 2001 with the most specious of arguments - that unless something was done about America &apos;s soaring fiscal surpluses , the national debt would be totally paid off within , say , ten to fifteen years . 
According to Greenspan , immediate action needed to be taken to avert this looming disaster , which would impede the Fed &apos;s ability to conduct monetary policy ! 
It says a great deal about the gullibility of financial markets that they took this argument seriously . 
More accurately , tax cuts were what Wall Street wanted , and financial professionals were willing to accept any argument that served that purpose . 
Of course , if , say , by 2008 the disappearing national debt really did appear to pose an imminent danger , Congress would have happily obliged in cutting taxes or increasing expenditures . 
Greenspan &apos;s irresponsible support of that tax cut was critical to its passage . 
The fault was not only in the magnitude of the tax cut , but also in its design ; by directing the cuts at upper-income Americans , it provided little economic stimulus . 
But soaring deficits did not return the economy to full employment , so the Fed did what it had to do - cut interest rates . 
Lower interest rates worked , but not so much because they boosted investment , but because they led households to refinance their mortgages , and fueled a bubble in housing prices . 
In short , as Greenspan departs , he leaves behind an American economy burdened with high household and government debt and fragile balance sheets - a legacy that is already contributing to global financial instability . 
It is still not clear what led Greenspan to support the tax cut . 
Was it a massive economic misjudgment , or was he currying favor with the Bush administration ? 
The most likely explanation is a combination of the two , for he and Bush were pursuing the same &quot; starve the beast &quot; political strategy , which calls for tax cuts to be used to reduce revenues , thereby forcing the public sector to be downsized . 
The traditional argument for an independent central bank is that politicians can &apos;t be trusted to conduct monetary and macroeconomic policy . 
Neither , evidently , can central bank governors , at least when they opine in areas outside their immediate responsibility . 
Greenspan was as enthusiastic for a policy that led to soaring deficits as any politician ; but the fig leaf of being &quot; above politics &quot; gave credence to that policy , engendering support from some who otherwise would have questioned its economic wisdom . 
This , then , is Greenspan &apos;s second legacy : growing doubt about central bank independence . 
Macroeconomic policy can never be devoid of politics : it involves fundamental trade-offs and affects different groups differently . 
Unemployment harms workers , while the lower interest rates needed to generate more jobs may lead to higher inflation , which especially harms those with nominal assets whose value is eroded . 
Such fundamental issues cannot be relegated to technocrats , particularly when those technocrats place the interests of one segment of society above others . 
Indeed , Greenspan &apos;s political stances were so thinly disguised as professional wisdom that his tenure exposed the dubiousness of the very notion of an independent central bank and a non-partisan central banker . 
Unfortunately , many countries have committed themselves to precisely this illusion , and it may be a long time before they take heed of Greenspan &apos;s most important lesson . 
Stressing the new Fed chief &apos;s &quot; professionalism &quot; may only delay the moment when this lesson is learned again .
