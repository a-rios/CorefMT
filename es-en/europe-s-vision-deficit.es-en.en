Europe &apos;s Vision Deficit 
PARIS - In the Western part of Europe - the part that former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld maliciously labeled &quot; Old Europe &quot; - almost every government is in deep political trouble . 
The United Kingdom &apos;s new coalition government may be the exception - for now . 
In the European Union &apos;s big member states , the popularity ratings of leaders - Nicolas Sarkozy in France , Silvio Berlusconi in Italy , Angela Merkel in Germany , and José Luís Rodriguez Zapatero in Spain - hover around 25 % or worse . 
Whether it is conservatives like Sarkozy , Christian Democrats like Merkel , right-wing populists like Berlusconi , or socialists like Zapatero , political affiliation appears to make no difference . 
If you hold office in Europe nowadays , you are in trouble . 
What has gone so wrong ? 
The economic crisis seems to be the most obvious explanation , but perhaps too obvious . 
Two years ago , when shockwaves from the collapse of the US housing bubble crashed onto European shores , these political leaders reacted with apparent vigor , making themselves rather popular for a while . 
Paradoxically , the early stages of the financial crisis appeared to favor conservative and pro-market leaders - who seemed to be in a better position to save the economy - more than socialists . 
Today , this is no longer the case . 
Socialism is on the rise again across Europe , at least in opinion polls . 
Economic stagnation has come to appear endless . 
Jobs are scarce , and the future looks bleak everywhere . 
The Greek crisis has cast a pall over the entire eurozone . 
The common currency is now looked at with suspicion . 
On the fringes of public opinion , some people are even muttering suggestions that their countries should revert to their ancient national currencies - which of course would only bring disaster in the form of an even more confusing state of affairs , as EU countries are indebted in euros . 
To quit the eurozone would only increase their level of indebtedness . 
What makes this desolate economic landscape even gloomier is the striking inability of European leaders to explain what has happened and is happening to their citizens . 
Indeed , I believe that it is here that the seminal reason for their plunging poll ratings lies . 
Europe &apos;s leaders seem to lead nowhere , because they have no vision on which to draw . 
Consider the euro : no head of state or government has so far been able to present a coherent defense of the eurozone to counter the pervasive unease that now exists towards the common currency . 
Or public spending : all European leaders adamantly want to reduce government spending . 
Why such a turnaround ? 
The European public has discovered that the 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus programs , which were aimed at forestalling an even greater crisis , generated more debts than jobs . 
Politicians , however , hate to confess past errors . 
Thus , they appear unable to explain their new rationale for the spending cuts that they are now announcing . 
Europe &apos;s leaders make things worse when they prove unable to connect isolated &quot; reforms &quot; - say , a lower public deficit - with any comprehensive vision of the economy . 
A good example is Sarkozy &apos;s effort to raise France &apos;s retirement age from 60 to 62 . 
Trade unions are up in arms , which , after all , is their duty . 
The population at large just does not understand what links raising the retirement age with the crisis . 
The truth that politicians ( David Cameron &apos;s UK government excluded , at least for now ) are reluctant to admit is that Western Europe &apos;s current morass is distinct from the global US-made downturn . 
Old Europe has entered into a severe and intractable crisis of the welfare state as ordinary Europeans have come to know it . 
The generous retirement pensions , unemployment compensation , health coverage , and all kinds of social programs that make Western Europe a comfortable place to live were established when Europe &apos;s economy and population were growing fast . 
Now , after one generation of economic and demographic stagnation , the welfare state can be financed only by issuing more public debt . 
Financial markets , awakened by the global crisis , will no longer support today &apos;s Potemkin-like situation , in which welfare benefits have become a façade propped up by deficits . 
Political leadership at such a moment demands a Churchillian accent . 
It needs to be explained why the euro remains the best protection there is against inflation , the most dangerous social ill of all ; why government stimulus will not work and never actually has delivered sustained growth ; and why a new equilibrium between welfare and economic dynamism - based on less public debt and more private investment - must be established . 
Such a discourse , if clearly articulated , would be understood and could be endorsed by many , if not by all . 
At the very least , it would bring a sense of coherence to the actions of politicians , and those opposed to this search for a new European equilibrium - mostly Marxists and populists - would need to compete with a new vision of their own . 
Would such an articulate vision make Europe &apos;s leaders more popular ? 
Maybe , and maybe not , but they would almost certainly appear more legitimate , even in the eye of their adversaries .
