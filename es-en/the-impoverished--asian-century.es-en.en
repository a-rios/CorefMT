The Impoverished &quot; Asian Century &quot; 
HONG KONG - By 2050 , Asia will have more than five billion people , while the European Union &apos;s share of the global population will decline from 9 % to 5 % . 
Annual economic growth in Asia over the past 30 years has averaged 5 % . 
The balance of power in the twenty-first century is shifting - in social , economic , and , arguably , political terms - from west to east . 
Western anxieties about a looming &quot; Asian century &quot; stem largely from the precedent of twentieth-century geopolitics , in which the West dominated less-developed nations . 
But this dynamic is outdated , and Asia would suffer as much as the West from any attempt to emulate the British and American empires of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
As Asian economic growth has increased , consumption in the region has also risen . 
Multinational companies and Western countries - both of which stand to benefit greatly from Asia &apos;s increasing consumption - have encouraged Asians to aspire to a Western standard of living , with its high energy usage , electronic toys , and meat-heavy diet . 
Asian governments seem willing partners in this one-dimensional approach to development , and are eager to lead global economic growth . 
Yet it is neither desirable nor possible for Asians to consume in the way that Westerners do , and Asian governments should face up to this reality . 
In previous centuries , Western economic growth was characterized by a comparatively insignificant minority having unfettered access to resources , and was thus built on fueling consumption . 
This was , after all , the idea behind colonialism , which succeeded economically by underpricing resources or even obtaining them for free . 
But the planet simply cannot support five billion Asians consuming like Westerners . 
The earth &apos;s regenerative capacity was exceeded more than 30 years ago , and we now use 30 % more resources than the planet can sustain . 
Although we know this to be the case , the vast majority of Western economists and institutions continue to encourage China and India to consume more . 
Asian governments must reject this trend , but , having been intellectually subservient for so long , it is not clear that they will . 
Western governments , for their part , must stop being intellectually dishonest . 
Indeed , they must openly acknowledge the impossibility of supporting demands for ever-higher material consumption in Asia without irreversibly changing our planet &apos;s climate and resource pool . 
Trade relations are far less important than establishing a dialogue between the West and Asia that addresses how to live within limits . 
For example , Western leaders concerned about climate change must understand that economic instruments like emissions trading are not a panacea . 
For Asia , resource management must be at the center of policymaking , which may include Draconian regulations , and even bans . 
Otherwise , resource shortages will push up commodity prices and create crises in food , water , fisheries , forests , land use , and housing , thereby leading to greater social injustice . 
The West must help Asia to challenge the idea that consumption-led growth is the only solution , or even a solution at all . 
And Asia must adopt three core principles to avert environmental and social crises . 
First , economic activity must be secondary to maintaining resources . 
Second , Asian governments must take action to re-price resources and focus on increasing their productivity . 
Third , Asian states must recast their central role as being to defend our collective welfare by protecting natural capital and the environment . 
All of this implies that Asian governments will need to play a far greater role than officials in Europe or America in managing both the macro-economy and personal consumption choices , which will require very sensitive political choices regarding individual rights , as well as policies that powerful business interests - many of them Western - will resist . 
Asian governments will sometimes need to set strict limits on resource use - and have the tools to ensure that society respects these limits . 
They should begin , for example , by stressing that car ownership is not a human right . 
The debate about rights must emphasize constraints , not the utopian definitions of Western politicians . 
These policy options fly in the face of Western liberal-democratic orthodoxy . 
But Western policymakers should not react negatively to these sorts of policy choices made by Asian governments , nor misconstrue them as anti-capitalist or anti-democratic . 
The West must realize that its consumption-led economic system has exhausted the world &apos;s resources , and that it is not a viable option for most Asian countries , whose governments must employ different political methods to create more equitable societies .
