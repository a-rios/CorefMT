The Myth of Chinese Meritocracy 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - Political scandals sometimes perform a valuable function in cleansing governments . 
They destroy the political careers of individuals of dubious character . 
More importantly , they can debunk political myths central to the legitimacy of some regimes . 
That appears to be the case with the Bo Xilai affair in China . 
One enduring political myth that went down with Bo , the former Communist Party boss of Chongqing municipality , is the notion that the Party &apos;s rule is based on meritocracy . 
In many ways , Bo personified the Chinese concept of &quot; meritocracy &quot; - well-educated , intelligent , sophisticated , and charming ( mainly to Western executives ) . 
Aside from his alleged involvement in assorted crimes , Bo was said to be a ruthless apparatchik , endowed with an outsize ego but no real talent . 
His record as a local administrator was mediocre . 
Bo &apos;s rise to power owed much to his pedigree ( his father was a vice premier ) , his political patrons , and his manipulation of the rules of the game . 
For example , visitors to Chongqing marvel at the soaring skyscrapers and modern infrastructure built during Bo &apos;s tenure there . 
Unfortunately , Bo &apos;s case is not the exception in China , but the rule . 
Contrary to the prevailing perception in the West ( especially among business leaders ) , the current Chinese government is riddled with clever apparatchiks like Bo who have acquired their positions through cheating , corruption , patronage , and manipulation . 
One of the most obvious signs of systemic cheating is that many Chinese officials use fake or dubiously acquired academic credentials to burnish their resumes . 
Because educational attainment is considered a measure of merit , officials scramble to obtain advanced degrees in order to gain an advantage in the competition for power . 
The overwhelming majority of these officials end up receiving doctorates ( a master &apos;s degree won &apos;t do anymore in this political arms race ) granted through part-time programs or in the Communist Party &apos;s training schools . 
Of the 250 members of provincial Communist Party standing committees , an elite group including party chiefs and governors , 60 claim to have earned PhDs . 
Tellingly , only ten of them completed their doctoral studies before becoming government officials . 
The rest received their doctorates ( mostly in economics , management , law , and industrial engineering ) through part-time programs while performing their duties as busy government officials . 
One managed to complete his degree in a mere 21 months , an improbable feat , given that course work alone , without the dissertation , normally requires at least two years in most countries &quot; doctoral programs . 
If so many senior Chinese officials openly flaunt fraudulent or dubious academic degrees without consequences , one can imagine how widespread other forms of corruption must be . 
Another common measure used to judge a Chinese official &apos;s &quot; merit &quot; is his ability to deliver economic growth . 
On the surface , this may appear to be an objective yardstick . 
In reality , GDP growth is as malleable as an official &apos;s academic credentials . 
Inflating local growth numbers is so endemic that reported provincial GDP growth data , when added up , are always higher than the national growth data , a mathematical impossibility . 
Because of their relatively short tenure in one position before promotion ( less than three years , on average , for local mayors ) , Chinese officials are under enormous pressure to demonstrate their ability to produce economic results quickly . 
One sure way of doing so is to use financial leverage , typically by selling land or using land as collateral to borrow large sums of money from often-obliging state-owned banks , to finance massive infrastructure projects , as Bo did in Chongqing . 
The result is promotion for such officials , because they have delivered quick GDP growth . 
Local governments are saddled with a mountain of debt and wasted investments , banks accumulate risky loans , and farmers lose their land . 
Worse , as competition for promotion within the Chinese bureaucracy has escalated , even fake academic credentials and GDP growth records have become insufficient to advance one &apos;s career . 
What increasingly determines an official &apos;s prospects for promotion is his guanxi , or connections . 
Based on surveys of local officials , patronage , not merit , has become the most critical factor in the appointment process . 
For those without guanxi , the only recourse is to purchase appointments and promotions through bribes . 
In the Chinese parlance , the practice is called maiguan , literally &quot; buying office . &quot; 
The official Chinese press is full of corruption scandals of this type . 
Given such systemic debasement of merit , few Chinese citizens believe that they are governed by the best and the brightest . 
The time has come to bury it .
