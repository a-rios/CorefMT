Escaping from the Deflation Trap 
Deflation will be the overriding topic when America &apos;s Federal Reserve Board meets on June 24th . 
Michael Woodford , one of the world &apos;s leading authorities on central banking , offers a strategy to break the grip of falling prices . 
Alan Greenspan &apos;s recent speech to a conference of bankers in Berlin - admitting the desirability of &quot; insurance &quot; against the risk of deflation in the US , even if it has not yet appeared - focused attention on a crucial issue . 
What can be done to stabilize an economy when nominal interest rates cannot be lowered any further , but prices still fall and the output gap - the difference between what it can produce and what it actually does produce - remains wide ? 
What was a theoretical curiosity raised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930 &apos;s has become the fundamental issue confronting policymakers in the world &apos;s largest economies . 
Japan poses the clearest example of this problem . 
Growth there remains anemic , and deflation lingers , suggesting a need for monetary stimulus . 
But the benchmark interest rate in Japan has been essentially zero for the past four years , so the standard form of monetary stimulus - reducing short _ term nominal interest rates - is unavailable . 
With the Fed &apos;s operating target now only 1.25 % and signs of recovery in the US fragile , many now fear that the US is poised to confront a similar situation . 
The recent cut in the ECB &apos;s policy rate amid warnings of possible deflation in Germany lead some to fear that the euro zone may be equally at risk . 
Some economists recommend fundamental changes in the way monetary policy is conducted to avoid ever reaching this &quot; zero bound &quot; on interest rates . 
Paul Krugman , for example , calls deflation a &quot; black hole &quot; : once you fall into it , monetary policy becomes ineffective because no amount of monetary expansion can further reduce interest rates . 
So policymakers must prevent deflationary expectations from ever taking root by targeting a sufficiently high inflation rate at all times . 
But what if it &apos;s too late , and the zero interest _ rate bound is reached while prices are falling ? 
Is there any point in having an inflation target that cannot be met ? 
Kunio Okina , director of the Bank of Japan &apos;s Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies , resists inflation targeting for this reason . 
He argues that &quot; because short _ term interest rates are already at zero , setting an inflation target of , say , 2 % wouldn &apos;t carry much credibility . &quot; 
Wrong . 
The &quot; zero bound &quot; on short _ term rates does represent an important constraint on what monetary stabilization can achieve , but it is a more modest barrier than deflation pessimists insist . 
Monetary policy is far from powerless to mitigate a contraction in economic activity when deflation strikes , or when an economy flirts dangerously with it . 
The key is to create the right kind of expectations regarding how monetary policy will be conducted in the longer term . 
If the Bank of Japan , for example , were to commit itself to a target path for a broad price index , and credibly commit to keeping interest rates low until that target is reached , this commitment would influence investor behavior . 
A commitment to a price-level target path above the current level would imply a commitment to keep nominal interest rates low for a time in the future , even after prices begin to rise again . 
A commitment to hold down nominal interest rates for a longer period of time should stimulate aggregate demand immediately . 
This is true even when current rates cannot be lowered any further - and even if inflation expectations remain unaffected - owing to the effects of the expected future path of short rates on current long-term interest rates and on the exchange rate . 
The fact that an official price _ level target is not hit immediately need not impugn such targets . 
The existence of an official target is crucial , even when it is not being reached , because it allows the private sector to judge how close the central bank is to a point at which it would feel justified in abandoning its zero _ interest _ rate policy . 
The current gap between the actual and target price levels should shape private _ sector expectations regarding how long interest rates are likely to remain low . 
But why should the private sector believe that the central bank is serious about hitting its price _ level target , if all that is observed in each period is a zero nominal interest rate and another target shortfall ? 
Ideally , the best way to make its policy credible would be for the central bank to demonstrate its commitment to the price _ level targeting framework before the zero bound is reached . 
In practice , and especially when deflationary fears are already present , managing private _ sector expectations demands considerable subtlety . 
The private sector is likely to scrutinize the bank &apos;s current actions for clues to its future behavior . 
So &quot; signaling &quot; effects , such as shifts in the central bank &apos;s portfolio towards long _ term securities , could help make the bank &apos;s price-level target credible . 
If , say , the central bank starts buying long _ term bonds from the private sector at below _ market interest rates , this should help convince the public that the bank intends to stick to a future low interest _ rate policy . 
Such asset shifts would work because the level of long _ term interest rates is an indicator of the markets &apos; faith in the central bank &apos;s commitment to maintaining low short _ term rates once inflation returns . 
So , if the private sector is skeptical about the bank &apos;s commitment , long _ term rates will be too high . 
But if the bank buys long-term bonds , it will tend to show that skepticism is unwarranted . 
The stabilizing effect of such asset purchases is due not to any mechanical consequence of the shift in portfolio balances , but to a change in private _ sector expectations regarding future interest _ rate policy . 
Any central bank facing deflation should commit itself in advance to a price-level target and pursue actions that convince the private sector that the commitment is genuine . 
Only that change in private expectations will make the bank &apos;s policy effective .
