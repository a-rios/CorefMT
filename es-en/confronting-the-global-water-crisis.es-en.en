Confronting the Global Water Crisis 
CAMBRIDGE - Around the world , demand for fresh water doubles every 20 years , owing to increasing population and affluence . 
Yet pollution , climate change , and seawater intrusion are diminishing supplies of fresh water at similar rates . 
So , is a global fresh water crisis looming ? 
Fortunately , the situation appears to be less alarming . 
This is not to deny that the supply of fresh water is getting tight . 
Left unattended , major disruptions for human society could occur . 
Many argue that water is different from resources such as oil , because there are often no substitutes for water in most uses ( particularly growing food ) . 
Moreover , water is an essentially fixed resource , albeit one that renews itself every year . 
There are prodigious quantities of water on the globe , but most of it is salty ocean water and brackish groundwater . 
There are huge resources of fresh water , but most is in ice sheets and glaciers , with only a small percentage readily available where and when we need it . 
The supply of water is also highly variable across regions and within countries , with floods and droughts occurring at irregular times . 
One new factor influencing water supplies is rising global temperature . 
Although we are not certain about the exact effects , many scientists believe that total annual precipitation will increase , but that its seasonality and the frequency of extremes may also increase . 
This would make it difficult to use the existing supply infrastructure of dams , reservoirs , treatment systems , and pipelines without big modifications . 
From the writings of the earliest modern commentators on the drivers of socio-economic growth and decline - Adam Smith , Edward Gibbon , Thomas Malthus , David Ricardo , and Karl Marx - we see that concern about exhausting resources is not new . 
Malthus and Ricardo were particularly prescient about the roles of population , food , and energy resources . 
Malthus postulated a geometric rate of population growth ( like compound interest on a bank deposit ) and an arithmetic rate of growth ( simple interest on a bank account ) of food production . 
These curves always intersect after a couple of decades , and Malthus predicted widespread famine or violent conflicts : food and population would be aligned with each other by &quot; misery , war , pestilence , and vice . &quot; 
Ricardo projected &quot; declining returns &quot; on investments in resources , whereby the best ( least-cost ) resources are used first , followed by the next best , and so on . 
Increasing demand for resources leads to price increases that will continue until the resource becomes too expensive to use . 
Of course , these constraints were at work over previous centuries , before Malthus and Ricardo articulated them , but homo sapiens was able to &quot; cheat &quot; by expanding our resource base ( colonialism ) to bring in cheaper resources and food ; by finding substitutes for scarce resources ; and by improving our technology so that the same amounts of land and resources could be used more efficiently . 
Because the world is now pretty much filled up , there are few opportunities to expand the physical supply of resources . 
The real question now facing the planet is whether we can continue improving our technologies or finding cheaper substitutes . 
Just because something worked over the past 200 years does not mean that it will necessarily continue to work . 
This is the crux of the problem facing global water resources . 
But we can avoid a crisis by embracing the following technical and managerial adaptations : 
- Trade virtual water - the amount of water that is embodied in producing a product ( usually food ) and shipping it somewhere else to be used . 
This saves the recipient from using his own water , which can be saved for higher-value activities ; 
- Conserve irrigation water . 
Because agriculture routinely accounts for 75-90 % of all water consumed in a country , a 10 % efficiency gain would save as much water as all the water used by the country &apos;s municipalities and industry . 
Another way of improving irrigation efficiency is by developing crops that produce more food with the same , or less , water . 
Research on such genetically modified ( GM ) foods is well advanced in several of the largest water-scarce countries , such as China and India ; 
- Exploit advanced desalination . 
Modern developments in desalination have brought the cost per unit of desalinated seawater to levels comparable to obtaining fresh water from natural sources ( approximately US $ 0.05 per cubic meter ) . 
- Expand wastewater recycling . 
Urban areas typically dispose of about 85 % of their fresh-water intake as wastewater , often in neighboring water bodies . 
The wastes could be treated and used to replenish groundwater . 
Emerging low-water-using sanitation technologies such as urine-separating dry-composting toilets could also significantly reduce urban water demands if properly developed ; 
- Develop creative pricing policies for urban water and wastewater . 
Protecting human and ecosystem health are difficult to price , because they form part of the pervasive externalities associated with water use . 
Nevertheless , many water uses would respond well to more efficient prices . 
Although avoiding a global water crisis will not be easy , we have at hand policies and technologies that , if properly applied , could see us safely through the next several decades , even in the face of increasing - and increasingly wealthy - populations .
