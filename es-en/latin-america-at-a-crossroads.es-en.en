Latin America at a Crossroads Last year witnessed a decisive turn in Latin America . 
A growing number of countries in the region now seem determined to pursue their interests regardless of what the United States desires . 
José Miguel Insulza &apos;s election as Secretary General of the Organization of American States , and the consequent defeat of the candidate supported by the Bush administration , emphatically demonstrated the decline of America &apos;s continental leadership . 
The US not only lost control of the OAS , an organization that generally serves US interests , but also failed to get last month &apos;s Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata Argentina to endorse unanimously a declaration supporting America &apos;s trade and political positions for the region . 
This rejection came about despite the summit be structured in such a way as to promote and defend those interests . 
Attempts throughout 2005 by the Bush administration to discipline Venezuela &apos;s government also failed . 
America has also been frustrated in its desire to obtain regional support for its policy of direct involvement in the Colombia &apos;s internal strife . 
Of course , not everything went against America . 
This means that the bank is likely continue its orthodox , neo-liberal policies . 
Some countries - Mexico , Colombia , and Peru - appear to want a privileged direct relationship with America . 
Other countries - Bolivia , Chile , the countries of Central America - prefer regional solutions in which they have a clear and equal say . 
The latter group , for example , are generally supportive of the plan to build a Community of South American Nations , a scheme backed primarily by Argentina and Venezuela . 
But it is the ideological picture that presents the starkest contrasts . 
Indeed , there could be political consequences that could affect the entire region if the confrontation between Venezuela and the US worsens beyond today &apos;s tense relations , or if there were an electoral victory for the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional in Nicaragua , or for Evo Morales &apos;s Movimiento al Socialismo in Bolivia . 
The eventual formation of a triangle that links Cuba , Venezuela , and Nicaragua is likely to be considered a direct threat to regional stability by the United States , which would have dangerous consequence of putting Latin America atop the security agenda of the Bush administration . 
Yet you cannot see Latin America in 2005 only in terms of the region &apos;s relations with the US . 
Deep concerns about the internal situation many countries who suffer almost permanent political and institutional crises , such as Haiti , Ecuador and Bolivia , abound . 
As the structural causes that have pushed these countries into near permanent states of crisis seem unlikely to be resolved anytime soon , there problems may well become linked to Latin America &apos;s tense relations with the US . 
Indeed , local problems are likely to exacerbate regional tensioins . 
2005 saw the return of seemingly buried territorial disputes , such as defining the maritime limits between Chile and Peru , as well as the revanchist pressures that are mounting in Bolivia for recovering access to the sea that was lost in the 19th century , an urge strengthened by Bolivia &apos;s growing willingness to perhaps use its gas exports as a pressure point . 
The dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua over navigation on the San Juan River , and the heated jurisdictional arguemnts between Colombia and Venezuela also help raise regional tempers . 
The result of all this tension is that Latin America is seeing its biggest arms race for decades , a sad trend when the region &apos;s worst problems are poverty , inequality , and the marginalization of indigenous people . 
If these problems go unattended , destabilization will undoubtedly grow . 
One last problem is contributing to the region &apos;s anxieties : massive migration . 
The problem is not just about illegal migration to the US , though those Americans who seek to play the anti-immigrant card do antagonize regional sensibilities unnecessarily . 
For migration - triggered by dire economic conditions - is also happening between Latin American countries . 
Latin America is truly at a crossroads : 2006 may well determine whether the continent lapses back into the sad days of chaotic past , who finds a new maturity to strike out on its own path to growth and stability .
