The Agony and Ecstasy of Synthetic Drugs 
NEW YORK - The world is speeding up . 
Communications , travel , and productivity are increasing . 
For some people , synthetic drugs have become a way to deal with today &apos;s fast and competitive times . 
Around the world , in order to enhance performance , people are popping pills and powder known as amphetamine-type stimulants ( ATS ) . 
From ravers in all-night discos to assembly-line workers or long-haul truckers , more than 30 million people use amphetamine , methamphetamine ( meth ) , or ecstasy at least once a year - more than the combined number of those who take cocaine and heroin . 
The global market for these stimulants is estimated at $ 65 billion . 
Part of the attraction of these synthetic drugs is that they are readily available , affordable , and convenient to use ( no need to shoot up , snort , or smoke ) . 
Amphetamines speed up the way the body works : users experience increased confidence , sociability , and energy . 
This buzz is considered harmless : &quot; pills do not kill or spread HIV / AIDS , &quot; it is said . 
But what goes up must come down . 
People who become dependent on &quot; uppers &quot; may suffer paranoia , kidney failure , and internal bleeding , and even serious mental health problems , brain damage , or heart attack . 
Meth users often develop rotten teeth and horrible scabs caused by scratching themselves due to a sensation of insects crawling under their skin . 
The message about the dangers of ATS seems to be getting through to young people in the developed world , thanks in part to graphic public awareness campaigns . 
After substantial increases in the 1990 &quot; s - when meth was considered public enemy number one in the United States and Japan - the use of synthetic drugs has stabilized in North America , Europe , Australia , and New Zealand , albeit at high levels . 
In Australia , for example , 2.3 % of the population use meth , and 3.5 % use ecstasy at least once a year - one of the highest rates in the world . 
Evidence suggests that the problem is shifting to new markets in East and Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East . 
Asia , with its huge population and increasing affluence , is driving demand . 
In 2006 , almost half of Asian countries reported an increase in meth use . 
This year , more than half of China &apos;s provinces had serious ATS-related problems . 
The upsurge is not limited to Asia . 
Something strange is going on in Saudi Arabia . 
Last year , the Kingdom seized almost 14 tons of amphetamine , mostly in the form known as Captagon ( probably manufactured in Southeast Europe ) . 
That &apos;s one-quarter of all amphetamines seized in the world . 
Seven years ago , Saudi Arabia accounted for only 1 % of all such seizures . 
In South Africa , the number of seized meth laboratories has consistently gone up for the past five years , while domestic consumption has increased . 
Part of the shift may be due to changes in demand . 
For societies in transition or going through rapid modernization , synthetic drugs seem to be a by-product of hyperactive growth . 
The shift is also due to a strong supply push from increasingly aggressive criminal groups with tentacles around the world . 
A decade ago , synthetic drugs were a do-it-yourself cottage industry . 
The ingredients for meth , for example , are readily available , recipes are easy to obtain , and batches of the drug can be cooked up in a kitchen . 
But in the past few years , the production of ATS has become a big global business . 
Organized crime is taking over all aspects of this illicit trade , from smuggling precursor chemicals to manufacturing and trafficking the drugs . 
With little initial investment , industrial-scale factories can make huge profits by manufacturing millions of tablets . 
Increasingly sophisticated labs are being discovered in , for example , Indonesia and Malaysia . 
In 2007 alone , 75 ATS laboratories were seized in China . 
No doubt there are many other such labs in parts of the world where law enforcement is weak or corrupt , or local officials are complicit . 
Myanmar is a notorious example . 
Producers and suppliers adapt quickly to the latest trends , and cater to local markets . 
When one lab is shut , another opens . 
When one type of precursor chemical is unavailable , producers switch to an alternative . 
North America still accounts for 84 % of all reported ATS laboratories in the world , and Western Europe has traditionally been a production center for synthetic drugs ( particularly in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands ) . 
In the past few years , however , decreasing lab seizures in the US and the European Union have been offset by a rise in production in neighboring countries , like Canada and Mexico in North America , and Turkey in Southeast Europe . 
Greater regional cooperation is needed to prevent such displacement . 
Before it is too late , countries in the developing world need to get their heads out of the sand . 
Many are in denial about the problem , and do not even report their situation to the United Nations . 
The most vulnerable are ill-equipped to fight the pandemic through information gathering , regulatory frameworks , law enforcement , forensics , or health care . 
In general , more information is needed on new types of synthetic drugs ( like the hallucinogen ketamine ) , developments in production techniques , emerging trafficking routes , and new markets . 
Stabilization of the problem in the developed world shows that containment is possible . 
But unless more attention and resources are devoted to prevention , treatment , and law enforcement in youthful and increasingly affluent societies in the developing world , these countries may soon be facing a similar epidemic of drug abuse .
