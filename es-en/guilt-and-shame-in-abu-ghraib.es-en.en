Guilt and Shame in Abu Ghraib 
Whenever governments lose moral authority , as when their police seize evidence in violation of the Constitution , their case for conviction suffers . 
As the late US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said , government must remain the &quot; omnipresent teacher &quot; of our highest ideals . 
In the Abu Ghraib scandal , the army and the Bush administration have hardly been good teachers , and the public and the media have also been complicit . 
How , then , can the collectively guilty bring charges and single out some suspects as individually guilty ? 
To be sure , the extent of collective liability for torture and other indecencies invites debate . 
Should the public &apos;s appropriate reaction be guilt or shame ? 
Many have read and seen enough to feel acute shame about being part of a nation that could go to war with righteous ideas and end up replicating , if not aggravating , the abuses of the &quot; rogue state &quot; Americans called their enemy . 
Guilt is based , they say , on what we do ; shame , on who we are . 
Neither the vast majority of US soldiers nor Americans as individuals have done anything wrong in Iraq ( apart from the invasion itself ) , and thus might balk at allegations of collective guilt for the atrocities . 
Yet in other cases of collective action , we willingly affirm collective guilt and a shared duty to make reparations . 
This was the widely accepted approach toward German liability for the Holocaust , and there are many who urge the same approach toward America &apos;s responsibility for slavery . 
Yet shame might be more plausible with regard to US behavior in Iraq . 
The source of that shame is not any particular act , but simply being part of a nation that could behave so arrogantly as to disregard international law and the United Nations by invading a country that was not threatening America , and then sending untrained military police to keep prisoners in line by any means they happen to devise . 
One way to think about guilt versus shame is to begin with the response that fits our sentiment of responsibility . 
Guilt represents a debt . 
The proper response to such a debt is to suffer punishment or to pay reparations to the victims . 
Shame invites a retreat from the public eye . 
If you are ashamed , you do not expose yourself to punishment , nor do you extend your hand in a gesture of repair . 
When you are ashamed , you cannot bear the critical gaze of others : you hold your head low . 
Though US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld proposed compensation to the victims of abuse at American military hands , it is hard to see this offer as expressing either guilt or shame . 
The offer seems more like an effort to buy silence . 
If compensation were coupled with a finding of high-level American wrongdoing , we would get closer to an act of atonement . 
In the last few weeks , attention has focused on whether Rumsfeld himself should resign or be fired . 
It is not clear what this would accomplish in light of the Secretary &apos;s declaration that he would resign not as an expression of guilt but only if he can no longer be &quot; effective . &quot; 
Under these circumstances , one can see why people yearn for international criminal prosecutions of responsible politicians . 
For good or for ill , the political power of the US makes it immune to prosecution . 
Even if the UN Security Council could establish an ad hoc tribunal to try the abuses of American officials in Iraq , this would still address only the guilt of individuals , not the problem of each American &apos;s own responsibility for having participated , directly and indirectly , in a culture that generated the torture of prisoners . 
Another reason why guilt does not capture our situation is that the collective debt must be owed to some coherent collective entity , such as the Jewish people in the Holocaust . 
But Iraq has already degenerated into so many rival factions that apart from the abused prisoners , there is no identifiable entity America has wronged and to whom it is indebted . 
Peculiarly , President Bush first apologized for the atrocities in the presence of King Abdullah of Jordan , as though the crime had been committed against Jordanian Arabs . 
The King of Jordan would not have been in a position to forgive even a truly contrite Bush , and therefore he was not the proper audience for the confession . 
If guilt is problematic in this context , we are left to struggle with collective shame . 
The problem is how to respond . 
Americans have few choices but to discover a form of modesty appropriate to the country &apos;s reduced status in the eyes of the world . 
One immediate consequence would be to abandon the US attempt to prosecute Saddam Hussein on its own and to invoke an international tribunal . 
The longer-range consequence of this new modesty should be for Americans to become enthusiastic supporters not only of the UN but of the International Criminal Court . 
American shame would be salutary if it led Americans to realize that they live in an interdependent world where nations cannot undertake unilateral military adventures without suffering unexpected disasters . 
Bush and the American people sought glory in Iraq . 
What Americans have secured is merely a lasting stain on their reputation as decent and law-abiding people .
