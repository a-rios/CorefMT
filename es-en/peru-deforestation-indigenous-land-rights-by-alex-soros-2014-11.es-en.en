The Killing Forests 
NEW YORK - Edwin Chota was killed in the forest he had fought to protect . 
The Peruvian environmental activist had appealed to his government for help after receiving death threats from the illegal loggers that plagued the area around his village , deep in the Amazon rainforest . 
And yet , in September , he and three other prominent members of the Peruvian Ashéninka community were ambushed and shot on a jungle trail as they traveled to meet with fellow activists from neighboring Brazil . 
Chota &apos;s widow journeyed six days by river to the regional capital to report their deaths . 
Chota &apos;s death is a reminder of the price that local activists in some of the world &apos;s most remote areas are paying as they fight to defend their communities from exploitation and industrialization . 
Global demand for natural resources is growing , and indigenous people are receiving little protection from those who would destroy their land , forests , and rivers . 
Instead , they are being murdered with impunity at an alarming rate , sometimes with the complicity of government authorities . 
Peru is a prime example . 
According to a recently released report by the activist group Global Witness , Peru ranks fourth in the world for murders of environmental activists ( after Brazil , Honduras , and the Philippines ) , with 58 activists in the country killed from 2002 to 2013 . 
More than half of the country is still covered by rainforest , but those forests are being cut down at an accelerating rate to satisfy voracious international demand for timber and related products . 
Though the World Bank estimates that 80 % of the timber trade in Peru is illegal , the authorities have enacted legislation that makes it easier for investors to undertake agricultural , mining , or logging projects . 
Calls for the government to recognize indigenous peoples &quot; demand for legal title to their ancestral lands have gone unheeded . 
Sadly , this phenomenon is not confined to Peru . 
According to Global Witness , from 2002 to 2013 , more than 900 people in 35 countries died defending the environment or fighting for the right to their land . 
The death toll has risen sharply in recent years . 
Worldwide , activists are murdered at an average rate of two per week . 
Given that such deaths tend to go unreported , the real number could be even higher . 
In only ten cases have the perpetrators been brought to justice . 
The deaths of environmental activists like Chota are not the result of obscure disputes in wild , faraway places . 
Wood from a single tropical cedar tree can sell for $ 9,000 in the United States . 
These are amounts that some in rural , impoverished regions might kill for . 
Peru has pledged to protect its forests , which cover some 60 % of the country and are among the largest and best preserved in the world . 
Land-use and forest-related activities account for about half of the country &apos;s greenhouse-gas emissions , and earlier this year , just weeks after Chota &apos;s murder , Peru &apos;s government entered into an agreement with Norway , with the Norwegian authorities agreeing to pay up to $ 300 million over the next six years if Peru curbs deforestation . 
But lax laws , poor enforcement , endemic corruption , and weak land rights for Peru &apos;s 300,000 indigenous people threaten to thwart good intentions . 
Securing indigenous rights to land is one of the most effective ways to curb deforestation , but the Peruvian government is sitting on unprocessed claims to 20-million hectares . 
These communities need better support and protection , so that they can continue to keep their forests intact . 
Next month , Peru is hosting a major United Nations climate-change conference , and efforts to protect the world &apos;s forests are expected to take center stage - even as those who are physically standing in the way of deforestation are being killed . 
The government should recognize environmental defenders &quot; heightened vulnerability and uphold their rights to the land they are protecting . 
That means scaling up efforts to combat illegal logging and pervasive corruption , improving forest governance ( as the US-Peru free-trade agreement stipulates ) , and revoking recent laws that have weakened environmental protection . 
The alternative is clear : more death on Peru &apos;s environmental frontiers . 
Edwin Chota and the three other murdered Ashéninka activists were awarded the 2014 Alexander Soros Foundation prize posthumously .
