A Statue for Stalin ? 
PRINCETON - Hitler and Stalin were ruthless dictators who committed murder on a vast scale . 
The difference in attitude extends beyond the borders of the countries over which these men ruled . 
In the United States , there is a bust of Stalin at the National D-Day Memorial in Virginia . 
In New York , I recently dined at a Russian restaurant that featured Soviet paraphernalia , waitresses in Soviet uniforms , and a painting of Soviet leaders in which Stalin was prominent . 
New York also has its KGB Bar . 
To the best of my knowledge , there is no Nazi-themed restaurant in New York ; nor is there a Gestapo or SS bar . 
So , why is Stalin seen as relatively more acceptable than Hitler ? 
At a press conference last month , Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted a justification . 
Asked about Moscow &apos;s plans for a statue of Stalin , he pointed to Oliver Cromwell , the leader of the Parliamentarian side in the seventeenth-century English Civil War , and asked : &quot; What &apos;s the real difference between Cromwell and Stalin ? &quot; 
He then answered his own question : &quot; None whatsoever , &quot; and went on to describe Cromwell as a &quot; cunning fellow &quot; who &quot; played a very ambiguous role in Britain &apos;s history . &quot; 
( A statue of Cromwell stands outside the House of Commons in London . ) 
&quot; Ambiguous &quot; is a reasonable description of the morality of Cromwell &apos;s actions . 
While he promoted parliamentary rule in England , ended the civil war , and allowed a degree of religious toleration , he also supported the trial and execution of Charles I and brutally conquered Ireland in response to a perceived threat from an alliance of Irish Catholics and English Royalists . 
But , unlike Cromwell , Stalin was responsible for the deaths of very large numbers of civilians , outside any war or military campaign . 
According to Timothy Snyder , author of Bloodlands , 2-3 million people died in the forced labor camps of the Gulag and perhaps a million were shot during the Great Terror of the late 1930 &quot; s . 
Another five million starved in the famine of 1930-1933 , of whom 3.3 million were Ukrainians who died as a result of a deliberate policy related to their nationality or status as relatively prosperous peasants known as kulaks . 
Snyder &apos;s estimate of the total number of Stalin &apos;s victims does not take into account those who managed to survive forced labor or internal exile in harsh conditions . 
Including them might add as many as 25 million to the number of those who suffered terribly as a result of Stalin &apos;s tyranny . 
The total number of deaths that Snyder attributes to Stalin is lower than the commonly cited figure of 20 million , which was estimated before historians had access to the Soviet archives . 
It is nonetheless a horrendous total - similar in magnitude to the Nazis &quot; killings ( which took place during a shorter period ) . 
Moreover , the Soviet archives show that one cannot say that the Nazi &apos;s killings were worse because victims were targeted on the basis of their race or ethnicity . 
Stalin , too , selected some of his victims on this basis - not only Ukrainians , but also people belonging to ethnic minorities associated with countries bordering the Soviet Union . 
Stalin &apos;s persecutions also targeted a disproportionately large number of Jews . 
There were no gas chambers , and arguably the motivation for Stalin &apos;s killings was not genocide , but rather the intimidation and suppression of real or imaginary opposition to his rule . 
If there is any &quot; ambiguity &quot; about Stalin &apos;s moral record , it may be because communism strikes a chord with some of our nobler impulses , seeking equality for all and an end to poverty . 
No such universal aspiration can be found in Nazism , which , even on its face , was not concerned about what was good for all , but about what was good for one supposed racial group , and which was clearly motivated by hatred and contempt for other ethnic groups . 
But communism under Stalin was the opposite of egalitarian , for it gave absolute power to a few , and denied all rights to the many . 
Those who defend Stalin &apos;s reputation credit him with lifting millions out of poverty ; but millions could have been lifted out of poverty without murdering and incarcerating millions more . 
Others defend Stalin &apos;s greatness on the basis of his role in repelling the Nazi invasion and ultimately defeating Hitler . 
Yet Stalin &apos;s purge of military leaders during the Great Terror critically weakened the Red Army , his signing of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in 1939 paved the way for the start of World War II , and his blindness to the Nazi threat in 1941 left the Soviet Union unprepared to resist Hitler &apos;s attack . 
It remains true that Stalin led his country to victory in war , and to a position of global power that it had not held before and from which it has since fallen . 
Hitler , by contrast , left his country shattered , occupied , and divided . 
People identify with their country and look up to those who led it when it was at its most powerful . 
That may explain why Muscovites are more willing to accept a statue of Stalin than Berliners would be to have one of Hitler . 
But that can be only part of the reason for the different treatment given to these mass murderers . 
It still leaves me puzzled about New York &apos;s Soviet-themed restaurant and KGB Bar .
