Less of an Ass 
PARIS - &quot; If the law supposes that , &quot; says Mr. Bumble in Oliver Twist , &quot; the law is a ass - a idiot . &quot; 
For decades , Britain &apos;s libel laws had been living down to Mr. Bumble &apos;s expectations . 
But freedom of expression worldwide received a boost - and Britain &apos;s reputation for commonsense was somewhat restored - in April , when Parliament adopted legislation revising the country &apos;s libel law . 
Previously , corporations and individuals all over the world who claimed that they had been defamed - even if those suing or those who allegedly defamed them had little or no connection to the United Kingdom - would bring lawsuits for libel in the British courts . 
The practice was widely known as &quot; libel tourism . &quot; 
Many plaintiffs who brought such lawsuits - Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs , Arab princes , African dictators , and unscrupulous bosses - had little chance to prevail . 
But the point was not to win . 
Often , their targets had much fewer resources , which meant that a libel suit requiring both sides to spend substantial amounts could be effective in silencing critics even if it did not succeed . 
Within the United Kingdom itself , the law meant that many important issues could not be fully debated . 
The passage of libel reform is attributable to a campaign launched more than three years ago by three organizations : English PEN , a writers association ; 
Index on Censorship , a bimonthly journal that has monitored censorship worldwide and published the works of censored writers for the past four decades ; and Sense About Science , an organization that promotes scientific knowledge and understanding . 
The targeting of scientific journals and scientists for exposing charlatans was a leading factor in generating public support for reform of the UK &apos;s libel law . 
The cases involving science included a costly lawsuit against Nature , one of the world &apos;s best-known and most widely respected scientific journals . 
Nature had to contend with a libel suit for pointing out that a physics journal had published many articles by its editor , and that these articles had not been subjected to peer review . 
Though Nature defended itself successfully , the suit cost it a lot of money and tied up many of its staff members for long periods . 
Other libel suits involved unproven cancer therapies . 
The science case that probably played the most significant role in the campaign was a suit filed by the British Chiropractic Association against science writer Simon Singh for an article he published in The Guardian in 2008 , in which he discussed &quot; bogus treatments . &quot; 
Singh won his case , but it cost him dearly in time and legal expenses . 
One of the cases that illustrated the kind of &quot; tourism &quot; encouraged by the law involved a suit by a Saudi businessman against an American author who said in her book that the businessman had provided financial support to Al Qaeda . 
Apparently , 23 copies of the book were sold in the United Kingdom . 
Though the American author did not hire British counsel and did not try to defend herself in the UK , she was ordered to pay damages , arousing outrage in the United States . 
The US Congress adopted legislation , signed by President Barack Obama , making such judgments unenforceable in American courts . 
The revised British law continues to place the burden of proof on the defense . 
But the standard that must be met has been changed . 
The new law permits an author or publisher who is sued to invoke a &quot; public interest &quot; defense . 
Moreover , corporations , charities , and other institutions filing libel suits will now have to show that they suffered financial damage . 
Singh argues that this requirement by itself would have prevented the suit against him by the British Chiropractic Association from going forward . 
And libel tourism will be drastically reduced by a new rule that excludes suits from outside the European Union if it cannot be shown that the UK is the most appropriate place to bring the case . 
British law firms that have apparently made a lot of money representing libel plaintiffs from around the world impeded adoption of the new law through intense lobbying . 
The scientists , writers , and anti-censorship activists who led the campaign were assisted in Parliament by Lord Lester , a well-known British civil liberties lawyer , who introduced a Private Members &quot; Bill in 2010 , and eventually by endorsement of reform by all three major political parties . 
Nearly 400 years ago , in 1644 , John Milton published his Areopagitica , an essay denouncing a measure in Parliament for licensing the press that was intended , among other things , to suppress libelous publications . 
That essay is widely regarded as the start of the worldwide movement for freedom of speech and the press . 
Last month &apos;s victory by scientists , writers , and anti-censorship campaigners suggests that the movement launched by Milton still has life in his own country .
