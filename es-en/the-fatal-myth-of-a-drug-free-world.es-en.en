The Fatal Myth of a Drug-Free World 
VIENNA - Negotiations at the United Nations High Level Summit on drugs in Vienna last week fell flat . 
Although 25 countries officially stated their support for proven methods such as needle exchange and overdose prevention , the summit &apos;s outcome was a watered-down political declaration that fails to acknowledge crucial lessons that have been learned over the last decade . 
The refusal to include the words &quot; harm reduction &quot; seems motivated by ideology rather than science , despite clear evidence showing that needle exchange and substitution treatment keep drug users alive and free of deadly infections . 
Those advocating for harm reduction accept that drugs have always been a part of human history and aim to decrease the damage caused by their production and use . 
A vocal few disagree with this approach , labeling it , in the Vatican &apos;s words , &quot; anti-life . &quot; 
Those who strive for the futile goal of a &quot; drug-free world &quot; refuse to recognize the proven benefits of harm reduction . 
But the evidence against the &quot; war on drugs &quot; is overwhelming : prisons swelling with non-violent drug offenders , billions of dollars spent on military action to curb production while the availability of illicit drugs increases and prices drop , and increasing HIV rates throughout the former Soviet Union and parts of Asia . 
Elsewhere , the stories of futility in the &quot; war on drugs are more brutal : capital punishment for drug-related offenses ; extra-judicial killings in the name of creating drug-free societies ; drug users sent to labor camps as a form of &quot; treatment &quot; ; and drug-using women handcuffed to beds during childbirth . 
The list goes on . 
But there is reason for hope . 
Since assuming office , President Barack Obama has made clear his desire to lift the federal ban on needle exchange in the United States . 
Indeed , while the previous Bush administration led the global opposition to harm reduction , the US delegation struck a more conciliatory tone at the Vienna summit , indicating what some perceive as a fresh start to drug policy . 
Ten years ago , when a &quot; drug-free world &quot; became the global drug-policy mantra , no one imagined that in 2009 two million people in the former Soviet Union , and over a million in Asia , would be infected with HIV through intravenous drug use . 
Also missing from Vienna was a discussion about increased numbers of destabilized countries becoming narco-states . 
There is , moreover , still an important region where drug use has not contributed significantly to HIV infection rates : Africa . 
Sadly , when we meet again in ten years , this will no longer hold true . 
Even though no African countries voiced their support in Vienna for harm reduction , African leaders should take heed of those countries with pragmatic and humane drug policies . 
Instead of signaling a new way forward for international drug policy , the Vienna declaration represents the same , failed politics of the past . 
Unless that changes quickly , the result will be continued suffering and death for millions of people around the world .
