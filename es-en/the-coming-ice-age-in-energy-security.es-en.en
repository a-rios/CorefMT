The Coming Ice Age in Energy Security 
Worldwide dependence on fossil fuels costs far more than the price of a barrel of crude oil . 
The current Middle East crisis , the gradual transformation of Central Asia into a military outpost of the West , and weak regimes in other key producers , such as Russia and Venezuela , are sobering reminders of the fragility of global energy security . 
With the world economy remaining dependent on fossil fuels well into this century , energy vulnerability will only increase in the foreseeable future . 
Conservation can moderate , but not reverse , rising consumption in the industrialized countries and the developing world . 
Renewable energy sources are promising , but they will not soon replace fossil fuels . 
Yet there is hope for an abundant , clean energy source that would boost global security by placing production closer to consumers . 
Surprisingly , the energy source is a kind of ice . 
When natural gas seeps up from within the earth and combines with water at and below the seafloor under certain conditions of low temperature and high pressure , the result is gas hydrate-a substance that most people have never heard of , but that is common geologically . 
Once the gas is liberated from the frozen water , it can be collected in wells and put into pipelines , just like ordinary natural gas . 
Gas extracted from hydrate reserves is exactly the same as the natural gas in use currently . 
Natural gas is increasingly today &apos;s fossil fuel of choice , currently accounting for more than 20 % of the world &apos;s primary energy consumption . 
This is mainly because it burns cleaner than coal or oil . 
The only byproducts of gas combustion are carbon dioxide , water , and small amounts of nitrogen oxides . 
While carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas , natural gas produces less of it than other fossil fuels . 
With our current technology , the amount of recoverable natural gas worldwide-called &quot; conventional gas &quot; in industry parlance-represents about a 60-year supply at today &apos;s prices and rate of consumption . 
Running out of gas may seem like a distant prospect , but the risk of a security breakdown that jeopardizes supplies haunts us always . 
Only 6 % of conventional reserves are in North America-roughly a ten-year supply for that continent . 
Europe imports much of its gas from Russia , and Japan &apos;s resources are minuscule ; it imports liquefied natural gas from Indonesia and the Middle East . 
India is also energy-poor relative to its population and economy . 
Although these reserve estimates are based today &apos;s known deposits , we should not pin our hopes on vast undiscovered supplies . 
There is a well-established method for estimating reserves yet to be found , and whether one examines currently proven reserves or future projections , one fact stands out : conventional gas supplies are distributed unevenly around the world-and in places far from most consumers . 
Russia accounts for one-third of total reserves ; the Persian Gulf states control a similar amount . 
Conventional gas production will increasingly be concentrated in these two regions over the coming decades . 
Gas hydrate , however , is abundant in offshore areas near many major consuming nations-indeed , generally within their exclusive economic zones . 
The US is estimated to have a thousand-year supply at its present rate of gas consumption . 
Japan is also well endowed , with a large potential resource just 50 kilometers south of Hamamatsu . 
There are indications of significant gas hydrate deposits near India &apos;s eastern coast , between Madras and Calcutta . 
Unfortunately , major hurdles must be overcome . 
To liberate the gas , the frozen water has to be melted . 
This can be done in one of three ways : increase the temperature , lower the pressure , or introduce chemicals ( like antifreeze for a car ) . 
But the optimal method is not yet known . 
More importantly , in some places , hydrate fields are vast but dilute , and extraction would be similar to mining a very low-grade ore-not worth the trouble and expense . 
For example , one hydrate-bearing geological formation , Blake Ridge , lies 300 kilometers from Charleston , South Carolina , in the US . 
Blake Ridge alone contains six times more natural gas than all American conventional reserves combined . 
But this huge resource is spread out over 26,000 square kilometers and lies under 1,000 meters of water . 
The investment required to tap it would be enormous and could never be recovered . 
But not all gas hydrate reserves are alike . 
A more promising one lies beneath the permafrost of Prudhoe Bay , the big oil-producing region on the arctic coast of Alaska . 
This deposit is smaller than Blake Ridge , but it is more concentrated and closer to the surface . 
While operations in the arctic are always challenging , existing infrastructure makes the Prudhoe Bay prospect a reasonably accessible one . 
A reliable assessment of global hydrate reserves and extraction costs would be a very wise investment . 
Even if gas hydrate will never be economically competitive with conventional gas , it may have value as a strategic energy reserve . 
Many countries subsidize domestic food production to guarantee emergency supplies . 
A domestic hydrate-production capability would serve a similar purpose , while perhaps promising a new era of global energy security .
