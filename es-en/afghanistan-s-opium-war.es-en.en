Afghanistan &apos;s Opium War 
When NATO leaders meet for their summit in Riga at the end of this month , there will be a ghost at the feast : Afghanistan &apos;s opium . 
Afghanistan is in danger of falling back into the hands of terrorists , insurgents , and criminals , and the multi-billion-dollar opium trade is at the heart of the country &apos;s malaise . 
Indeed , NATO &apos;s top general , James Jones , has called drugs the &quot; Achilles heel &quot; of Afghanistan . 
This year &apos;s record harvest of 6,100 tons of opium will generate more than $ 3 billion in illicit revenue - equivalent to almost half of Afghanistan &apos;s GDP . 
Profits for drug traffickers downstream will be almost 20 times that amount . 
Opium money is corrupting Afghan society from top to bottom . 
High-level collusion enables thousands of tons of chemical precursors , needed to produce heroin , to be trucked into the country . 
Sometimes even army and police vehicles are involved . 
Guns and bribes ensure that the trucks are waved through checkpoints . 
Opiates flow freely across borders into Iran , Pakistan , and other Central Asian countries . 
The opium fields of wealthy landowners are untouched , because local officials are paid off . 
Major traffickers never come to trial because judges are bribed or intimidated . 
Senior government officials take their cut of opium revenues or bribes in return for keeping quiet . 
Perversely , some provincial governors and government officials are themselves major players in the drug trade . 
As a result , the Afghan state is at risk of takeover by a malign coalition of extremists , criminals , and opportunists . 
Opium is choking Afghan society . 
Within Afghanistan , drug addiction is rising . 
Neighbors that used to be transit states for drugs are now major consumers , owing to similar dramatic increases in opium and heroin addiction . 
Intravenous drug use is spreading HIV / AIDS in Iran , Central Asia , and the former Soviet Union . 
In traditional Western European markets , health officials should brace for a rise in the number of deaths from drug overdoses , as this year &apos;s bumper opium crop will lead to higher-purity doses of heroin . 
What can be done ? 
First , the veil of corruption in Afghanistan must be lifted . 
Afghans are fed up with arrogant and well-armed tycoons who live in mansions and drive top-of-the range Mercedes limousines - this in a country where barely 13 % of the population have electricity and most people must survive on less than $ 200 a year . 
It is time for the Afghan government to name , shame , and sack corrupt officials , arrest major drug traffickers and opium landlords , and seize their assets . 
Donors have trained police and prosecutors and built courts and detention centers . 
Now it is up to the government to use the judicial system to impose the rule of law . 
It will be difficult , but not impossible , to re-establish confidence in the central government . 
Putting major drug traffickers behind bars at the new maximum-security prison at Pul-i-Charki , near Kabul , would be a good start . 
Of course , Afghanistan does not bear sole responsibility for its plight . 
The heroin trade would not be booming if Western governments were serious about combating drug consumption . 
It is a bitter irony that the countries whose soldiers &quot; lives are on the line in Afghanistan are also the biggest markets for Afghan heroin . 
Furthermore , Afghanistan &apos;s neighbors must do more to stop insurgents , weapons , money , and chemical precursors from flowing across their borders into the country . 
Coalition forces should take a more robust approach to the drug problem . 
Counter-insurgency and counter-narcotics are two sides of the same coin . 
Improving security and the rule of law must include destroying the opium trade . 
Allowing opium traffickers to operate with impunity gives them a free hand to raise money to pay for the arms and fighters battling the Afghan army and NATO forces . 
The United Nations Security Council has authorized the International Security Assistance Force to take all necessary measures to fulfill its mandate . 
NATO troops should be given the green light to help the Afghan army fight opium - destroy the heroin labs , disband the opium bazaars , attack the opium convoys , and bring the big traders to justice . 
There is no point in trying to win the hearts and minds of major drug traffickers . 
Farmers are a different story . 
Forced eradication risks pushing farmers into the hands of extremists , and thus will not lead to the sustainable reduction of opium fields . 
Indeed , as we have seen in some Andean countries , it can be counter-productive . 
Therefore , security and development must go hand in hand . 
To achieve this , Afghanistan needs more development assistance . 
International support so far has been generous , but it is still well below per capita equivalents for other post-conflict situations - and the need is much greater . 
Farmers will be weaned off opium over the long term only if they have sustainable livelihoods . 
At the moment , Afghanistan &apos;s drug lords are prospering , and rural communities are suffering . 
That situation needs to be reversed . 
We must punish the traffickers and reward the farmers . 
We cannot afford to fail in Afghanistan . 
Recent history has given us graphic evidence of what would happen if we do . 
But any solution in Afghanistan depends on eliminating its opium .
