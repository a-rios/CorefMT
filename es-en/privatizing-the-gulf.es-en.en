Privatizing the Gulf 
JEDDAH - As the Arab world undergoes fundamental changes , its leaders must adapt fast or risk popular uprisings - a lesson that has not been lost on the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) - Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and the United Arab Emirates . 
With their neighbors embroiled in internal conflict or in the midst of difficult transitions , and with discontent rising at home , the Gulf states are eager to stem the tide of revolution . 
Indeed , the GCC has offered generous aid , totaling roughly $ 160 billion so far , to countries swept by the Arab Spring . 
Furthermore , to cool domestic political tensions , some of the Gulf countries have announced additional spending packages that include significant wage hikes , substantial increases in public-sector jobs for their citizens , and higher unemployment benefits . 
Simply put , the Gulf states are relying on their wealth to ward off revolution . 
After all , the majority of their population has benefited immensely from decades of rapid , natural-resource-based economic growth . 
But the GCC economies are also rife with structural problems that short-term economic packages will not address - bloated public sectors , heavy dependence on imported labor , and endemic unemployment , especially among young people , who make up a disproportionately large share of the population . 
The region needs sustainable policies aimed at bringing about much-needed economic diversification . 
Indeed , without profound structural change , the favorable standard of living that underpins the Gulf states &quot; political stability is likely to erode . 
The public sector is by far the largest employer of GCC citizens : in Saudi Arabia , the government employs 80 % of the indigenous workforce ; in Kuwait , the figure is 93 % . 
An estimated 45 % of Saudi Arabia &apos;s government budget is allocated to public-sector salaries . 
The GCC countries &quot; new spending packages are likely to perpetuate public-sector hypertrophy . 
Unproductive measures , such as public-sector wage increases , will have the immediate effect of crowding out further the private sector . 
Next year , salaries for federal employees in the UAE will rise by 30-100 % , while their Qatari counterparts &quot; wages will rise by 60-120 % . 
But it is not certain that the additional spending will trickle down to the rest of the economy . 
In fact , because most consumer goods are imported , it is unlikely that domestic companies will benefit at all . 
Reducing public-sector dependence requires increasing citizens &quot; involvement in local businesses , so increasing the private sector &apos;s role in generating employment is vital . 
Yet very little attention has been paid to promoting entrepreneurship , despite its potential to channel the youthful dynamics unleashed by the Arab uprisings in a positive direction . 
Wealthy locals , for example , could be given incentives to invest in start-ups , while the government could provide low-interest loans and defer repayment until a particular profit threshold is reached . 
But strong legal fundamentals are no less important for creating a business-friendly environment . 
Ensuring that intellectual and other property rights are adequately protected for citizens and foreigners alike is essential , as is reducing corruption . 
Not all Gulf countries have been impermeable to change . 
In response to social-housing shortages - and rising tensions over increasingly conspicuous social inequality - Oman &apos;s leaders pledged to build 2,500 housing units for low-income families , and to support technical training tailored to job creation . 
Likewise , Bahrain signed a $ 550 million public-private partnership for housing , 75 % of which will be allocated to construction of units for low-income people . 
Still , according to the Bertelsmann Transformation Index - which aims to measure various aspects of economic development in non-liberal countries , or countries in a democratic transition - the GCC states &quot; transformation indices range from &quot; limited &quot; to &quot; very limited , &quot; largely owing to corruption and a lack of transparency . 
In some countries , such as Saudi Arabia and Oman , perceptions of corruption are linked to the absence of meritocracy . 
Moreover , the overriding importance of personal networks helps to maintain - or even increases - socio-economic inequality and hinders inclusive growth , as do weak intellectual-property laws and cumbersome bureaucracies . 
If Gulf leaders are serious about avoiding social unrest , they should take advantage of gains from today &apos;s high oil prices to finance labor-market and intellectual-property reforms , thereby encouraging private-sector growth and providing greater opportunity for all . 
International institutions could help by offering technical assistance . 
For example , there could be scope for cooperation within the European Union-GCC Joint Action Program , which already includes a section on &quot; Exchange of expertise and information ... in economic integration . &quot; 
New private-sector jobs could generate a wave of dynamism in the Gulf region , helping it to move away from overreliance on energy exports and forge a new path towards sustainable long-term growth . 
A successful transition would give real opportunities to a generation of unemployed young people , thus enabling them to take responsibility for their futures - and the future of the region .
