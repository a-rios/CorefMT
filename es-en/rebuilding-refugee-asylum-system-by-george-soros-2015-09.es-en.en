Rebuilding the Asylum System 
NEW YORK - The European Union needs to accept responsibility for the lack of a common asylum policy , which has transformed this year &apos;s growing influx of refugees from a manageable problem into yet another political crisis . 
Each member state has selfishly focused on its own interests , often acting against the interests of others . 
This precipitated panic among asylum seekers , the general public , and the authorities responsible for law and order . 
Asylum seekers have been the main victims . 
The EU needs a comprehensive plan to respond to the crisis , one that reasserts effective governance over the flows of asylum-seekers so that they take place in a safe , orderly way , and at a pace that reflects Europe &apos;s capacity to absorb them . 
To be comprehensive , the plan has to extend beyond the borders of Europe . 
It is less disruptive and much less expensive to maintain potential asylum-seekers in or close to their present location . 
As the origin of the current crisis is Syria , the fate of the Syrian population has to be the first priority . 
But other asylum seekers and migrants must not be forgotten . 
Similarly , a European plan must be accompanied by a global response , under the authority of the United Nations and involving its member states . 
This would distribute the burden of the Syrian crisis over a larger number of states , while also establishing global standards for dealing with the problems of forced migration more generally . 
Here are the six components of a comprehensive plan . 
First , the EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future . 
And , to do that , it must share the burden fairly - a principle that a qualified majority finally established at last Wednesday &apos;s summit . 
Adequate financing is critical . 
The EU should provide € 15,000 ( $ 16,800 ) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing , health care , and education costs - and to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states . 
It can raise these funds by issuing long-term bonds using its largely untapped AAA borrowing capacity , which will have the added benefit of providing a justified fiscal stimulus to the European economy . 
It is equally important to allow both states and asylum-seekers to express their preferences , using the least possible coercion . 
Placing refugees where they want to go - and where they are wanted - is a sine qua non of success . 
Second , the EU must lead the global effort to provide adequate funding to Lebanon , Jordan , and Turkey to support the four million refugees currently living in those countries . 
Thus far , only a fraction of the funding needed for even basic care has been raised . 
If education , training , and other essential needs are included , the annual costs are at least € 5,000 per refugee , or € 20 billion . 
EU aid today to Turkey , though doubled last week , still amounts to just € 1 billion . 
In addition , the EU also should help create special economic zones with preferred trade status in the region , including in Tunisia and Morocco , to attract investment and generate jobs for both locals and refugees . 
The EU would need to make an annual commitment to frontline countries of at least € 8-10 billion , with the balance coming from the United States and the rest of the world . 
This could be added to the amount of long-term bonds issued to support asylum-seekers in Europe . 
Third , the EU must immediately start building a single EU Asylum and Migration Agency and eventually a single EU Border Guard . 
The current patchwork of 28 separate asylum systems does not work : it is expensive , inefficient , and produces wildly inconsistent results in determining who qualifies for asylum . 
The new agency would gradually streamline procedures ; establish common rules for employment and entrepreneurship , as well as consistent benefits ; and develop an effective , rights-respecting return policy for migrants who do not qualify for asylum . 
Fourth , safe channels must be established for asylum-seekers , starting with getting them from Greece and Italy to their destination countries . 
This is very urgent in order to calm the panic . 
The next logical step is to extend safe avenues to the frontline region , thereby reducing the number of migrants who make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing . 
If asylum-seekers have a reasonable chance of ultimately reaching Europe , they are far more likely to stay where they are . 
This will require negotiating with frontline countries , in cooperation with the UN Refugee Agency , to establish processing centers there - with Turkey as the priority . 
The operational and financial arrangements developed by the EU should be used to establish global standards for the treatment of asylum-seekers and migrants . 
This is the fifth piece of the comprehensive plan . 
Finally , to absorb and integrate more than a million asylum seekers and migrants a year , the EU needs to mobilize the private sector - NGOs , church groups , and businesses - to act as sponsors . 
This will require not only sufficient funding , but also the human and IT capacity to match migrants and sponsors . 
The exodus from war-torn Syria should never have become a crisis . 
It was long in the making , easy to foresee , and eminently manageable by Europe and the international community . 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has now also produced a six-point plan to address the crisis . 
But his plan , which subordinates the human rights of asylum-seekers and migrants to the security of borders , threatens to divide and destroy the EU by renouncing the values on which it was built and violating the laws that are supposed to govern it . 
The EU must respond with a genuinely European asylum policy that will put an end to the panic and the unnecessary human suffering .
