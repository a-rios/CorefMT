European Universities &quot; Identity Crisis 
MADRID - Higher education in Europe today finds itself in a state of profound uncertainty . 
What should universities &quot; primary focus be - research , professional training , or social inclusion ? 
Should governments invest more in higher education to underpin long-term economic growth ? 
Should universities be left alone to compete and survive ( or not ) in a global education marketplace ? 
Amid the debates about their future role , Europe &apos;s universities must not lose sight of their individual identity , their traditions , and their sense of social purpose . 
This will not be easy . 
Moreover , the parameters of the debate are becoming hazy . 
On one hand , universities are abiding by long-standing agreements with government ; on the other , they face zealous reformers who seek market-based solutions that stress competition among institutions , encourage staff and student mobility , and emphasize student-centered learning . 
Traditionally , universities undertook research , provided a professional education , and offered a country &apos;s young people a cultural foundation as they entered society . 
Today , none of these aims appears secure . 
Indeed , the gravest danger to Europe &apos;s universities is a prolonged period of confusion about their ultimate aims . 
Seeking truth through observation , experimentation , rational argument , and mutual criticism has always been a raison d &quot; Ãªtre of universities . 
Reflecting this , some European institutions are encouraged by government to try to match the research excellence attained by top universities in the United States . 
But not all of Europe &apos;s universities regard themselves primarily as research institutions . 
Many prefer to focus on preparing their students for the world of work . 
And if years of schooling do not translate into greater cognitive skills , then much of the economic justification for investing in higher education falls apart . 
Universities have also had a public-service mission : to provide students with a cultural foundation for life . 
This purpose may seem increasingly controversial in pluralistic Western societies , but universities should at least provide their students with an understanding of the models , history , and philosophical fundamentals with which to debate these issues . 
Without a reasonable awareness of their socio-cultural environment , students may view universities merely as a place to pursue private goals , make useful connections , enjoy student life , and perhaps pick up a superficial sense of diversity . 
Whichever path Europe &apos;s universities take , maintaining a distinct identity in the face of global change and education reform will become increasingly difficult . 
Researchers are no longer confined within their ivory towers , but work as part of complex global networks alongside private-sector participants . 
Tenured professors , once central to the life and image of a college , are being replaced by part-time teachers who lack a strong connection to their institution . 
Likewise , in the emerging conception of universities - one that draws heavily from the corporate world - educational &quot; managers , &quot; applying &quot; best practices &quot; ( and always ready to move on to the next posting ) - retain the most cursory regard for the institution &apos;s life and traditions . 
And students , seen as mere consumers of a service , are invited to exercise choice regarding teachers , curricula , and location . 
Some may find these changes exciting . 
Policymakers must be aware of the educational and cultural damage that continuous reforms - all justified in the future-oriented jargon of the day - can wreak . 
Universities must protect their institutional memories , local traditions , and commitment to each new generation of students . 
A loyal and grateful alumni network can help to ensure this . 
The alternative is a formulaic educational experience that not only lacks individual character , but that is also devoid of moral purpose .
