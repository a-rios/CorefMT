Accounting Tricks Around the Globe 
Accounting chicanery will be high on the agenda of the bankers who will meet at the annual IMF / World Bank gathering in Washington , D.C. The IMF should do more than offer the private sector advice about how to fix its accounting problems ; governmental accounting tricks and the IMF &apos;s own wheezes should also be addressed , says Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz . 
The Arthur Anderson and Enron scandals in America have focused attention on the problems of accounting in private businesses . 
But the scale of this corruption should not blind us to the problem of public sector accounting , where many deceitful things are also being done . 
Accounting rules are designed to provide standardized frameworks within which the financial position of a firm , or government , can be assessed . 
Bad accounting frameworks always lead to bad information , and bad information leads to bad decisions , with serious long term consequences . 
This is true in the public as well as the private sector . 
America &apos;s business scandals showed how accounting rules can be bent and abused to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a company . 
The Bush Administration , not to be left behind , has shown how public accounting rules can be bent so as to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a national economy . 
Indeed , last year saw what may be the largest accounting fraud ever conducted , as a mega-surplus of more than $ 3trillion for the years 2002 to 2011 was transformed into a $ 2 trillion deficit . 
Investors in Enron waited years before discovering that something was amiss . 
It will be years before the full magnitude of President Bush &apos;s deception is apparent . 
Meanwhile , the Bush Administration will blame the sinking economy , bad luck , and unintentional miscalculations for the vanished surplus . 
But America is not alone in allowing for official accounting shenanigans . 
In Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world , the IMF imposes accounting frameworks that not only make little sense , but result in excessive austerity . 
In some of the poorest countries in the world - ie , those most dependent on aid - the IMF has argued that foreign aid should not be listed as revenue in a government &apos;s budget calculations . 
But what else is aid if it is not revenue ? 
The IMF &apos;s argument seems to be this : a country cannot rely on foreign aid because aid is too unstable . 
The truth , of course , is that aid is more stable than tax revenues in poor countries . 
By the IMF &apos;s logic , neither aid nor tax revenues should be included in budgets . 
If that is the case , every country in the world is in deep trouble . 
The absurdity here is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to reserves . 
But donor countries want to see the money they give to finance schools or health clinics spent on schools and health clinics ; they don &apos;t want to see it added to a nation &apos;s reserves . 
Governments in developing countries have the 
Other IMF accounting practices , including how the capital expenditures of government-owned enterprises are treated , are also causing outrage . 
But by 
These are national funds that , in boom years , receive revenues from sales of natural resources to be set aside against a rainy day . 
This makes sense . 
But IMF accounting inhibits the use of these funds to help stabilize an economy through counter-cyclical fiscal spending . 
According to Mexican and Chilean officials I have discussed the matter with , spending from a stabilization fund is reportedly treated as if the country is borrowing , thus adding to its deficit . 
It is , of course , in times of economic downturn that countries worry most about their credit rating , so the IMF stance is particularly unhelpful . 
IMF accounting frameworks , rather than providing useful signals to the market , provide distorted information that exacerbates a troubled country &apos;s problems .
