The Paradox of Blinking 
SINGAPORE - The world has recently witnessed two major diplomatic blinks . 
Japan , facing mounting pressure from China , unconditionally released a Chinese trawler captain whose ship had rammed a Japanese naval patrol boat . 
And US President Barack Obama did nothing when Israel refused to extend its freeze on new building construction in the West Bank , causing Israeli West Bank settlers to rejoice . 
In the short run , it is clear who lost . 
In the long run , however , the outcome of backing down may not be so clear . 
China , in particular , should weigh carefully the long-term political price of celebrating its supposed victory over Japan . 
According to Newton &apos;s third law of motion , &quot; for every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction . &quot; 
Geopolitics has a similar law : whenever the world sees a new emerging power , the world &apos;s greatest existing power tries , directly or indirectly , to block its rise . 
Today , the world &apos;s greatest power is the US , and the greatest emerging power is China . 
So far , surprisingly , the US has not forged a strategy to thwart China &apos;s rise . 
The reasons for this geopolitical aberration are complex . 
But a key factor is that , until recently , China &apos;s leaders have abided by the wise counsel of Deng Xiaoping : taoguang yanghui ( conceal &#91; our &#93; capabilities and avoid the limelight ) , and shanyu shouzhuo ( be good at keeping a low profile ) . 
China &apos;s decision to browbeat the Japanese into submission over the fishing trawler , suggests that China may be throwing Deng &apos;s geopolitical caution out the window . 
More recklessly , after securing the release of the trawler , China demanded an apology from Japan . 
A major rule in international relations is never to make a demand that cannot be met . 
Having already been humiliated by China , such an apology would be politically suicidal for the Japanese government . 
In fact , China should hope that no such apology is forthcoming . 
In the past few decades , Japan has become a sleeping tiger . 
Having outperformed the rest of Asia for more than a century , the Japanese have decided to slow down . 
Japan has lost its drive to remain one of the world &apos;s greatest powers , and it may never regain it . 
But , given Japan &apos;s history , one would be foolish to underestimate the country . 
While the world frets about North Korean and Iranian nuclear weapons , it is useful to remind ourselves that Japan , should it choose , could become a nuclear power in a matter of weeks . 
It has all the ingredients , though painful memories of World War II and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have so far kept its leaders well away from developing a nuclear stockpile . 
Moreover , if Japan needs allies to balance the rise of China , it could easily turn not only to the US , but also to Russia and India . 
In short , the geopolitical cards could turn out in Japan &apos;s favor if China overplays its hand . 
Similarly , geopolitics does not work in Israel &apos;s favor on the West Bank issue . 
When US global dominance was unquestioned , as in the 1990 &quot; s , it made sense for Israel to secure its long-term future by maintaining a stranglehold over the US Congress . 
But American power has peaked . 
At its high water mark , the US , with 5 % of the world &apos;s population , accounted for close to 30 % of global GDP . 
Given this spectacular economic performance , Americans could spend more on defense than the rest of the world combined . 
All this , quite naturally , led to geopolitical hubris , in Washington and in Tel Aviv . 
While US power will inevitably decline in relative terms , that of the 1.3 billion people who live in the Islamic world - the vast majority of them in Asia - will inevitably increase . 
The rising economic tide that is lifting China and India will lift them as well . 
Asian Muslims have the same mentality as the Chinese and Indians . 
What China and India are doing today , Asia &apos;s Muslim societies will do tomorrow . 
As a result , the combined GDP of the 57-member Organization of the Islamic Conference nations - now only about 13 % of global output - will easily double in the coming decades . 
So time is no longer on Israel &apos;s side . 
The security fostered by America &apos;s unchallenged global power has been shown to be an illusion . 
Soon America will have to make major geopolitical adjustments , especially if its economy underperforms in the coming decade or two . 
Like the former Soviet Union , the US will have to carry out perestroika and cut defense spending . 
As a friend of Israel , I am surprised that more of us are not calling on the country &apos;s leaders to seize the brief geopolitical opportunity of a viable two-state solution , while the offer remains on the table . 
Israel &apos;s continued humiliation of the Palestinians , now telecast live into hundreds of millions of Muslim homes , is generating unnecessary reservoirs of hate . 
The scenes of exultant West Bank settlers only aggravate this . 
Israel &apos;s recent falling out with its best friend in the Islamic world , Turkey , should have provided its leaders a premonition of the new world that is coming . 
The fallout with Turkey was a minor tremor . 
With larger geopolitical earthquakes coming , the time for Israel to act is now .
