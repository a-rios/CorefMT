Heroes Cross Swords in Sri Lanka 
NEW DELHI - Two celebrated heroes who , as president and army chief , helped end Sri Lanka &apos;s long and brutal civil war against the Tamil Tigers are now crossing political swords . 
Whichever candidate wins Sri Lanka &apos;s presidential election on January 26 will have to lead that small but strategically located island-nation in a fundamentally different direction - from making war , as it has done for more than a quarter-century , to making peace through ethnic reconciliation and power sharing . 
Sri Lanka , almost since independence in 1948 , has been racked by acrimonious rivalry between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils , who make up 12 % of today &apos;s 21.3-million population . 
Now the country is being divided by the political rivalry between two Sinhalese war idols , each of whom wants to be remembered as the true leader who crushed the Tamil Tiger guerrillas . 
The antagonism between President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the now-retired General Sarath Fonseka has been in the making for months . 
No sooner had Sri Lanka &apos;s military crushed the Tamil Tigers - who ran a de facto state for more than two decades in the north and east - than Rajapaksa removed Fonseka as army chief to appoint him to the new , largely ceremonial post of chief of defense staff . 
Once the four-star general was moved to the new position , his relationship with the president began to sour . 
After rumors swirled of an army coup last fall , the president , seeking military assistance should the need arise , alerted India . 
When Rajapaksa decided last November to call an early election to help cash in on his war-hero status with the Sinhalese , he had a surprise waiting for him : anticipating the move , Fonseka submitted his resignation so that he could stand against the incumbent as the common opposition candidate . 
In his bitter resignation letter , the general accused Rajapaksa of &quot; unnecessarily placing Indian troops on high alert &quot; and failing to &quot; win the peace in spite of the fact that the army under my leadership won the war . &quot; 
Now the political clash between the two men - both playing the Sinhalese nationalist card while wooing the Tamil minority - has overshadowed the serious economic and political challenges confronting Sri Lanka . 
Years of war have left Sri Lanka &apos;s economy strapped for cash . 
Despite a $ 2.8 billion International Monetary Fund bailout package , the economy continues to totter , with inflation soaring and public-sector salary disputes flaring . 
The government , desperate to earn foreign exchange , has launched a major campaign to attract international tourists . 
But a vulnerable economy dependent on external credit has only helped increase pressure on Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
This was a war with no witnesses , as the government barred independent journalists and observers from the war zone . 
Yet the United Nations estimates that more than 7,000 noncombatants were killed in the final months of the war as government forces overran Tamil Tiger bases . 
How elusive the peace dividend remains can be seen from the government &apos;s decision to press ahead with the expansion of an already-large military . 
The Sri Lankan military is bigger in troop strength than the British and Israeli militaries , having expanded five-fold since the late 1980 &quot; s to more than 200,000 troops today . 
In victory , that strength is being raised further , in the name of &quot; eternal vigilance . &quot; 
With an ever-larger military machine backed by village-level militias , civil society has been the main loser . 
Sweeping emergency regulations remain in place , arming the security forces with expansive powers of search , arrest , and seizure of property . 
Individuals can still be held in unacknowledged detention for up to 18 months . 
Now calls are growing for the government to surrender the special powers that it acquired during the war and end the control of information as an instrument of state policy . 
Fonseka has promised to curtail the almost unchecked powers that the president now enjoys and free thousands of young Tamil men suspected of rebel links . 
Rajapaksa , for his part , has eased some of the travel restrictions in the Tamil-dominated north after opening up sealed camps where more than 270,000 Tamils were interned for months . 
More than 100,000 still remain in those camps . 
Neither of the two main candidates , though , has promised to tackle the country &apos;s key challenge : transforming Sri Lanka from a unitary state into a federation that grants provincial and local autonomy . 
After all , the issues that triggered the civil war were rooted in the country &apos;s post-independence moves to fashion a mono-ethnic national identity , best illustrated by the 1956 &quot; Sinhalese only &quot; language policy and the 1972 Constitution &apos;s elimination of a ban on discrimination against minorities . 
Sri Lanka is the only country , along with Malaysia , with affirmative action for the majority ethnic community . 
As the incumbent with control over the state machinery and media support , Rajapaksa has the edge in the election . 
But , with the fractured opposition rallying behind Fonseka and a moderate Tamil party also coming out in support of him , this election may produce a surprise result . 
Whichever &quot; hero &quot; wins , however , building enduring peace and stability in war-scarred Sri Lanka requires a genuine process of national reconciliation and healing . 
The country &apos;s future hinges on it .
