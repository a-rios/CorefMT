A French Presidential Primer The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that &quot; a week is a long time in politics . &quot; 
So , in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election , any prediction made today could be reversed , and reversed again , before the vote . 
But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls : Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left . 
In fact , they have more in common than meets the eye , for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity . 
For Sarkozy , &quot; rupture &quot; reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices . 
The 12 years of Jacques Chirac &apos;s presidency , together with France &apos;s tradition of alternation in power , suggests a victory for the left . 
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today &apos;s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate . 
This is reflected in Sarkozy &apos;s openly pro-American stance - an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high . 
Sarkozy &apos;s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America &apos;s military adventure in Iraq , but that their style was disastrously wrong . 
Thus , his deep admiration for &quot; American values , &quot; while sincere , implies no embrace of President George W. Bush . 
It also reassures the French business community , which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin &apos;s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac &apos;s foreign minister . 
At home , Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young , issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline , a counter-revolutionary revolution . 
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968 , whose leaders and supporters , according to Sarkozy , may have lost politically to de Gaulle , but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on &quot; false values . &quot; 
By contrast , rebelling against one &apos;s parents &quot; generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France - a message that is highly applicable to issues , such as education and immigration , that may dominate the electoral campaign . 
In the case of Royal , the meaning of &quot; rupture &quot; is both more obvious and more visible . 
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic . 
To achieve her goal , she prefers to emphasize her &quot; essence , &quot; thereby countering Sarkozy &apos;s stress on his record as a &quot; doer . &quot; 
Her appeal to voters is simple : &quot; I am a woman , and you have never tried a woman , so be modern and try one now . &quot; 
Hiding behind the originality ( in French presidential politics ) of her gender , Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program . 
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda , her highly effective line of defense ( so far ! ) has been : &quot; You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman ! &quot; 
Thus , Royal &apos;s program is her popularity . 
In foreign policy , one can only guess what her priorities would be . 
As far as Europe is concerned , she seems as &quot; agnostic &quot; as Sarkozy , who , like her , incarnates a new generation of &quot; post-European &quot; leaders . 
In terms of values , Royal , too , seems to represent a rupture with May 1968 , with her emphasis on discipline and family . 
According to public opinion polls , Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy . 
Her support is particularly strong among women voters . 
For the Socialist Party , which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002 , the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal . 
In the opinion of Royal &apos;s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants , the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity : the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern . 
According to Royal &apos;s Socialist critics , the &quot; Hollywoodization &quot; of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead . 
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy . 
Moreover , both candidates embody continuity - with Chirac &apos;s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal - as much as rupture . 
Royal openly claims Mitterand &apos;s legacy as she searches for legitimacy , while Sarkozy &apos;s rejection of Chirac &apos;s legacy has more to do with form than substance . 
To a large extent , Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more , whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less . 
When the voters decide in the spring of 2007 , their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations , as it did in 2002 , when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round . 
As in 2002 , the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less .
