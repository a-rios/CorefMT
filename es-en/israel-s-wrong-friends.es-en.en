Israel &apos;s Wrong Friends 
JERUSALEM - Israel has been welcoming some rather peculiar visitors of late . 
The Dutch populist , Geert Wilders , is a frequent caller , telling sympathetic audiences that Israel is on the front line of the Western war against Islam . 
And , in December , a delegation of European far-right politicians toured Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank , pleasing their hosts by reassuring them that this was &quot; Jewish land . &quot; 
Some of these &quot; friends of Israel &quot; represent political parties whose supporters , to put it mildly , have not traditionally been noted for their fraternal feelings towards Jews . 
Heinz-Christian Strache , for example , leads the Freedom Party of Austria , which began , under its late leader , Jörg Haider , by actively courting former Nazis . 
&quot; More strength for our Viennese blood , &quot; one of his election slogans , gives an idea of Strache &apos;s typical tone . 
His Belgian colleague , Filip Dewinter , represents a Flemish nationalist party tainted by wartime collaboration with the Nazis . 
To be sure , nowadays even right-wing politicians in Europe are careful not to sound openly anti-Semitic . 
Wilders , for one , is ostentatiously philosemitic , and all the New Rightists like to stress the importance of what they call &quot; Judeo-Christian values , &quot; which must be defended against &quot; Islamofascism . &quot; 
Leftist and liberal critics of Israeli politics like to point out that anti-Zionism is not the same thing as anti-Semitism . 
But it is just as true that being a friend of Israel is not necessarily the same thing as being a friend of the Jews . 
Richard Nixon , for example , said of Jews that &quot; you can &apos;t trust the bastards , &quot; but was a great admirer of Israel . 
And , of course , the last 2,000 years have shown that anti-Semitism is perfectly compatible with the worship of a Jew called Jesus of Nazareth . 
In the United States , some of the fiercest defenders of hardline Zionism are evangelical Christians who firmly believe that Jews who refuse to convert to Christianity will one day face terrible retribution . 
Sometimes , the wrong friends can be useful . 
When Theodor Herzl was making the rounds of Europe at the end of the nineteenth century , trying to gain support for the establishment of a state for the Jews , he was often rebuffed by rich and powerful Jewish grandees , who saw him as a troublemaker . 
Instead , he found eager supporters among pious Protestants , for whom Jews belonged in their own holy land rather than in Europe . 
Once the Jewish state was established , the earliest European friends of Israel were often people on the left , who admired the communal life on the kibbutzim , and saw Israel as a great socialist experiment , led by wise old left-wing idealists , such as David Ben-Gurion . 
Residual guilt about the Holocaust bolstered this attitude . 
Things began to change after the 1967 Six Day War , and even more after the 1973 &quot; Yom Kippur &quot; war , when it became clear that Israel was not going to let go of the Palestinian territories that it had conquered . 
Later , when Israel began to build settlements all over the occupied territories , admiration even turned into active hostility from Europe &apos;s left . 
To many people on the right , however , the very things deplored by the European ( and Israeli ) left became reasons to admire Israel . 
These new friends liked the ruthless use of force , the ethnic nationalism , the continued humiliation of the Palestinians . 
Keen to revive a more militant form of nationalism in their own countries , politicians like Strache , Wilders , and Dewinter see Israel as a kind of model - a model discredited for a long time in Europe , owing to bad memories of fascism and Nazism . 
Indeed , anti-Zionist leftists frequently attempt to discredit Israel by comparing its actions in Gaza and the West Bank to Nazi atrocities . 
This is a cheap trick , aimed to give maximum offense . 
Contrary to what the Nobel Prize-winning author José Saramago once said , the Israeli army &apos;s attacks in Gaza are not comparable in any way to Auschwitz . 
But the view , espoused by Israel &apos;s new right-wing friends , that Israel is on the front line against Islamic fascism , is equally mendacious . 
By comparing Islam in general - not only Islamist terrorism - to fascism , as the right-wing populists do , and to suggest that Europe faces a threat comparable to the Nazis , is not just wrong , but dangerous . 
For , if it were true , any and all measures taken against Muslims , however brutal , would be justified , and Israel would indeed be a frontline state , resisting &quot; Islamofacism &quot; to prevent another Auschwitz . 
This is certainly how many Israeli right-wing politicians explain things . 
And they find eager parrots among some of Europe &apos;s most retrograde political forces . 
It is a view that carries the grave implication that a peaceful solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is almost impossible . 
The longer Israel , cheered on by the wrong European friends , continues to humiliate the Palestinians and occupy their lands , the more likely it will be that hatred and violence will stand in the way of compromise , without which there can be no peace . 
There is another potential consequence , however . 
False analogies with the past trivialize history . 
If the Israelis , or the Palestinians , are like Nazis , then the horror of what the real Nazis did has been greatly diminished . 
But exploiting history to justify current violence will not work forever . 
Once people stop believing that Israel is defending the West against fascism , Israel will be blamed for all the violence in the Middle East . 
And Jews everywhere else will be blamed by association . 
In short , the wrong friends of Israel are even worse friends of the Jewish people .
