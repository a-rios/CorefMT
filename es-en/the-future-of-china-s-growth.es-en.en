The Future of China &apos;s Growth 
BEIJING - The slowdown of China &apos;s economy has captured the headlines in recent weeks . 
Whether it is a permanent or temporary adjustment , the Chinese authorities have much work to do in laying the groundwork for strong economic performance in the medium and long term . 
Despite extraordinary growth since the start of its transition to a market economy in 1979 , China is facing serious challenges simultaneously : rising inequality , large and growing levels of environmental degradation , stubborn external imbalances , and an aging society . 
Fortunately , China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan ( 2011-2015 ) recognizes the need to deepen market-oriented reform , change the country &apos;s development model , and focus on the quality of growth , structural reforms , and social inclusion to overcome the rural-urban divide and stem the rise in income inequality . 
In line with this bold , long-term approach , a new report , China 2030 : Building a Modern , Harmonious , and Creative High-Income Society , proposes reforms that my country needs to develop a mature , well-functioning market economy by 2030 . 
The report is the result of a longstanding China-World Bank partnership . 
Commemorating the 30th anniversary of China &apos;s membership , World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick proposed to the country &apos;s leaders a joint effort to identify and analyze China &apos;s medium-term development challenges . 
China 2030 calls for structural reforms that would redefine the role of government , overhaul state-owned enterprises and banks , develop the private sector , promote competition , and deepen liberalization of the land , labor , and financial markets . 
While providing relatively fewer tangible public goods and services directly , the Chinese government will need to provide more intangible public goods and services like rules , standards , and policies . 
Such policies and institutional improvements increase productivity , promote competition , facilitate specialization , enhance the efficiency of resource allocation , protect the environment , and reduce risks and uncertainties . 
In the enterprise sector , the focus will need to be on increasing competition in all sectors , reducing barriers to entry and exit for private companies , and strengthening state-owned enterprises &quot; competitiveness . 
In the financial sector , the banking system must be commercialized , thereby gradually allowing interest rates to be set by market forces , while capital markets must be deepened in tandem with the development of the legal and supervisory infrastructure needed to ensure financial stability . 
In the labor market , China needs to accelerate reforms of the hukou ( household registration ) system to ensure that , by 2030 , workers can move more freely in response to market signals . 
Currently , anyone who moves to another part of the country without a hukou risks losing access to education , social services , and the housing market . 
China &apos;s policymakers also need to introduce measures to increase labor-force participation rates , rethink wage policy , and make social-insurance programs portable nationwide . 
Finally , farmers &quot; rights need to be protected , the efficiency of land use must be increased , and policies for acquisition of rural land for urban use should be overhauled . 
China &apos;s medium-term success will also require creating an open system in which competitive pressures encourage Chinesecompanies to engage in product and processinnovation , not only through their ownresearch-and-development efforts , but also through participationin global Rampamp ; Dnetworks . 
The priority is to increase the quality of Rampamp ; D , rather than just its quantity . 
An enlightened strategy must encourage China to &quot; grow green , &quot; as opposed to growing rapidly now and facing massive environmental costs later . 
Encouraging new investments in low-pollution , energy- and resource-efficient industries would lead to greener development , spur investments in related upstream and downstream manufacturing and services , and build an international competitive advantage in a global sunrise industry . 
China 2030 also calls for expanding opportunities , promoting social security , and reducing the country &apos;s relatively high social and economic inequality by addressing the rural-urban disparities in access to jobs , finance , and high-quality public services . 
Doing so will require greater sustained attention to underserved rural areas and migrant populations , and to restructuring social policies in order to ensure secure safety nets . 
Moreover , it is vital to strengthen China &apos;s fiscal positionby mobilizing additional revenues and ensuring that local governments have adequate financing to meet their rising expenditure responsibilities . 
Such reforms can help to ensure that budgetary resources are available at different levels of government ( central , provincial , prefectural , county , township , and village ) , and are commensurate with expenditure responsibilities . 
Last but not least , China should become a proactive stakeholder in the global economy . 
By continuing to intensify its global trade , investment , and financial links , which have served it well over the past three decades , China would benefit from further specialization , increased investment opportunities , and higher returns to capital , as well as mutually beneficial flows of ideas and knowledge . 
China must remain committed to resuscitating the stalled Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and support a global agreement on investment flows . 
Global integration of China &apos;s financial sector will require opening the capital account , which will have to be carried out steadily and with considerable care ; but it will be a key step toward internationalizing the renminbi as a global reserve currency . 
The proposals contained in China 2030 could provide a framework for Chinese policymakers as they seek to achieve their goal of sustainable and harmonious growth . 
With the global economy entering a dangerous phase , China &apos;s government will need to respond to new risks , shocks , and vulnerabilities as they arise . 
But , in doing so , it should adhere to the principle that policy responses to short-term problems must uphold , not undermine , long-term reform priorities .
