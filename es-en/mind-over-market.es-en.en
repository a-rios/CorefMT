Mind over Market 
MILAN - In the 66 years since World War II ended , virtually all centrally planned economies have disappeared , largely as a result of inefficiency and low growth . 
Nowadays , markets , price signals , decentralization , incentives , and return-driven investment characterize resource allocation almost everywhere . 
This is not because markets are morally superior , though they do require freedom of choice to function effectively . 
Markets are tools that , relative to the alternatives , happen to have great strengths with respect to incentives , efficiency , and innovation . 
But they are not perfect ; they underperform in the presence of externalities ( the un-priced consequences - for example , air pollution - of individual actions ) , informational gaps and asymmetries , and coordination problems when there are multiple equilibria , some superior to others . 
But markets have more fundamental weaknesses . 
Or , rather , most societies have important economic and social objectives that markets and competition are not designed to achieve . 
In today &apos;s rapidly globalizing world , the most important of these objectives - expressed in various ways through the political and policymaking process in a wide range of countries - are stability , distributional equity , and sustainability . 
Consider stability . 
We live in a world of largely decentralized networks of increasing complexity : electronic networks , networks of supply chains and trade , financial networks that link the balance sheets of disparate entities . 
Market incentives cause actors to operate or modify parts of the network in ways that maximize efficiency locally . 
But the presumption - often an article of faith - that the whole remains stable and resilient has no theoretical or empirical support . 
Indeed , it seems inaccurate . 
For example , it has been known for some time that networks that are efficient are often not resilient , because resilient networks have inefficient redundancies . 
Resilience is a public good , created by the right kind of redundancy . 
In a decentralized structure , redundancy tends to be undersupplied in the process of local optimization . 
That is why the tsunami that hit Japan last year disrupted many global supply chains : they were ( and still are ) too efficient from the standpoint of withstanding shocks . 
In financial markets , local optimization seems to lead to excessive leverage and other forms of risk-taking that undermine the stability of the system . 
Much research is needed to understand which interventions or restrictions on individual choice are needed to make certain kinds of market equilibria stable . 
But , clearly , markets do not do this well by themselves . 
Consider , next , how labor-saving technological change and the integration of several hundred million new workers into global markets have affected income distribution , returns to education , and employment opportunities almost everywhere . 
In particular , the share of national income going to capital and human capital ( highly educated people ) is rising on a broad front , fueling increasing concentration of wealth . 
Even so , income distributions vary widely among the developed countries . 
For example , in the US , the top 20 % earns , on average , 8.4 times more than the bottom 20 % . 
In the UK , the same ratio is 7.2 , and it is only 4.3 in Germany ( compared to a whopping 12.2 in China ) . 
These differential outcomes reflect distinctive combinations of market forces and social contracts . 
Income distributions are influenced by taxation and fiscal policy , which usually have redistributive effects , directly and through the provision of social services and insurance . 
But these distributions are also affected by policies and investments that focus on the supply side , and that produce education and skills that match ( or don &apos;t match ) a rapidly evolving global structure of labor demand . 
Part of the challenge is that demand for labor moves to supply , rather than vice versa , because labor mobility in the global economy is limited . 
To assume a constant level and composition of labor demand would be as mistaken as taking current passenger demand as a fixed reference point in planning public-transportation systems . 
In this and other cases , supply influences demand over time ( Steve Jobs , for example , understood this better than most ) . 
That is why it is crucial to think about potential demand in tackling this kind of matching problem . 
As with stability , markets cannot be relied upon to deal effectively with this problem on their own . 
Public policy and public-sector investment matter , too . 
Attention is increasingly - and , in my view , rightly - being focused on the role of the state , and in particular on the state &apos;s balance sheet . 
Experience in developing and advanced countries alike suggests that states with substantial and healthy balance sheets are better positioned to deal with today &apos;s stability , distributional , and sustainability challenges . 
The benefits are several , including an ability to withstand shocks and mount countercyclical responses , as well as a capacity to recycle income to households during periods like the present , when the share of income that goes to capital is rising ( with adverse distributional consequences ) . 
In addition , countries periodically need to be able to mount and sustain public-sector investment in technology , or to engage in risk-sharing , in order to adapt to shifting competitive conditions or respond to shocks . 
Minority public ownership can provide resources , while retaining the benefits of competition , and ensure that some of the returns accrue to the general public via government revenues . 
Some of this will run counter to existing orthodoxy , and may provoke a healthy debate . 
A relatively narrow focus on efficiency and growth , at least in many advanced countries , may have worked in the early decades after WWII , when distributional patterns were benign and instability rare . 
Today that is not enough . 
Stability , equity , and sustainability challenges have become crucially important , and the role of the state in relation to markets may need re-thinking as a result . 
Re-orienting policy frameworks to longer time horizons , with a more balanced and forward-looking focus on stability and equity ( without losing sight of efficiency and innovation ) , seems essential to meeting the needs , hopes , and expectations of people everywhere . 
Indeed , that is the key to addressing sustainability , to which I will turn next month .
