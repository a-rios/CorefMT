Inside Africa &apos;s Consumer Revolution 
JOHANNESBURG - Nowadays , Africa &apos;s economic potential - and the business opportunities that go with it - is widely acknowledged . 
Poverty and unemployment are still more widespread than in other emerging markets , but accelerating growth since 2000 has made Africa the world &apos;s second-fastest-growing region ( after emerging Asia and equal to the Middle East ) . 
With rapid economic growth have come more prosperous consumers - and vice versa : 45 % of Africa &apos;s total GDP growth in the 2000 &quot; s ( before the financial crisis erupted in 2008 ) came from consumer-related sectors of the economy . 
It is expected that , by 2020 , more than half of African households - almost 130 million - will have discretionary income to spend ( or save ) , up from 85 million today . 
Moreover , Africa has the world &apos;s fastest-growing population - and the youngest , with more than half under 20 years old , compared to 28 % in China . 
The United Nations estimates that the continent will account for more than 40 % of global population growth through 2030 , with the working-age population expected to surpass that of China by 2040 . 
Given these trends , the continent &apos;s consumer industries are expected to grow a further $ 410 billion by 2020 - more than half the total revenue increase that all businesses are expected to generate in Africa by the end of the decade . 
In one of the first studies of its kind , the McKinsey Africa Consumer Insights Center surveyed 13,000 individuals from 15 cities in ten of the continent &apos;s 54 countries in 2011 and 2012 . 
The ten countries - Algeria , Angola , Egypt , Ghana , Kenya , Morocco , Nigeria , South Africa , Sudan , and Tunisia - accounted for 81 % of Africa &apos;s private consumption in 2011 . 
Indeed , with 40 % of its population living in cities , Africa is more urbanized than India ( 30 % ) , and nearly as urbanized as China ( 45 % ) . 
By 2016 , more than 500 million Africans will live in urban centers , and the number of cities with more than one million people is expected to reach 65 , up from 52 in 2011 ( on par with Europe and higher than India and North America ) . 
This development is critically important for consumer companies . 
Urban household spending in Africa is increasing twice as fast as rural spending , with urban per capita incomes , on average , 80 % higher than those of countries as a whole . 
Befitting the continent &apos;s strong macro trends , the survey found a high degree of optimism among urban African consumers : 84 % of respondents expect their households to be better off in two years . 
Sub-Saharan Africans are the most optimistic - 97 % of Ghanaians , for example , expect to be much better off in two years . 
( For North Africans , however , that figure drops to only 10-15 % , which is unsurprising given the uncertainty generated by the region &apos;s recent political turmoil . ) 
Overall , consumers are increasing their spending across most retail categories . 
Up to 30 % of the more optimistic consumers in some countries say that they are shopping more frequently and purchasing new and more expensive products . 
This suggests that companies offering cheap , poor-quality , unbranded products are unlikely to succeed in the long term . 
For apparel consumers , for example , quality is second only to price when choosing a store , and second only to fashion when choosing a specific item . 
But quality and brand must be delivered at the right price . 
Even though Africans value brands and product quality , affordability remains crucial . 
To succeed , companies should work to reach consumers &quot; price points through a combination of product reengineering ( such as removing low-value-added features ) , smaller package sizes , and low-cost operating models . 
Moreover , timing is crucial when choosing where to play . 
Demand for consumer products typically follows an S-curve . 
At higher levels of income , markets become saturated and growth slows . 
Different products and categories enter the &quot; hot zone &quot; at different moments : those with low price points , such as snacks and beverages , typically take off relatively early ; beauty products somewhat later ; and luxury goods , such as branded fashion , later still . 
Not surprisingly , in most African markets , few categories have entered the slower-growth &quot; chill-out &quot; zone . 
This is where understanding opportunities at a city level is vital . 
Country-level planning and resource allocation is still the rule for most businesses operating in Africa , resulting in inefficient allocation of human and capital resources . 
By creating detailed profiles of the most promising urban opportunities , companies could target their investments more effectively . 
Identifying growth hot spots is only the start . 
Substantial differences among and within Africa &apos;s countries imply the need for a much deeper and finer-grained understanding of consumer preferences and affordability profiles by product category . 
Likewise , many markets are still in early stages of development , and must be built through concerted consumer education and trial . 
Here , Africa &apos;s youth merit special attention : the survey found that the 16-34 age group already accounts for 53 % of income in urban centers . 
Young people &apos;s consumption habits are quite different from their elders . &quot; 
They are more than twice as likely to search for information online and to seek products and stores that reflect the &quot; right image . &quot; 
They are also more educated , with 40 % of 16-24 year olds having completed high school , compared with only 27 % of the 45-and-older group . 
These characteristics point to a major change in African consumption habits as this cohort ages , its incomes increase , and its behaviors and decision criteria become the societal norm . 
Many companies - particularly multinational firms accustomed to old and aging populations in the advanced countries - will have to adapt accordingly .
