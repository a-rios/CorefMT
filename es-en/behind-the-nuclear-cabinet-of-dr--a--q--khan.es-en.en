Behind the Nuclear Cabinet of Dr. A. Q. Khan 
Most new revelations about Pakistan &apos;s nuclear scandal focus on the clandestine supply of uranium enrichment technology to Iran , North Korea , and Libya by the celebrated bomb-maker Dr. A. Q. Khan . 
But the documents that Libya turned over to the International Atomic Energy Agency , and subsequently to the US , show that Pakistan supplied more than just equipment for making bomb fuel . 
Dr. Khan allegedly also supplied a detailed nuclear weapon design that US experts say is of a 1964 Chinese vintage passed on to Pakistan two decades ago . 
This disclosure raises interesting new questions because Dr Khan was peripheral to actual weapons-related work . 
Pakistan &apos;s nuclear establishment has essentially two divisions . 
One , once headed by Dr. Khan , is responsible for producing bomb-grade uranium gas that , when converted to metal , provides the crucial fuel for a nuclear explosion . 
The other division , which falls under the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and the National Development Complex , has a much wider range of responsibilities - conversion of uranium gas to metal , weapons design and manufacture , and nuclear testing . 
Dr. Khan was barely mentioned by the head of the NDC , Dr. Samar Mubarakmand , in his victory speeches after the successful May 1998 nuclear tests . 
Thus the mystery : how could Dr. Khan - who had no need to possess weapons design information - have handed over detailed bomb design documents to Libya ? 
Dr. Khan &apos;s televised confession and acceptance of sole responsibility for proliferation activities has done nothing to reduced suspicion that there is more here than meets the eye , and of the Pakistani military &apos;s complicity in proliferation . 
Dr. Khan &apos;s export of centrifuge technology was unknown to successive governments in Pakistan , says the country &apos;s leader , General Pervez Musharraf . 
But for over a decade , Dr. Khan had openly advertised his nuclear wares . 
Year after year - ( 2003 includinged 2003 , when the proliferation controversy was already red-hot- ) Islamabad was festooned with colorful banners advertising workshops on &quot; Vibrations In Rapidly Rotating Machinery &quot; and &quot; Advanced Materials , &quot; sponsored by the Dr. A. Q. Khan Research Laboratories ( also known as the Kahuta Research Laboratories ) . 
These had obvious and immediate utility for centrifuge technology , essential for producing weaponsbomb-grade uranium . 
In earlier years , Dr. Khan and his collaborators published a number of papers detailing critical issues regarding the balancing of centrifuges and magnetic bearings . 
These dealt with technical means for enabling centrifuge rotors to spin close to the speed of sound without disintegrating , -essential for making bomb-grade uranium . 
Dr. Khan &apos;s proliferation activitiesIt could scarcely be more blatant . 
But to make it absolutely certain , Kahuta issued glossy brochures aimed at &quot; classified organizations . &quot; 
To protect itself , Pakistan &apos;s desperate military establishment , fearful of being labelled a proliferator and of ultimately being deprived of its nukes , has chosen to sacrifice Dr. Khan . 
Yet his public confession and apology are unlikely to end the matter . 
The US Intense is certain to apply intense pressureis certain to be applied by the US for on-site inspection and monitoring of Pakistani fissile material production at the enrichment facility at Kahuta , the plutonium production reactor at Khushab , and elsewhere . 
Although Pakistan will publicly resist this demand , it may secretly agree to allow installation of cameras and various sensing devices in these nuclear facilitiesinstallations . 
For the moment , the efforts of some Pakistani bomb-makers to peddle nuclear secrets appear to have been stymied . 
But , having invoked solidarity with Islamists all over the world , these expertsy have created a high demand for their skills . 
While it is inconceivable that any Muslim country will now ask Pakistan for nuclear weapons , non-state actors are clearly more enthusiastic . 
One recalls that two years ago , highly placed members of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission wanted to play atheir role in the jihad against America . 
In a fit of Islamic solidarity , they went to Afghanistan and met with Osama bin Laden and the Taliban . 
It is difficult to believe that they were the only ones so inclined . 
As a result , Pakistan &apos;s bomb-makers have seriously jeopardized the safety of their country . 
Imagine , for example , the horrific situation consequences ofarising from an atomic explosion in some American city . 
Blinded with grief and rage , the US would exact a terrible revenge . 
Mere suspicion might form the basis of action . 
It is possible that America would bomb Pakistan first - perhaps with nuclear weapons - and look later for justifications later . 
Iraq stands as a reminder of America &apos;s furious desire to avenge the terrorist attacks of September , 2001 and hurt punish even those unconnected with the perpetrators . 
The failure to subsequent non-discovereither y of weapons of mass destruction , or connections with Al-Qaeida , have both been shrugged off by George Bush and his neo-conservative cabal . 
It is time to give up the fantasy of an Islamic Bomb , and it is past the time to rein in Pakistan &apos;s rogue bomb-makers . 
Their illegitimate nuclear commerce has created a nightmare for the reputation , safety , and security of their country . 
It is difficult to know what Dr. Khan meant when he said he had acted in &quot; good faith . &quot; 
After all , what kind of faith allows putting instruments of mass murder on sale in the black market .
