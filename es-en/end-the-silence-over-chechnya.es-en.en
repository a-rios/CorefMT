End the Silence Over Chechnya 
It is extremely difficult for an honest observer to break through the closed doors that separate Chechnya from the rest of the world . 
Indeed , no one even knows how many civilian casualties there have been in ten years of war . 
According to estimates by non-governmental organizations , the figure is between 100,000 ( that is , one civilian out of ten ) and 300,000 ( one out of four ) . 
How many voters participated in the November 2005 elections ? 
Between 60 and 80 % , according to Russian authorities ; around 20 % , reckon independent observers . 
The blackout imposed on Chechnya prevents any precise assessment of the devastating effects of a ruthless conflict . 
But censorship cannot completely hide the horror . 
Under the world &apos;s very eyes , a capital - Grozny , with 400,000 inhabitants - has been razed for the first time since Hitler &apos;s 1944 punishment of Warsaw . 
Such inhumanity cannot plausibly be described as &quot; anti-terrorism , &quot; as Russian President Vladimir Putin insists . 
The Russian military leadership claims to be fighting against a party of 700 to 2,000 combatants . 
What would be said if the British government had bombed Belfast , or if the Spanish government bombed Bilbao , on the pretext of quelling the IRA or the ETA ? 
And yet the world remains silent in the face of the looting of Grozny and other Chechen towns and villages . 
Are Chechen women , children and all Chechen civilians less entitled to respect than the rest of mankind ? 
Are they still considered human ? 
Nothing can excuse the seeming indifference displayed by our worldwide silence . 
In Chechnya , our basic morality is at stake . 
Must the world accept the rape of girls who were kidnapped by the occupying forces or their militias ? 
Should we tolerate the murder of children and the abduction of boys to be tortured , broken , and sold back to their families , alive or dead ? 
What about &quot; filtration &quot; camps , or &quot; human firewood &quot; ? 
What about the villages exterminated to set an example ? 
A few NGO &apos;s and some brave Russian and Western reporters have witnessed countless crimes . 
So we cannot say &quot; we did not know . &quot; 
Indeed , the fundamental principle of democracies and civilized states is at issue in Chechnya : civilians &quot; right to life , including the protection of innocents , widows , and orphans . 
International agreements and the United Nations Charter are as binding in Chechnya as anywhere else . 
The right of nations to self-determination does not imply the right of rulers to dispose of their people . 
The fight against terrorism is also at stake . 
Who has not yet realized that the Russian army is actually behaving like a group of pyromaniac firefighters , fanning the fires of terrorism through its behavior ? 
After ten years of a large-scale repression , the fire , far from going out , is spreading , crossing borders , setting Northern Caucasus ablaze and making combatants even more fierce . 
How much longer can we ignore the fact that , in raising the bogeyman of &quot; Chechen terrorism , &quot; the Russian government is suppressing the liberties gained when the Soviet empire collapsed ? 
The Chechen war both masks and motivates the reestablishment of centralized power in Russia - bringing the media back under state control , passing laws against NGO &apos;s , and reinforcing the &quot; vertical line of power &quot; - leaving no institutions and authorities able to challenge or limit the Kremlin . 
War , it seems , is hiding a return to autocracy . 
Sadly , wars in Chechnya have been going on for 300 years . 
They were savage colonial conflicts under the Czar and almost genocidal under Stalin , who deported the whole Chechen population , a third of which perished during their transfer to the Gulag . 
Because we reject colonial and exterminating ventures , because we love Russian culture and believe that Russia can bloom in a democratic future , and because we believe that terrorism - whether by stateless groups or state armies Â­ - should be condemned , we demand that the world &apos;s blackout on the Chechen issue must end . 
We must help Russia &apos;s authorities escape from the trap they set for themselves and into which they fell , putting not only Chechens and Russians , but the world at risk . 
It would be tragic if , during the G8 summit scheduled for St. Petersburg , Russia , in June 2006 , the Chechen issue were pushed to the side . 
This dreadful and endless war needs to be discussed openly if it is to end peacefully .
