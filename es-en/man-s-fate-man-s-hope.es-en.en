Man &apos;s Fate / Man &apos;s Hope 
For quite a while now - certainly since the terrorist attacks on the US of September 11 , 2001 , and before as we watched the slaughters in Kosovo , Sarajevo , Srebrenica , Rwanda , and Congo on our televisions - the news has been dominated by war and rumors of war , by violent death and threats of violent death . 
Everyone , everywhere is keenly aware of the power of our weapons . 
From nuclear-tipped missiles down to trucks full of fertilizer or explosives worn as belts , we have used our technology to amplify greatly the dark parts of our nature as a violent - and not even a properly predatory - species . 
I certainly do not want to downplay or dismiss this side of humanity &apos;s history and our current events . 
I do not want anyone to forget that over less than half of the years contained in the past century - from the outbreak of World War I to the famine that followed Mao &apos;s &quot; Great Leap Forward &quot; - about one in every ten people alive on this planet was shot , gassed , stabbed , burned , or starved to death by his or her fellow human beings . 
But that is not the whole story . 
Indeed , the human abattoirs of the twentieth century - and even the slaughterhouses that various humans are preparing now - may not appear from the perspective of the future to be the most important part of our experience and condition , and of what our descendants will regard as their history . 
For them , the most important features of what our experience may instead be : 
· What UN demographers foresee as the end of the population explosion : the halting of the growth of the human population at ten billion or so around the middle of this century ; 
· The coming of a truly humane world as the numbers of those engaged in subsistence agriculture , or those whose wages are kept at subsistence-agriculture levels by labor market pressure from those who have migrated from the countryside into teeming cities , fall to a small fraction of human populations . 
For most of the twentieth century , large chunks of the world remained desperately poor for one or more of four related reasons : ( 1 ) criminal misgovernment ; ( 2 ) lack of the machines to do anything useful and productive in the world economy besides subsistence agriculture and unskilled service work ; ( 3 ) lack of the public education system needed to give people the literacy and the skills to operate the machines ; and ( 4 ) barriers ( legal and physical ) that kept people where demand was low from selling the products of their work where demand was high . 
But over the course of the late twentieth century , these four causes of desperate poverty have largely fallen away . 
Governments as bad as Kim Jong-Il &apos;s in North Korea are now extremely rare . 
Nearly all countries in the world are at most one generation away from near-universal literacy . 
The fast pace of technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention and innovation that is open to every place that can send someone away to get a master &apos;s degree in engineering . 
Most important , the barriers to making goods and services in Mauritius , Mozambique , or Mauritania and selling them in New York or Berlin , Santiago or Tokyo are dropping swiftly . 
The gargantuan container ships that first appeared a generation ago brought one revolution to world trade . 
The use of information technology to manage transportation and distribution channels is likely to have a similarly profound effect . 
Moreover , the advent of the Internet and the fiber-optic cable will do as much to make service-sector work internationally tradable as the coming of the iron-hulled steamship a century and a half ago did to make bulk agricultural products and manufactures internationally tradable . 
It will take at least a generation for these changes to make themselves felt in most corners of the world . 
But inside the industrial core of the world &apos;s rich countries there is already concern about these looming revolutions . 
Indeed , this concern will only become sharper and stronger , as citizens in rich countries fear that as the remaining barriers to international trade fall , industrial-core income distributions , social orders , and politics will be shaken to their foundations . 
For the world as a whole , however , the next two generations are ones that will bring an extraordinary opportunity for economic growth and world prosperity . 
Perhaps at the end of history there is a pot of gold , after all .
