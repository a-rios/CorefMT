The New Age Divide 
LONDON - So what does 2009 hold in store for us ? 
As ever , the unpredictable - a terrorist atrocity or a rash decision by a national leader - will take its toll . 
But much of what happens tomorrow will be a result of history . 
In the last century , the world &apos;s population increased four-fold , and the number of people living in cities thirteen-fold . 
The world &apos;s output grew by a factor of forty , water use by nine , energy use by thirteen , and the emission of carbon dioxide by seventeen . 
The twenty-first century has to live with the consequences of all that , good and bad . 
Some of the factors that will shape our lives appear to tug in different directions . 
The age profiles of our societies are changing dramatically . 
Asia and Europe have experienced sharp falls in fertility rates . 
The figures in Hong Kong , Singapore , and South Korea are even more remarkable than those in Catholic European countries like Spain , Italy , and Poland . 
At the same time , people are living longer , so that in a generation the number of elderly dependents in some countries will outgrow that of the young . 
We have been accustomed to societies with a demographic structure that resembles a pyramid - a broad youth base tapering to an elderly tip . 
But now the structure is more like the profile of a skyscraper , more or less the same from top to bottom . 
Our older populations have to cope with ever younger technology . 
Many students today are being prepared for jobs that do not yet exist . 
Moreover , some sorts of knowledge can rapidly become redundant . 
Indeed , half of what a student learns in the first year of a four-year technical course will be out of date by the third year . 
Change itself accelerates . 
Its benefits and its disadvantages penetrate more deeply . 
Every month there are 31 billion searches on Google . 
It took radio 38 years to reach an audience of 50 million . 
Facebook did that in two years . 
We usually reckon that it is easier for young , unformed minds to handle changes like these . 
How does someone like me , at university in the early 1960 &quot; s , adapt and cope ? 
How will older societies manage new technology and remain dynamic ? 
The biggest challenge for all of us , young and old , next year and for the indefinite future , will result from a different sort of change that is unlikely to respond simply to technological determinism . 
It results from the way we have been living for two centuries . 
2009 is supposed to see the conclusion of an agreement on global warming and climate change to succeed and build on the Kyoto Protocol . 
Copenhagen is the venue for the meeting . 
Pessimists note that our mounting economic woes around the world are being used as an excuse for inaction on cuts in carbon emissions . 
But continuing to use energy inefficiently will not mitigate the painful effects of the global economic crisis . 
If we make today &apos;s problems the excuse for failure to save the environment , we will simply pile up much bigger - and potentially catastrophic - problems tomorrow . 
China , the biggest of the emerging economies , clearly understands this . 
Whether India does as well seems to me rather more doubtful . 
China faces its own environmental dangers , for example , water stress . 
It does not want to see its industries outdated and uncompetitive . 
China will work for a global consensus on climate change . 
The big question is whether it will be able to impose tougher environmental standards throughout the whole country . 
For America , the problem is also mainly one of domestic politics . There will be no worthwhile American offer on the environment until there is a deal in Congress . 
This year &apos;s task may be to reach a global understanding in Copenhagen that is not too prescriptive , but which is more than aspirational and into which an American domestic political agreement can be incorporated once Obama achieves it . 
But all of this sensitive diplomacy could be wrecked if , in response to rising unemployment , there is an outbreak of trade protectionism involving America , Europe , and China . 
That is when the economic and environmental agendas could fatally collide . 
So young and old alike should hold onto their hats in the exciting but dangerous years ahead . 
All of us must hope that the first Internet-generation American President can lead his own country and the rest of humanity into a safer and more sustainably prosperous future .
