A Sustainable Housing Recovery ? 
NEW HAVEN - Volatility in the housing market has long been known , but until now it has never been visible in so many places around the world at the same time . 
Indeed , the year 2009 might even be a milestone marking a new era of volatility . 
Since 2000 , we have seen the most dramatic evidence ever of speculative bubbles in markets for owner-occupied homes . 
Home prices exploded after 2000 in North America , Europe , and Asia , and in many isolated places elsewhere in the world . 
Markets peaked in 2007 , and then fell sharply in many of these places with the onset of the global financial crisis . 
Surprisingly , prices rebounded in some places in 2009 . 
It seems the story never ends . 
In the United States , the S P / Case-Shiller 10-City Home Price Index recorded the biggest turnaround since the index began in 1987 , rising 5 % ( a 15 % annual rate ) from April to August 2009 , after having fallen 7 % ( a 21 % annual rate ) in the four months from December 2008 to March 2009 . 
Recent increases in home prices have also been seen in Australia , the United Kingdom , Hong Kong , Korea , Singapore , and Sweden , and optimistic talk is heard in still more places . 
Housing prices are on a rollercoaster ride , and we may never be able to make complete sense of their movements , other than to understand the volatility that they represent . 
Indeed , in a volatile speculative market , where people buy and sell in anticipation of further price movements , history confirms that price movements will be hard to explain , even after the fact . 
They reflect changing investor psychology , which is hard to discern , and new information , which may still be amorphous and ambiguous . 
This surge in volatility appears to reflect a new and different attitude toward homes as an asset - an attitude that has spread around much of the world . 
We used to think that homes were in the same category as automobiles : depreciating assets that grow obsolete over time , are costly to maintain , and go out of style , eventually to be scrapped and replaced . 
Now we think of them as claims on increasingly scarce resources in a rapidly growing world , with prices potentially skyrocketing any day . 
It used to be commonly thought that a home &apos;s value consists primarily in the structure , not in the land on which it sits . 
This should be increasingly true as high-rise condominiums become more common . 
In some cases 100 homes can , in effect , be stacked on one another . 
With such intensive use of land , our land constraints for housing construction are vanishingly small . 
This long-term trend towards multifamily housing may be expected to continue , further diminishing the importance of land to home values . 
But the recent speculative bubbles have in effect boosted the percentage of land value in home value . 
Although much of this was temporary , we now tend to think of homes as land rather than structures . 
Economists usually compute urban land value by subtracting the estimated construction cost of the home from the home price , so that land value is inferred as a residual . 
Economists do this because in most places direct sales of vacant urban land are rare , and often involve unusual places or unusual circumstances , that make such sales unrepresentative of land values underneath homes . 
Thus , the bubble component in home prices is attributed to a surge in land prices , even though land prices outside of bubbly urban areas are vastly lower . 
Many people appear to believe that upswings in home prices reflect increasing scarcity of land in a world constrained by rapid economic growth and severe resource constraints ( symbolized by the fear of global warming ) . 
They view the recent collapse of the housing bubble as merely the effect of a temporary financial crisis , which governments around the world seem to be confronting aggressively . 
Such thinking may be playing a part in the recent rebound of home prices . 
But in fact , it is probably more accurate to think of the ups and downs of the world &apos;s housing markets as a reflection of the change in our thinking about housing as an investment . 
If so , the volatility in home prices after 2000 was the result of faulty thinking , not of the natural effects of global economic growth , which has occurred at a relatively smooth rate for decades now . 
Faulty thinking , in turn , encouraged loose practices by mortgage lenders , and led central banks to take no action against housing bubbles as they developed . 
In many countries , governments in 2009 responded to the collapse of housing bubbles by instituting policies aimed at supporting these speculative markets . 
The result , however , has been to lead people to add another , political , component to their assessment of home prices , unhinging them further from economic fundamentals . 
A basic fact is often forgotten : the modern construction industry is quite capable of building vast numbers of fine modern homes , including units in high-rise buildings , at costs far below the prices of homes in many urban areas today . 
This should put a break on long-run escalation of home prices . 
Housing speculators seem often to be betting on the political equilibrium that restricts the supply of housing , and on the indefinite continuation of the artificial supports started during this financial crisis . 
But , in a newly global economy , with increasing interregional and international population flows and widespread commitment to economic freedom , it is very hard for governments to restrict supply in the long run . 
That is why it appears safer to predict high volatility in 2010 than to predict that home prices will rise .
