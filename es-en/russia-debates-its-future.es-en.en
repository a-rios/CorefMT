Russia Debates Its Future 
YAROSLAVL - Russia is said by many to lack a &quot; civil society . &quot; 
But it partly makes up for this by having a rather interesting public sphere , in which serious topics do get debated , and where glimpses of the great are not entirely confined to televised snippets . 
The first fortnight in September saw successive meetings of two major Russian political groups , the Valdai Discussion Club and the Global Policy Forum . 
The first was on a boat and ended with dinner with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at Sochi on the Black Sea . 
The second , in Yaroslavl , culminated in a symposium with President Dmitri Medvedev . 
Scholars , think-tankers , and journalists ( both Russian and foreign ) joined political and business leaders to discuss Russia &apos;s future . 
Three things made these events unusual in a typically Russian way . 
The first was the intense media interest . 
Indeed , even the most camera-shy academic can suddenly find himself a TV star in Russia . 
Second was the willingness of both Putin and Medvedev to engage publicly with experts on the experts &quot; own intellectual turf . 
The only recent Western political leader I can think of who had the confidence to do this was Bill Clinton . 
Finally , the two events saw the emergence of two rival political courts , each exuding the faint but unmistakable odor of a looming conflict . 
For those with eyes to see , the two conferences presented a fascinating glimpse of a crumbling diarchy . 
The main theme of the Valdai conference concerned whether Russia &apos;s history and geography doomed it to authoritarian rule . 
If democracy was the wave of the future , was Russia destined to miss out ? 
The pessimists - mainly Russian historians - claimed that Russia would find it difficult , if not impossible , to overcome its legacy of autocracy . 
One of them argued that , in Russia , autocracy rises constantly from the ashes , like a Phoenix , sustained by Russians &quot; passivity and endurance . 
The Bolsheviks inherited the autocracy of the Czars ; 
Putin rediscovered the old monarchical principle of anointing his successor , bypassing democratic competition for the presidency . 
Some radicals in Russia have rejected this historical determinism , arguing that we should not legitimize authoritarianism by reference to history . 
Protests were growing . 
It was Putin &apos;s yoke , not history &apos;s , which lay heavily on Russia . 
Much of this discussion lacked clarity , as such discussions tend to do . 
Most participants failed to distinguish between history as a constraint and history as a determinant . 
No country , or civilization , can entirely transcend its history : but each history offers many different possibilities . 
Countries are not genetically programmed like animals . 
The discussion about autocracy was inevitably bound up with others . 
Autocracy has been defended in Russia as necessary for empire . 
But this leads to another question : is empire necessary for Russia ? 
Can Russia renounce its imperial past and accept ordinary relations with newly independent neighbors like Ukraine and Georgia ? 
Can it , in fact , be an &quot; ordinary &quot; or &quot; normal &quot; player on the world stage ? 
At the Yaroslavl meeting with Medvedev , attention shifted to the connection between democracy and modernization . 
Everyone agreed that Russia must diversify its economy away from reliance on energy . 
As Medvedev pointed out , a raw materials-based economy is always vulnerable to volatile commodity prices . 
But there were two broad views about the relationship between political and economic modernization . 
Putin &apos;s view is that democracy results from a modern economy , a kind of reward for hard work . 
If the state pushes modernization from the top , democracy will grow naturally , if slowly , as a result of rising prosperity and a growing middle class . 
The Kremlin &apos;s chief ideologist , Vladislav Surkov , has suggested that full democracy presupposes &quot; democracy in the head , &quot; implying that this desirable mental condition was still a long way off in Russia . 
The alternative view , championed by people such as Igor Yurgens , head of Medvedev &apos;s favorite think tank , The Institute of Contemporary Development , is that democracy is the precondition for economic modernization . 
Their argument is that the Russian state , as now constituted , lacks any real incentive to reform its own - or Russians &quot; - bad economic habits . 
The record bears this out . 
Russia has staged a modest recovery from the recession . 
But there is almost no innovation , the elites are happy to live comfortably off energy rents , and corruption continues unchecked . 
Putin is the strong leader of a weak state , which , lacking a mobilizing or feedback mechanism , is incapable of carrying out a modernizing project . 
There is a clear rift between Putin and Medvedev . 
Medvedev is far from being Putin &apos;s puppet . 
They both believe that democracy must come sooner or later , but Putin &apos;s emphasis is very much on later , whereas Medvedev has added a liberalizing voice to Russia &apos;s public discourse . 
Cynics say that this is simply a deceptive &quot; good cop-bad cop &quot; routine . 
But words matter , and new rhetoric is a political force in its own right . 
Moreover , Medvedev &apos;s main strategic goal must be to secure a second term as president . 
He cannot openly challenge Putin &apos;s legacy , but he has to position himself as reaching beyond Putin . 
It is a difficult balancing act , because Putin can always reclaim the presidency if he believes that his erstwhile protégé wants to dismantle the authoritarian state he has created . 
Nineteen years after the fall of Communism , Russia &apos;s direction remains as unclear as ever . 
This matters chiefly to Russians , but , because Russia straddles the vast Eurasian land mass , lack of clarity about its future imposes a permanent fearfulness on the rest of us . 
Is Russia part of the West ? 
Does its history and geography give it a distinctive Eurasian outlook capable of mediating a potential clash between Western and Eastern civilizations , or between Christianity and Islam ? 
Russia does not fit neatly into geopolitical categories , but remains too important to be ignored .
