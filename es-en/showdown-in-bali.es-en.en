Showdown in Bali 
BALI - This month &apos;s international meeting in Bali will set a framework that will attempt to prevent the impending disaster of global warming / climate change . 
There is now little doubt that greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide , are leading to significant changes in climate . 
Nor is there doubt that these changes will impose huge costs . 
The question is no longer whether we can afford to do something , but rather how to control emissions in an equitable and effective way . 
The Kyoto Protocol was a major achievement , yet it left out 75 % of the sources of emissions : the US , the largest polluter , refused to sign . 
( With Australia &apos;s new government now having signed the Protocol , America is now the sole holdout among the advanced industrial countries . ) 
No requirements were put on developing countries , yet within the not-too-distant future , they will contribute half or more of emissions . 
The US and China are in a race to be the world &apos;s worst polluter ; 
America has long won the contest , but in the next few years , China will claim that dubious honor . 
But Indonesia is number three , owing to its rapid deforestation . 
One concrete action that should be taken at Bali is support for the initiative of the Rainforest Coalition , a group of developing countries that want help to maintain their forests . 
These countries are providing environmental services for which they have not been compensated . 
They need the resources , and the incentives , to maintain their forests . 
The global benefits of supporting them far outweigh the costs . 
The timing of the conference is not propitious . 
George W. Bush , long a skeptic about global warming , and long committed to undermining multilateralism , remains America &apos;s president . 
His close connections with the oil industry make him loathe to force it to pay for its pollution . 
Still , the Bali meeting &apos;s participants can agree on a few principles to guide future negotiations . 
These include , first , that solutions to global warming require the participation of all countries . 
Second , there can be no free riders , so trade sanctions - the only effective sanctions that the international community currently has - can and should be imposed on those not going along . 
Third , the problem of global warming is so vast that every instrument must be employed . 
Better incentives must be part of the solution . 
The problem with the Kyoto system is assigning caps that will be acceptable to developed and developing countries . 
Giving emission allowances is like giving away money - potentially hundreds of billions of dollars . 
Kyoto &apos;s underlying principle - that countries that emitted more in 1990 are allowed to emit more in the future - is unacceptable to developing countries , as is granting greater emission rights to countries with a higher GDP . 
The only principle that has some ethical basis is equal emission rights per capita ( with some adjustments - for instance , the US has already used up its share of the global atmosphere , so it should have fewer emission allowances ) . 
But adopting this principle would entail such huge payments from developed countries to developing countries , that , regrettably , the former are unlikely to accept it . 
Economic efficiency requires that those who generate emissions pay the cost , and the simplest way of forcing them to do so is through a carbon tax . 
There could be an international agreement that every country would impose a carbon tax at an agreed rate ( reflecting the global social cost ) . 
Indeed , it makes far more sense to tax bad things , like pollution , than to tax good things like work and savings . 
Such a tax would increase global efficiency . 
Of course , polluting industries like the cap-and-trade system . 
While it provides them an incentive not to pollute , emission allowances offset much of what they would have to pay under a tax system . 
Some firms can even make money off the deal . 
Moreover , Europe has grown used to the concept of cap-and-trade , and many are loathe to try an alternative . 
Yet , no one has proposed an acceptable set of principles for assigning emission rights . 
For some , this is not a concern . 
With developing countries standing to lose even more than developed countries if nothing is done about global warming , many believe they can be cajoled , threatened , or induced to be part of a global agreement . 
Developed countries need only figure out the minimum price they have to pay developing countries to go along . 
But developing countries worry that a new global agreement on emissions , like so many other international agreements , will leave them in a disadvantageous position . 
In the end , Realpolitik may rule . 
Flourishing democracies in many developing countries mean that their citizens demand fair treatment . 
Principles do matter . 
The Bali meeting &apos;s participants should bear this in mind : global warming is too important to be held hostage to another attempt at squeezing the poor .
