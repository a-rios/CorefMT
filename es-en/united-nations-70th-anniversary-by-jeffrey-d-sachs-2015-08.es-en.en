The UN at 70 
NEW YORK -The United Nations will mark its 70th anniversary when world leaders assemble next month at its headquarters in New York . 
Though there will be plenty of fanfare , it will inadequately reflect the UN &apos;s value , not only as the most important political innovation of the twentieth century , but also as the best bargain on the planet . 
But if the UN is to continue to fulfill its unique and vital global role in the twenty-first century , it must be upgraded in three key ways . 
Fortunately , there is plenty to motivate world leaders to do what it takes . 
Indeed , the UN has had two major recent triumphs , with two more on the way before the end of this year . 
The first triumph is the nuclear agreement with Iran . 
Sometimes misinterpreted as an agreement between Iran and the United States , the accord is in fact between Iran and the UN , represented by the five permanent members of the Security Council ( China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the US ) , plus Germany . 
An Iranian diplomat , in explaining why his country will scrupulously honor the agreement , made the point vividly : &quot; Do you really think that Iran would dare to cheat on the very five UN Security Council permanent members that can seal our country &apos;s fate ? &quot; 
The second big triumph is the successful conclusion , after 15 years , of the Millennium Development Goals , which have underpinned the largest , longest , and most effective global poverty-reduction effort ever undertaken . 
Two UN Secretaries-General have overseen the MDGs : Kofi Annan , who introduced them in 2000 , and Ban Ki-moon , who , since succeeding Annan at the start of 2007 , has led vigorously and effectively to achieve them . 
The MDGs have engendered impressive progress in poverty reduction , public health , school enrollment , gender equality in education , and other areas . 
Since 1990 ( the reference date for the targets ) , the global rate of extreme poverty has been reduced by well over half - more than fulfilling the agenda &apos;s number one goal . 
Inspired by the MDGs &quot; success , the UN &apos;s member countries are set to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) - which will aim to end extreme poverty in all its forms everywhere , narrow inequalities , and ensure environmental sustainability by 2030 - next month . 
This , the UN &apos;s third triumph of 2015 , could help to bring about the fourth : a global agreement on climate control , under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , in Paris in December . 
The precise value of the peace , poverty reduction , and environmental cooperation made possible by the UN is incalculable . 
If we were to put it in monetary terms , however , we might estimate their value at trillions of dollars per year - at least a few percent of the world economy &apos;s annual GDP of $ 100 trillion . 
Yet spending on all UN bodies and activities - from the Secretariat and the Security Council to peacekeeping operations , emergency responses to epidemics , and humanitarian operations for natural disasters , famines , and refugees - totaled roughly $ 45 billion in 2013 , roughly $ 6 per person on the planet . 
That is not just a bargain ; it is a significant underinvestment . 
Given the rapidly growing need for global cooperation , the UN simply cannot get by on its current budget . 
Given this , the first reform that I would suggest is an increase in funding , with high-income countries contributing at least $ 40 per capita annually , upper middle-income countries giving $ 8 , lower-middle-income countries $ 2 , and low-income countries $ 1 . 
With these contributions - which amount to roughly 0.1 % of the group &apos;s average per capita income - the UN would have about $ 75 billion annually with which to strengthen the quality and reach of vital programs , beginning with those needed to achieve the SDGs . 
Once the world is on a robust path to achieve the SDGs , the need for , say , peacekeeping and emergency-relief operations should decline as conflicts diminish in number and scale , and natural disasters are better prevented or anticipated . 
This brings us to the second major area of reform : ensuring that the UN is fit for the new age of sustainable development . 
Specifically , the UN needs to strengthen its expertise in areas such as ocean health , renewable energy systems , urban design , disease control , technological innovation , public-private partnerships , and peaceful cultural cooperation . 
Some UN programs should be merged or closed , while other new SDG-related UN programs should be created . 
The third major reform imperative is the UN &apos;s governance , starting with the Security Council , the composition of which no longer reflects global geopolitical realities . 
Indeed , the Western Europe and Other Group ( WEOG ) now accounts for three of the five permanent members ( France , the United Kingdom , and the US ) . 
That leaves only one permanent position for the Eastern European Group ( Russia ) , one for the Asia-Pacific Group ( China ) , and none for Africa or Latin America . 
The rotating seats on the Security Council do not adequately restore regional balance . 
Even with two of the ten rotating Security Council seats , the Asia-Pacific region is still massively under-represented . 
The Asia-Pacific region accounts for roughly 55 % of the world &apos;s population and 44 % of its annual income but has just 20 % ( three out of 15 ) of the seats on the Security Council . 
Asia &apos;s inadequate representation poses a serious threat to the UN &apos;s legitimacy , which will only increase as the world &apos;s most dynamic and populous region assumes an increasingly important global role . 
One possible way to resolve the problem would be to add at least four Asian seats : one permanent seat for India , one shared by Japan and South Korea ( perhaps in a two-year , one-year rotation ) , one for the ASEAN countries ( representing the group as a single constituency ) , and a fourth rotating among the other Asian countries . 
As the UN enters its eighth decade , it continues to inspire humanity . 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains the world &apos;s moral charter , and the SDGs promise to provide new guideposts for global development cooperation . 
Yet the UN &apos;s ability to continue to fulfill its vast potential in a new and challenging century requires its member states to commit to support the organization with the resources , political backing , and reforms that this new era demands .
