The Perverse Politics of Financial Crisis 
CHICAGO - In trying to understand the pattern and timing of government interventions during a financial crisis , we should probably conclude that , to paraphrase the French philosopher Blaise Pascal , politics have incentives that economics cannot understand . 
From an economic point of view , the problem is simple . 
When a sovereign borrower &apos;s solvency has deteriorated sufficiently , its survival becomes dependent on market expectations . 
If everybody expects Italy to be solvent , they will lend to Italy at a low interest rate . 
Italy will be able to meet its current obligations , and most likely its future obligations as well . 
But if many people start to doubt Italy &apos;s solvency and require a large premium to lend , the country &apos;s fiscal deficit will worsen , and it will most likely default . 
Whether a borrower like Italy ends up in the lap of good expectations or tumbles into a nightmare scenario often depends upon some &quot; coordinating news . &quot; 
If everyone expects that a credit-rating downgrade will make Italian debt unsustainable , Italy will indeed default after a downgrade , regardless of the downgrade &apos;s real economic effects . 
This is the curse of what we economists call multiple equilibria : once I expect others to run for the exit , it is optimal for me to run as well ; but if everybody stays put , I have no interest in running . 
Given this economic dynamic , there seem to be two obvious policy prescriptions . 
First , it is too dangerous for any country to come even remotely close to the point where insolvency can be triggered by a sunspot . 
While nobody knows exactly what this danger level is , it is clear where the alarm starts to arise . 
Given the enormous cost of a default , any government should stay far away from the danger zone . 
The second prescription assumes that if , for any reason , a country does end up in the danger zone , only two responses make economic sense . 
Either officials recognize immediately the inevitability of default and waste no resources trying to prevent it , or they believe that a default can be avoided and deploy all the resources at their disposal as fast as possible . 
As in many wars , a staged escalation in a financial crisis often leads to the worst possible outcome : a defeat with large losses . 
That , unfortunately , is story of the American authorities &quot; intervention during the 2008 financial crisis . 
After the collapse of Bear Stearns , it was clear that more problems were coming , yet the United States government did nothing . 
In July 2008 , when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( the government-backed housing-loan agencies ) were found to be insolvent , then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson promised a &quot; bazooka , &quot; but delivered what turned out to be a slingshot . 
It was only after Lehman Brothers collapsed that Paulson went to Congress seeking $ 700 billion to stabilize the financial system . 
Even that turned out to be insufficient . 
The same travesty appears to be playing out in Europe . 
If European officials thought Greece needed to be saved , an immediate European intervention in favor of Greece would have minimized the resources required . 
If they thought Greece needed to go bankrupt , an immediate decision to that effect would have minimized the cost as well . 
Now we are already at the second rung of intervention , and there seems to be no end in sight . 
In the meantime , Italy is sinking . 
One could argue that politicians behave this way because they do not understand the economic nature of crises . 
I disagree . 
I think that what leads them to behave this way is not lack of knowledge , but perverse incentives . 
First of all , even for someone with the best incentives , it is difficult to choose a smaller cost that must be paid now over a larger cost that might fall due in the future . 
For an elected politician who is unlikely to be in office ( or even alive ) when the bigger costs materialize , the choice is clear . 
That is why countries build up debt levels that put them in the danger zone . 
Second , there is no political reward for fighting a preventive war , while there is great political capital to be earned by acting after problems have exploded . 
Had Franklin Roosevelt succeeded in preventing the Pearl Harbor attack with a preemptive strike against Japan , we would still be discussing whether war with Japan was inevitable . 
Roosevelt waited to act until after the catastrophe , and he has been revered as a savior . 
To act , politicians need consensus , which often does not emerge until the costs of inaction have become highly visible . 
By that point , it is often too late to avoid a much worse outcome . 
These incentives are present in all democracies . 
They cannot be eliminated , but they can be tempered . 
The European Stability and Growth Pact was an effort to accomplish exactly that - by creating incentives for eurozone countries to steer clear of the danger zone for debt . 
Unfortunately , the pact failed miserably . 
But if the euro is to survive - and if other countries are to avoid sovereign-debt crises of their own - we still need politician-proof rules .
