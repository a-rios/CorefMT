Money for Nothing 
COPENHAGEN - When it comes to global warming , we have plenty of hot rhetoric but very little cool reason . 
This matters immensely , because the Kyoto Protocol is already among the most expensive global public policies ever enacted , and the follow-up in Copenhagen in late 2009 promises to break all records . 
We better get it right , but right now we &apos;re more likely to pay for virtually nothing . 
A good example is the European Union &apos;s newly instituted policy of cutting CO2 emissions by 20 % by 2020 . 
Of course , it is always easier to promise than to deliver - a concern that is especially relevant in the EU . 
Yet , even if the promise is kept , will the benefit outweigh the cost ? 
Curiously , but not surprisingly , this is not discussed very much . 
A 20 % reduction in the EU &apos;s CO2 emissions , vigorously enforced throughout this century , would merely postpone temperature increases due to global warming by two years at the end of the century , from 2100 to 2102 - a negligible change . 
Yet the cost would be anything but negligible . 
The EU &apos;s own estimate is about € 60 billion annually , which is almost certainly a vast underestimate ( its previous estimate was almost twice as much ) , since it requires the EU to make the reductions in the smartest way possible . 
However , the EU doesn &apos;t just want to cut emissions in the smartest possible way , but also to increase the share of renewable energy in the Union by 20 % by 2020 . 
This increase has no separate climate effect , since we &apos;ve already promised to cut emissions by 20 % . 
However , it does manage to make a poor policy decision dramatically worse . 
The debate in my native Denmark is instructive , as the relevant government ministries have outlined what this decision will end up costing here , which in turn suggests the total cost for the EU . 
The annual cost of an increase in renewable energy of less than 20 % ( 18 percentage points ) - and five years later , by 2025 - will be more than € 2.5 billion . 
And the benefit ? 
If Denmark sticks to this decision throughout the rest of this century , it will spend more than € 200 billion to postpone global warming by five days . 
Is that a sensible decision ? 
The total advantage to the world ( measured according to all relevant criteria , such as lives saved , agricultural production increased , wetlands preserved , etc . ) from Denmark &apos;s policy would be about € 11 million . 
To put this in perspective , € 2.5 billion could double the number of hospitals in Denmark . 
People in the affected countries would live much better and become more productive , benefiting their children and grandchildren in 2100 . 
The last € 500 million could fund an eight-fold increase in research and development aimed at improving CO2-efficient energy technologies , enabling everyone in the long run to reduce emissions much more dramatically , and at much lower cost . 
So , should we halve malaria while dramatically increasing the possibility of solving global warming in the medium term ? 
Or should we make a pledge that does 2,000 times less good and barely alters the global climate ? 
It gets worse . 
The € 2.5 billion estimate assumes that politicians pick the cheapest renewable energy alternative . 
Yet Danish politicians seem intent on choosing much more expensive solutions , implying a two-fold ( or more ) increase in cost . 
The opposition - trying to trump the government - insists on an almost 40 % increase in renewable energy , at a cost of almost € 10 billion annually , with every euro doing just € 0.025 worth of good for the world . 
Using the Danish figures to calculate EU-wide costs , the total is likely to be more than € 150 billion annually , with every euro doing just half a cent worth of good . 
The same money could triple the global development aid budget . 
It could easily provide clean drinking water , sanitation , education , and health care to every human being on the planet , while increasing CO2-reducing R D ten-fold . 
The EU &apos;s goal of a 20 % reduction by 2020 is an incredibly expensive way to signal good intentions . But wouldn &apos;t we rather do real good ? 
The EU believes it is showing the way , but if the world follows the Union , it seems that we are more likely simply to become lost .
