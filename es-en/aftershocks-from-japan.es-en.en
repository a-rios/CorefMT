Aftershocks from Japan 
NEW HAVEN - The devastation - both human and physical - from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan is unfathomable . 
It is impossible at this point to gauge the full extent of the damage with any degree of precision . 
The narrow view of the catastrophe &apos;s economic impact is that Japan doesn &apos;t really matter anymore . 
After all , more than 20 years of unusually sluggish trend growth in Japanese output has sharply reduced its incremental impact on the broader global economy . 
The disaster may produce some disproportionate supply-chain effects in autos and information-technology product lines such as flash drives , but any such disruptions would tend to be transitory . 
On the surface , the world &apos;s two largest economies have little to fear . 
Japan accounts for only 5 % of America &apos;s exports and 8 % of China &apos;s . 
Under the worst-case outcome of a complete disruption to the Japanese economy , the direct repercussions on the United States and Chinese economies would be small - shaving no more than a few tenths of a percentage point off their annual growth rates . 
Within the so-called G-10 developed economies , Australia has the largest direct exposure to Japan - the destination of about 19 % of its total exports . 
The eurozone is at the opposite end of the spectrum , with Japan accounting for less than 2 % of its exports . 
Among emerging-markets , the Philippines and Indonesia are the most exposed to Japan , which absorbs about 16 % of their total exports . 
South Korea , the third-largest economy in East Asia , is at the other end of the scale , relying on Japanese demand for only about 6 % of its exports . 
But the narrow view misses the most critical consideration : this &quot; Japan shock &quot; has not occurred at a time of great economic strength . 
That is true not only of Japan itself , where two lost decades have left a once-vigorous economy on a less-than-1 % growth trajectory since the early 1990 &quot; s . 
Moreover , the Japan shock is not the only negative factor at work today . 
The impacts of sharply rising oil prices and ongoing sovereign debt problems in Europe are also very worrisome . 
While each of these shocks may not qualify as the proverbial tipping point , the combination and the context are disconcerting , to say the least . 
Context is vital . 
Notwithstanding the euphoric resurgence of global equity markets over the past two years , the world economy remains fragile . 
What markets seem to have forgotten is that post-bubble , post-financial-crisis recoveries tend to be anemic . 
Economies grow at something much closer to their stall speeds , thus lacking the cyclical &quot; escape velocity &quot; required for a self-sustaining recovery . 
As a result , post-crisis economies are far more vulnerable to shocks and prone to relapses than might otherwise be the case . 
Alas , there is an added complication that makes today &apos;s shocks all the more vexing : governments and central banks have exhausted the traditional ammunition upon which they have long relied during times of economic duress . 
That is true of both monetary and fiscal policy - the two mainstays of modern countercyclical stabilization . 
Policy interest rates are close to zero in the major economies in the developed world , and outsize budget deficits are the norm . 
As a result , unconventional - and untested - policies , such as so-called &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; have become the rage among central bankers . 
All along , such unconventional policies were viewed as a temporary fix . 
The hope was that policy settings soon would return to pre-crisis norms . 
Just as it is next to impossible to take a critically ill patient off life-support treatment , it is equally difficult to wean post-bubble economies from their now steady dose of liquidity injections and deficit spending . 
In an era of extraordinarily high unemployment , political pressures only compound the problem . 
This raises perhaps the most troublesome concern of all : with a post-crisis world getting hit by one shock after another , and with central banks having no latitude to cut interest rates , it is not hard to envision a scenario of open-ended monetary expansion that ends in tears . 
The dreaded inflationary endgame suddenly looms as a very real possibility . 
None of this detracts from the resilience factor . 
Yes , Japan will rebuild , which will undoubtedly spur some type of recovery in its disaster-battered economy . 
That happened in the aftermath of the Hanshin ( Kobe ) earthquake in 1995 , and it will happen this time as well . 
But , just as the post-Kobe rebuilding did little to end the first of Japan &apos;s lost decades , a similar outcome can be expected this time . 
The upside of rebuilding - beyond the urgent restoration of normal life for thousands of people - is only a temporary palliative for an impaired economy . 
That &apos;s only one of the lessons that Japan offers the rest of us . 
The Japanese economy has , in fact , been on the leading edge of many of the more serious problems that have afflicted the global economy in recent years . 
From asset bubbles and a dysfunctional financial system to currency suppression and monetary-policy blunders , Japan has been in many respects the laboratory of our future . 
Unfortunately , the world has failed to learn the lessons of Japan . 
The significance of the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 is not the relatively low magnitude of Japan &apos;s direct impact on the broader global economy . 
The more meaningful message is how these shocks box the rest of us into an even tighter corner .
