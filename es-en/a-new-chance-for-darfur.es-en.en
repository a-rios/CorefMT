A New Chance for Darfur 
NEW BRUNSWICK , NEW JERSEY - As the crisis in Sudan &apos;s Darfur region worsens and negotiaitions to end it drag on , an international consensus is emerging around a &quot; muscular &quot; policy based on public denunciation , severe economic sanctions , and , increasingly , threats of military force . 
But none of these steps , taken alone or together , can bring about the ends that their often well-intentioned advocates seek . 
On the contrary , they risk reproducing the havoc that such measures have unleashed in Iraq and elsewhere in recent years . 
In the United States , cautionary voices have been notably absent even among staunchly liberal newspapers like The New York Times . 
Foreign policy advisers to the Democratic Party and neo-conservatives alike have called for &quot; action &quot; against Sudan - demands that have been echoed by an international group of intellectuals and celebrities ranging from Umberto Eco , Jürgen Habermas , and Harold Pinter to Bob Geldof , George Clooney , Mia Farrow , Matt Damon , Mick Jagger , and J.K. Rowling . 
Meanwhile , French troops , with the support of other European Union members - notably Austria , Belgium , Ireland , Poland , Romania , and Sweden - are now deployed for putatively humanitarian reasons in the Central African Republic and Chad , where they have already clashed with Sudanese government forces . 
The International Crisis Group , Human Rights Watch , and many other organizations support this deployment , while Save Darfur , despite describing itself as a non-political &quot; alliance of more than 180 faith-based , advocacy , and humanitarian organizations , &quot; has , in fact , been pivotal in setting the policy agenda . 
This agenda &apos;s interventionism is incremental : tougher economic sanctions , demands that China exercise its influence , creation of a &quot; no-fly zone , &quot; and military force against the Sudanese army . 
The assumption is that only real pressure will finally force Sudan &apos;s government to embrace the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force , negotiate with the West , disband the feared Janjaweed militia , allow refugees from the country &apos;s brutal civil war to return to their villages , and make peace with Southern rebels . 
But realizing these aims requires cooperation from the government in Khartoum , whereas each of the proposed measures would only heighten tensions or prove useless . 
Existing Western sanctions , for example , have merely driven the Sudanese regime into the arms of China , Indonesia , and Malaysia . 
Indeed , investment in Sudan has actually grown $ 2.8 billion over the last year . 
Efforts to &quot; pressure &quot; the Chinese appear similarly futile . 
Darfur is hardly a high priority for China , which accounts for 20 % of African trade , and buys 60 % of Sudan &apos;s oil . 
Growing talk - both in Europe and America - about boycotting the Olympics ( or the opening ceremony ) has proven utterly ineffective in influencing China &apos;s behavior in Tibet . 
Would the threat of a boycott really prove more successful vis-à-vis Darfur ? 
Likewise , even proponents of a no-fly zone are doubtful about its potential efficacy . 
After all , Sudan is the size of Western Europe , and Darfur is the size of France , with 158 refugee camps . 
Strategic constraints would almost certainly overwhelm enforcement . 
Finally , there is the &quot; military option , &quot; which would merely justify fears in Sudan of Western &quot; imperialism . &quot; 
Worse , given the splintering of rebel forces in the South , where an estimated 80 tribes and clans control their own militias , a military response could generate a power vacuum in Sudan and destabilize the nine countries - many of them fragile or failed states - on its borders . 
Western analysts and activists should have learned by now that and military threats produce only resistance , and that genuine diplomacy involves using carrots as well as sticks . 
Yet the emerging policy consensus contains no positive incentives to resolve the Darfur crisis . 
Nor is it clear whether its aim is to pressure Sudan into changing its policy or to bring about wholesale regime change . 
I have been to Sudan twice , and , as part of a delegation organized by Conscience International , I also visited the refugee camps in Nyala and El Fasher in Darfur . 
I have met with dozens of Sudanese politicians and diplomats , and I know that the regime in Khartoum is authoritarian , self-interested , and ruthless . 
But it is not monolithic . 
Factions within the regime might prove supportive of new policies aimed at tempering the climate of violence in Sudan , decreasing its trade dependency on China , improving conditions for refugees , and lowering international tensions . 
Such policies might include : 
Normalizing diplomatic relations in exchange for removing obstacles to the deployment of UN-AU forces in Darfur . 
Replacing sanctions on Sudan with new investment opportunities and gradually forgiving its foreign debt in exchange for achievement of benchmarks tied to repatriating refugees , rebuilding villages , and demobilizing the Janjaweed ; 
Calling on not only the government , but also the rebel forces , over which the West has some influence , to bargain in good faith ; 
Engaging China &apos;s desire for international prestige by encouraging it to assume a public role in designing and overseeing repatriation , demobilization , and vocational programs ; 
Offering aid to the Sudanese in rebuilding the tribal reconciliation councils that were destroyed during the civil war ; 
Reintegrating Sudan into the international community through academic exchanges , conferences , political visits , and the like ; 
Strengthening the AU , which Western analysts have consistently underestimated with almost indescribable arrogance , in order to foster African solutions to African problems . 
The emerging policy consensus toward Sudan is predicated on an approach that has already undermined respect for Western values throughout the non-Western world . 
Its interventionist measures won &apos;t work . 
They are unrealistic and , ultimately , counterproductive . 
There is no time to lose in trying something new .
