Invulnerable Brazil ? 
Two questions have dominated economic debate in Latin America in recent years . 
First , when will the current period of great international liquidity end ? 
Second , what will happen when it does ? 
We could also add a third , related , question : are Latin America &apos;s governments preparing for that day ? 
In the case of Brazil , the answer appears ambiguous , at least at first glance . 
On one hand , Brazil has remained more or less at a standstill in terms of economic reform after the start of President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva &apos;s administration in 2003 . 
Essential changes to the tax code , labor law , and pension system have simply not been made . 
On the other hand , whereas , lenders once demanded commitments from Brazil that were often nearly impossible to meet due to the political situation , these same investors now generally seem completely satisfied with Brazil , despite its economic policy paralysis . 
There are objective reasons for this change . 
For the first time in decades , Brazil has been able to take advantage of good economic times to reduce its external debt , thereby lowering the risk to lenders . 
Indeed , Brazil &apos;s foreign debt-to-export ratio in 2006 was the lowest in the past 50 years . 
Moreover , while Brazil &apos;s total gross foreign debt fell by $ 50 billion during the past eight years , its foreign currency reserves rose rapidly , especially in the past two years , cutting the net foreign debt by more than $ 120 billion since the 1999 crisis ( see table ) .

Diminishing debt is important for investors because it shows a trend : if the rate observed in 2006 and 2007 is maintained , Brazil will eliminate net foreign debt by the end of Lula &apos;s second term in 2010 . 
This , together with its strong fiscal position , means that Brazil will be much better &quot; armored &quot; against a foreign crisis than ever before in the modern era . 
Indeed , a country affected by a world recession or by falling export prices is much more vulnerable if its external debt is 40 % or 50 % of the value of its net exports than if it has little or no net foreign debt . 
When foreign credit dried up for Brazil years ago , the only way to avoid bankruptcy was to call in the IMF . 
Now , if something similar happens , the central bank will have the foreign exchange needed to service its debts while maintaining a stable exchange rate . 
As a result , however , Brazil faces an uncomfortable fiscal dilemma . 
In order to compensate for the increase in money supply associated with the purchase of dollars , the government issues securities that pay a higher interest rate than the central bank receives for investing its reserves overseas . 
While the result in terms of net public debt is neutral , reducing net foreign debt in the public sector - which already is less than Brazil &apos;s international reserves - and increasing domestic debt is not good business in terms of the cost of the official debt . 
This is one reason why it is important that domestic interest rates fall , which in the coming months will very likely happen - and relatively robustly . 
In the coming years , Brazil &apos;s government also should strive for fiscal balance ( last year the deficit was still 3 % of GDP ) , and then to attain a surplus , as Chile has done for years now . 
Brazil is preparing partially for the day when the current period of great international liquidity ends . 
While structural reforms have lagged , the economy is far less vulnerable than it was in the past .
