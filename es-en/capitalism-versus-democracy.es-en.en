Capitalism versus Democracy 
WARSAW : Around the world , democracy is on the march . 
Totalitarian and authoritarian regimes have been swept away . 
Popular resentment against the remaining ones is growing . 
But it is too early to declare victory . 
The connection between capitalism and democracy is far from automatic . 
Repressive regimes do not willingly abdicate power and are often abetted by business interests , both foreign and domestic , particularly in countries where resources such as oil and diamonds are at stake . 
Perhaps today &apos;s greatest threat to freedom comes from an unholy alliance between government and business , such as in Fujimori &apos;s Peru , Mugabe &apos;s Zimbabwe , Mahatir &apos;s Malaysia , and the oligarchs &apos; Russia , where the appearances of democratic process are often observed but state powers are diverted to benefit private interests . 
Capitalism creates wealth but cannot be relied upon to assure freedom , democracy and the rule of law . 
Business is motivated by profit ; it is not designed to safeguard universal principles . 
Even the preservation of the market itself requires more than self-interest : market participants compete to win , and if they could , would eliminate competition . 
So freedom , democracy and the rule of law cannot be left to the care of market forces ; we need institutional safeguards . 
Traditionally , protecting the common interest was the task of the nation state . 
But state powers shrank as global capital markets expanded . 
Since capital can now avoid states that tax and regulate , governments cater to its demands . 
In many ways , this is beneficial . 
Free competition produces more wealth than state control ; globalization prevents states from abusing their power and offers a degree of freedom that no state could provide . 
But globalization has its downside : financial markets are unstable ; free competition creates and reinforces inequalities nationally and internationally ; collective interests , from preservation of peace to human rights and environmental protection , receive short shrift . 
To enjoy globalization &apos;s benefits we must address these shortcomings on an international scale . 
Unfortunately , existing international institutions , like the UN , are ill-suited to safeguard universal interests because they are associations of states , and states jealously guard their interests . 
Moreover , the faults of state bureaucracies are multiplied within international bureaucracies . 
In today &apos;s world , most conflicts occur not between states but within states . 
For people living under repressive regimes , outside protection is the only lifeline . 
Democratic countries cannot tolerate large scale violation of human rights , and are liable to be drawn into local conflicts . 
Even if they refuse to be drawn in , they face an influx of refugees and other forms of contagion . 
Once conflict erupts , as Yugoslavia shows , most forms of punitive intervention have unintended adverse consequences . 
Trade sanctions foster smuggling and smugglers are usually in cahoots with authorities , so that sanctions strengthen the governments they are supposed to topple . 
Military action tends to silence internal opposition to the regime against which it is directed . 
Crisis prevention is much to be preferred to intervention ; the best way to prevent crises is to foster the development of open societies . 
That is what my network of foundations seeks to do . 
Open societies allow people with different views , backgrounds , and interests to live together in peace . 
Given our human nature , conflicts cannot be avoided , but the chances of crises requiring outside intervention are greatly reduced . 
I advocate a concerted effort by developed democracies to foster the development of democracy in less developed parts of the world . 
This should take the form of technical assistance and economic incentives . 
Economics and politics cannot be separated . 
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen makes a convincing case that development should be defined in terms of freedom , not in terms of gross national product . 
The global capitalist system has produced a very uneven playing field . 
The gap between rich and poor is getting wider . 
We must find ways to counteract this because a system that does not offer hope and opportunity to its losers is liable to be disrupted by acts of desperation . 
By contrast , economic aid can foster democratic development ; it can also be used as leverage against recalcitrant governments . 
Unfortunately , there is scant support for this idea . 
Foreign aid failed in Africa and the post-communist states , and is in danger of failing in the Balkans . 
But that does not mean we should abandon the idea . 
Rather , we must examine the reasons for failure and devise better ways . 
Foreign aid is all too often directed at satisfying the needs of the donor , not the recipient . 
Based on the experience of my foundations in countries like Russia , I assert that outside assistance can be effective . 
Recent changes to the global financial architecture in the wake of the international financial crises aim exclusively at imposing greater market discipline . 
The goal is to eliminate the moral hazard introduced by the IMF . 
This will reduce the danger of excessive capital flows to emerging markets , but the next crisis is likely to arise from inadequate capital flows . 
Today &apos;s market fundamentalist creed fails to recognize that financial markets are inherently unstable . 
By imposing market discipline , it is , in fact , imposing instability . 
Global financial markets require a global central bank or some other international financial institutions to keep financial markets on an even keel . 
The same applies to the World Trade Organization . 
There is a crying need for both labor standards and environmental protection . 
But poor countries cannot afford them . 
Instead of punitive measures to enforce such standards , poor countries ought to be given incentives , such as tariff relief , to comply . 
The Meltzer Commission established by the US Congress recently recommended converting the World Bank from a lender to a World Development Agency . 
Splendid , but the Meltzer Commission would shrink the World Bank , returning unused capital to shareholders - a major resource transfer to the rich . 
I would put the unused capital to productive use and increase grant-giving activities of the Bank . 
The World Bank should also stop insisting that recipient governments guarantee its loans , which gives governments control over which private sector company , local government , or non-governmental organization receives financing . 
Such control is detrimental to the evolution of open societies . 
Removing this constraint might endanger the Bank &apos;s triple A rating , but will make it more effective . 
I propose that the world &apos;s open societies form an alliance with a dual purpose : fostering both development of open societies in individual countries and the evolution of a global open society . 
The first involves development assistance ; the second , strengthening international institutions , such as an international central bank and a World Development Agency . 
Such an alliance requires the co-operation not only of governments , but also of civil society . 
Governments represent the interests of the state , but democratic governments are responsive to the wishes of the electorate . 
Only if people believe in an open society that transcends national borders can such a society be brought into existence . 
So far , civil society has been mobilized for the destruction of international institutions as in the recent protests against the WTO and World Bank in Seattle and Washington . 
We must reverse the trend and start a movement for the creation of a global open society . 
The World Forum on Democracy , held in Warsaw June 25 - 27 made a start , but it must be followed up .
