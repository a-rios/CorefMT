What is the IMF &apos;s Mission ? 
BERKELEY - The International Monetary Fund has been one of the few beneficiaries of the global economic crisis . 
Just two years ago , it was being downsized , and serious people were asking whether it should be closed down . 
Since then , there has been a renewed demand for IMF lending . 
Members have agreed to a tripling of its resources . 
It has been authorized to raise additional funds by selling its own bonds . 
The Fund is a beehive of activity . 
But the crisis will not last forever . 
Meanwhile , the IMF &apos;s critics have not gone away ; they have merely fallen silent temporarily . 
The Fund only encourages their criticism by failing to define its role . 
It needs to do so while it still has the world &apos;s sympathetic ear . 
The IMF &apos;s first role is to assist countries that , as a result of domestic policies , experience balance-of-payments crises . 
Their governments have no choice but to borrow from the Fund . 
To safeguard its resources - that is , to be sure that its shareholders are paid back - the Fund must demand difficult policy adjustments on the part of these borrowers . 
The problem is that the IMF has bought into the rhetoric of its critics by agreeing to &quot; streamline &quot; its conditionality . 
In fact , where structural weaknesses are the source of problems , the Fund should still require structural adjustment as the price of its assistance . 
By seeming to give ground on this point in the effort to win friends and influence people , the IMF has created unnecessary confusion . 
A second role for the IMF is to act as a global reserve pool . 
Countries have accumulated large reserves in order to insure against shocks . 
This is costly for poor economies , which could better use the resources for investment and consumption . 
Unfortunately , the recent demonstration of the volatility of global financial markets only encourages the tendency to stockpile reserves . 
It would be more efficient to pool the reserves of countries that need them at different times . 
The IMF has moved in this direction by creating a Short-Term Liquidity Facility through which countries with strong policies can draw from the Fund up to five times their quota without conditionality . 
But the STLF still requires a burdensome application process , which only Mexico , Colombia , and Poland have been willing to endure . 
This made sense so long as the IMF &apos;s resources were limited , as the application process allowed the Fund to limit its liability . 
But , with the tripling of resources , this rationale no longer exists . 
The IMF should categorically announce which countries qualify for the facility , automatically making them members of the pool . 
A third role for the IMF is macro-prudential supervisor . 
Recent events have made clear that someone needs to anticipate and warn of risks to global financial stability . 
The G-20 suggests that the Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) , made up of national supervisory authorities , should take the lead in these tasks . 
The Fund , through its early-warning exercises and joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessments , is to only play a supporting role . 
But why the FSB should head up this process is far from clear . 
The IMF , with its universal membership , is more representative , and it has a larger expert staff . 
National supervisors may be reluctant to surrender this responsibility to a multilateral organization . 
If so , this is shortsighted . 
Financial markets and institutions with global reach need a global macro-prudential regulator , not just a loosely organized college of supervisors . 
Or it could be that national policymakers don &apos;t trust the IMF , given that it essentially missed the global financial crisis . 
If so , the Fund needs to win back their confidence . 
This brings us to the IMF &apos;s fourth role , namely using its bully pulpit to warn of risks created by large-country policies . 
Small countries are subject to market discipline , as any Latvian will tell you . 
But when large economies whose currencies are used internationally need more resources , they can just print more money . 
Not only do they feel less market discipline , but they are subject to less IMF discipline , since they are not compelled to borrow from the Fund . 
But , as the sub-prime mortgage debacle reminds us , large countries &quot; policies can place the global financial system at risk . 
The Fund , wary of biting the hand that feeds it , has been reluctant to issue strong warnings in such instances . 
But if the IMF is to have a future , its management will have to issue stronger warnings about the next dangerously large US current-account deficit , the next unsustainable housing boom , or whatever large-country problem succeeds them . 
There can be no more mincing of words . 
Finally , the IMF needs to coordinate reform of the international system . 
If , in the long run , a supra-national unit , the Special Drawing Right , is to replace national currencies in international use , then the Fund will need to guide its development . 
If stop-gap measures are required during the transition , the Fund must provide leadership there as well . 
So far , however , the innovative ideas for reforming the international system have come from the United Nations , 10 Downing Street , and the People &apos;s Bank of China . 
The Fund has been notable mainly for its silence . 
The crisis is not yet forgotten , but the window is closing . 
The next meeting of the IMF &apos;s Board of Governors will be in early October in Istanbul . 
If the Fund does not provide a clear vision of its future by then , the opportunity will have been missed .
