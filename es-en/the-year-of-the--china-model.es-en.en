The Year of the &quot; China Model &quot; 
It will be China &apos;s year in 2008 . 
The Olympic Games - no doubt perfectly organized , without a protester , homeless person , religious dissenter , or any other kind of spoilsport in sight - will probably bolster China &apos;s global prestige . 
While the American economy gets dragged down further in a swamp of bad property debts , China will continue to boom . 
Exciting new buildings , designed by the world &apos;s most famous architects , will make Beijing and Shanghai look like models of twenty-first century modernity . 
More Chinese will be featured in annual lists of the world &apos;s richest people . 
To come back from near destitution and bloody tyranny in one generation is a great feat , and China should be saluted for it . 
But China &apos;s success story is also the most serious challenge that liberal democracy has faced since fascism in the 1930 &quot; s . 
This is not because China poses a great military threat - war with the United States , or even Japan , is only a fantasy in the minds of a few ultra-nationalist cranks and paranoiacs . 
It is in the realm of ideas that China &apos;s political-economic model , regardless of its environmental consequences , is scoring victories and looking like an attractive alternative to liberal democratic capitalism . 
And it is a real alternative . 
Contrary to what some pundits say , Chinese capitalism is not like nineteenth-century European capitalism . 
True , the European working class , not to mention women , did not have voting rights 200 years ago . 
But even during the most ruthless phases of Western capitalism , civil society in Europe and the US was made up of a huge network of organizations independent of the state - churches , clubs , parties , societies , and associations that were available to all social classes . 
In China , by contrast , while individuals have regained many personal freedoms since the death of Maoism , they are not free to organize anything that is not controlled by the Communist Party . 
Despite communism &apos;s ideological bankruptcy , China has not changed in this regard . 
The China Model is sometimes described in traditional terms , as though modern Chinese politics were an updated version of Confucianism . 
But a society where the elite &apos;s pursuit of money is elevated above all other human endeavors is a far cry from any kind of Confucianism that may have existed in the past . 
Still , it &apos;s hard to argue with success . 
If anything has been laid to rest by China &apos;s rising wealth , it is the comforting idea that capitalism , and the growth of a prosperous bourgeoisie , will inevitably lead to liberal democracy . 
On the contrary , it is precisely the middle class , bought off by promises of ever-greater material gains , that hopes to conserve the current political order . 
It may be a Faustian bargain - prosperity in exchange for political obedience - but so far it has worked . 
The China Model is attractive not only to the country &apos;s new coastal elites , but has global appeal . 
African dictators - indeed , dictators everywhere - who walk the plush red carpets laid out for them in Beijing love it . 
It is also a source of vast amounts of money , much of which will end up in the tyrants &quot; pockets . 
By proving that authoritarianism can be successful , China is an example to autocrats everywhere , from Moscow to Dubai , from Islamabad to Khartoum . 
China &apos;s appeal is growing in the Western world as well . 
Businessmen , media moguls , and architects all flock there . 
Could there be a better place to do business , build stadiums and skyscrapers , or sell information technology and media networks than a country without independent trade unions or any form of organized protest that could lower profits ? 
Meanwhile , concern for human or civic rights is denigrated as outmoded , or an arrogant expression of Western imperialism . 
There is , however , a fly in the ointment . 
No economy keeps growing at the same pace forever . 
Crises occur . 
What if the bargain struck between the Chinese middle classes and the one-party state were to fall apart , owing to a pause , or even a setback , in the race for material wealth ? 
This has happened before . 
The closest thing , in some ways , to the China Model is nineteenth-century Germany , with its industrial strength , its cultivated but politically neutered middle class , and its tendency toward aggressive nationalism . 
Nationalism became lethal when the economy crashed , and social unrest threatened to upset the political order . 
The same thing could happen in China , where national pride constantly teeters on the edge of belligerence towards Japan , Taiwan , and ultimately the West . 
Aggressive Chinese nationalism could turn lethal , too , if its economy were to falter . 
This would not be in anyone &apos;s interest , so we should wish China well in 2008 , while sparing a thought for all the dissidents , democrats , and free spirits languishing in labor camps and prisons . 
We should hope that they will live to see the day when the Chinese , too , will be a free people . 
It might be a distant dream , but dreaming is what New Year &apos;s is all about .
