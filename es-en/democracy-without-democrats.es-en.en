Democracy Without Democrats 
The philosopher Karl Popper had ample reason to propose a precise definition of democracy . 
Democracy , he said , is a means to remove those in power without bloodshed . 
Popper &apos;s preferred method , of course , was the ballot box . 
Popper &apos;s definition avoids theological disputes about the &quot; rule of the people , &quot; and whether such a thing can actually exist . 
It also spares us the attempt to stick all kinds of possibly desirable objectives into the definition , like equality in social as well as technical terms , a general theory of the actual process of &quot; democratisation , &quot; or even a set of civic virtues of participation . 
But Popper &apos;s definition of democracy does not help when it comes to a question that has become topical in many parts of the world : what if those removed from power believe in democracy , whereas those who replace them do not ? 
What in other words , if the &quot; wrong &quot; people are elected ? 
There is no shortage of examples . 
In Europe , parties of dubious democratic pedigree have done well in recent years : JÃ¶rg Haider in Austria , Christoph Blocher in Switzerland , Umberto Bossi in Italy , Jean-Marie LePen in France - the list is long . 
At best , the electoral victories of such groups make the formation of responsible governments difficult ; at worst , they foreshadow actively antidemocratic movements capable of getting a majority by election. -  
This is what has happened or is happening in many parts of the world . 
Two recent examples stand out . 
One is found in the postcommunist countries of East and Southeast Europe , a surprising number of which have elected members of the old nomenklatura under a new guise . 
The most extreme current case is Serbia , where a big part of the electorate gave their votes to men standing trial for war crimes in The Hague . 
The other example is Iraq . 
What if the American dream of bringing democracy to that troubled country ends in its citizens electing a fundamentalist movement to power ? 
The mere thought of such examples leads to the clear conclusion that democracy is not just about elections . 
In fact , of course , the early advocates of democracy had all kinds of things in mind . 
John Stuart Mill , for example , regarded &quot; nationality , &quot; a cohesive society within national boundaries , as a precondition for democracy . 
Another precondition for Mill was the ability and desire of citizens to make considered choices . 
Today we no longer take such virtues as given . 
They were probably exercised by only a minority of people even at the time when Mill wrote on representative government . 
Today democracy has to mean &quot; elections plus &quot; - but plus what ? 
There may be some technical measures that can be taken , like banning parties and candidates who campaign against democracy , or whose democratic credentials are weak . 
This worked in postwar Germany , but then traumatic memories of the Nazis and the relative weakness of antidemocratic movements helped . 
A more relevant example may well be Turkey , where Islamist movements were dissolved by the courts ; when they reappeared in a different guise , they had to undergo severe tests . 
Yet one can easily see the problems : who judges the eligibility of candidates and how are such judgements enforced ? 
What if the groundswell of support for an antidemocratic movement is so strong that the suppression of its organisation leads to violence ? 
In a sense it might be better to let such movements have a go at government and hope that they will fail - as have most of the current European groups of an antidemocratic ilk . 
But that too is risky . 
When Hitler came to power in January 1933 , many if not most German democrats thought : &quot; Let him ! 
He will soon be exposed for what he is and above all for what he is not . &quot; 
But time is relative : &quot; soon &quot; came to mean twelve years that included a savage war and the Holocaust . 
Active citizens who defend the liberal order must thus be its safeguard . 
But there is another , and a more important element to safeguard , which is the rule of law . 
The rule of law is not the same as democracy , nor does one necessarily guarantee the other . 
The rule of law is the acceptance that laws given not by some supreme authority , but by the citizenry , govern all - those in power , those in opposition , and those outside the power game . 
The rule of law is the strongest feature of Turkey today . 
It has rightly been the prime objective of the High Representative for Bosnia , Paddy Ashdown . 
It is something that must be defended ; so-called &quot; enabling laws &quot; that suspend the rule of law are the first weapon of dictators . 
But it is harder to use the rule of law to undermine law than it is to use popular elections against democracy . 
&quot; Elections plus &quot; must mean , therefore , democracy plus the rule of law . 
At the risk of offending many friends of a democratic persuasion , I have now concluded that the rule of law should come first when constitutionalism is brought to an ex-dictatorship , and democracy second . 
Incorrupt independent judges are even more influential than politicians elected with massive majorities . 
Lucky are those countries that have both , and that nurture and protect them !
