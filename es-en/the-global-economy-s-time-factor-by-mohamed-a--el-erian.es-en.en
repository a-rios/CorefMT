Global Markets \ u0027 Time Factor 
BARCELONA - In recent months , the dichotomy between booming financial markets , on the one hand , and sluggish economies and dysfunctional politics , on the other , has loomed large . 
Yet insufficient attention is being devoted to a critical factor - time , and who controls it - that could well mean the difference between an orderly global resolution of today &apos;s growing inconsistencies and a return to a more troubled phase . 
Markets have been understandably buoyant in the first quarter of 2013 . 
Most economic data confirm that , after the trauma caused by the global financial crisis , the United States &quot; economy is healing , and doing so in an accelerated fashion . 
The sequence is now well established . 
It started with large multinational companies , which are on as solid a financial footing as I can remember . 
Smaller firms are gradually recuperating ; banks have rebuilt their capital cushions and reduced their dubious assets ; the housing sector has stabilized ; and a growing number of households are reestablishing healthier balance sheets , especially as employment gradually picks up . 
This private-sector recovery is helping government finances . 
The US budget deficit has been on a downward trend for now , helped by both higher revenues and lower pressure on spending ( for example , payments to the unemployed have fallen as joblessness has declined ) . 
The healing process is also evident in Europe , though , unfortunately , it is effectively limited only to sovereign-bond markets . 
The real economy remains under enormous pressure in several countries , as economies contract and unemployment remains alarmingly high . 
After flirting with disaster last July , interest-rate spreads for eurozone bonds have generally been subdued , and financial segmentation has been slowly reversed ( that is , at least before European officials embarked on the controversial path of trying to impose losses on guaranteed bank deposits in Cyprus ) . 
Moreover , as Ireland &apos;s highly successful â‚¬ 5 billion ten-year bond issue in mid-March demonstrated , some countries are in the process of restoring normal access to capital markets . 
The impact on markets of these trends has been turbocharged by central banks , which are risk markets &quot; best friends . 
This is not because they wish to play that role ; rather , it is because higher asset prices are essential if central bankers stand any chance of delivering the desired economic outcomes of higher growth and stronger job creation . 
This is most evident in the US , where markets love the Federal Reserve &apos;s trifecta of near-zero policy interest rates ( negative in real terms ) , aggressive forward policy guidance , and asset purchases - all of which push investors to take more risk . 
Markets also welcome the fact that the Fed &apos;s hyperactive experimentation is forcing other central banks around the world to pursue more expansionary policies . 
Indeed , from the Bank of Japan &apos;s dramatic policy U-turn to the Bank of Mexico &apos;s surprise interest-rate cuts , the Fed &apos;s approach is affecting central banks in a growing number of countries . 
Pushed further away from best-case scenarios , they are unable to ignore the global liquidity impact of the Fed &apos;s policies , yet they lack the right policy tools to address it . 
The mix of endogenous healing and strong central-bank tailwinds , including from a &quot; whatever it takes &quot; European Central Bank , has also helped markets shrug off troubling political uncertainties . 
Be it the US Congress &apos;s paralyzing polarization or Italy &apos;s protest vote against the established political order , politicians are being given time to overcome their dysfunction , thereby minimizing any immediate disruptive impact . 
Understandably , investors have interpreted all of this as a green light to take more risk . 
And with the hype this month over eight successive records for the Dow Jones index ( and many other records around the world ) , excitement induces more investors to enter riskier asset markets . 
The excitement is not anxiety-free , however , and rightly so . 
Investors worry about the longer-term consequences of political dysfunction , another year of European economic contraction , disastrously high unemployment , unprecedented - and thus untested - central bank policies , and increasing global tensions . 
And the recent bungling of the Cyprus rescue does not help . 
No wonder some have called the recent market rally &quot; one of the most unloved &quot; in history . 
This mix of excitement and anxiety is , in fact , a sign of the looming crossroads that faces investors . 
One road , involving a relatively orderly handoff from policy-assisted recovery to self-sustaining growth , offers the possibility of even greater financial rewards , as rapidly improving economic and political conditions validate current artificial pricing and drive it higher . 
The other road is a lot less attractive . 
With insufficient endogenous healing and no economic escape velocity , the effectiveness of central banks &quot; policies wanes and political dysfunction increases , leading to financial losses , volatility spikes , and huge risk-management challenges . 
Given current policy and political uncertainties - and the multiple equilibria that they entail - it is difficult to predict with a high degree of confidence which road eventually will be taken and when . 
Those who claim otherwise may well fail to appreciate fully the exceptional nature of the current situation . 
In these circumstances , timing may not be everything , but it may prove to be a key determinant of the probabilities . 
If the journey to the crossroads is accelerated by a large geopolitical shock ( originating in , say , the Middle East or North Korea ) and / or a serious political breakdown in Europe ( for example , a meltdown in Cyprus or prolonged political paralysis in Italy ) , the probability of taking the adverse path rises to an uncomfortably high level . 
If , however , central banks can contain domestic and global inconsistencies long enough , the combination of endogenous healing and eventual political progress would significantly improve the probability distribution . 
Have no doubt : today &apos;s markets rely heavily on the old adage that &quot; time heals all wounds . &quot; 
The timekeepers are central banks . 
But their control of the clock is less than perfect ; and it will become increasingly ineffective if economic improvement faces additional political headwinds in the months ahead .
