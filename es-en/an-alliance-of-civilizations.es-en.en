An Alliance of Civilizations ? 
MADRID - The first International Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations , conceived as an antidote to the idea that the world is doomed to a &quot; clash of civilizations , &quot; recently met in Madrid and revealed that there is more than a grain of truth in Robert Kagan &apos;s idea that Americans are from Mars and Europeans from Venus . 
Ever since September 11 , 2001 , the United States has been engaged in a crusade against the forces of evil in the Muslim world . 
By contrast , the March 11 , 2004 , terrorist attack on Spain , which left 200 dead , triggered an &quot; anti-crusade &quot; that seeks to disarm extremism by building bridges of understanding and reconciliation with Islam . 
Co-sponsored by Spain and Turkey , the Alliance of Civilizations initiative is not devoid of political calculation . 
To the Spaniards , it helps to justify their abrupt withdrawal from Iraq in 2004 ; for the Turks , it is yet another vehicle in their struggle , as the vital bridge between Islam and the West , for admission into the European Union . 
A loose and somewhat confused project , the Alliance of Civilizations aims to heal the wounds of conflict between Islam and the West through education , viable integration policies , and a better-informed dialogue with the media . 
But it suffers from the major global players &quot; profound skepticism , with the US , Russia , and , for that matter , the EU shown no real enthusiasm for it . 
However vague , the alliance of civilizations idea certainly cannot do more harm than war against Islamic extremism . 
After all , none of the Muslim world &apos;s problems and conflicts with the West are susceptible to a military solution . 
Moreover , the Alliance is not an entirely incoherent proposal if the objective is that the West disengage from the politics of hubris and establish a genuine sphere of cooperation with the Muslim world in economics , culture , and science . 
Of course , the idea is held back by the inner workings of both parts of the proposed alliance . 
Many in the West question whether Islam is compatible with human rights and Western concepts of liberty . 
Many Muslims who have been fighting for years for their countries &quot; modernization have so far failed to find a lucid response to the progressive wave of radical Islam . 
To claim that Islam is incompatible with human rights is to consider it a civilization too hidebound to change . 
This is a historic fallacy . 
Nor is the claim that Islam is intrinsically inimical to innovation viable , because Muslim civilization has contributed mightily to science and art throughout history . 
Today , Western universities are replete with distinguished Arab scholars in almost every field - the result of a brain drain that itself reflects the Islamic world &apos;s centuries of decline . 
In 2005 , the 17 countries of the Arab world together produced 13,444 scientific publications , fewer than the 15,455 achieved by Harvard University alone . 
Enemies of reason , however , are also to be found in the West . 
We live in an age in which many people are disillusioned with secular politics , and are turning to religion instead , not only throughout the Muslim world , but in the core of Western civilization , Christian Europe and Evangelist America . 
Nor is the Jewish state of Israel , where Messianic fanatics and religious nationalists have embraced a political theology that questions the very legitimacy of the democratic institutions , immune from this phenomenon . 
The current crisis of Islam might not be congenital , but Islam &apos;s predicament is acute . 
The question is this : are Muslims ready to accept that Khomeini &apos;s dictum that &quot; Islam is politics or it is nothing &quot; is wrong , that Islam is a religion and not a form of government , and that , as in the Christian world , there is a sphere for Caesar and a sphere for God ? 
Those in the Muslim world who want to embrace reform must be driven by the conviction that theocracy has never served as a vehicle for human progress . 
Of course , the Alliance of Civilizations should not attempt to bridge differences by defending moral relativism . 
If it is driven by a Western guilt complex that assumes that the solution simply lies in greater empathy for the Muslim predicament , then the skeptics are bound to be vindicated . 
For the Alliance of Civilizations to have any chance of success , the emphasis must be on reciprocity . 
Islam &apos;s part in the deal must include a guarantee of human rights and civil liberties , improvement in women &apos;s status , and realistic policies to stem the Islamic world &apos;s demographic explosion . 
Some , as usual , will claim that the Arab-Israeli conflict lies at the root of the problems that exist between Islam and the West , and that resolving the Palestinians &quot; plight will contribute immensely to smoother relations . 
But Arabs and Muslims must stop deluding themselves that the Israel-Palestine dispute is what is holding them back . 
Ending the American occupation in Iraq and imposing an Arab-Israeli peace would help , but they are no panacea . 
The fight to eradicate misery , illiteracy , and corruption , and Islam &apos;s embrace of science , do not depend on the results of the Middle East peace process .
