Putting America &apos;s Recovery to Work 
BERKELEY - America &apos;s economy grew much more rapidly than expected in 2013 and appears poised to strengthen further this year . 
But there is still considerable slack in the labor market , and , as long as it persists , the gains from faster growth will continue to be concentrated at the top of the income distribution , as they have been throughout the recovery . 
According to recent BEA estimates , real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP grew at a 2.7 % average annual rate in 2013 , compared to only 2 % in 2012 . 
Most forecasters - including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , the so-called Blue Chip consensus , and the Federal Reserve - predict that annual real growth will reach at least 2.8 % in 2014 . 
Despite two recent lackluster employment reports , there are many reasons to expect that growth will accelerate in 2014 . 
The headwinds buffeting the US recovery - impaired household balance sheets , a depressed housing market , and government spending and employment cuts - are dissipating . 
Household debt has fallen to levels last seen in the early 1990 &quot; s , real household net worth has returned to its pre-recession peak , and residential investment as a share of GDP is rising . 
Meanwhile , state and local-government budgets are improving , and the federal budget is on track to subtract only about 0.5 % from GDP in 2014 , compared to 1.75 % in 2013 . 
In a Congressional election year , another destabilizing showdown over the federal debt limit is unlikely . 
Moreover , monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative , and inflation remains lower than expected . 
US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was a vocal co-architect of the Fed &apos;s accommodative policy stance under the leadership of her predecessor , Ben Bernanke , so policy continuity is expected . 
Indeed , the Fed has reiterated its intention to hold the federal funds rate near zero well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 % , while gradually trimming its purchases of long-term assets - so-called quantitative easing - by $ 10 billion a month . 
Meanwhile , private spending grew 3.9 % year on year in 2013 , the strongest rate in a decade , and the outlook for 2014 is promising . 
Improving household balance sheets imply stronger consumer sentiment . 
Real personal-consumption spending rose at a 2.3 % annual rate in 2013 , up from 2 % in 2011 and 2012 . 
Stronger consumer spending , along with record-high corporate profits , should boost investment spending further this year , as will re-shoring of economic activity and an improving trade balance , owing to a decline in energy and labor costs in the US . 
Indeed , shale energy and big-data analytics , two areas in which the US has a strong competitive edge , could be significant supply-side &quot; game changers &quot; for growth . 
Nonetheless , the outlook for US workers is less sanguine and more uncertain . 
Despite stronger growth in 2013 , net monthly job creation , at about 193,000 , was only slightly above its 2012 level ( 186,000 ) and still below its pre-recession average of 200,000 . 
Employment at the end of 2013 was still 1.1 million short of its pre-recession peak ; regaining this peak requires 7.7 million more jobs , in addition to absorbing subsequent monthly entrants to the labor force . 
In November 2013 , monthly job openings topped four million for the first time since 2008 . 
But the number of job seekers exceeded the number of openings in every industry . 
When the recession officially ended in June 2009 , there were 6.2 unemployed workers for every job opening . 
In November , this ratio had fallen to 2.7 , compared to 1.8 before the recession began ( and just 1.1 in 2000 ) . 
When the recession hit , unemployment rates for workers at all education levels jumped , and they have yet to fall back to pre-recession levels . 
While the short-term unemployment rate ( those unemployed for 26 weeks or less ) has fallen back to its 2001-2007 pre-crisis average , the long-term unemployment rate remains higher than at any time since the measure was introduced in 1948 . 
The long-term unemployed account for about 36 % of total unemployment , down from nearly 46 % in March 2011 but still far above the previous peak of 26 % reached 30 years ago . 
The long-term unemployed tend to be older - the number of unemployed workers aged 50-65 has doubled - and those who have been laid off from previous jobs . 
Faster economic growth and more job openings are less likely to benefit these workers : the longer they are unemployed , the more their skills become obsolete and the more their actual or perceived employability deteriorates . 
Moreover , both the short-term and long-term unemployment rates underestimate the slack in the labor market caused by the significant and sustained decline in the labor-force participation rate ( LFPR ) since the recession began . 
In 2007 , 66 % of Americans were working or actively seeking work ; today , that number stands at 63 % , the lowest level since 1977 . 
If the LFPR had remained at its pre-recession high , the unemployment rate today would be nearly 12 % . 
If it had stabilized when the unemployment rate peaked in October 2009 , unemployment today would be over 9 % . 
A critical policy question is why the LFPR has continued to decline . 
Demography clearly plays a role : a larger share of the workforce is reaching retirement age , while the share of those aged 16-24 who are pursuing education is rising . 
But the recession triggered sudden and sustained declines in the LFPR across all age groups in response to weak demand and poor job prospects . 
A recent CBO analysis attributes about one-half of the decline in the LFPR from the end of 2007 to the end of 2013 to these cyclical factors , with the remainder explained by secular demographic trends . 
As has been painfully obvious during the last several years , prolonged labor-market slack means falling real wages for most workers , with the negative effect intensifying as one moves down the wage distribution . 
By the same logic , stronger growth in 2014 and tightening labor markets should lead to healthier wage gains for the 70 % of the workforce whose real wages have not yet returned to their pre-recession level . 
But , as President Barack Obama argued in his recent State of the Union address , it will take more than faster economic growth for American workers to recover from the Great Recession . 
Extending unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless , combating the stigma against hiring them , creating more on-the-job training opportunities and apprenticeships , and raising the minimum wage are all essential steps toward a more equitable distribution of the recovery &apos;s benefits .
