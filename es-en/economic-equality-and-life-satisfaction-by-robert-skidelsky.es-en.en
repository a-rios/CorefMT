Happiness Is Equality 
LONDON - The king of Bhutan wants to make us all happier . 
Governments , he says , should aim to maximize their people &apos;s Gross National Happiness rather than their Gross National Product . 
Does this new emphasis on happiness represent a shift or just a passing fad ? 
It is easy to see why governments should de-emphasize economic growth when it is proving so elusive . 
The British economy is contracting . 
Greece &apos;s economy has been shrinking for years . 
Even China is expected to slow down . 
Why not give up growth and enjoy what we have ? 
No doubt this mood will pass when growth revives , as it is bound to . 
Nevertheless , a deeper shift in attitude toward growth has occurred , which is likely to make it a less important lodestar in the future - especially in rich countries . 
The first factor to undermine the pursuit of growth was concern about its sustainability . 
Can we continue growing at the old rate without endangering our future ? 
When people started talking about the &quot; natural &quot; limits to growth in the 1970 &quot; s , they meant the impending exhaustion of food and non-renewable natural resources . 
Recently the debate has shifted to carbon emissions . 
As the Stern Review of 2006 emphasized , we must sacrifice some growth today to ensure that we do not all fry tomorrow . 
Curiously , the one taboo area in this discussion is population . 
The fewer people there are , the less risk we face of heating up the planet . 
But , instead of accepting the natural decline in their populations , rich-country governments absorb more and more people to hold down wages and thereby grow faster . 
A more recent concern focuses on the disappointing results of growth . 
It is increasingly understood that growth does not necessarily increase our sense of well-being . 
So why continue to grow ? 
The groundwork for this question was laid some time ago . 
In 1974 , the economist Richard Easterlin published a famous paper , &quot; Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot ? 
Some Empirical Evidence . &quot; 
After correlating per capita income and self-reported happiness levels across a number of countries , he reached a startling conclusion : probably not . 
Above a rather low level of income ( enough to satisfy basic needs ) , Easterlin found no correlation between happiness and GNP per head . 
In other words , GNP is a poor measure of life satisfaction . 
That finding reinforced efforts to devise alternative indexes . 
In 1972 , two economists , William Nordhaus and James Tobin , introduced a measure that they called &quot; Net Economic Welfare , &quot; obtained by deducting from GNP &quot; bad &quot; outputs , like pollution , and adding non-market activities , like leisure . 
They showed that a society with more leisure and less work could have as much welfare as one with more work - and therefore more GNP - and less leisure . 
More recent metrics have tried to incorporate a wider range of &quot; quality of life &quot; indicators . 
The trouble is that you can measure quantity of stuff , but not quality of life . 
How one combines quantity and quality in some index of &quot; life satisfaction &quot; is a matter of morals rather than economics , so it is not surprising that most economists stick to their quantitative measures of &quot; welfare . &quot; 
But another finding has also started to influence the current debate on growth : poor people within a country are less happy than rich people . 
In other words , above a low level of sufficiency , peoples &quot; happiness levels are determined much less by their absolute income than by their income relative to some reference group . 
We constantly compare our lot with that of others , feeling either superior or inferior , whatever our income level ; well-being depends more on how the fruits of growth are distributed than on their absolute amount . 
Put another way , what matters for life satisfaction is the growth not of mean income but of median income - the income of the typical person . 
Consider a population of ten people ( say , a factory ) in which the managing director earns $ 150,000 a year and the other nine , all workers , earn $ 10,000 each . 
The mean average of their incomes is $ 25,000 , but 90 % earn $ 10,000 . 
With this kind of income distribution , it would be surprising if growth increased the typical person &apos;s sense of well-being . 
That is not an idle example . 
In rich societies over the last three decades , mean incomes have been rising steadily , but typical incomes have been stagnating or even falling . 
In other words , a minority - a very small minority in countries like the United States and Britain - has captured most of the gains of growth . 
In such cases , it is not more growth that we want , but more equality . 
More equality would not only produce the contentment that flows from more security and better health , but also the satisfaction that flows from having more leisure , more time with family and friends , more respect from one &apos;s fellows , and more lifestyle choices . 
Great inequality makes us hungrier for goods than we would otherwise be , by constantly reminding us that we have less than the next person . 
We live in a pushy society with turbo-charged fathers and &quot; tiger &quot; mothers , constantly goading themselves and their children to &quot; get ahead . &quot; 
The nineteenth-century philosopher John Stuart Mill had a more civilized view : 
&quot; I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think ... that the trampling , crushing , elbowing , and treading on each other &apos;s heels , which form the existing type of social life , are the most desirable lot of human kind .... The best state for human nature is that in which , while no one is poor , no one desires to be richer , nor has any reason to fear being thrust back , by the efforts of others to push themselves forward . &quot; 
That lesson has been lost on most economists today , but not on the king of Bhutan - or on the many people who have come to recognize the limits of quantifiable wealth .
