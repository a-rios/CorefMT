Slamming the Euro Door 
LONDON - Last week , central bankers from around the world assembled in Frankfurt to bask in the glory of the euro &apos;s first ten years . 
But for those coming from euro candidate countries , the event was a cold shower . 
Just as the global financial crisis has made euro membership seem more urgent and necessary than ever , euro incumbents have started floating proposals that would raise the bar for entry . 
Under the proposal that was openly discussed in Frankfurt , in addition to the macroeconomic Maastricht criteria that have been in place since the euro &apos;s launch , the quality of a country &apos;s banking system would be used as an additional criterion for euro entry . 
Leaving aside the hypocrisy of Western governments pontificating on this topic while they are bailing out banks after massive regulatory failures , the proposal is seriously flawed . 
To fully appreciate the proposal &apos;s absurdity , consider the extraordinarily successful East European growth model of the past two decades . 
The model advocated by Western Europe and embraced by Eastern Europe has been based on the idea that capital should flow from capital-rich to capital-poor countries . 
Economists have to go back to the nineteenth-century United States to find a similar textbook example of successful growth , with large current-account deficits financed mainly through foreign direct investment . 
Financial flows have been accompanied by unprecedented financial integration , with most East European banks now controlled by Western parents . 
This model has worked remarkably well not just in generating growth , but also , as documented in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development &apos;s 2008 Transition Report , in improving the institutions that support markets and democracy in Eastern Europe . 
But it has also left these countries vulnerable to the twists and turns of global financial markets . 
Over the last year and a half , they withstood these pressures remarkably well ; but , as the global crisis hits them with full force , they are now seeking help from the International Monetary Fund . 
The main vulnerability in the current crisis has been massive exposure to foreign exchange movements . 
Actors in all parts of the economy , households and companies alike , have bet that their local currencies would continue to appreciate . 
Mortgages in Swiss francs and car loans in Japanese yen have been common throughout the region . 
But it was probably in Hungary , the first country to seek an IMF package , that these practices were most widespread . 
Yet this vulnerability was largely created , or at least accommodated , by Western banks . 
The funding from the parent banks that in the earlier phase of the crisis helped provide liquidity to the East European banking systems now appears more as a liability and possible source of contagion . 
It was also the West European financial regulators and supervisors who , under &quot; home rule , &quot; were supposed to discourage these excesses . 
The penetration of foreign banks has also effectively deprived countries in Central and Eastern Europe of monetary policy tools , leaving them with little control over extremely rapid credit growth . 
Add to this the impact of the current West European bank rescue packages on the banking systems of Eastern Europe . 
On one hand , these programs help promote stability by supporting the parent banks active in the region . 
On the other hand , the interventions have also undermined the East European financial systems . 
Governments in Eastern Europe cannot credibly match the broad deposit guarantees issued by their Western neighbors , and the generous recapitalizations have brought down Western banks &quot; relative funding costs , further weakening local institutions &quot; competitiveness . 
Finally , many governments explicitly or implicitly restrict parent banks &quot; ability to use government funds to back up their East European subsidiaries , many of them critical to the stability of the local financial systems . 
To make the quality of the banking system a new criterion for euro membership is not only hypocritical ; it is also counterproductive . 
Relatively high levels of inflation have been the main reason why euro membership was perceived as increasingly remote in most countries , and why the prospect of euro entry has had a diminishing impact on domestic reform efforts . 
A small consolation in the current crisis is that inflation rates are now coming down . 
More importantly , the crisis has demonstrated the value for these small economies of being part of a larger currency area . 
Instead of exploiting the current opportunity of unprecedented leverage over euro candidates to push them to meet the Maastricht criteria , euro incumbents are contemplating a new and exceedingly vague criterion based on the quality of banking systems . 
And whose banks are these ? 
Who are we kidding ?
