Pigs , Calves , and American Democracy 
Amidst all the headlines about the Democrats gaining control of the United States Congress in the November elections , one big election result was largely ignored . 
Although it illuminated the flaws of America &apos;s political system , it also restored my belief in the compassion of ordinary Americans . 
In Arizona , citizens can , by gathering a sufficient number of signatures , put a proposed law to a direct popular vote . 
This year , one of the issues on the ballot was an act to prohibit tethering or confining a pregnant pig , or a calf raised for veal , in a manner that prevents the animal from turning around freely , lying down , and fully extending his or her limbs . 
Those who know little about modern factory farming may wonder why such legislation would be necessary . 
Under farming methods that were universal 50 years ago , and that are still common in some countries today , all animals have the space to turn around and stretch their limbs . 
Today , however , about 90 % of US breeding sows - the mothers of the pigs that are raised and killed for pork , bacon , and ham - spend most of their lives locked in cages that measure about two feet by seven feet ( 0.6 meters by 2.2 meters ) . 
They are unable to turn around , lie down with their legs fully extended , or move more than a step forward or backward . 
Other sows are kept on short tethers that also prevent them turning around . 
Veal calves are similarly confined for all their lives in individual stalls that do not permit them to turn around , lie down , or stretch their limbs . 
These methods are , essentially , labor-saving devices - they make management of the animals easier and enable units with thousands or tens of thousands of animals to employ fewer and less skilled workers . 
They also prevent the animals from wasting energy by moving around or fighting with each other . 
Several years ago , following protests from animal welfare organizations , the European Union commissioned a report from its Scientific Veterinary Committee on these methods . 
The committee found that animals suffer from being unable to move freely and from the total lack of anything to do all day . 
Common sense would , of course , have reached the same conclusion . 
Following the report , the EU set dates by which close confinement of these animals would be prohibited . 
For veal calves , that date , January 1 , 2007 , is almost here . 
Individual stalls for sows , already outlawed in the United Kingdom and Sweden , will be banned across the entire EU from 2013 . 
Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens , which are typically kept crammed into bare wire cages with no room to stretch their wings , are also being phased in . 
In the US , no such national measures are anywhere in sight . 
In the past , when my European friends have asked me why the US lags so far behind Europe in matters of animal welfare , I have had no answer . 
When they pressed me , I had to admit that the explanation could be that Americans care less about animals than Europeans . 
Then , in 2002 , animal welfare advocates put a proposal to ban sow stalls on the ballot in Florida . 
To the surprise of many , it gained the approval of 55 % of those voting . 
Last month in Arizona , despite well-funded opposition from agribusiness , the ban on small cages for sows and veal calves also passed , with 62 % support . 
Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states - both voted for George W. Bush over John Kerry in 2004 . 
So the results strongly suggest that if all Americans were given a chance to vote on keeping pregnant pigs and calves in such tight confinement , the majority would vote no . 
Americans seem to care just as much about animal welfare as Europeans do . 
So , to explain the gap between Europe and the US on farm animal welfare , we should look to the political system . 
In Europe , the concerns of voters about animal welfare have been effective in influencing members of national parliaments , as well as members of the European Parliament , resulting in national legislation and EU directives that respond to those concerns . 
In the US , by contrast , similar concerns have had no discernible effect on members of Congress . 
There is no federal legislation at all on the welfare of farm animals - and very little state legislation , either . 
That , I believe , is because agribusiness is able to put tens of millions of dollars into the pockets of congressional representatives seeking re-election . 
The animal welfare movement , despite its broad public support , has been unable to compete in the arena of political lobbying and campaign donations . 
In US electoral politics , money counts for more than the opinions of voters . 
Party discipline is weak , and Congressmen must themselves raise most of the money that they need for re-election - and that happens every two years for members of the House of Representatives . 
In Europe , where party discipline is strong and the parties , not the individual candidates , finance election campaigns , money plays a smaller role . 
In the US , a nation that prides itself on its democratic traditions , pigs and calves are hardly the only losers .
