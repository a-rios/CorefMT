Is Ahmadinejad Now Free to Make a Nuclear Deal ? 
BERLIN - In Istanbul this week , representatives of Iran and the &quot; 5 + 1 &quot; group ( the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany ) , led by European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton , will resume talks about Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
No breakthrough is likely , but the outcome could be more favorable than many expect . 
In October 2009 , an initial understanding was reached , according to which Iranian low-enriched uranium ( LEU ) would be delivered to Russia for further enrichment and conversion into fuel rods for the Tehran Research Reactor ( TRR ) . 
But this accord faltered on Iran &apos;s domestic politics : President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s political adversaries effectively blocked it . 
Might the same thing happen again ? 
Ahmadinejad , who was severely weakened after his disputed reelection in 2009 , has now consolidated his position . 
Representatives of his regime are still concerned about what they see as externally backed attempts to stage a &quot; velvet revolution &quot; in the country , but there is little fear of new challenges from within . 
One conservative intellectual put it in almost Nietzschean terms : &quot; Yes , two million people took to the street after the elections . 
But they were voters , not fighters . 
They criticized the situation . 
In other words , there is no will to power on the part of civil society and the opposition . 
Many who protested against the regime in 2009 are disillusioned . 
Ordinary people do not hide their contempt for the regime , but they also see that last year &apos;s mass protests have failed . 
Many have withdrawn into the private sphere - education and culture for some , business for others . 
Visa applications are increasing , indicating preparations for limited or prolonged sojourns abroad . 
While Iran &apos;s leadership continues to repress liberal dissenters , it feels secure enough to talk of &quot; reconciliation &quot; with parts of the &quot; loyal &quot; opposition - Ahmadinejad &apos;s conservative and reform-oriented adversaries who want to preserve the Islamic system as such . 
Within the president &apos;s camp as well , there are discussions about the post-Ahmadinejad era and possible successors to him - all , however , assuming regular presidential elections in 2013 . 
Until then , despite frequently harsh criticism of his performance , the president is seen to have a mandate to govern . 
The effects of the latest round of international sanctions on Iran are somewhat ambiguous : they have weakened the country , but they do not seem to have weakened Ahmadinejad . 
Withdrawal of European companies is delaying necessary investments and forcing Iranian firms to seek less-favored alternatives , mainly in China and Russia . 
Prices are increasing , more transactions are being conducted in cash , and more dubious business figures are arriving from around the world . 
But , while government officials do not deny that sanctions worry them , they point to Iran &apos;s high foreign-currency reserves and the Iranians &quot; creativity in coping with the effects . 
Moreover , Ahmadinejad uses the sanctions as political cover to pursue his economically sound - but deeply unpopular - policy of slashing subsidies on electricity , petrol , and bread . 
Though economic pressure is unlikely to force the regime to abandon uranium enrichment , unity on sanctions among the five permanent Security Council members , and moves by the EU , Japan , and South Korea to sharpen them further has had an impact . 
Most importantly , sanctions have strengthened those within the elite who favor negotiations , and weakened those who are deeply critical of Ahmadinejad &apos;s unhidden interest in doing business with the West , particularly the United States . 
For Ahmadinejad and his supporters , there are two main reasons for engagement with the US . 
Second , Ahmadinejad and the political leadership believe that the regime is under serious threat from the US - and only from the US . 
American officials often underestimate this threat perception and deep suspicion of US intentions , but they are powerful factors in Iranian politics . 
While Iran &apos;s ruling elite appears to be divided over the prospect of a full-scale rapprochement with the US , they share this underlying fear of America and do not want their country to be isolated further . 
Given this background , it is quite possible that this time Iranian domestic politics will not undermine a new agreement to swap Iranian LEU for fuel rods for the TRR . 
The 5 + 1 group has an interest in reducing Iran &apos;s stockpile of LEU and the risk of its use at some point for military purposes . 
Iran , for its part , has an interest in securing both the supply of fuel rods for the TRR and the international community &apos;s implicit acceptance of its uranium-enrichment efforts , as well as in engaging with the US . 
Any such deal will be possible only if it responds to both sides &quot; interests . 
It would certainly help if Iran began the talks with a commitment to end its enrichment of uranium to the level of 20 % .Even Iranian officials admit that there is no ( civilian ) purpose for such a program if the 20 % enriched fuel rods for the TRR are actually produced in Russia . 
Another clear signal of Iran &apos;s intention to settle the dispute would be progress toward ratification by Iran &apos;s parliament of the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
The 5 + 1 , for their part , should indicate that an eventual agreement on the basis of &quot; minimum enrichment and maximum controls &quot; is possible . 
Agreement on a LEU fuel swap would not resolve the nuclear dispute between Iran and the West , but it would open the door for a diplomatic process that could eventually reach the core of the problem - Iran &apos;s uranium enrichment and the risks of diversion for military purposes . 
If the Istanbul talks go well , they could provide a road map for further negotiations , not only on the nuclear issue , but also on Afghanistan , the Middle East , and terrorism . 
Even if they only provide an avenue for bilateral engagement between the US and Iran , they will still prove to be worth the effort .
