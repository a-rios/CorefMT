Homesick Politics 
MADRID - World order - or the lack thereof - is a hot topic these days . 
Our fixation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere - in the news and at conferences , on bestseller lists , even in popular television shows . 
People are anxious . 
The world seems to be undergoing fundamental change : new actors are emerging on the world stage , previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied , and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors . 
In our quest for structure and predictability - a natural impulse in times of rapid change - we are desperate for hints about how the world , and our role in it , will develop . 
It is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best , or at least the most feasible , way forward ; predictability provides a foundation for cost-benefit analysis and strategic thinking . 
The problem arises when our yearning for certainty overwhelms rational thinking , taking our ideas and actions in an unproductive - or even dangerous - direction . 
The current trend toward rose-colored retrospection is a case in point . 
Faced with political , economic , geostrategic , and social uncertainty , policymakers have increasingly succumbed to the allure of nostalgia , promising a return to what they portray as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past . 
In Russia , President Vladimir Putin has been operating according to a nineteenth-century worldview , in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence unchallenged . 
As he noted at last October &apos;s meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club , &quot; The bear will not even bother to ask permission . 
Here , we consider it the master of the taiga . &quot; 
The Islamic State is attempting to return to an even more distant past . 
Its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate , in which &quot; the legality of all emirates , groups , states , and organizations becomes null &quot; and summary execution and slavery are mandatory . 
The West , too , has fallen into the trap of nostalgia , clinging to a late-twentieth-century conception of order in which it makes the rules and can choose whether to follow them . 
The latest example of this anachronistic perspective is America &apos;s ham-fisted ( not to mention failed ) attempt to stem support for the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , after repeatedly refusing to provide a greater voice for the world &apos;s emerging powers in the Bretton Woods institutions . 
Nostalgia has also emerged as a major factor in many countries &quot; domestic affairs . 
Throughout Europe , populist parties - from the right-wing United Kingdom Independence Party to the far-left Syriza in Greece - seek a return to the ostensibly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders . 
In the US , a prominent strain of jurisprudence defends the &quot; original intent &quot; of the Constitution &apos;s framers , while Republicans are shifting toward isolationism and Democrats are denouncing free-trade agreements . 
But nostalgia offers no solutions - only a dream of escape . 
Looking backward gets us no closer to what we want ; on the contrary , it is a surefire way to miss the challenges - and miss out on the opportunities - that lie before us . 
Trying to advance one &apos;s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today &apos;s crossword puzzle using yesterday &apos;s clues . 
Let &apos;s face it : the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return - before , say , the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation-state - never really existed . 
As Marcel Proust noted : &quot; Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were . &quot; 
The past is being abridged and sugarcoated in order to portray it as superior to the widespread tumult and misery of today . 
Over time , nostalgia has come to have a benign connotation . 
But the word - a combination of the Greek nostos ( homecoming ) and algos ( pain ) - was coined to describe the disease of &quot; acute homesickness . &quot; 
Perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostalgia , at least in its political manifestation , as something more akin to an illness : a condition that distorts reality and impedes the formulation of effective solutions for real-world challenges . 
No worldview rooted in the nineteenth century - much less in the ninth century - is adequate to the complexities of today &apos;s globalized world . 
Likewise , the rise of new powers and non-state actors means that rule making ( and breaking ) can no longer be restricted to a small Western club . 
And the intensity of global competition means that European countries cannot hope to thrive independently of one another . 
Flimsy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative . 
But , rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia , we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them .
