Syria \ u0027s Culture of Fear and Stalemate 
It is not surprising that the new , young leader of an Arab country should be tremendously concerned , during his first years in office , with establishing his legitimacy and stature . 
In replacing his father , the late President Hafiz al-Assad , Syria &apos;s current President , Bashar al-Assad , urgently needed to demonstrate his command of his country &apos;s situation even more than other relatively new Arab leaders , such as Jordan &apos;s King Abdullah or Morocco &apos;s King Muhammad . 
For Bashar al-Assad selection as the replacement for his father , within minutes of Assad &apos;s death on June 10 , 2000 , had stunned Syria &apos;s entire system , despite the years of preparing public opinion for this succession . 
Having failed to put forward a clear and effective program of internal reform , the young President sought to make up for his domestic failure in the realm of foreign affairs . 
Here , no surprise , the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict provided the most visible opportunity to establish his leadership credentials , especially in the aftermath of the democratic election of Ariel Sharon as Israel &apos;s new Prime Minister , a man reviled in the Arab world . 
During the recent Arab Summit in Beirut , the young President capitalized on the absence of the Egyptian , Libyan and Palestinian leaders ( among others ) to strike a positive chord with audiences in Syria and across the Arab world . 
In a well-rehearsed , self-assured manner reminiscent of his late father , Bashar al-Assad aimed a provocative lecture at his colleagues , supporting the Palestinians &apos; &quot; right of resistance , &quot; calling upon Arab countries to sever their relations with Israel , urging an Iraqi-Kuwaiti reconciliation , and endorsing Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah &apos;s peace initiative . 
With these demands , the young President emerged in many Syrian eyes as the summit &apos;s &quot; Man of the Hour , &quot; a leader with a deep understanding of the issues at hand . 
Through his confident performance , the new President gained in stature . 
More importantly , his performance deflected attention from any consideration of economic or political reform within Syria , at least for now . 
Initially , President Bashar &apos;s accession to power was accompanied by a modest , but noticeable political thaw . 
Popular forums and private discussion clubs sprung up across Syria , allowing relatively open debate . 
After a few months , these popular forums were brought to an abrupt halt , as security services enforced a stringent set of regulations that effectively closed these open gatherings . 
The shortness of this Syrian &quot; spring &quot; came as a hard blow to the expectations of many of the country &apos;s intellectuals and professionals , young and old . 
This blow was felt all the more sharply as it became obvious that curtailment of these popular forums did not stir a wide public reaction . 
Forced to recognize the prospect of being marginalized yet again by the new government , Syrian intellectuals turned their attention to Sharon and the growing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians . 
Once again , the Palestinian cause became a substitute for focused attention on Syria &apos;s domestic situation , offering Syrian intellectuals and professionals a politically safe way to vent their frustrations . 
As for the Syrian &quot; Street , &quot; that amorphous mixture of average citizens and popular consensus , not only did it lack any sympathy for the intellectuals , it also failed to show any systematic interest in domestic politics . 
The main concerns of the average Syrian , it seems , are definite improvements in living standards and a reduction in the high unemployment rate . 
Broader concerns about reform - civil law , women &apos;s rights , and the role of religion in society - remain issues that the Syrian Street prefers to avoid . 
For better or worse , restrictions in these areas are well-understood constants of Syrian life . 
Challenging them in difficult and insecure times is not an appealing prospect . 
The passivity of Syrian society is the result of a tacit agreement between people and government . 
The government does not dabble too much in social affairs , while the people do not involve themselves too much in internal politics . 
Meanwhile , the Arab-Israeli conflict serves as a mutually agreed upon rallying point for Syria &apos;s government and governed . 
As the pretext for ignoring the repression of basic freedoms , that conflict has come to be described in powerful national and religious rhetoric throughout Syrian society . 
What might otherwise be seen as a political conflict has acquired significant socio-cultural dimensions . 
It is therefore legitimate to wonder whether Syria &apos;s President can act with any real initiative toward the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
Despite the dictatorial nature of his regime , President al-Assad still needs to satisfy popular sentiment regarding Israel . 
To betray this consensus runs the risk of mobilizing people on behalf of other , more domestically-oriented concerns . 
This is the risk of all popular mobilization in the Middle East ; 
Syria simply exhibits a more potent version of it .
