Greenspan Has Left the Building 
BERKELEY - The first time I went to Washington , DC , as an adult was in 1993 , when I arrived to work for President Bill Clinton in the Treasury Department . 
Back then , America urgently needed to rebalance the federal budget to rein in explosive growth in the debt / GDP ratio ; to overhaul America &apos;s extraordinarily expensive and inefficient health-care system ; and to begin to deal with global warming via a slow ramp-up of a carbon tax . 
Beyond these three immediate issues were long-run policy challenges : updating the country &apos;s pension system to deal with an aging population and the decline of defined-benefit pensions ; improving the education system so that more people would bear the risk of pursuing higher education ; and reversing the erosion of America as a middle-class society . 
None of these goals ( perhaps with the exception of the last one ) were partisan issues . 
The long-run deficit , health-care financing , and global warming , no less than securing retirement income and enabling educational opportunity , were issues on which bipartisan progress and agreement should have been easily attained . 
Yet we Clintonites received absolutely no cooperation from either Republican officeholders or Republican policy intellectuals . 
Figures like Senators Pete Domenici and Alan Simpson , who talked a good game about the long-run deficit , never met a budget-busting Republican program that they would oppose or a deficit-reducing Democratic initiative that they could support . 
Economists who , under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush , talked such a good game about excessive tax burdens and the importance of balanced budgets went very quiet after Clinton took office in January 1993 , and stayed quiet after January 2001 , when George W. Bush &apos;s administration dismantled so much of what the Clinton administration had accomplished . 
But back in 1993 there was one exception - one senior Republican officeholder and policy intellectual who did not forget his policy commitments of earlier years : US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan . 
For Greenspan , putting the long-run financing of America &apos;s federal government on a sound footing was an important and bipartisan goal , and in 1993-1994 he was willing to take monetary-policy risks to boost the chances of achieving it . 
The Fed , in Greenspan &apos;s view , had a responsibility not only to fight inflation but also to create a prosperous , entrepreneurial society , and he sought to achieve that dual mandate - with high employment as important as stable prices - during the high-tech boom of the late 1990 &quot; s . 
Unique among his Republican peers , after 2001 he spoke - quietly in public , but loudly in private - against the Bush administration &apos;s feckless fiscal policies . 
That is why , despite the damage that his reputation suffered in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , Greenspan retains enormous credibility among all those who hope to see rational economic policy in America . 
If there are going to be sensible negotiating partners on the Republican side , he should be at their head . 
That is why I find his new book , The Map and the Territory , so disappointing . 
Greenspan portrays the US Department of Housing and Urban Development and its affordable-housing goals as playing a big role in causing the 2008 crisis . 
Moreover , he claims that the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation is a large factor holding back the recovery . 
Likewise , he argues that the Earned Income Tax Credit - enacted in 1975 under Republican President Gerald Ford and expanded greatly under Reagan - is a threat to Americans &quot; moral fiber . 
Too much of the book reads , as the Washington Post &apos;s Steven Pearlstein put it , like it was lifted from the Web site of Mitt Romney &apos;s 2012 presidential campaign . 
The six problems that confronted me and others when we arrived in Washington in 1993 have not been solved . 
The long-run fiscal situation remains discouraging , if not as dire as we feared it would become . 
Health-care financing remains a mess , even if we have considerable reason to hope that Obamacare has started to address the problem . 
And we have made no progress on global warming , preserving a middle-class society , or improving the education system to make equality of opportunity a reality . 
Nor have we dealt with the likely shortfall of pension income and assets in an aging America . 
But that is not what Greenspan sees . 
For him , all of these problems boil down to a simple question : &quot; What type of society do we wish to live in ? &quot; 
That is not an analysis ; it is a sound bite . 
At a time when America desperately needs insight and ideas , Greenspan gives us only partisan bludgeons . 
That is bad news for those of us who would like to see an effective , technocratic economic-policymaking process emerge in Washington . 
We must somehow come to grips with the fact that we no longer have negotiating partners on the Republican side .
