Alpine Schadenfreude 
Not surprisingly , the atmosphere at this year &apos;s World Economic Forum was grim . 
Those who think that globalization , technology , and the market economy will solve the world &apos;s problems seemed subdued . 
Most chastened of all were the bankers . 
Against the backdrop of the sub-prime crisis , the disasters at many financial institutions , and the weakening of the stock market , these &quot; masters of the universe &quot; seemed less omniscient than they did a short while ago . 
And it was not just the bankers who were in the Davos doghouse this year , but also their regulators - the central bankers . 
Anyone who goes to international conferences is used to hearing Americans lecture everyone else about transparency . 
There was still some of that at Davos . 
I heard the usual suspects - including a former treasury secretary who had been particularly vociferous in such admonishments during the East Asia crisis - bang on about the need for transparency at sovereign wealth funds ( though not at American or European hedge funds ) . 
But this time , developing countries could not resist commenting on the hypocrisy of it all . There was even a touch of schadenfreude in the air about the problems the United States is having right now - though it was moderated , of course , by worries about the downturn &apos;s impact on their own economies . 
Had America really told others to bring in American banks to teach them about how to run their business ? 
Had America really boasted about its superior risk management systems , going so far as to develop a new regulatory system ( called Basle II ) ? 
Basle II is dead - at least until memories of the current disaster fade . 
Bankers - and the rating agencies - believed in financial alchemy . 
They thought that financial innovations could somehow turn bad mortgages into good securities , meriting AAA ratings . 
But one lesson of modern finance theory is that , in well functioning financial markets , repackaging risks should not make much difference . 
If we know the price of cream and the price of skim milk , we can figure out the price of milk with 1 % cream , 2 % cream , or 4 % cream . 
There might be some money in repackaging , but not the billions that banks made by slicing and dicing sub-prime mortgages into packages whose value was much greater than their contents . 
It seemed too good to be true - and it was . 
Worse , banks failed to understand the first principle of risk management : diversification only works when risks are not correlated , and macro-shocks ( such as those that affect housing prices or borrowers &quot; ability to repay ) affect the probability of default for all mortgages . 
I argued at Davos that central bankers also got it wrong by misjudging the threat of a downturn and failing to provide sufficient regulation . 
They waited too long to take action . 
Because it normally takes a year or more for the full effects of monetary policy to be felt , central banks need to act preemptively , not reactively . 
Worse , the US Federal Reserve and its previous chairman , Alan Greenspan , may have helped create the problem , encouraging households to take on risky variable-rate mortgages by reassuring those who worried about a housing bubble that there was at most a little &quot; froth &quot; in the market . 
Normally , a Davos audience would rally to the support of the central bankers . 
This time , a vote at the end of the session supported my view by a margin of three to one . 
Even the plea of one of central banker that &quot; no one could have predicted the problems &quot; moved few in the audience - perhaps because several people sitting there had , like me , explicitly warned about the impending problem in previous years . 
The only thing we got wrong was how bad banks &quot; lending practices were , how non-transparent banks really were , and how inadequate their risk management systems were . 
It was interesting to see the different cultural attitudes to the crisis on display . 
In Japan , the CEO of a major bank would have apologized to his employees and his country , and would have refused his pension and bonus so that those who suffered as a result of corporate failures could share the money . 
He would have resigned . 
In America , the only questions are whether a board will force a CEO to leave and , if so , how big his severance package will be . 
When I asked one CEO whether there was any discussion of returning their bonuses , the response was not just no , but an aggressive defense of the bonus system . 
This is the third US crisis in the past 20 years , after the Savings 
Deregulation has not worked . 
Unfettered markets may produce big bonuses for CEO &apos;s , but they do not lead , as if by an invisible hand , to societal well-being . 
Until we achieve a better balance between markets and government , the world will continue to pay a high price .
