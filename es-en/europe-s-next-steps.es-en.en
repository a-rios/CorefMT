Europe &apos;s Next Steps 
Terrorism in London and the French and Dutch rejections of the European Union &apos;s Constitutional Treaty have brought Euro-pessimism back into fashion . 
The failure of the June EU summit and the bitter clashes between Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac have even inspired some to proclaim the beginning of the end for Europe . 
They are wrong . 
Europe is neither dead nor dying . 
That vision , however , was not in the cards even before the recent setbacks . 
Once the original six core countries began to expand to include northern , southern , and , most recently , eastern European countries , the old federal vision was doomed . 
The constitution was designed to make a Europe of 25 members more efficient , not produce a strong federal state . 
Chirac &apos;s rhetoric often includes references to a &quot; multi-polar world &quot; in which the United States is no longer the only superpower . 
A recent Pew poll found that many Europeans have lost their attraction to the US and would like Europe to play a larger role in world politics . 
Even so , the picture for Europe is not as bleak as pessimists assume . 
Power in world politics today is distributed like a three-dimensional chess game that is played vertically as well as horizontally . 
On the top board of military relations among states , the US is the world &apos;s only superpower with global reach . 
Europe or China are unlikely to overtake the Americans in the next two decades . 
Here the world is uni-polar . 
On the middle board of economic relations , the world is already multi-polar . 
This is the board where Europe acts as a union , and other countries like Japan and China play significant roles . 
The US cannot reach a trade agreement or settle anti-trust cases without the approval of the EU Commission . 
Just recently , after the World Trade Organization ruled in favor of a European complaint , the US Congress had to rewrite billions of dollars of tax legislation . 
The bottom board includes transnational relations that cross borders outside the control of governments - everything from drugs to infectious diseases to climate change to transnational terrorism . 
On this board , power is distributed chaotically among non-state actors . 
No government can control outcomes without the cooperation of others . 
Here the US needs the help of Europeans , and it makes no sense to call this world uni-polar , either . 
On this bottom board , the degree of close civilian cooperation is also important , which is affected by a country &apos;s attractiveness or soft power . 
Here European countries are well endowed , having overcome centuries of animosity and developing a large successful market . 
One danger of the recent setbacks is a halt to EU enlargement . 
At the Cold War &apos;s end , East European countries did not try to form local alliances , as they did in the 1920 &quot; s , but looked toward Brussels as the magnet for their futures . 
Similarly , countries like Turkey and Ukraine have adjusted their policies because they are attracted to Europe . 
The loss of soft power implied by rejection of further enlargement would be a setback for Europe , the Balkans , and international stability . 
What will the EU do next ? 
Some counsel retreating to the original six countries as an inner core that creates a federation within the larger union . 
This approach appeals to those who think that the French and Dutch referendums were a rejection of the British liberal economic model . 
But that diagnosis is suspect , because polls show that many who voted &quot; non &quot; were objecting to Chirac and / or to high rates of unemployment . 
Turning backward and inward to the original six EU members is unlikely to meet such concerns , and augurs poorly for the liberalization of labor markets that Europe &apos;s economies need to get moving . 
A better path for the EU is to show that Europe still works . 
It also means carrying on with the important role that Europe plays in foreign policy such as attracting Serbia to reach agreement on the future status of Kosovo , or continuing efforts to persuade Iran to give up its plans for the enrichment of uranium . 
Equally important will be to press ahead with the Doha round of WTO trade talks , and to follow through with past commitments regarding aid to Africa . 
Eventually , after the dust has settled , it may be possible to reach inter-governmental agreements to tidy up some of the institutional arrangements that would have been settled if the new constitution had been approved . 
Such a practical , effective EU may not reach the lofty rhetorical aspirations beloved by politicians , but it will not be moribund . 
On the contrary , such a Europe has a lot to gain for itself as well as to contribute to the rest of the world .
