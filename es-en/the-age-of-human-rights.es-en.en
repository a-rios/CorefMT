The Age of Human Rights 
NEW YORK : At the dawn of the 21st century , the United Nations has become more central to the lives of more people than ever . 
Through our work in development , peacekeeping , the environment and health , we are helping nations and communities to build a better , freer , more prosperous future . 
Above all we have committed ourselves to the idea that no individual - regardless of gender , ethnicity or race - shall have his or her human rights abused or ignored . 
This idea is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
It is the source of our greatest inspiration and the impulse for our greatest efforts . 
Today , we know more than ever that without respect for the rights of the individual , no nation , no community , no society can be truly free . 
Whether it means advancing development , emphasizing the importance of preventive action , or intervening - even across state boundaries - to stop gross and systematic violations of human rights , the individual has been the focus of our concerns . 
The promotion and defense of human rights is at the heart of every aspect of our work and every article of the United Nations &apos; Charter . 
Above all , I believe human rights are at the core of our sacred bond with the peoples of the United Nations . 
When civilians are attacked and massacred because of their ethnicity , as in Kosovo , the world looks to the United Nations to speak up for them . 
When men , women and children are assaulted and their limbs hacked off , as in Sierra Leone , here again the world looks to the United Nations . 
When women and girls are denied their right to equality , as in Afghanistan , the world looks to the United Nations to take a stand . 
Perhaps more than any other aspect of our work , the struggle for human rights resonates with our global constituency , and is deeply relevant to the lives of those most in need - the tortured , the oppressed , the silenced , and the victims of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; and injustice . 
If , in the face of such abuses , we do not speak up and speak out , if we do not act in defense of human rights and advocate their lasting universality , how can we answer that global constituency ? 
For in a world where globalization has limited the ability of states to control their economies , regulate their financial policies , and isolate themselves from environmental damage and human migration , the last right of states cannot and must not be the right to enslave , persecute or torture their own citizens . 
The UN &apos;s achievements in the area of human rights over the last fifty years are rooted in the universal acceptance of the rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration , and in the growing abhorrence of practices for which there can be no excuse , in any culture , under any circumstance . 
Still , I believe it is not enough for the United Nations to be known by what we are against . 
The world needs to know who we are against , no less . 
In the age of human rights , the United Nations must have the courage to recognize that just as there are common aims , there are common enemies . 
We should leave no one in doubt that for the mass murderers , the &quot; ethnic cleansers , &quot; those guilty of gross and shocking violations of human rights , impunity is unacceptable . 
The United Nations will never be their refuge , its Charter never the source of comfort or justification . 
Perhaps the most important challenge lies in combating the most outrageous violations in the field of human rights - the gross violations , which in too many cases include summary executions , widespread forced displacements , massacres , and indiscriminate attacks on civilians . 
Of all gross violations , genocide knows no parallel in human history . 
The tragic irony of this age of human rights - where greater numbers are enjoying human rights than perhaps ever in history - is that it has been repeatedly darkened by outbursts of indiscriminate violence and organized mass killings . 
In Cambodia , in the 1970s , up to two million people were killed by Pol Pot &apos;s regime . 
And in the 1990s , from Bosnia to Rwanda , thousands upon thousands of human beings were massacred for belonging to the wrong ethnicity . 
Each time the world says &quot; never again . &quot; 
Yet it happens again . 
The vicious and systematic campaign of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; conducted by Serbian authorities in Kosovo appeared to have one aim : to expel or kill as many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo as possible , thereby denying a people their most basic rights to life , liberty and security . 
The result was a humanitarian disaster throughout the entire region . 
We all deeply regret that the international community , despite months of diplomatic efforts , failed to prevent this disaster . 
What gives me hope - and should give every future &quot; ethnic cleanser &quot; and every state-backed architect of mass murder pause - is that a universal sense of outrage was provoked leading to the eventual return of the Albanian population to Kosovo . 
Emerging slowly , but I believe surely , is an international norm against the violent repression of minorities , which will and must take precedence over concerns of state sovereignty . 
It is a principle that protects minorities - and majorities - from gross violations . 
Let me therefore be very clear : even though we are an organization of Member States , the rights and ideals the United Nations exists to protect are those of peoples . 
No government has the right to hide behind national sovereignty in order to violate the human rights or fundamental freedoms of its peoples . 
Whether a person belongs to the minority or the majority , that person &apos;s human rights and fundamental freedoms are sacred .
