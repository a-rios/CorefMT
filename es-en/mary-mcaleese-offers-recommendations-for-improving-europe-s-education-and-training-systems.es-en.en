Europe &apos;s Educational Evolution 
DUBLIN - Europe is grappling with great challenges - too great for any one country to address . 
Facing economic crisis , widespread unemployment , and rising competition from developing economies , Europe must adjust to technological advances and new modes of working - all while an aging population puts increasing strain on exhausted public budgets . 
In this fragile context , the European Union must focus on education in order to nurture people &apos;s talents and potential , and thus to spur economic and social recovery . 
Education holds the key not only to better jobs and stronger GDP growth , but also to the cultural , political , and social development that is needed to ensure that citizens are well-rounded and grounded enough to lead at the local , national , and international levels . 
By focusing on the right policies , EU leaders can ensure that Europeans &quot; education enables them to be articulate global citizens and potent economic actors . 
The good news is that European leaders seem to recognize the value of the pursuit of knowledge . 
When allocating funds in the 2014-2020 European budget , EU governments wisely decided to increase funding for education and research - the only areas in which they did so . 
This commitment to safeguarding education and research funding should be reflected at all levels of policymaking . 
Moreover , in order to drive Europe &apos;s transformation into a hub of responsible innovation and ethically sound production , policymakers must ensure that higher-education institutions equip students with cutting-edge knowledge and high-level flexible skills grounded in shared values . 
This means developing differentiated education systems , ranging from vocational schools to doctoral programs , and giving students access to international experience , which can expose them to opportunities beyond national frontiers . 
For example , the Erasmus program , which enables university students to study or work abroad as part of their degree , broadens participants &quot; outlook while enhancing their willingness and ability to go where the jobs are . 
Such programs also enrich local students and offer valuable insights to professors about other traditions of higher education . 
Furthermore , EU leaders must recognize that high-quality instruction is as central to universities as , say , pioneering research . 
As it stands , while everyone agrees that researchers need extensive training , the prevailing assumption is that great teachers are born and great teaching just happens - a view that is hampering education at all levels . 
Improving the quality of instruction in higher education is at the focus of the first report to the European Commission by the High-Level Group on the Modernization of Higher Education ( of which I am President ) . 
Among the report &apos;s 16 recommendations is to develop quality teaching through compulsory continuous professional training , and to recognize and reward achievement . 
This approach would give educators the skills and motivation that they require to provide the kind of education that Europe needs . 
Another crucial issue - and the topic of the group &apos;s next report - concerns new modes of delivering education , such as Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) . 
In fact , some claim that a revolution in the way knowledge and information is created and transmitted is imminent . 
While these new modes of delivery are undoubtedly transforming education , especially higher education , what is happening may be more evolution than revolution . 
In other words , rather than bringing about the end of brick-and-mortar education , MOOCs and other innovations will spur the progression to so-called &quot; click-and-mortar &quot; education . 
This suggests that the group &apos;s recommendations in this area will include complementary improvements to existing formal and non-formal systems , as well as mechanisms for reviving lifelong learning in higher education . 
For students , the foundations for success must be laid early , beginning with pre-primary and primary education . 
And policymakers must recognize the risk of perpetuating a digital divide that favors those who are already advantaged . 
Studies show , for example , that the vast majority of participants in MOOCs - which have been praised for their supposed accessibility - already have higher-education qualifications . 
Europe &apos;s leaders must work to ensure that new modes of delivering education translate into better opportunities for a broader range of people . 
The pace and scope of technological progress makes predicting impending developments , and how they will affect education , virtually impossible . 
Regardless of which new technologies arise , however , education will boil down to teachers and students . 
Providing tools and opportunities that support the evolution of their respective roles is essential to creating a labor force capable of adapting to changing circumstances . 
That is the real challenge facing Europe .
