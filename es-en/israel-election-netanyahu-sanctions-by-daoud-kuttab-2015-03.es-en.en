Isolating Israel 
RAMALLAH - Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu certainly has reason to celebrate . 
He surprised nearly everyone by securing a decisive electoral victory , winning a third consecutive term in office after his right-wing Likud party gained a five-seat advantage in the Knesset over its main rival , the center-left Zionist Union . 
But the celebration is likely to be short . 
The way Netanyahu finagled this outcome - renouncing his commitment to a two-state solution with Palestine and pledging to continue building settlements on occupied land - will almost certainly have serious political and diplomatic consequences for Israel . 
In recent years , Netanyahu &apos;s hardline stance has increasingly undermined Israel &apos;s international credibility , while convincing the Palestinians living in the occupied territories that a genuine agreement with Israel is impossible . 
( Indeed , Palestinians showed little interest in the outcome of this election . ) 
Now that Netanyahu has intensified his right-wing rhetoric - and been rewarded with another term in power - the international movement to isolate Israel will only gain momentum . 
After all , support for direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine no longer makes sense , even for Israel &apos;s main ally , the United States , because the assumptions underlying this approach have been demolished . 
The first such assumption was that both parties accepted the two-state solution as the general basis for a compromise agreement . 
And , indeed , at Bar Ilan University in 2009 , Netanyahu declared his willingness to accept the creation of a Palestinian state , on the condition that it be demilitarized and that the Palestinians recognize Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people . 
This is no longer the case : two days before the election , Netanyahu explicitly vowed that his government would never allow Palestinian statehood . 
The second key assumption underlying peace negotiations was that Israel , as a democratic country , would not want to rule another people through military occupation - thereby denying them their basic human right of self-determination - in perpetuity . 
But Netanyahu has now shown that Israel is a democracy only for its Jewish citizens , dismissing Israel &apos;s Arab citizens , who comprise 20 % of the country &apos;s population , in blatantly racist terms . 
In the last hours of the election , Netanyahu called on Jewish Israelis to turn out , because &quot; the Arabs are voting in droves . &quot; 
By eliminating the two assumptions critical to negotiations with the Palestinians , Israel &apos;s current leadership - and , indirectly , the majority of Israelis - has destroyed the thin veneer of legitimacy that the international community had erected around a country that has been occupying another people for nearly five decades . 
The justification for not censoring Israel too harshly in international institutions or using boycotts to punish Israel for war crimes is no longer valid . 
Obviously , some groups have long recognized the need for sterner measures . 
Most notably , in 2005 Palestinians living in the diaspora and others launched the international boycotts , divestment , and sanctions ( BDS ) movement , with the goal of compelling Israel to stop violating international law , particularly with its settlement policies . 
The BDS movement has met significant resistance in many parts of the world , owing to the belief that its tactics are unnecessary and unhelpful . 
That will now change . 
Similarly , the US opposed the move by Palestine - a United Nations-recognized non-member observer state - to join the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) . 
Despite the lack of progress in peace negotiations , American leaders continued to believe in Israel &apos;s democracy and willingness to pursue a two-state solution . 
That , too , will change . 
Simply put , now that Israel &apos;s leaders have renounced their commitment to a negotiated peace with Palestine , the international community can no longer justify the prevailing approach . 
Moreover , world leaders should support Palestine &apos;s efforts to resolve its conflicts with Israel through neutral international agencies like the ICC . 
And international forums like the United Nations Security Council must condemn Israel &apos;s refusal to end its 47-year occupation , making it clear that the country will no longer benefit from a diplomatic double standard . 
In 1990 , when Saddam Hussein sent Iraqi forces to occupy Kuwait , claiming that he was retaking lost territory , the UN Security Council voted , based on chapter seven of the UN charter , to punish Iraq by imposing a strict financial and trade embargo . 
Likewise , when apartheid South Africa refused to provide its black majority with their fundamental human rights , the international community supported a major campaign of divestment and sanctions . 
Today , Israel is relying on historical claims to occupy another people . 
Its government , which has revealed its racist underpinnings , is denying four million Palestinians basic rights , and even using military force against them . 
The international community needs to respond accordingly , intensifying boycotts , divestments , and sanctions , until Palestinians are allowed to live freely in a truly independent state alongside Israel .
