The Wrong Tax for Europe 
CAMBRIDGE - Europe is already in pickle , so why not add more vinegar ? 
That seems to be the thinking behind the European Commission &apos;s proposed financial transactions tax ( FTT ) - the Commission &apos;s latest response to Europe &apos;s festering growth and financing problems . 
The emotional appeal of a tax on all financial transactions is undeniable . 
Ordinary Europeans have to pay value-added tax on most of the goods and services that they buy , so why not tax purchases of stocks , bonds , and all kinds of derivatives ? 
Surely , such a tax will hit wealthy individuals and financial firms far more than anyone else , and , besides , it will raise a ton of revenue . 
Indeed , the European Commission estimates that its proposed tax of only 0.1 % on stock and bond trades , and 0.01 % tax on derivatives , will raise more than â‚¬ 50 billion per year . 
As a bonus , an FTT will curb destabilizing speculation in financial markets . 
If only it were so simple . 
Of course , taxation of financial firms &quot; profits and bonuses should be made more similar to that of other economic activities . 
Excessive leverage needs to be reined in . 
A return to pre-2007 levels of macroeconomic and financial stability would support growth . 
Unfortunately , much as FTTs are the darling of leading liberal economic commentators and Robin Hood NGOs , they are an extremely misguided approach to achieving such worthy ends . 
True , great thinkers like John Maynard Keynes and the late Nobel laureate James Tobin floated various ideas for taxing financial transactions as a way to reduce economic volatility . 
( Tobin &apos;s tax applied specifically to foreign-exchange trading . ) 
But , since then , the idea has received close attention from many economic researchers , and , frankly , it is hard to find their research results supportive . 
Such taxes surely reduce liquidity in financial markets . 
With fewer trades , the information content of prices is arguably reduced . 
But both theoretical and simulation results suggest no obvious decline in volatility . 
And , while raising so much revenue with so low a tax rate sounds grand , the declining volume of trades would shrink the tax base precipitously . 
As a result , the ultimate revenue gains are likely to prove disappointing , as Sweden discovered when it attempted to tax financial transactions two decades ago . 
Worse still , over the long run , the tax burden would shift . 
Higher transactions taxes increase the cost of capital , ultimately lowering investment . 
With a lower capital stock , output would trend downward , reducing government revenues and substantially offsetting the direct gain from the tax . 
In the long run , wages would fall , and ordinary workers would end up bearing a significant share of the cost . 
More broadly , FTTs violate the general public-finance principle that it is inefficient to tax intermediate factors of production , particularly ones that are highly mobile and fluid in their response . 
All of this is well known , even if prominent opinion leaders , politicians , and philanthropists prefer to ignore it . 
The European Commission has surely been strongly cautioned by the Fiscal Affairs Department at the International Monetary Fund , whose economists have thoroughly catalogued the pros and cons of FTTs . 
So why did the Commission go forward with the idea ? 
The most generous interpretation is that the Commission simply does not believe economists &quot; estimates and analysis , and views an FTT as more workable than is commonly realized ( a scenario that calls to mind the debate surrounding the creation of the euro ) . 
It is true that Latin American governments , particularly the Brazilian authorities , succeeded in raising more revenue from taxes on bank withdrawals ( a crude version of an FTT ) than most policy analysts thought possible . 
On the other hand , Latin America &apos;s long-term growth record is hardly an advertisement for the approach , and accounting for lost tax revenues due to lower GDP would surely yield a less impressive fiscal outcome . 
Another possibility is that the Europeans concluded that an FTT &apos;s political advantages outweigh its economic flaws . 
After all , there certainly is a case to be made that an FTT has so much gut-level popular appeal that politically powerful financial interests could not block it . 
One can almost buy this idea , except that the tax is so counterproductive in the long run that it is hardly obvious that it would be better than nothing . 
There are more cynical interpretations of the European Commission &apos;s motives . 
Perhaps officials noticed that virtually everything in Europe is already heavily taxed . 
So , rather than finance the European Union &apos;s institutions through greater contributions from existing tax bases , they are seeking a consensus for new revenue sources . 
Or perhaps the Commission realizes that the FTT will be dead on arrival , owing to disputes within Europe , and simply wants to gain political capital from an enormously popular proposal . 
After the financial crisis erupted with full force in 2008 , former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker claimed that the only worthwhile financial innovation in recent decades was the ATM . 
And , as the Oscar-winning documentary Inside Job rightly points out , no one whose other , less useful innovations helped cause the financial crisis - politicians , financiers , and many others - has really paid a price . 
There is , in short , ample reason to be angry at financiers , and real change is needed in how they operate . 
But the FTT , despite its noble intellectual lineage , is no solution to Europe &apos;s problems - or to the world &apos;s .
