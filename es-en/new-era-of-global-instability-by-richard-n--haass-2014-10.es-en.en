The Era of Disorder 
NEW YORK - Historical eras are difficult to recognize before they end . 
The Renaissance became the Renaissance only in retrospect ; the same can be said for the Dark Ages that preceded it and any number of other eras . 
The reason is simple : It is impossible to know if some promising or troubling development stands alone or represents the start of a lasting trend . 
Nonetheless , I would argue that we are witnessing the end of one era of world history and the dawn of another . 
It has been 25 years since the Berlin Wall was dismantled , bringing the 40-year Cold War to an end . 
What followed was an era of American preeminence , increased prosperity for many , the emergence of a large number of relatively open societies and political systems , and widespread peace , including considerable cooperation among the major powers . 
Now that era , too , has ended , ushering in a far less orderly and peaceful epoch . 
The Middle East is in the early phases of a modern-day Thirty Years &quot; War , in which political and religious loyalties are destined to fuel prolonged and sometimes savage conflicts within and across national borders . 
With its behavior in Ukraine and elsewhere , Russia has challenged what had been a mostly stable European order founded on the legal principle that territory may not be acquired by military force . 
Asia , for its part , has remained mostly at peace . 
Meanwhile , global efforts to slow climate change , promote trade , set new rules for the digital age , and prevent or contain outbreaks of infectious diseases are inadequate . 
Some of the reasons why this is happening reflect fundamental changes in the world , including the diffusion of power to an increasing number of states and non-state actors , ranging from terrorist organizations and militias to corporations and NGOs . 
Managing greenhouse-gas emissions and global flows of drugs , arms , terrorists , and pathogens would be no easy task under the best of circumstances ; it is made more difficult by a lack of consensus on what to do and a lack of will to act even when agreement exists . 
Other reasons for growing global disorder have to do with the United States . 
The 2003 Iraq War exacerbated Sunni-Shia tensions and removed a critical barrier to Iranian ambitions . 
More recently , the US called for regime change in Syria , but then did little to bring it about , even after government forces , ignoring American warnings , repeatedly used chemical weapons . 
In Asia , the US articulated a new policy of heightened involvement ( the so-called strategic &quot; pivot &quot; to the region ) , but then did little to make it a reality . 
The consequence of these and other episodes has been the emergence of widespread doubt about US credibility and reliability . 
There are also local explanations for growing global instability . 
The Middle East suffers from too much intolerance and too little accord about either the boundaries between government and society or the role of religion within them . 
Meanwhile , countries in and near the region are doing little to prevent the rise of extremism or contend with it when and where it emerges . 
Russia under Vladimir Putin seems determined to use intimidation and force to restore lost parts of its empire . 
Europe increasingly lacks the means and the mindset to play a significant global role . 
Too many Asian governments are tolerating or encouraging nationalism rather than preparing their populations for difficult but necessary compromises with neighbors . 
This is not to argue that we are in for a new Dark Ages . 
Interdependence acts as a brake on what governments can do without hurting themselves . 
The world economy has recovered somewhat from its nadir six years ago . 
Europe is mostly stable , as is Latin America and an increasing share of Africa . 
There is also the possibility of pushing back against the new disorder . 
International negotiations might produce an outcome that would leave Iran sufficiently short of a nuclear-weapons capability that its neighbors would not feel the need to attack it or develop such weapons of their own . 
Steps can be taken to weaken the Islamic State militarily , reduce the flows of recruits and dollars to it , and shore up some of its potential targets . 
Sanctions and lower oil prices might lead Russia to accept compromise on Ukraine . 
Asian governments could still opt for regional arrangements that would buttress peace . 
But what can be accomplished is likely to be limited by countries &quot; domestic politics , the absence of international consensus , and the waning of US influence , which no other country is able to replace and few are willing even to support in promoting order . 
The result is a world less at peace , less prosperous , and less adept at meeting the challenges it faces than it was in the post-Cold War era .
