Iraq &apos;s Economic Divide 
Everyone who looks at Iraq sees a nation divided between Shia , Sunni , and Kurd communities . 
But an equally fundamental division - one that has contributed as much to the ongoing insurrection as sectarian strife and opposition to the American-led military occupation - is the widening gap between Iraq &apos;s rich and poor . 
When Iraq was liberated , most people , especially the poor , began to hope for a charismatic leader who would save them from the bitter reality of daily life . 
Raised in fear , they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society , or how human-rights groups and other civic organizations could help shape the future . 
Soon enough , Iraq was faced with a new social divide . 
On one side stood people who understood how to operate in a democracy , attain power , and realize their ambitions . 
They learned to speak the language of democracy , gaining money and influence in the process and enlisting independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges . 
On the other side , however , remains the vast population of powerless Iraqis , including widows and divorced or abandoned women with no one to provide for them and their children . 
For these people , democracy and human rights mean nothing . 
They are ignorant , poor , and sick . 
Victimized by an educational system that collapsed over a decade ago , they have few skills that can help them find employment in Iraq &apos;s blighted economy . 
During Saddam &apos;s reign , no effort was made to raise living standards for the poor . 
I have visited the huge slums of Iraq and found families living in homes with barely a roof to cover them , with infestations of insects everywhere , and with raw sewage seeping under their doors . 
Day or night , they live in darkness . 
Needing nothing more than food , decent housing , and the possibility of a job , these families wait for death , dreading the cries of their starving children . 
When I met the women who live in those houses , they showered me with questions : will democracy give us food and houses ? 
Will democracy stop men from beating their wives ? 
Will it give citizenship to our children ? 
Will it give us the right to divorce the husbands who abandon us ? 
My answer to all of these questions was &quot; yes . &quot; 
Yes , democracy will give you the right to live in a decent house , the right to learn and work , and it will give citizenship to your children and make you equal with your men . 
But you have to work hard and make every possible effort in demanding your rights . 
They replied : &quot; Saddam taught us for 35 years how to be jobless , silent , and fearful . 
What can we do now ? &quot; 
In these destitute areas , where most Iraqis live , people are prey to bitter temptations . 
Many are beyond the reach of political or government leaders . 
They fall easily into violence , theft , and sabotage . 
Poverty drives some to take money in exchange for acts of violence , abetted by the lure of a false heroism that they were not able to act upon during Saddam &apos;s long reign . 
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of Iraq &apos;s violent history of wars and atrocities , which has desensitized people to killing . 
Though conditions in Iraq today are drawing many young men toward violence , I am convinced that we need only to provide decent jobs and housing to save them . 
Jobs , in particular , will help young people to create new lives through serious work . 
We must not use no-work jobs to disguise an army of unemployed . 
We must give people jobs that allow them to make a contribution to rebuilding the country . 
By nature , every individual seeks to prove himself as a useful person in his or her society . 
But the culture that Saddam created convinced Iraqis that political connections are the only way to gain authority , money , and knowledge . 
Overcoming such sentiments will take time and a vibrant economy , which means that a new Iraqi government must have limited power , allowing the private sector to grow while encouraging widespread understanding of democracy and human rights . 
Religious groups are ready to contribute to this process . 
We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam , so that they , too , have a chance to serve their country . 
Last but not least , we must provide loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life . 
Above all , the government must spare no effort in convincing poor Iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom , and how important the constitution is in realizing their aspirations for a better life . 
This will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people consider breaking the law an act of heroism . 
But we Iraqis have also learned that power should not be concentrated in a few hands , and that establishing justice requires fighting all forms of corruption . 
If the constitution is to operate as the guarantee of democracy , freedom , and security , poor Iraqis must learn to make that fight their own .
