Burying Augusto Pinochet 
At long last , the age of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile is over . 
Thirty-six years after the left took power for the first time with Salvador Allende &apos;s peaceful revolution - one supported by votes rather than armed struggle - Chileans have opted again for real change by i naugurating a socialist and a woman as their president . 
&quot; My commitment will be to travel with you on yet another stretch of this great promenade of freedom we have been opening , &quot; Michelle Bachelet said after being elected in January . 
The street euphoria that greeted Bachelet &apos;s victory felt very much like the emotions that gripped Santiago back in 1970 , when Allende was elected . 
Even the stage from which Bachelet spoke was located at almost the same place from which Allende delivered his historic victory speech 36 years ago . 
But the balcony of the Students &quot; Federation of Universidad de Chile no longer exists , having been replaced by the tall buildings and modern subway stations that have marked the intervening years of Chile &apos;s history . 
Indeed , although Michelle Bachelet , like Allende , is a socialist and a physician , today &apos;s Chile is not the country of 1970 . 
This is not only because Pinochet &apos;s 17 years in power , from 1973 to 1990 , dramatically shattered the country &apos;s democracy , with thousands of people executed , missing , or tortured - among them Bachelet &apos;s own father , an air force general who died under torture because he opposed the coup . 
The changes go much deeper , which explains how a country with a huge Roman Catholic majority has chosen to be led by a woman who is a socialist , an agnostic , and an unmarried mother . 
But this time , the markets were calm , mostly because economists believe that Chile &apos;s GDP will continue growing in 2006 at a brisk 6.3 % annual rate . 
This change in market sentiment is one of the great achievements of President Ricardo Lagos , Bachelet &apos;s predecessor , who was also a socialist . 
So it is small surprise that he left office with more than 75 % popular support . 
Bachelet &apos;s margin of victory was far larger than the scant 31,000 votes that brought Lagos to power in January 2000 . 
Back then , many predicted that Lagos wouldn &apos;t last the thousand or so days that Allende ruled before Pinochet launched his coup . 
Lagos brought Chile free-trade agreements with the United States , the European Union , and China , an unemployment rate of less than 8 % , and a growth rate over 6 % . 
Most importantly , Lagos leaves office having erased from the constitution the dictator &apos;s signature . 
The new constitution eliminated the so-called &quot; authoritarian enclaves &quot; by subordinating the armed forces to civilian rule and removing their designated senators from Parliament . 
As for Pinochet himself , ever since July 2004 , when the US Senate revealed his vast secret bank accounts , the once-powerful dictator has become a pariah . 
At age 90 , he is being prosecuted for his crimes and corruption . 
That is hardly surprising . 
But , in yet another sign of Chile &apos;s transformation , the right-wing candidate that Bachelet defeated , Sebasti치n Pi침era , is a liberal entrepreneur who has never hidden his rejection of Pinochet and his dictatorship . 
Pi침era &apos;s great challenge will be to use his 46.6 % of the vote in January to strengthen his leadership and his effort to build a new right-wing coalition with unimpeachable democratic credentials , thereby enabling it one day to defeat the ruling &quot; Concertaci칩n &quot; coalition that Bachelet leads . 
Such a reformed right &apos;s opposition to Bachelet will probably focus on her efforts to modify the country &apos;s neo-liberal model as she tackles the country &apos;s persistent knots of poverty and inequality . 
If Bachelet , who has already served as Minister of Health and Minister of Defense , is to succeed as president , she must transform this other Chile , where 18 % of the population is poor , and 5 % indigent . 
These are the Chileans for whom a lack of hope might make social unrest seem to be the only alternative . 
From now on , the danger of a military comeback will no longer be present to act as a deterrent . 
In any case , on March 11 , when Michelle Bachelet crosses the presidential sash over her chest , a new Chile will set itself in motion . 
The first truly post-Pinochet-era government will have begun .
