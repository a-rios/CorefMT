The Price of 9 / 11 
NEW YORK - The September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks by Al Qaeda were meant to harm the United States , and they did , but in ways that Osama bin Laden probably never imagined . 
President George W. Bush &apos;s response to the attacks compromised America &apos;s basic principles , undermined its economy , and weakened its security . 
The attack on Afghanistan that followed the 9 / 11 attacks was understandable , but the subsequent invasion of Iraq was entirely unconnected to Al Qaeda - as much as Bush tried to establish a link . 
That war of choice quickly became very expensive - orders of magnitude beyond the $ 60 billion claimed at the beginning - as colossal incompetence met dishonest misrepresentation . 
Indeed , when Linda Bilmes and I calculated America &apos;s war costs three years ago , the conservative tally was $ 3-5 trillion . 
Since then , the costs have mounted further . 
With almost 50 % of returning troops eligible to receive some level of disability payment , and more than 600,000 treated so far in veterans &quot; medical facilities , we now estimate that future disability payments and health-care costs will total $ 600-900 billion . 
But the social costs , reflected in veteran suicides ( which have topped 18 per day in recent years ) and family breakups , are incalculable . 
Even if Bush could be forgiven for taking America , and much of the rest of the world , to war on false pretenses , and for misrepresenting the cost of the venture , there is no excuse for how he chose to finance it . 
His was the first war in history paid for entirely on credit . 
As America went into battle , with deficits already soaring from his 2001 tax cut , Bush decided to plunge ahead with yet another round of tax &quot; relief &quot; for the wealthy . 
Today , America is focused on unemployment and the deficit . 
Both threats to America &apos;s future can , in no small measure , be traced to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Increased defense spending , together with the Bush tax cuts , is a key reason why America went from a fiscal surplus of 2 % of GDP when Bush was elected to its parlous deficit and debt position today . 
Direct government spending on those wars so far amounts to roughly $ 2 trillion - $ 17,000 for every US household - with bills yet to be received increasing this amount by more than 50 % . 
Moreover , as Bilmes and I argued in our book The Three Trillion Dollar War , the wars contributed to America &apos;s macroeconomic weaknesses , which exacerbated its deficits and debt burden . 
Then , as now , disruption in the Middle East led to higher oil prices , forcing Americans to spend money on oil imports that they otherwise could have spent buying goods produced in the US . 
But then the US Federal Reserve hid these weaknesses by engineering a housing bubble that led to a consumption boom . 
It will take years to overcome the excessive indebtedness and real-estate overhang that resulted . 
Ironically , the wars have undermined America &apos;s ( and the world &apos;s ) security , again in ways that Bin Laden could not have imagined . 
An unpopular war would have made military recruitment difficult in any circumstances . 
But , as Bush tried to deceive America about the wars &quot; costs , he underfunded the troops , refusing even basic expenditures - say , for armored and mine-resistant vehicles needed to protect American lives , or for adequate health care for returning veterans . 
A US court recently ruled that veterans &quot; rights have been violated . 
( Remarkably , the Obama administration claims that veterans &quot; right to appeal to the courts should be restricted ! ) 
Military overreach has predictably led to nervousness about using military power , and others &quot; knowledge of this threatens to weaken America &apos;s security as well . 
But America &apos;s real strength , more than its military and economic power , is its &quot; soft power , &quot; its moral authority . 
And this , too , was weakened : as the US violated basic human rights like habeas corpus and the right not to be tortured , its longstanding commitment to international law was called into question . 
In Afghanistan and Iraq , the US and its allies knew that long-term victory required winning hearts and minds . 
But mistakes in the early years of those wars complicated that already-difficult battle . 
The wars &quot; collateral damage has been massive : by some accounts , more than a million Iraqis have died , directly or indirectly , because of the war . 
According to some studies , at least 137,000 civilians have died violently in Afghanistan and Iraq in the last ten years ; among Iraqis alone , there are 1.8 million refugees and 1.7 million internally displaced people . 
Not all of the consequences were disastrous . 
The deficits to which America &apos;s debt-funded wars contributed so mightily are now forcing the US to face the reality of budget constraints . 
America &apos;s military spending still nearly equals that of the rest of the world combined , two decades after the end of the Cold War . 
Some of the increased expenditures went to the costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the broader Global War on Terrorism , but much of it was wasted on weapons that don &apos;t work against enemies that don &apos;t exist . 
Now , at last , those resources are likely to be redeployed , and the US will likely get more security by paying less . 
Al Qaeda , while not conquered , no longer appears to be the threat that loomed so large in the wake of the 9 / 11 attacks . 
But the price paid in getting to this point , in the US and elsewhere , has been enormous - and mostly avoidable . 
The legacy will be with us for a long time . 
It pays to think before acting .
