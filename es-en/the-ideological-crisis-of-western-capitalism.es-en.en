The Ideological Crisis of Western Capitalism 
NEW YORK - Just a few years ago , a powerful ideology - the belief in free and unfettered markets - brought the world to the brink of ruin . 
Even in its hey-day , from the early 1980 &quot; s until 2007 , American-style deregulated capitalism brought greater material well-being only to the very richest in the richest country of the world . 
Indeed , over the course of this ideology &apos;s 30-year ascendance , most Americans saw their incomes decline or stagnate year after year . 
Moreover , output growth in the United States was not economically sustainable . 
With so much of US national income going to so few , growth could continue only through consumption financed by a mounting pile of debt . 
I was among those who hoped that , somehow , the financial crisis would teach Americans ( and others ) a lesson about the need for greater equality , stronger regulation , and a better balance between the market and government . 
Alas , that has not been the case . 
On the contrary , a resurgence of right-wing economics , driven , as always , by ideology and special interests , once again threatens the global economy - or at least the economies of Europe and America , where these ideas continue to flourish . 
In the US , this right-wing resurgence , whose adherents evidently seek to repeal the basic laws of math and economics , is threatening to force a default on the national debt . 
If Congress mandates expenditures that exceed revenues , there will be a deficit , and that deficit has to be financed . 
Rather than carefully balancing the benefits of each government expenditure program with the costs of raising taxes to finance those benefits , the right seeks to use a sledgehammer - not allowing the national debt to increase forces expenditures to be limited to taxes . 
This leaves open the question of which expenditures get priority - and if expenditures to pay interest on the national debt do not , a default is inevitable . 
Moreover , to cut back expenditures now , in the midst of an ongoing crisis brought on by free-market ideology , would inevitably simply prolong the downturn . 
A decade ago , in the midst of an economic boom , the US faced a surplus so large that it threatened to eliminate the national debt . 
Unaffordable tax cuts and wars , a major recession , and soaring health-care costs - fueled in part by the commitment of George W. Bush &apos;s administration to giving drug companies free rein in setting prices , even with government money at stake - quickly transformed a huge surplus into record peacetime deficits . 
The remedies to the US deficit follow immediately from this diagnosis : put America back to work by stimulating the economy ; end the mindless wars ; rein in military and drug costs ; and raise taxes , at least on the very rich . 
But the right will have none of this , and instead is pushing for even more tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy , together with expenditure cuts in investments and social protection that put the future of the US economy in peril and that shred what remains of the social contract . 
Meanwhile , the US financial sector has been lobbying hard to free itself of regulations , so that it can return to its previous , disastrously carefree , ways . 
But matters are little better in Europe . 
As Greece and others face crises , the medicine du jour is simply timeworn austerity packages and privatization , which will merely leave the countries that embrace them poorer and more vulnerable . 
This medicine failed in East Asia , Latin America , and elsewhere , and it will fail in Europe this time around , too . 
Indeed , it has already failed in Ireland , Latvia , and Greece . 
There is an alternative : an economic-growth strategy supported by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund . 
Growth would restore confidence that Greece could repay its debts , causing interest rates to fall and leaving more fiscal room for further growth-enhancing investments . 
Growth itself increases tax revenues and reduces the need for social expenditures , such as unemployment benefits . 
And the confidence that this engenders leads to still further growth . 
Regrettably , the financial markets and right-wing economists have gotten the problem exactly backwards : they believe that austerity produces confidence , and that confidence will produce growth . 
But austerity undermines growth , worsening the government &apos;s fiscal position , or at least yielding less improvement than austerity &apos;s advocates promise . 
On both counts , confidence is undermined , and a downward spiral is set in motion . 
Do we really need another costly experiment with ideas that have failed repeatedly ? 
We shouldn &apos;t , but increasingly it appears that we will have to endure another one nonetheless . 
A failure of either Europe or the US to return to robust growth would be bad for the global economy . 
A failure in both would be disastrous - even if the major emerging-market countries have attained self-sustaining growth . 
Unfortunately , unless wiser heads prevail , that is the way the world is heading .
