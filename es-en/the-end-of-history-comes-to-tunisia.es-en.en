The End of History Comes to Tunisia 
PARIS - Tunisia &apos;s &quot; Jasmine Revolution &quot; is still unfolding , but we can already read into it lessons about democracy and democratization that extend far beyond the Maghreb . 
To set the Jasmine Revolution in historical perspective , we must recall June 4 , 1989 - that pivotal Sunday when the Poles voted the communists out of power and , at the other end of Eurasia , the Communist Party of China crushed a burgeoning democratic movement on Tiananmen Square . 
In retrospect , that day looks like a fork in the road of human history . 
One path led to the demise of communism and a new birth of freedom and democracy - at times bloody and painful - in Europe . 
The other path traced an alternative course , with China remaining under the grip of its ruling party , but delivering prosperity to its impoverished masses through astounding and sustained growth . 
As the revolutionary year of 1989 was unfolding , Francis Fukuyama , presciently yet controversially pondered whether the path chosen in Europe heralded the &quot; end of history . &quot; 
Following Hegel , Fukuyama made the case that history is directional - that it is leading somewhere - for two reasons . 
First , the ceaseless spread of technology and of the economic liberal order , which has a homogenizing effect . 
Second , the Hegelian &quot; struggle for recognition &quot; has been a pervasive driving force of mankind , powerful enough to lead countless individuals to the ultimate sacrifice . 
But , while a widespread consensus held that communism was nothing but a dead end , China &apos;s economic success , and the authoritarian backlash in Russia following Boris Yeltsin &apos;s departure from the Kremlin a decade ago , prompted a more pessimistic analysis . 
Theories of &quot; democratic rollback &quot; and of a resurgence of &quot; authoritarian great powers &quot; surfaced to unveil the potential of systems that combined nationalism and state-led growth-yielding capitalism . 
Some argued that authoritarian rule provided a much surer and safer path to welfare than democracy could offer , others extolled the virtues of &quot; Asian values , &quot; and still others argued that democracy in the Arab or Muslim world would only pave the way for Islamic fundamentalists to take power . 
Not surprisingly , autocrats everywhere embraced such views . 
But the message of Tunisia &apos;s Jasmine Revolution rings loud and clear : democracy - and the liberal political order in which it is rooted - is not merely a Western concept ( or a Western conspiracy ) , but holds universal attraction , powered by the craving for &quot; recognition . &quot; 
Moreover , it can be accessed at an early stage of a country &apos;s modernization . 
To be sure , authoritarian rule can manage the early stages of industrialization . 
Even the smartest authoritarian rulers are unable to manage complexity on this scale - not to mention the corruption that inevitably breeds in the protected shadows of autocracy . 
Challenging the &quot; myth of the autocratic revival , &quot; the American political scientists Daniel Deudney and John Ikenberry have examined China and Russia , finding &quot; little evidence for the emergence of a stable equilibrium between capitalism and autocracy such that this combination could be dignified as a new model of modernity . &quot; 
While neither country qualifies as a liberal democracy , both &quot; are much more liberal and democratic than they have ever been , and many of the crucial foundations for sustainable liberal democracy are emerging &quot; - one main hurdle being the centrifugal forces that democracy might unleash . 
But most countries that are unburdened by such a threat have , quietly or spectacularly , rallied to the liberal order over the past decades . 
Asian countries such as Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , and Indonesia have done so without being hampered by their supposed &quot; Asian values . &quot; 
Similarly , Latin America , once the playground of myriad juntas and golpes , is now largely anchored in political liberalism . 
Turkey is ruled by a mildly Islamist party that plays by the rules of democracy . 
What is obvious from these cases is that development activates the two channels that Fukuyama identifies as shaping the direction of history : cumulative economic and technological change and the desire for recognition . 
Both foster individual empowerment , which is the gateway to freedom and democracy . 
The paths differ between countries , setbacks are not uncommon , and it can take decades , but the leap can occur when the circumstances are ripe - as in Tunisia . 
Indeed , the Jasmine Revolution embodies all the tenets of the liberal political order that the West has been advocating since the Atlantic Charter of 1941 : a yearning for freedom , opportunity , and the rule of law . 
Moreover , Tunisia &apos;s revolution was indigenous , not imported as part of some forcible regime change . 
The Tunisian people , led by a frustrated middle class that refused to be cowed , thus provide a healthy reminder of the steady and compelling forces driving the behavior of individuals and nations nowadays . 
They illustrate the catalytic effect of digital connectivity ( clearly visible , too , among China &apos;s &quot; twittering classes &quot; ) . 
Whatever the outcome in Tunisia , those who believe that democracy , to paraphrase Woodrow Wilson , makes the world a safe place - and that more democracy makes it safer - have every reason to rejoice at such an auspicious development .
