Does Europe Have a Death Wish ? 
BERLIN - From the start of the Greek debt crisis in 2010 , the major European players should have understood the risks and consequences that it posed for the European Union . 
They certainly don &apos;t give that impression to onlookers . 
The crisis was always about much more than Greece : a disorderly insolvency there would threaten to pull other economies on the EU &apos;s southern periphery , including some very big ones , into the fiscal abyss , along with major European banks and insurers . 
That could plunge the global economy into another financial crisis , delivering a shock equivalent to the autumn of 2008 . 
It would also mean a eurozone failure that would not leave the Common Market unharmed . 
For the first time in its history , the very continuance of the European project is at stake . 
And yet the behavior of the EU and its most important member states has been irresolute and dithering , owing to national egotism and a breathtaking absence of leadership . 
States can go bust just like companies , but , unlike companies , they don &apos;t disappear when that happens . 
That is why states should not be punished , and why their ongoing interests should not be underestimated . 
Insolvent states need help with restructuring , both in the financial sector and well beyond it , so that they can work their way out of crisis . 
This is certainly true of Greece , whose structural problems are much more sweeping than even its financial difficulties . 
Thus far , the EU and the Greek government have failed to address Greece &apos;s structural problems . 
But they need to develop ( and fund ) an appropriate strategy for economic reconstruction , in order to make clear to the Greeks - and to skittish financial markets - that there is light at the end of the tunnel . 
Everyone knows that Greece will be unable to work its way out of crisis without massive debt relief . 
The only question is whether the country &apos;s debt restructuring will be orderly and controlled or chaotic and contagious . 
Either way , Germany &apos;s internal debate about whether to pay for the Greek debt is risible . 
Refusing to pay is not a viable option , because Germany and all other eurozone members are in the same boat . 
A Greek default would threaten to sink them , too , for it would raise immediate concerns about the solvency of Europe &apos;s systemically important banks and insurance companies . 
So what are the eurozone &apos;s heads of government waiting for ? 
Are they reluctant to come clean with their people out of fear for their own political futures ? 
The European financial crisis is really a political crisis , because EU leaders are unable to decide on the necessary measures . 
Instead , time is lost on secondary issues largely rooted in domestic policy concerns . 
It is certainly right , in principle , to argue that the banks should participate in financing the resolution of the debt crisis . 
But it makes little sense to insist on it as long as losses by banks that remain &quot; too big to fail &quot; could trigger a renewed financial crisis . 
Any chance to make this work would have required overhauling the financial system early in 2009 , but that opportunity was largely wasted . 
As long as the EU &apos;s life-threatening political crisis continues , its financial crisis will continue to destabilize it . 
At the heart of resolving the crisis lies the certainty that the euro - and with it the EU as a whole - will not survive without greater European political unification . 
If Europeans want to keep the euro , we must forge ahead with political union now ; otherwise , like it or not , the euro and European integration will be undone . 
Europe would then lose nearly everything it has gained over a half-century from transcending nationalism . 
In the light of the emerging new world order , this would be a tragedy for Europeans . 
Unfortunately , when the outgoing president of the European Central Bank , Jean-Claude Trichet , proposed a step in this direction by suggesting that a &quot; European Secretary of the Treasury &quot; be created , heads of state and government dismissed the idea out of hand . 
Hardly anyone on the European Council seems willing even to acknowledge the depth of the EU crisis . 
Resolving this crisis requires more Europe and more integration , not less . 
And yes : the rich economies - first and foremost Germany - will have to pay for the way out . 
Germany and France , the two crucial players in this crisis , will have to devise a joint strategy , because only they , working together , can push through a solution . 
The problem is that the French referendum on the EU constitution in 2005 vetoed further political integration , while further economic integration may now fail because of Germany . 
What is required , therefore , is an open bilateral French-German dialogue about a comprehensive realignment of the monetary union . 
Treaty changes are impossible ; therefore , different methods will need to be found , which makes the Franco-German partnership all the more important . 
Regardless of the EU &apos;s political crisis and paralysis , Europeans should not forget how important its existence is and will continue to be . 
One has only to look back to the first half of the twentieth century to understand why .
