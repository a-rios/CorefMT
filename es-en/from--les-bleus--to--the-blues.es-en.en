From &quot; Les Bleus &quot; to &quot; the Blues &quot; 
PARIS - Is football ( soccer ) just a mirror that reflects the collective emotions of a country ? 
Or should it instead be seen as a magnifying glass , if not sometimes a distorting mirror , that reveals on the playing field the frustrations , fears , ambition , or hope of a nation ? 
It would be tempting to attribute to football a &quot; mapping &quot; of the emotional state of the world . 
Asia is doing less well in the World Cup than it is doing in economic terms , yet it is definitely progressing , compensating for the current lack of individual talent by the greater collective discipline shown by its teams . 
By contrast , in terms of creativity , Latin American flair shines well beyond Brazil and its confirmed emerging-power status in the world to encompass countries such as Argentina , Uruguay , and even Chile . 
Africa , despite some rare individual national successes , continues to underperform , even with the World Cup in its backyard . 
As a Frenchman who watched with a mixture of sadness and humiliation the behavior of the French national team , on and off the field ( happily , the torture is over ) , the image in the mirror makes a lot of sense . 
There are many countries with social and economic conditions that are equal to or worse than France &apos;s , yet their national teams are currently shining on the field . 
Consider Portugal or the Netherlands , not to mention Spain . 
And just think of Argentina . 
One could almost speak of an inverse relationship between a country &apos;s confidence and that of its World Cup football team . 
The catastrophic performance of France &apos;s team in South Africa may well reinforce the nation &apos;s depression . 
French citizens badly needed a furlough , if only for a month , from the socio-economic reality of their country . 
But one should not confuse the consequence with the cause . 
The French team &apos;s performance may reflect the mood of the country , but the failure of France &apos;s international stars to jell reflected , above all , a total absence of leadership at the helm . 
Too much money , too little respect for the honor of wearing the team shirt - the unraveling of &quot; Les Bleus &quot; has not been an event but a process , the chronicle of a disaster foretold , to quote Roselyne Bachelot , France &apos;s minister of health and sport . 
In reality , what applies to France can also be said of many other teams , such as Italy . 
In the land of Moliere , failure , like success , must be theatrical . 
In 1998 , France could celebrate the multicolor , multi-ethnic victory of &quot; Les Bleus . &quot; 
In 2010 , France has the &quot; blues , &quot; and some people are starting to see , through the failure of the national team , the limits of the French model of integration . 
&quot; We &quot; Frenchmen were so proud in 1998 of watching the gigantic , iconic image of Zinedine Zidane ( the French captain , who is of Algerian descent ) being projected onto the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees . 
&quot; We &quot; French were not only on top of the world , we were overcome by a sense of pride , probably similar to what many Americans felt after Barack Obama &apos;s presidential victory . 
Liberty , Equality , Fraternity seemed very real as the values of our Republic . In 2010 , &quot; The rise and fall of Les Bleus &quot; can be interpreted as an accelerated version of Gibbon &apos;s study of the decline of the Roman Empire . 
A weak emperor ( the president of the French Football Federation ) chose an incompetent general ( the coach Raymond Domenech ) , who failed to inspire mercenaries ( the players ) or to instill in them a sense of collective sacrifice and duty . 
But there is a study much more useful than Gibbon &apos;s analysis of Rome for understanding what happened to France &apos;s team : Marc Bloch &apos;s masterful examination of France &apos;s collapse in 1940 , A Strange Defeat . 
Like the French army in the spring of 1940 , the French team &apos;s strategy and technique were outmoded . 
If one substitutes war for soccer , the comparison that comes to mind is that of the aging French military establishment , behind the Maginot Line in 1940 , unable to confront General Heinz Guderian &apos;s masterful command of blitzkrieg tank attacks . 
A question remains . 
Is France just an extreme version of Europe &apos;s traditional &quot; Big Powers &quot; predicament ? 
In Europe , at least when it comes to soccer , &quot; small is beautiful , &quot; and , as a fan , it is much better to be Dutch , Portuguese , or Slovak , than Italian , English , or , of course , French . 
Even Spain and Germany , despite qualifying for the next round , have started to scare theirs fans with mixed results . 
In 2006 , the World Cup final was European , with Italy defeating France . 
This year &apos;s final may well be a Latin American affair .
