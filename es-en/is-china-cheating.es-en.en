Is China Cheating ? 
Foul play ! 
How else , says the US , could China undercut American producers in so many areas ? 
For decades America seemed to dominate manufacturing , so US officials focused on liberalizing trade in manufactured goods . 
They put little effort into creating a level playing field for farmers , since they knew America couldn &apos;t compete in agriculture . 
Now , China is out-competing everyone , racking up huge trade surpluses with the US . 
So America &apos;s Treasury Secretary accuses China of deliberately keepings its exchange rate low , and calls for China to let market forces determine the value of the reminbi . 
The IMF &apos;s departing Chief Economist , Ken Rogoff , warns that the surpluses put global stability at risk . 
For those who recall East Asia &apos;s crisis of five years ago , much of this seems to run counter to what was said then . 
China was urged not to float its currency . 
Until Argentina &apos;s peso imploded , fixed exchange rates were fine . 
The US Treasury welcomed government intervention in exchange rate markets , and encouraged the IMF to support such interventions with mega-billion dollar loans to crisis countries . 
If China had let its currency float back then , it would have depreciated in value , deepening the crisis . 
Countries were warned : avoid trade deficits and build up reserves , because they are the key frontline defense . 
East Asia &apos;s countries followed that advice , and for a good reason : they had seen the consequences of a lack of reserves . 
East Asia &apos;s governments knew then that the IMF &apos;s policies would deepen their downturns , but they were helpless to resist . 
The IMF had the money they needed . 
China and Malaysia , lucky enough not to have to turn to the IMF or brave enough to set their own course , did what every textbook said you should do : they pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies . 
China &apos;s economy continued to grow at 7 % ; 
Malaysia had the shortest and shallowest downturn . 
To understand what is at stake , a few basic economic points need to be spelled out . 
First , international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage ; countries export goods in which they have a relative advantage and import goods in which they have a relative disadvantage . 
By and large , America now has a relative disadvantage in manufacturing , while China has a relative advantage . 
China should be exporting manufactured goods to the US . 
Secondly , if a country invests more than it saves , it will need to borrow , and the counterpart to that borrowing is a trade deficit . 
America &apos;s burgeoning trade deficit is a result of the Bush Administration &apos;s unprecedented mismanagement . 
Tax cuts that America could ill afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit ; rather than saving , America &apos;s government is borrowing , much of it from abroad . 
That , not China &apos;s exchange rate policy , is the culprit . 
In fact , China &apos;s overall trade surplus today is actually small , around 1 % of its GDP . 
Of course , the Bush Administration wants to shift the blame , but neither China , nor anyone else , should be fooled . 
This is reminiscent of what happened twenty years ago , when President Reagan engineered huge tax cuts that were supposed to pay for themselves , but which incited huge fiscal deficits , which in turn led to huge trade deficits . 
Back then , Japan was blamed ! 
The harsh truth is that neither the IMF nor the Bush administration really believes in free markets . 
They interfere with markets when it suits their purposes . 
The Bush Administration supported bailouts for airlines , unprecedented subsidies for agriculture , and tariff protections for steel . 
The IMF is right : there is a real risk of global instability , but the underlying cause is massive US borrowing from abroad , which began under President Reagan . 
This turned the US into a huge debtor . 
If , someday , America &apos;s creditors decide that they want to hold fewer dollars , it could set off large exchange rate movements , causing global instability . 
Why hasn &apos;t the IMF sternly criticized these deficits ? 
Why should the richest country in the world live beyond its means while the IMF scolds poorer countries for smaller transgressions ? 
This problem is compounded by the global reserve system , which sees most countries demanding US dollars , effectively to bury them in the ground . 
The system requires the reserve currency country ( the US ) to be a massive debtor - to the point where others lose faith . 
But to solve deep-seated problems with the global financial system , we need to go beyond the complacency that has long marked the G-7 and the unilateralism that defines the current US administration . 
China is right to have ignored America &apos;s demands . 
Floating the exchange rate would expose the country to instabilities that would lead to a host of further problems , particularly the country &apos;s shaky banking system . 
A higher exchange rate would undermine job creation and would contribute to deflation , which China is successfully combating . 
China is fortunate to have the freedom to follow its own views . 
Its huge foreign currency reserves give it the freedom to ignore the IMF and the US Treasury . 
In the end , this may be the most compelling reason for why China should continue to run trade surpluses . 
Once again , China has shown its mastery of basic economic principles . 
Others in the region only wish that they could have acted similarly .
