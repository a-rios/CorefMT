Need Versus Greed 
NEW YORK - India &apos;s great moral leader Mohandas Gandhi famously said that there is enough on Earth for everybody &apos;s need , but not enough for everybody &apos;s greed . 
Today , Gandhi &apos;s insight is being put to the test as never before . 
The world is hitting global limits in its use of resources . 
We are feeling the shocks each day in catastrophic floods , droughts , and storms - and in the resulting surge in prices in the marketplace . 
Our fate now depends on whether we cooperate or fall victim to self-defeating greed . 
The limits to the global economy are new , resulting from the unprecedented size of the world &apos;s population and the unprecedented spread of economic growth to nearly the entire world . 
There are now seven billion people on the planet , compared to just three billion a half-century ago . 
Today , average per capita income is $ 10,000 , with the rich world averaging around $ 40,000 and the developing world around $ 4,000 . 
China &apos;s economy is growing at around 10 % annually . 
India &apos;s is growing at nearly the same rate . 
Africa , long the world &apos;s slowest-growing region , is now averaging roughly 5 % annual GDP growth . 
Overall , the developing countries are growing at around 7 % per year , and the developed economies at around 2 % , yielding a global average of around 4.5 % . 
This is very good news in many ways . 
Rapid economic growth in developing countries is helping to alleviate poverty . 
In China , for example , extreme poverty has been cut from well over half of the population 30 years ago to around 10 % or less today . 
Yet there is another side to the global growth story that we must understand clearly . 
With the world economy growing at 4-5 % per year , it will be on a path to double in size in less than 20 years . 
Today &apos;s $ 70 trillion world economy will be at $ 140 trillion before 2030 , and $ 280 trillion before 2050 if we extrapolate from today &apos;s growth rate . 
Our planet will not physically support this exponential economic growth if we let greed take the upper hand . 
Even today , the weight of the world economy is already crushing nature , rapidly depleting the supplies of fossil-fuel energy resources that nature created over millions of years , while the resulting climate change has led to massive instabilities in terms of rainfall , temperature , and extreme storms . 
We see these pressures every day in the marketplace . 
Oil prices have surged to more than $ 100 per barrel , as China , India , and other oil-importing countries join the United States in a massive scramble to buy up supplies , especially from the Middle East . 
Food prices , too , are at historical highs , contributing to poverty and political unrest . 
On the one hand , there are more mouths to feed , and with greater purchasing power on average . 
On the other hand , heat waves , droughts , floods , and other disasters induced by climate change are destroying crops and reducing the supplies of grains on world markets . 
In recent months , massive droughts have struck the grain-producing regions of Russia and Ukraine , and enormous floods have hit Brazil and Australia ; now , another drought is menacing northern China &apos;s grain belt . 
There is something else hidden from view that is very dangerous . 
In many populous parts of the world , including the grain-growing regions of northern India , northern China , and the American Midwest , farmers are tapping into groundwater to irrigate their crops . 
The great aquifers that supply water for irrigation are being depleted . 
In some places in India , the water table has been falling by several meters annually in recent years . 
Some deep wells are approaching the point of exhaustion , with salinity set to rise as ocean water infiltrates the aquifer . 
A calamity is inevitable unless we change . 
And here is where Gandhi comes in . 
If our societies are run according to the greed principle , with the rich doing everything to get richer , the growing resource crisis will lead to a widening divide between the rich and the poor - and quite possibly to an increasingly violent struggle for survival . 
The rich will try to use their power to commandeer more land , more water , and more energy for themselves , and many will support violent means to do so , if necessary . 
The US has already followed a strategy of militarization in the Middle East in the na√Øve hope that such an approach can ensure secure energy supplies . 
Now competition for those supplies is intensifying , as China , India , and others bid for the same ( depleting ) resources . 
An analogous power grab is being attempted in Africa . 
The rise in food prices is leading to a land grab , as powerful politicians sell foreign investors massive tracts of farmland , brushing aside the traditional land rights of poor smallholders . 
Foreign investors hope to use large mechanized farms to produce output for export , leaving little or nothing for the local populations . 
Everywhere in the leading countries - the US , the United Kingdom , China , India , and elsewhere - the rich have enjoyed soaring incomes and growing political power . 
The US economy has been taken over by billionaires , the oil industry , and other key sectors . 
The same trends threaten the emerging economies , where wealth and corruption are on the rise . 
If greed dominates , the engine of economic growth will deplete our resources , push the poor aside , and drive us into a deep social , political , and economic crisis . 
The alternative is a path of political and social cooperation , both within countries and internationally . 
There will be enough resources and prosperity to go around if we convert our economies to renewable energy sources , sustainable agricultural practices , and reasonable taxation of the rich . 
This is the path to shared prosperity through improved technologies , political fairness , and ethical awareness .
