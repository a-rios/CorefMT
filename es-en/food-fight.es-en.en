Food Fight 
Europe &apos;s parliament has passed stringent new rules for genetically modified food , raising American objections . 
NoÃ«lle Lenoir , the new French Minister for Europe , dissects the issues involved . 
The adage that &quot; you are what you eat &quot; holds two meanings . 
It admonishes us to maintain a healthy , nutritious diet . 
It also reminds us that food forms an integral part of our cultural , religious , or regional identities , because what we eat and how we produce our foods are deeply rooted in our histories and traditions . 
Indeed , the peculiarities of national cuisine provide some of our most descriptive nicknames for one another . 
To the English , we French will forever be &quot; frogs &quot; because we eat frogs &apos;s legs , as the Germans will always be &quot; krauts &quot; because of their love of sauerkraut . 
The evolution of European attitudes toward genetically modified foods and plants reflects just such a dual concern with health and identity . 
Since April 1990 , when the EU Parliament , with no significant opposition , adopted the first two directives on the use and release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , public opinion has grown increasingly suspicious and hostile . 
What incited such fierce sensitivity about GM foods ? 
Seven years ago , the President of the European Commission requested the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies ( of which I was a member ) to examine the &quot; ethical aspects of the labeling of foods derived from modern biotechnology . &quot; 
Our opinion , released in May 1995 , deemed food safety a fundamental ethical imperative and called for barring the commercialization of questionable products . 
It also argued that labeling GM foods is required in accordance with consumers &apos; right to make informed choices about what they eat . 
The opinion also included the following remark : &quot; modern biotechnology , as a technique used in food production , cannot be regarded in itself as ethical or unethical . &quot; 
It seemed to me a trivial and harmless dictum . 
Yet when the opinion was released , I provoked a general outcry by quoting it to the assembled journalists . 
I realized at once that opposition to GM crops and foods has as much to do with social and political values as with concerns about health and safety . 
A candid international dialogue is indispensable to a better understanding of Europe &apos;s differences with the US and other parts of the world concerning GMOs . 
Such discussions might help negotiators settle ongoing disputes over the &quot; Codex Alimentarius &quot; ( global food standards set by the World Health Organization and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ) , the EU regulation on labeling and tracing genetically modified organisms , and the application of World Trade Organization rules . 
Two questions , in particular , merit attention . 
First , why are Europeans more reluctant than Americans to embrace biotechnology ? 
Second , why must GMOs be addressed as a global issue ? 
In contrast to the US , information on GMOs in Europe emphasizes risk rather than benefits ( in particular , reduced use of pesticides and insecticides ) . 
For example , national advisory bodies in the UK , the Netherlands , and France recently insisted on additional regulatory measures for GMOs intended to prevent adverse side effects - for example , allergic reactions - on consumers &apos; health . 
Americans find it difficult to understand why Europeans insist on such restrictions , and accuse the EU of practicing bio-trade protectionism . 
Europeans are undoubtedly more pessimistic than Americans about progress in general , and recent events merely seem to have reinforced this stance . 
Having faced successive contamination crises in recent years - first BSE and then hoof and mouth disease - we feel particularly insecure about food . 
Nor is this fear limited to consumers . 
Farmers across Europe are anxious about the future of agriculture in a globalized world . 
Americans , including farmers , are more accustomed to paying for innovative technologies and products - a disposition reflected in a recent US Supreme Court decision that extended the scope of patents on plants . 
In Europe , agriculture and intellectual property are more often at odds . 
Europeans consumers &apos; growing awareness of their rights and farmers &apos; increasing fear of dependence on multinational companies are symptoms of a deeper concern about values and priorities : the type of environment we want , the role of biodiversity , our tolerance for risk , and the price we are prepared to pay for regulation . 
Outside Europe , the GM green revolution holds more stark implications . 
Eight hundred million people worldwide are chronically malnourished . 
Are GMOs a blessing or a curse for these people and the farmers among them ? 
I am inclined to believe that the problem of malnutrition in poor countries has little to do with technology or development as such . 
As the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen compellingly argues , hunger is not caused by a scarcity of food , but by a scarcity of democracy . 
Even so , once the political causes of famine and malnutrition in developing countries are resolved , the use of modern biotechnology in agriculture and food production could potentially make an immense contribution to social welfare and economic advancement . 
However , we must first address the political factors that underlie most misunderstandings between America and Europe . 
Above all , we must reckon with the rise of ecological awareness , which in Europe is reflected in the formation and strength of Green parties , and which nurtures anti-globalization sentiments . 
In Europe and beyond , GMOs became emblematic of the powerful economic fears that globalization inspires . 
In country after country - France , Britain , Germany , New Zealand , and elsewhere - farmers and ecologists jointly oppose , and sometimes sabotage , trials of GM crops . 
Hostility to GMOs is symbolic of broader opposition to the encroachment of market forces that are perceived to be creating a world in which money rules with nary a consideration for historical traditions , cultural identities , and social needs . 
Whatever the truth in this perception , it is little wonder - and perhaps fitting - that a fight about the future of food should form a key battleground in a fight about who we are .
