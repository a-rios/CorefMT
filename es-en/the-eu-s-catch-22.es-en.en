The EU \ u0027s Catch-22 
COPENHAGEN : Worrying signs are mounting that the European Union &apos;s enlargement process is losing steam . 
Bringing into the EU applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe , as well from the Baltic region , however , remains the single most important item on the European agenda in our time . 
It would be a mistake of historic proportions to delay it . 
Enlargement will undoubtedly pose many practical problems . 
But the magnitude of the economic costs should not be exaggerated : after all , the aggregate GNP of the 10 applicant countries from the former communist bloc is smaller than the GNP of Holland ! 
Structural support to new members from current EU members , indeed , is expected to be less than 4 % of Dutch GNP . 
Transfers of wealth on the scale of what took place between West and East Germany won &apos;t happen . Indeed , enlargement &apos;s total cost will be less than the annual increase in the EU Commission &apos;s own resources which &quot; normal &quot; economic growth provides . 
Costs , of course , are not the only difficulty . 
One additional problem concerns the establishment within applicant countries of administrative and democratic structures compatible to those that exist in today &apos;s EU . 
But if present EU members erect conditions on membership that are too harsh for newcomers to meet , they run the risk of creating a &quot; Catch-22 &quot; situation . 
In his novel of that title Joseph Heller described the situation faced by some fighter pilots in WWII : medics can ground anyone who is crazy , provided that the pilot requests to be grounded . 
Because fear in the face of danger is a normal human reaction , however , anyone who requests grounding cannot be crazy and so cannot be grounded . 
That &apos;s &quot; Catch-22 . &quot; 
The same might be said about joining the EU : if you can only become a member by living up to the standards of the Union , you will never become a member , since you need membership to entrench those standards . 
Keep in mind that European integration is a political endeavour . 
Economics are the means , politics the purpose . 
This was made clear in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome more than 40 years ago : ... &quot; pooling their resources to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty ..... &quot; 
The six founding members - Germany , France , Italy , and the Benelux-countries - waged war against each other several times during the first half of the 20th century . 
Nowadays , however , war between members of the EU is not only unlikely and unbelievable , but also impossible . 
This proves the point : European integration is first and foremost an instrument to preserve and strengthen peace and liberty . 
This was the guiding principle behind past enlargements to include democracies that were , at the time of their admission , new and fragile : first Greece , then Spain and Portugal . 
It is in full conformity with its original vision that the Union now be enlarged to include the new democracies of Eastern and Central Europe and the Baltics . 
This process must not be delayed by lack of perspective . 
One corner of Europe is in particular need of prompt action : the Baltic Sea Region . 
Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania cannot join NATO for the foreseeable future . 
Therefore it is necessary to bring them into the EU as soon as possible in order to make it absolutely clear to their big neighbour , Russia , that in today &apos;s Europe Aspheres of interest &quot; no longer exist ; that the Baltic three are equal members of the European family . 
When you discuss this issue with our American allies , they fail to understand why an EU of 350 million people hesitates to absorb less than 8 million people in order to mend historic fences . 
Bringing in Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia would strengthen stability in the Baltic area , because the rules of the game would be crystal clear to everyone , both with regard to security and to human and minority rights . 
There would be no room left for adventures on either side . 
Alas , as always , the Devil is in the details : the EU &apos;s institutions were originally designed for 6 members , but within a decade or two the EU will probably have 25-30 ( perhaps more ) member states . 
So reform is vital . 
But calls to reform can also be used as delaying tactics . 
When I listen to the grand , visionary speeches about Europe &apos;s future put forward recently by some EU political leaders - President Chirac &apos;s recent speech to the Bundestag being the most otherworldly - I am struck by the thought that these visions are worthless if designed to cover up a lack of enthusiasm to face the challenges of enlargement . 
Now is not the time to discuss far-reaching visions , nor to start constructing &quot; inner circles &quot; in the Union . 
Now is the time to give concrete direction and pledges regarding enlargement . 
For Europe &apos;s task is to maintain and strengthen structures of cooperation that retain the advantages of diversity and independence without reviving the old curse of the European nation state : xenophobia , bloodshed , and war . 
A stronger , wider EU must be our priority .
