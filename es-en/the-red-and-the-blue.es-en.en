The Red and the Blue 
Condoleeza Rice &apos;s replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretary of State shows that America &apos;s recent presidential election continues to produce powerful reverberations . 
But understanding what that election tells us about America is important not only for Americans , but for the world . 
This year &apos;s presidential vote proves that America &apos;s democracy is healthy , but that some things could be better . 
Contrary to the election in 2000 , when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College , Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes . 
While some Democrats remain bitter , there is little serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush &apos;s victory . 
America remains closely divided into red states ( Republican ) and blue states ( Democrat ) . 
If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio , John Kerry would be the president ( albeit with a minority of the popular vote ) . 
The Electoral College was included in America &apos;s constitution to protect small states in a federal system , but it now means that the political campaign focuses largely on the dozen or so battleground states where public opinion is closely divided . 
More fundamentally , there is something unseemly about electing presidents without a popular majority . 
So it is time for a serious debate about amending the constitution to abolish the Electoral College . 
Some observers also complain about the divisive negative rhetoric and advertising that characterized the campaign . 
But this should be seen in historical perspective . 
In the era of the Founding Fathers , newspapers were extremely partisan , and George Washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language . 
For much of its early history - to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction - the country was as closely divided as it is today , and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition . 
At the same time , despite negative advertising by both sides , the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and were widely viewed . 
In general , an incumbent president with a growing economy is likely to be re-elected . 
In that sense , what was surprising about Bush &apos;s re-election was how thin his majority was . 
In large part , this was because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War . 
Kerry tried to make the war , the low rate of job creation , inadequate healthcare , and Bush &apos;s tax cuts for upper income groups the central issues of the campaign , but some observers felt that this never added up to a clear message . 
Bush countered with concerns about security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion rights . 
In the end , security and cultural populism trumped economic populism . 
Interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked ( after they voted ) about which issues mattered most to them . 
The largest number ( 22 % ) answered &quot; moral values , &quot; comparison to 20 % who cited the economy and 19 % who mentioned terrorism . 
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush , and that their agenda should dominate his next term . 
But a Pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category &quot; moral values &quot; encompassed a wide range of issues besides abortion rights and gay marriage . 
In fact , polls show that 25 % of the public support gay marriage and 35 % favor legal civil unions for gay couples ( the position advocated by Kerry ) . 
Nonetheless , for the 37 % who oppose gay marriage , particularly in the red center of the country , the issue helped mobilize Bush supporters to come to vote . 
A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided . 
The election map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country . 
Some call it &quot; Coastopia . &quot; 
But the division is not that sharp . 
Many states in both camps were won by narrow margins , and if one colors the map at the level of counties rather than states , much of the country looks quite purple . 
Cities versus suburbs and rural areas is a better description than coasts versus heartland . 
Indeed , public opinion polls show that most Americans are clustered in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes . 
But political elites , such as party activists and members of Congress , tend to be more extreme than the public . 
At first , this seems puzzling , because they should have an incentive to move to the vote-rich middle . 
But many members of Congress represent districts that are safe for their parties , and the threat to their re-election comes in party primaries that are dominated by the more activist and extreme wings of the parties . 
This tendency is reinforced by the rise of cable television , which attracts viewers by means of contentious &quot; infotainment &quot; programs , and Internet bloggers , who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter . 
Reforms to alter the boundaries of Congressional districts to make them more competitive would help alleviate this problem , but few incumbent Congressmen will vote for changes that might increase their risk of defeat . 
The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe . 
Faced with difficult questions in foreign , fiscal , and social policy , he would be wise to turn toward the center rather than conciliate his conservative base , but it remains unclear whether the politics of conviction or of pragmatism will prevail .
