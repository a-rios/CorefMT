The Arabs Look Inward 
Across the Arab world , the fall of Baghdad on April 9th is seen as a day of shame , reminiscent of June 5th 1967 , when Israel defeated the armies of three Arab countries , conquering the West Bank , Gaza Strip , and East Jerusalem in a mere six days . 
Arab intellectuals , and indeed the wider Arab public , are now busy trying to analyze and understand the lessons of the Iraqi earthquake . 
Meanwhile , supporters of the former Ba &apos;athist regime in Iraq and others are now busy defending the same old totalitarian mindset . 
Their tactic has been to obstruct a clear review of the Iraqi catastrophe by suggesting that any criticism of Saddam &apos;s regime is tantamount to supporting the American occupation of Iraq . 
For example , Fahd Al-Fanek , a former Ba &apos;ath Party member , is now a columnist for the Jordanian newspaper Al-Ra &apos;i . 
In April , he wrote that the end of Saddam &apos;s hold on power in Iraq &quot; provided the opportunity for the enemies of the regime to shed crocodile tears at democracy and to denounce repression and dictatorship as an indirect gesture welcoming the American occupation . &quot; 
None of the anti-Saddam sentoment , Al-Fanek argued , was &quot; intended to serve the cause of democracy , but to support the American position and justify the American occupation . &quot; 
Interestingly , such retrospective support for Saddam and his dictatorial regime is now being met with growing indignation in the Arab World , because ordinary Arabs are only now learning of the crimes perpetrated by the Ba &apos;ath Party regime . 
Apologists for Saddam &apos;s rule are now facing some difficult questions . 
There is precedent for such soul-searching in the Arab world . 
In the aftermath of Israel &apos;s 1967 victory , Sadeq Jalal Al-Azm , a well-know Syrian intellectual and a professor of philosophy , published a book entitled &quot; Self-criticism after the defeat , &quot; which sharply criticised many aspects of Arab political culture . 
Al-Azm &apos;s book became a sensation , stimulating a wave of reviews and polemical exchanges . 
Back then , the paramount question was : How did a small state like Israel defeat the armies of three Arab countries and occupy vast areas of Egyptian , Jordanian and Syrian territory in a few days ? 
This question still echoes through the decades , and the many answers have dwelled not only on military failings , but on broader questions concerning Arab political , economic , cultural , and technological development . 
The prevailing response in the 1960 &apos;s to Israel &apos;s triumph was that the Arabs should adapt the guerilla strategies pursued by the Vietnamese , Chinese , and Cubans . 
Later on , the Soviet model became popular among nationalist and leftist movements fighting for independence when they seized power in Syria , Iraq , and South Yemen . 
Demands for democracy , popular participation , and political pluralism were shelved in favor of pan-Arab national slogans urging Arab unity , the liberation of Palestine and opposition to imperialism . 
But looking back on the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s , the socioeconomic failures of the despotic regimes that embodied this worldview are glaringly obvious . 
Their countries sank deeply into debt , with low rates of growth , endemic corruption , and bloated public sectors . 
Prisons were overcrowded , and cultural expression was stifled . 
Unsurprisingly , these regimes viewed the slightest criticism as treason and subversion . 
This was the stagnant context in which Iraq embarked on its military expansionism in 1991 , aimed at the occupation of Kuwait . 
Although the Iraqi forces were quickly expelled from Kuwait , Saddam &apos;s overwhelming defeat did nothing to undermine his stature in the Arab world . 
The remnants of Saddam &apos;s army were not pursued within Iraq , allowing him to crush the popular insurrection staged in the south , and remain in power . 
Despite trying to annex an Arab neighbor , Saddam was able to claim the nationalist mantle against the Americans . 
Today , the previously unknown crimes committed by Saddam &apos;s regime against numberless thousands of Iraqis are being revealed . 
Around the Arab world , people are comparing the nationalist rhetoric of the regime with the scope of its barbarism . 
Shame at the price the Iraqi people have paid for the false face of the Baathist regime can be detected everywhere . 
It is becoming clear that no achievement , regardless of how great it may be , can justify the human cost that the Iraqi people paid over the last four decades . 
In the weeks since the overthrow of Saddam &apos;s regime , and despite the American occupation , Iraqis are exercising an increasing degree of control over their daily lives . 
They are choosing local councils , publishing newspapers , and organizing various political and social organizations . 
The reconstruction of Iraq , which has now begun , will continue . 
The echoes of the Iraqi quake are being felt in every Arab capital , including those that put their faith in oil riches to protect them from popular discontent . 
Demands for political and economic reform are escalating . 
The winds of change will blow once again through the Middle East , which remains threatened by both religious fundamentalism and foreign pressure . 
The best alternative to both is a voluntary movement toward democratic openness and political pluralism , enabling citizens across the Arab world to participate in making the future of their countries .
