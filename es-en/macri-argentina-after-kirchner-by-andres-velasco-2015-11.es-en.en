Argentina &apos;s Fresh Start 
BUENOS AIRES - For the last 99 years , the presidency of Argentina has rotated between Peronists - Juan Domingo Perón and his populist followers - and reactionary generals . 
Every so often , centrists from the Radical Civic Union were voted into office , but their terms ended quickly , in resignations or coups . 
In Sunday &apos;s election , Argentina &apos;s voters broke the pattern : for the first time in almost a century , the president will not be a Peronist , a Radical , or an army general . 
It is difficult to overstate the significance of the occasion . 
According to Héctor Schamis , a political scientist at Georgetown University , if a similar political change had occurred in France or Brazil , the country &apos;s citizens would be celebrating the birth of a new republic . 
Argentina &apos;s new president-elect , Mauricio Macri , an engineer by training , is often described in the international press as &quot; center-right . &quot; 
But that label is not quite correct . 
In Argentina , the left-right divide has been blurred by the policies of the hydra-headed Perónist Justicialist Party , which privatized state companies in the 1990s , only to re-nationalize them later . 
Moreover , &quot; center-right &quot; often means &quot; conservative , &quot; and Macri &apos;s victory will not &quot; conserve &quot; the status quo . 
Macri is best described as a &quot; liberal &quot; - in the European sense of the word . 
That means , first of all , respect for Argentina &apos;s democratic institutions , badly damaged after a decade of rough handling by Presidents Néstor and Cristina Kirchner . 
It also means more market-friendly economic policy . 
One of Macri &apos;s early post-election proclamations was that he wants a &quot; developmentalist &quot; as finance minister . 
In Latin America , that means an economist who worries about growth , employment , and exports , as well as about balancing the budget and paying debts . 
Macri will phase out , albeit gradually , the stringent price and capital controls favored by the Peronists . 
And his trade and industry minister is unlikely to repeat the antics of a recent predecessor , who placed a gun on the table while negotiating import and export quotas with local producers . 
And yet , the world should not expect free-market zealotry from Macri . 
The coalition will not command a majority in either house of Congress , so legislating will require fashioning temporary ad hoc alliances . 
During the campaign , Macri displayed a sensitive political ear . 
He understood that Argentines were tired of the Kirchners &quot; imperious ( one might even say authoritarian ) political style , whereby anyone who disagreed with them was branded a lackey of dark imperialist forces . 
Even for a country with a political history as tumultuous as Argentina &apos;s , partisan polarization and vitriol had reached levels that seemed extreme . 
The contrast was striking even on Macri &apos;s first day as president-elect . 
Unlike Cristina Kirchner , who gave long-winded speeches but held no press conferences and took no questions from journalists , Macri answered queries until reporters had none left . 
As President , Macri will inherit a dire economic situation . 
The economy is shrinking . 
Inflation is above 20 % ( no one is sure by how much , because the figures have been doctored ) . 
The peso is overvalued . 
International reserves are dwindling quickly . 
And the budget deficit has reached 7 % of GDP . 
Some adjustment is inevitable . 
Fortunately , there is also some good news . 
The current account is roughly in balance , so there is no need for further import compression . 
And because no one would lend to Argentina after it defaulted in the early 2000s , the government has relatively little debt . 
By allowing the peso to depreciate , Macri could achieve two goals at once . 
A weaker currency would stimulate exports and allow imports to grow as foreign-exchange controls are lifted . 
Meanwhile , because a significant share of government revenues are dollar-linked , while its expenditures are mostly in pesos , devaluation would reduce the budget deficit . 
Macri &apos;s honeymoon is likely to be brief ; the Peronist opposition , having rid itself of the Kirchners , will not hesitate to attack the new administration . 
But if he uses his political capital wisely , he has a good chance of stabilizing the economy while retaining reasonable levels of political support . 
That would change the political outlook not only in Argentina , but throughout Latin America . 
In neighboring Brazil , President Dilma Rousseff &apos;s administration made little effort to hide its preference for Macri &apos;s opponent . 
As her government plumbs record lows in opinion polls , the centrist opposition has been inching toward power . 
Macri &apos;s victory could accelerate that process . 
Likewise , Macri &apos;s victory could give voters in Venezuela - headed to the polls on December 6 - the courage they need to cast their ballots against their increasingly authoritarian government . 
Indeed , Macri has announced that , in response to human rights violations in Venezuela , he will invoke the so-called &quot; democratic clause &quot; in the statutes of Mercosur , which could lead to Venezuela &apos;s suspension from the regional trading bloc . 
This stands in marked contrast to the cowardly and complicit silence of other governments in the region . 
If Macri follows through , that action alone will guarantee his presidency a mention in the history books .
