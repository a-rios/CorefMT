What Is Wrong with Terrorism ? 
People all over the world react with visceral horror to attacks on civilians by Al Quaeda , by Palestinian suicide bombers , by Basque or Chechen separatists , or by IRA militants . 
As there now seems to be a pause in the spate of suicide bombings and other terrorist acts - if only momentary - perhaps now is a moment to grapple with a fundamental question : What makes terrorist killings any more worthy of condemnation than other forms of murder ? 
The special opprobrium associated with the word &quot; terrorism &quot; must be understood as a condemnation of means , not ends . 
Of course , those who condemn terrorist attacks on civilians often also reject the ends that the attackers are trying to achieve . 
They think that a separate Basque state , or the withdrawal of US forces from the Middle East , for example , are not aims that anyone should be pursuing , let alone by violent means . 
But the condemnation does not depend on rejecting the aims of the terrorists . 
The reaction to the attacks of September 11 , 2001 on New York and Washington and their like underscores that such means are outrageous whatever the end ; they should not be used to achieve even a good end - indeed , even if there is no other way to achieve it . 
The normal balancing of costs against benefits is not allowable here . 
This claim is not as simple as it appears because it does not depend on a general moral principle forbidding all killing of non-combatants . 
Similarly , those who condemn terrorism as beyond the pale are usually not pacifists . 
They believe not only that it is all right to kill soldiers and bomb munitions depots in times of war , but that inflicting &quot; collateral damage &quot; on non-combatants it is sometimes unavoidable - and morally permissible . 
But if that is permissible , why is it wrong to aim directly at non-combatants if killing them will have a good chance of inducing the enemy to cease hostilities , withdraw from occupied territory , or grant independence ? 
Dying is bad , however one is killed . 
So why should a civilian death be acceptable if it occurs as a side-effect of combat that serves a worthy end , whereas a civilian death that is inflicted deliberately as a means to the same end is a terrorist outrage ? 
The distinction is not universally accepted - certainly not by the major belligerents in World War II . 
Hiroshima is the most famous example of terror bombing , but the Germans , the Japanese , and the British as well as the Americans deliberately slaughtered civilian non-combatants in large numbers . 
Today , however , terrorism inspires widespread revulsion , which in turn helps to justify military action against it . 
So it is essential that the reason for that revulsion become better understood . 
The core moral idea is a prohibition against aiming at the death of a harmless person . 
Everyone is presumed to be inviolable in this way until he himself becomes a danger to others ; so we are permitted to kill in self-defense , and to attack enemy combatants in war . 
But this is an exception to a general and strict requirement of respect for human life . 
So long as we are not doing any harm , no one may kill us just because it would be useful to do so . 
This minimal basic respect is owed to every individual , and it may not be violated even to achieve valuable long-term goals . 
However there are some activities , including legitimate self-defense or warfare , that create an unavoidable risk of harm to innocent parties . 
This is true not only of violent military or police actions but also of peaceful projects like major construction in densely populated cities . 
In those cases , if the aim is important enough , the activity is not morally prohibited provided due care is taken to minimize the risk of harm to innocent parties , consistent with the achievement of the aim . 
The moral point is that we are obliged to do our best to avoid or minimize civilian casualties in warfare , even if we know that we cannot avoid them completely . 
Those deaths do not violate the strictest protection of human life - that we may not aim to kill a harmless person . 
On the contrary , our aim is if possible to avoid such collateral deaths . 
Of course , the victim ends up dead whether killed deliberately by a terrorist or regrettably as the side effect of an attack on a legitimate military target . 
But in our sense of what we are owed morally by our fellow human beings , there is a huge difference between these two acts , and the attitudes they express toward human life . 
So long as it remains an effective means for weak parties to exert pressure on their more powerful enemies , terrorism cannot be expected to disappear . 
But we should hope nonetheless that the recognition of its special form of contempt for humanity will spread , rather than being lost as a result of its recent successes .
