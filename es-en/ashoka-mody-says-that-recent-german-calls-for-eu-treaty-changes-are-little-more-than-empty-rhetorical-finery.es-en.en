Europe &apos;s Deepening Muddle 
PRINCETON - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble recently declared that the European Union has &quot; moved sovereignty to the European level &quot; - a startling claim , given that European governments seem to be pursuing their national interests more aggressively than at any time since World War II . 
Was Schäuble &apos;s statement supposed to serve as a rallying cry for greater European solidarity ? 
Or was it just a ploy to deflect calls for a larger German contribution to the eurozone &apos;s recovery ? 
Schäuble is at the forefront of Germany &apos;s efforts to lead Europe without having to pay its bills . 
To this end , he has called for EU treaty changes to establish a European &quot; budget commissioner &quot; with authority to spend shared European funds and reject member countries &quot; fiscal strategies when they do not comply with established rules . 
According to Schäuble , negotiations for such reforms should begin immediately after the European Parliament election in May . 
While Schäuble &apos;s strategy may sound appealing , it is , at best , the symbolic garb of progress . 
For starters , the common funds are meager , with no prospect of being increased - not least because of Germany &apos;s unrelenting opposition . 
Likewise , so long as member countries maintain fiscal sovereignty , a new mechanism to facilitate finger-wagging at countries that defy European budget rules will change nothing . 
Over the last two decades , every effort to discipline the EU &apos;s fiscal delinquents has failed , owing to the lack of enforcement authority . 
Of course , when a country has run out of options , it will play along to gain access to official bailout funds . 
But , as Greece &apos;s experience has demonstrated , this does not always work out as planned . 
Indeed , the Greek bailout - jointly funded by the EU and the International Monetary Fund - began disastrously as it delayed a much-needed debt-restructuring and demanded strict austerity . 
As a result , the influence of extremist political forces has grown , and a public-health tragedy is brewing . 
Yet Schäuble , in a seemingly interminable quest for more austerity , views Greece as a model for an even more hapless Ukraine . 
Europe is in a muddle . 
With debt restructuring essentially ruled out and without a sizeable , politically-sanctioned central budget to relieve countries in distress , Europeans have anointed Germany as their presumptive hegemon . 
Germany relishes that role , but is not able to play the part . 
Simply put , Germany is unwilling to spend its taxpayers &quot; euros to bolster Europe . 
The robust German economy is little more than a memory at this point . 
Annual GDP grew by more than 3 % in 2010 and 2011 , because a still-booming Chinese economy was sustaining high demand for German machines and cars ; but , as China &apos;s GDP growth has slowed , so has Germany &apos;s , to an annual rate of less than 1 % . 
This is likely to improve slightly , but Germany &apos;s aging population means that its economy faces low potential growth in the long term . 
With Germany lacking the economic dynamism to support Europe financially , its leaders have been unwilling to take political risks . 
The country &apos;s two major political parties - the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats - sidestepped a public dialogue on Europe in the September 2013 election that produced their governing coalition . 
More revealing is Schäuble &apos;s defense of the European Central Bank &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; scheme ( which would permit the ECB to purchase unlimited amounts of weaker eurozone countries &quot; government bonds ) . 
Even as Germany &apos;s Bundesbank fiercely ( and rightly ) opposed the OMT program for its focus on countries &quot; solvency , rather than liquidity risk - thus creating a backdoor fiscal union - the government was relieved that the German Constitutional Court , assessing the scheme &apos;s legality , ultimately passed the buck to the European Court of Justice . 
After all , establishing a genuine fiscal union would require strong political commitment - and considerable legwork . 
The EU is an inspiring political structure that seeks to break the mold of the nineteenth-century nation-state . 
But progress toward that idealistic vision cannot continue to depend on shopworn symbolism . 
Its adoption was an act of economic hubris that has imposed costs well beyond Europe &apos;s borders . 
Today , European leaders are indulging in triumphalism , viewing the current economic reprieve as a validation of failed transnational governance structures . 
But the depth and persistence of the ongoing crisis have exposed the euro &apos;s fundamental fragilities , and should serve as a warning that today &apos;s technocratic Band-Aids may not hold in the face of another shock . 
Unfortunately , bold action to address these fragilities seems more distant than ever . 
Relinquishing some control over national budgets to achieve fiscal integration appears politically impossible , and talk of treaty changes - even if it comes from the German finance minister - amounts to little more than empty rhetorical finery . 
Adopting the euro was a mistake . 
But the damage is done , and precipitously abandoning the common currency would only make a bad situation worse . 
With countries unwilling to cede sovereignty , Europe &apos;s only option is to dump the pretense of centralized coordination , leaving countries and banks to deal with - and be disciplined by - their creditors . 
A step back to this more stable arrangement may offer the only way forward .
