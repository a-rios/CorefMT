Why Does Pain Hurt ? 
Pain is a familiar experience for everyone , but its nature remains a troubling enigma for sufferers and scientists alike . 
Why do different patients who undergo the same surgical procedure experience markedly different post-operative pain ? 
How is it that people with little or no medical explanation for a persistent pain become partially or totally disabled by it , even with extensive and resourceful treatment ? 
Many doctors would like to think of pain as a simple sensation that usefully calls disease or injury to our attention . 
A contemporary non-medical writer described the qualities of intense pain as including extreme unpleasantness , an ability to annihilate complex thoughts and other feelings , an ability to destroy language , and a strong resistance to objectification . 
She reminds physicians that , for the person suffering intense pain , what dominates awareness above all else is a powerful negative emotion . 
Most of the time , pain occurs after simple nerve endings detect tissue injury in various ways and generate signals that travel to the spinal cord and from there to the brain . 
For many years , scientists thought that these signals traveled along a few well-defined routes to reach a relay station in the brain called the thalamus . 
From there , scientists believed , the signals went on to the part of the brain &apos;s cortex that managed body awareness , and somehow the cortex turned them into conscious experience . 
Unfortunately , the neural roadmap for sensory messages of tissue injury explains only a part of how we experience pain . 
It cannot explain why pain involves emotion and cognition . 
Psychologists are quick to point out that whenever humans experience strong emotions , cognitions - thoughts , memories , expectations , beliefs , and interpretation of the situation - help form the experience . 
In other words , pain may begin with a neural message of tissue injury or disease , but it is the end product of complex events within the brain . 
The conscious experience of pain involves emotion and cognition as well as sensation . 
We always experience pain as a distressing thing happening in some part of the body , in some particular circumstance , and usually it has a particular meaning . 
New evidence points to more complex mechanisms for pain that involve higher levels of the brain . 
Injury messages , it seems , travel to many brain structures , not just to sensation-generating areas . 
Some injury messages directly excite brain structures that produce emotion , and these in turn stimulate areas of the brain that create the meaning of the immediate situation . 
Pain emerges into awareness only after sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes have combined to form a coherent , integrated pattern of experience . 
Studies of functional brain imaging in people experiencing pain tend to confirm this view . 
As we might expect , sensation-generating areas are active , but so are structures in emotion-generating areas of the brain and structures related to attention and thinking . 
Even motor structures that enable so-called &quot; fight or flight &quot; responses to a dangerous situation become active . 
Such studies show that simple signals of tissue injury generate many simultaneous brain processes . 
Because emotions and cognitions are an intrinsic part of the experience of pain , people differ greatly in their responses to a common injury , such as a standard surgical operation . 
Individual memory , beliefs , cultural background , and personal meaning all shape pain , so that an injury that is horrible to one person can be a minor discomfort to another . 
Psychological researchers are beginning to investigate why individual patients form the experience of pain differently when they experience similar tissue injury . 
Why seemingly healthy body areas can hurt persistently , and thereby disable a person , still eludes explanation . 
Some researchers are finding that long-lasting injury signals in neural pathways can change the way those pathways function , and over long periods of time , relentless signals of injury can even alter neural structures themselves . 
The altered parts of the nervous system might keep generating injury messages , even after the original injury has healed . 
Other researchers apply the same principle to higher levels of the brain . 
Memory of tissue injury rather than new messages of injury might contribute to the formation of pain , and in this way the brain might continuously create pain in the absence of its original cause . 
Alternatively , the brain might turn minor signaling of tissue injury into a major pain by mixing cognitive and emotional memories into the formation of the pain experience . 
Research on pain is progressing on many fronts . 
Perhaps the most challenging is that of understanding how the brain integrates sensory , emotional , and cognitive processes when an injury occurs to form the complex bodily awareness that we know as pain . 
Unlocking this secret may help doctors prevent , treat , or eliminate some chronic pain disorders .
