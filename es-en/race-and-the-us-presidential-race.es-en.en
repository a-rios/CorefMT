Race and the US Presidential Race 
BUENOS AIRES - Three-quarters of Americans now disapprove of President George W. Bush &apos;s performance . 
Given this , and the fact that the policies and values of John McCain and his vice-presidential nominee , Sarah Palin , are almost identical to those of Bush , you would expect Obama to be leading in the polls by a wider margin than he is . 
The reason that he is not , I suspect , is racism . 
When polled , most older white voters overwhelming reject Obama , even if many of them are unhappy with Bush . 
Indeed , one-third of Democrats have at various times told pollsters that they will not vote for a black candidate . 
And a recent Associated Press / Yahoo News poll suggested that his race is costing Obama six percentage points in the polls . 
Most of the time , this racism is covert , only hinted at through code words . 
The media , particularly the increasingly popular conservative media and talk radio , are particularly important here . 
Obama is consistently criticized for his &quot; otherness &quot; and his &quot; arrogance , &quot; terms that call to mind the image of the &quot; uppity nigger &quot; from the days of segregation , which are actually not so far in America &apos;s past . 
In a recent interview , Bill O &apos;Reilly , the most popular TV talk show host at Fox News , America &apos;s most watched news station , talked down to Obama in so condescending a manner that some viewers were reminded of the image of a slave owner in an old Hollywood movie putting a young black upstart in his place . 
Sean Hannity , another star host at the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox News , demanded repeatedly on air from one interviewee , Fareed Zakaria , a well-known columnist at Newsweek with a CNN talk show of his own , whether he thought America to be the greatest nation on earth . 
The dark-skinned Zakaria , a naturalized American from India with a Ph.D. from Harvard , felt compelled to affirm his loyalty for America twice . 
It is hard to imagine Hannity demanding such a public affirmation of loyalty from anyone with white skin . 
So how much is race costing Obama ? 
The problem is that pollsters cannot effectively measure the problem . 
They call it the &quot; Bradley effect , &quot; first noted during the 1982 governor &apos;s race in California , when Tom Bradley , the then African-American mayor of Los Angeles , lost the race to his white opponent despite leading in pre-election polls throughout the campaign . 
The idea behind the &quot; Bradley effect &quot; is that white voters won &apos;t reveal their prejudices to pollsters . 
Of course , many people now say that Obama has proven that the &quot; Bradley effect &quot; is a thing of the past . 
But his continuing difficulties with white working-class voters , who in the primaries went with Hillary Clinton , suggest that , perhaps , the &quot; Bradley effect &quot; is still alive and well . 
Younger Americans accept inter-racial relationships as part of the normal social and sexual landscape . 
Yet , the very speed with which American society has progressed has threatened half of the country , older and mostly white , unable and unwilling to live in the present . 
The moderate Republican Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Rockefellers has been taken over by a radical crowd , with even Eisenhower &apos;s granddaughter now openly backing Obama . 
So it boggles many non-Americans &quot; minds that so many in that great nation still do not wake up to the reality that four more years of Republican rule will further degrade and bankrupt the country . 
In any civilized society , ignorance is not illegal and being moralistic is anybody &apos;s inherent privilege . 
But what is alarming is how private religious beliefs and morals have increasingly shaped the secular agenda of America , whose Founding Fathers had specifically designed the Constitution to separate state and church . 
Today &apos;s radical Republican Party represents a large segment of the population that believes that abortions and same-sex marriage are immoral , God sent America to Iraq , and that bailing out Wall Street is &quot; socialism . &quot; 
At the Republican Convention in August , the ear-splitting chants of &quot; USA ! 
Palin has since identified the enemy , proclaiming of Obama : &quot; This is not a man who sees America like you and I see America . &quot; 
Whether or not her judgment carries a racist undertone , as many observers believe , the polls indicate that many Americans agree .
