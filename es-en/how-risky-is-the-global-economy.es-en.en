How Risky is the Global Economy ? 
NEWPORT BEACH - Three years after the global financial crisis , the global economy remains a confusing place - and for good reasons . 
Should we draw comfort from gradual healing in advanced countries and solid growth in emerging economies ? 
Or should we seek refuge against high oil prices , geopolitical shocks in the Middle East , and continued nuclear uncertainties in Japan , the world &apos;s third largest economy ? 
Many are opting for the first , more reassuring view of the world . 
Having overcome the worst of the global financial crisis , including a high risk of a worldwide depression , they are heartened by a widely shared sense that composure , if not confidence , has been restored . 
This global view is based on multispeed growth dynamics , with the healing and healthy segments of the global economy gradually pulling up the laggards . 
It is composed of highly profitable multinational companies , now investing and hiring workers ; advanced economies &quot; rescued banks paying off their emergency bailout loans ; the growing middle and upper classes in emerging economies buying more goods and services ; a healthier private sector paying more taxes , thereby alleviating pressure on government budgets ; and Germany , Europe &apos;s economic power , reaping the fruit of years of economic restructuring . 
Much , though not all , of the recent data support this global view . 
Indeed , the world has embarked on a path of gradual economic recovery , albeit uneven and far less vibrant than history would have suggested . 
If this path is maintained , the recovery will build momentum and broaden in both scope and impact . 
But &quot; if &quot; is where the second , less rosy view of the world comes in - a view that worries about both lower growth and higher inflation . 
While the obstacles are not yet sufficiently serious to derail the ongoing recovery , only a fool would gloss over them . 
I can think of four major issues - ranked by immediacy and relevance to the well being of the global economy - that are looming larger in importance and becoming more threatening in character . 
First , and foremost , the world as a whole has yet to deal fully with the economic consequences of unrest in the Middle East and the tragedies in Japan . 
While ongoing for weeks or months , these events have not yet produced their full disruptive impact on the global economy . 
It is not often that the world finds itself facing the stagflationary risk of lower demand and lower supply at the same time . 
And it is even more unusual to have two distinct developments leading to such an outcome . 
Yet such is the case today . 
The Middle Eastern uprisings have pushed oil prices higher , eating up consumer purchasing power while raising input prices for many producers . 
At the same time , Japan &apos;s trifecta of calamities - the massive earthquake , devastating tsunami , and paralyzing nuclear disaster - have gutted consumer confidence and disrupted cross-border production chains ( especially in technology and car factories ) . 
The second big global risk comes from Europe , where Germany &apos;s strong performance is coinciding with a debt crisis on the European Union &apos;s periphery . 
Last week , Portugal joined Greece and Ireland in seeking an official bailout to avoid a default that would undermine Europe &apos;s banking system . 
In exchange for emergency loans , all three countries have embarked on massive austerity . 
Yet , despite the tremendous social pain , this approach will make no dent in their large and rising debt overhang . 
Meanwhile , housing in the United States is weakening again - the third large global risk . 
Even though home prices have already fallen sharply , there has been no meaningful rebound . 
Indeed , in some areas , prices are again under downward pressure , which could worsen if mortgage finance becomes less readily available and more expensive , as is possible . 
With housing being such a critical driver of consumer behavior , any further substantial fall in home prices will sap confidence and lower spending . 
It will also make relocating even more difficult for Americans in certain parts of the country , aggravating the long-term-unemployment problem . 
Finally , there is the increasingly visible fiscal predicament in the US , the world &apos;s largest economy - and the one that provides the &quot; global public goods &quot; that are so critical to the healthy functioning of the world economy . 
Having used fiscal spending aggressively to avoid a depression , the US must now commit to a credible medium-term path of fiscal consolidation . 
This will involve difficult choices , delicate execution , and uncertain outcomes for both the federal government and the US Federal Reserve . 
The longer the US postpones the day of reckoning , the greater the risk to the dollar &apos;s global standing as the world &apos;s main reserve currency , and to the attractiveness of US government bonds as the true &quot; risk-free &quot; financial benchmark . 
The world has changed its supplier of global public goods in the past . 
The last time it happened , after World War II , an energized US replaced a devastated Britain . 
By contrast , there is no country today that is able and willing to step in should the US fail to get its act together . 
These four risks are material and consequential , and each is growing in importance . 
Fortunately , none of them is yet transformational for the global economy , and together they do not yet constitute a disruptive critical mass . 
But this is not to say that the global economy is in a safe zone . 
On the contrary , it is caught in a duel between healing and disruptive influences , in which it can ill afford any further intensification of the latter .
