How to Sell Anti-Protectionism 
STOCKHOLM - The looming global recession has brought government intervention to save failing companies to the forefront of economic policy . 
In a speech just prior to the recent G-20 summit , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned President-elect Barack Obama against bailing out America &apos;s struggling Big Three automakers , arguing that global competition has made their decline irreversible . 
A bailout , then , would simply delay the inevitable at a huge cost to taxpayers . 
Such advice is always tough to sell - all the more so in the face of the worst economic outlook in 70 years . 
After all , according to conventional wisdom , global competition moves jobs to low-cost countries and puts downward pressure on wages everywhere else . 
As globalization intensifies and accelerates economic change , it affects the lives of ordinary citizens like never before , stoking popular fear . 
Little wonder , then , that French president Nicolas Sarkozy succumbed to the allure of protectionism during last year &apos;s election campaign , as did both presidential candidates in the United States . 
But protectionism need not be the only alternative to fear of global competition . 
In the Scandinavian countries , as in the US , foreign competition intensified sharply during the past decade . 
China and India gained considerable economic power , and close neighbors in previously isolated communist states were rapidly integrated in the European economy . 
However , surveys by Pew Research show that in Sweden , 85 % of the population agrees that trade is good for their country , compared to only 59 % of Americans . 
Among Swedish industrial workers , the figure is 75 % in favor . 
How can that be ? 
By designing educational and social protection policies that strengthen the individual , Scandinavian politicians have sought to promote change rather than prevent it . 
The positive public opinion in Sweden is not a symptom of brainwashing , but a rational response to people &apos;s experience during the last decade . 
As competition intensified and production started moving to the Baltic States and Eastern Europe , Sweden &apos;s policy answer was to upgrade the skills of the work force . 
As a result , from 1997 to 2007 , Swedish exports nearly doubled and industrial production grew by 36 % , with manufacturing companies achieving record-high productivity growth . 
Indeed , while annual US output per hour grew by 6.2 % during this period , Swedish productivity rose by 8 % . 
Sweden accumulated a current-account surplus of 53 % of GDP , in contrast to America &apos;s 48 % -of-GDP deficit . 
Employment rose by 11 % , and blue-collar workers &quot; wages increased by 24 % , fueling a more than 30 % surge in private consumption . 
In short , even as globalization progressed , Swedish wage earners enjoyed a substantial improvement in living standards . 
While some jobs moved abroad , the net effect was still greatly positive . 
The secret behind Sweden &apos;s successful development , and hence people &apos;s attitudes , is how the costs of change are distributed . 
Official policy aims to reduce the cost of globalization for individuals , but never for companies . 
Entrepreneurs need to face competition in order to develop , whereas individuals who are laid off may have difficulties getting back into productive work . 
As trade minister of Sweden for most of this period , I never hindered or postponed import competition . 
In the European Union , Sweden voted against almost all anti-dumping and other protectionist proposals . 
This never met any criticism from my voters , because educational policy and the social safety net were designed to lower workers &quot; risk aversion . 
Broad educational policies equip an increasing share of Sweden &apos;s population with basic education , thereby enhancing their employability . 
Higher education is free of charge and accessible in all parts of the country . 
But reaching one cohort per year is too little to meet demands in a fast-changing economy . 
Therefore , on top of this , large resources are spent on modernizing the skills of those already in the labor force . 
Social protection also has a broad , general nature . 
In the Scandinavian countries , as opposed to , say , Germany and the US , the government , not individual companies , are responsible for most social benefits . 
That way , economically irrational lock-in effects , whereby workers simply cannot afford to change jobs , are avoided . 
Furthermore , benefits are generous enough to ensure that short periods of unemployment don &apos;t force workers to sell their homes or even cars . 
The system protects not only the unemployed , who can continue to pay their mortgages and interest , but also indirectly the banks , because their loans to households are repaid even in times of recession . 
And , instead of solving all sorts of economically caused private problems , laid-off workers can concentrate on finding new and more future-oriented jobs . 
No doubt , these policies are expensive . 
But they pay for themselves by producing growth and revenues . 
As the past decade shows , they have served the Scandinavian countries well during a period of extreme internationalization . 
Instead of giving in to conventional wisdom , we have exploited the possibilities that globalization and technological change offer . 
Could the Scandinavian model work for others ? 
At the very least , the Scandinavian example shows that politicians have more than one option to choose from when considering how to handle globalization . 
Intense foreign competition and rapid technological change does not have to be a race to the bottom . 
On the contrary , it can be compatible with rapidly rising real income and more and better jobs .
