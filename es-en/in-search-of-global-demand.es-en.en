In Search of Global Demand 
Once again , Germany and Japan have slipped into recession . 
Once again , the second and third largest of the world &apos;s major industrial economies are subtracting from , not adding to , growth in the world &apos;s aggregate demand . 
From the standpoint of German and Japanese citizens , this is bad news . 
Rapidly improving global technologies should make it relatively easy to deliver rising levels of output and living standards . 
Yet the German and the Japanese economies have had a hard time doing so for the past decade and a half . 
Certainly , everyone anticipated fifteen years ago that the current state of both economies would be much better . 
From the standpoint of global political stability , recession and stagnation in Germany and Japan is potentially even worse news . 
Democratic governments make a bargain with their people , gaining their long-run legitimacy from their ability to deliver rising living standards and high employment . 
Crisis , depression , and stagnation make people &apos;s thoughts turn to the fecklessness and corruption of mainstream politicians , the illegitimate powers of special interests , and the cretinism of parliaments . 
The thoughts people think in times of crisis and depression are not false . 
Mainstream politicians are often feckless and corrupt ( morally if not legally ) , special interests do have mighty and illegitimate powers , and legislatures are often cretinous . 
But there is no country in which attempts to draw political conclusions from these popular sentiments have not ended in disaster . 
From the standpoint of global economic stability , the failure of growth in Germany and Japan is perhaps the worst news of all . 
Six or seven years ago , there were vague worries that the world economy &apos;s developed core could not run indefinitely on one locomotive , the United States , alone . 
Now , due to appalling fiscal policy on the part of George W. Bush &apos;s administration and some bad luck , the US economy has wedged itself into a very uncomfortable position , hemmed in by its huge budget and trade deficits . 
Un-wedging America without a crisis - attaining the economists &quot; grail of a &quot; soft landing &quot; - requires that a great many people and institutions with enormous holdings of dollar-denominated assets passively stand by and take no action while those dollar-denominated assets lose a third or more of their value against other currencies . 
There is a recent precedent for this : from 1985 to 1987 , holders of dollar-denominated assets took a similar , but much smaller , bath . 
But can you step into the same river twice ? 
Moreover , achieving a successful soft landing requires more than that holders of dollar-denominated assets be tranquilized into catatonia while they lose their shirts . 
It also requires that at least eight million American workers who are now employed in construction , consumer services , and related industries find new jobs in export and import-competing industries . 
That &apos;s not all . 
At least sixteen million workers outside America who are now employed making exports to America would have to find jobs in other sectors as well . 
These jobs will have to fulfill demand coming from outside the US , because as a falling dollar and possibly a domestic recession shrinks the gap between American demand and American production , there must be a countervailing boost to demand relative to production outside the US . 
When the rebalancing comes - and it has already been delayed longer than I would have thought likely - it is important that , as former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers used to say , the world economy balance up rather than down . 
Without a rapidly growing Germany and Japan , where will the demand needed to &quot; balance up &quot; the world economy come from in the next several years ? 
A generation from now , we will probably be able to point to China and India as rapidly growing capital-hungry markets capable of filling gaps in global demand . 
But not yet . 
While China and India are enormous in terms of workers , they are still small in terms of output and demand . 
Without rapid demand growth somewhere in the developed world outside the US - and Germany and Japan are the best places to look - it is hard to see how the global economy can balance itself at a high level over the next few years .
