The Promise of Euro-Atlantic Missile Defense 
BRUSSELS - The new strategic arms reduction treaty ( START ) that Russian President Dmitri Medvedev and US President Barack Obama just signed in Prague is an historic achievement , and an inspiration for further progress in global arms control . 
But at the same time , here and now , we must also prepare to defend against another , less encouraging trend . 
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery is a threat to both the NATO allies and Russia . 
A look at current trends shows that more than 30 countries have or are developing missile capabilities . 
In many cases , these missiles could eventually threaten Europe &apos;s populations and territories . 
Iran is a case in point . 
It has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and is developing a nuclear program that it claims is for civilian purposes only . 
But Iran has gone far beyond what is necessary for a purely civilian program . It has concealed several nuclear facilities from the International Atomic Energy Agency , played hide-and-seek with the international community , and rejected all offers of cooperation from the United States , the European Union , and others . 
Most recently , Iran &apos;s government announced plans to enrich its uranium to levels that appear incompatible with civilian use and that defy several United Nations Security Council resolutions . 
Iran also has an extensive missile development program . Iranian officials declare that the range of their modified Shahab-3 missiles is 2,000 kilometers , putting Allied countries such as Turkey , Greece , Romania , and Bulgaria within reach . 
In February 2009 , Iran introduced the SAFIR 2 space launch vehicle . 
This is a key stage in the development of intermediate- and intercontinental-range missiles . 
If Iran completes this development , the whole of Europe , as well as all of Russia , would be within its range . 
Proliferators must know that the NATO allies are unwavering in their commitment to collective defense , including nuclear deterrence . 
Confronted with the spread of missile technology , and unpredictable regimes and leaders , we owe it to our populations to complement our deterrence capabilities with an effective missile-defense capability . 
We are not starting from scratch . 
NATO allies have been looking at various missile-defense options for some time . 
NATO itself is developing protections for our deployed troops . 
But with the new US approach to missile defense , there are now much better opportunities for an effective NATO-wide system that would enhance the territorial defense of our populations and nations . 
A true joint Euro-Atlantic missile defense would demonstrate NATO &apos;s collective will , not only to defend against the new threats of today and tomorrow , but also to send a clear message that there is nothing to be gained from missile proliferation . 
It can also provide an opportunity for Europeans to demonstrate again to the US their willingness to invest in self-defense capabilities , and to play an active role in a process that , until now , has been conducted largely over their heads , by the US and Russia . 
But there is another reason for developing missile defense : to create a new dynamic in European and Euro-Atlantic security . 
There is much talk these days about the Euro-Atlantic security architecture . 
Russia , in particular , has focused on treaties , conferences , and political arrangements . 
Clearly , these things can be useful and important . 
We should talk . 
We should look for common political approaches , many of which we have already agreed , and could easily endorse again . 
But , to my mind , a joint security architecture must move beyond blueprints . 
It needs to be built . 
And missile defense is a concrete way to do that . 
In this respect , the news that the US and Russia have agreed on a follow-up treaty to START that will substantially cut both countries &quot; nuclear arsenals provides a good backdrop . 
This new agreement makes the world safer , and it will give impetus to cooperation with Russia in other fields , particularly NATO-Russia relations . 
Since taking office last summer , I have invested considerable time and effort in revitalizing the NATO-Russia relationship , with progress made in several areas , including a joint review of common threats and challenges . 
But it is time to look at missile defense as another opportunity to bring us together . 
We need a missile-defense system that includes not just all NATO countries , but Russia , too . 
The more that missile defense is seen as a shared security roof - built , supported , and operated together - that protects us all , the more people from Vancouver to Vladivostok will know that they are part of one community . 
Such a security roof would be a strong political symbol that Russia is fully part of the Euro-Atlantic family , sharing the costs and benefits . 
Of course , there are practical challenges . 
We would have to make our systems interoperable , share intelligence assessments , and link sensitive technologies . 
But such cooperation is a concrete way to build mutual trust and confidence . 
For these reasons , the time has come to move forward on missile defense . 
We need a decision , by NATO &apos;s next summit in November , that missile defense is an Alliance mission , and that we will explore every opportunity to cooperate with Russia . 
But Russia also must decide to view missile defense as an opportunity , rather than a threat . 
If that happens , we can move forward to create a missile-defense system that not only defends the Euro-Atlantic community , but that also brings it together . 
The end of the Cold War has given us an enormous opportunity to achieve our goal of a Europe whole , free , and at peace . 
We are not quite there , but we are getting there . 
Missile defense can be part of that positive trend .
