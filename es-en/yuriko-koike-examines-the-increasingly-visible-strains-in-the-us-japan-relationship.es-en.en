Equality or Estrangement 
TOKYO - Those whom the gods would destroy , they grant their wishes . 
Will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the United States and Japan ? 
For a half-century , the US , which wrote Japan &apos;s postwar &quot; peace &quot; constitution , has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability . 
But now that Japan finally has a leader who agrees , the US is getting nervous , with Secretary of State John Kerry supposedly calling Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &quot; unpredictable . &quot; 
These strains in the US-Japan relationship - surely the foundation stone of Asian stability - first became noticeable in December , when Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo , which houses the &quot; souls &quot; of ( among others ) Class A war criminals from the Pacific War . 
The US has always criticized Japanese officials &quot; visits to the shrine , but through diplomatic channels . 
This time , America voiced its displeasure openly . 
The US is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pilgrimages on Japan &apos;s relations with its neighbors , particularly China and South Korea . 
But the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama &apos;s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe &apos;s government who question Obama &apos;s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America &apos;s defense commitment . 
Such suspicions were sharpened after China declared its new Air Defense Identification Zone , which overlaps Japanese sovereign territory . 
The US tried to have it both ways : though the Obama administration sent US bombers through the new ADIZ to demonstrate its refusal to recognize China &apos;s move , it also told US commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the Chinese authorities . 
Likewise , US acquiescence in China &apos;s de facto ouster of the Philippines from the Scarborough Shoal ( a disputed outcropping in the South China Sea ) raised questions in Japan about the two countries &quot; supposed harmony of interests . 
In fact , although the US extols the virtues of its partnership with Japan , successive American presidents have been vague about the details . 
Ultimately , the idea always seemed to be that Japan would pay more for defense , but the US would set the partnership &apos;s objectives . 
Abe &apos;s conception of the US-Japan partnership presupposes much greater equality . 
After all , a society like Japan , trying to escape two decades of economic malaise , cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national-security strategy , even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the US . 
Far from being based on chest-thumping nationalism , Abe &apos;s national-security strategy reflects , above all , a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the Japanese . 
His bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self-confident Japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape . 
Indeed , Abe has succeeded so well in returning Japan to the world stage that his US and Asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate Japanese self-confidence - a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago . 
But the fact remains that one of Abe &apos;s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied Japan &apos;s long economic stagnation . 
Those who see in his patriotic rhetoric a desire to whitewash history miss his real concern : economic revival is meaningless if it does not secure Japan &apos;s position as a leading Asian power . 
The US , however , regards Abe &apos;s worries about Japan &apos;s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with China and overhaul its strategic presence in the Pacific . 
For example , the US views the Trans-Pacific Partnership - the huge trade agreement involving it , Japan , and 10 other leading Pacific Rim countries - as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade . 
But , for Abe , the TPP &apos;s value for Japan &apos;s sense of identity - that it is now a more outward-looking nation - is just as important . 
In Abe &apos;s view , Japan needs to regain , wherever possible , the right of independent decision-making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by China . 
This does not mean that Abe &apos;s Japan will become an ally like France under Jacques Chirac , spurning US leadership for the sake of it ; instead , Abe seeks a policy of cooperation with the US that reflects the alliance &apos;s voluntary nature . 
He believes that , given the new balance of power in Asia , the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice , and the wherewithal , to act autonomously or with regional allies . 
Fortunately , Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different . 
Both generally view China as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach . 
And both believe that only when China is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for Asia take place . 
But even here , there is a difference . 
The US , convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy , believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power , a structure of peace will follow naturally . 
Abe , by contrast , believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon , and he is determined that Japan play its part in constructing that balance . 
Although Abe has lifted Japan &apos;s sights and self-confidence , he recognizes that Japan faces real limits . 
The US , too , should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally . 
Some wishes really are better left unfulfilled .
