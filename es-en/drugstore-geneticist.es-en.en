LA JOLLA , CALIFORNIA - Back in June 2000 , when the draft human-genome sequence was announced , US President Bill Clinton proclaimed , &quot; It will revolutionize the diagnosis , prevention , and treatment of most , if not all , human diseases . &quot; 
A decade later , hope has given way to disappointment , reflected in headlines like &quot; Gene Map Yields Few New Cures . &quot; 
But pessimism about the potential of human-genome research to yield medical breakthroughs has arisen from unrealistic expectations . 
Indeed , while &quot; silver bullets &quot; that can cure our most feared diseases have not been found , progress in the area of gene-drug interactions , known as pharmacogenomics , has been extraordinary . 
The ability to determine the principal genes that account for our variable response to prescription drugs has been advanced by a technique known as a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) . 
The whole human genome has approximately six billion bases , but a window into its composition can be probed using approximately one million bases ( 0.01 % of the genome ) via a gene chip . 
The bases on the chip are selected because they are informative , tagging bins of the genome , like a post-code directory . 
Using GWAS methodology , we have learned the biological basis for responses to many drugs - both their effectiveness and important side-effects . 
Examples of this progress in the past couple of years are plentiful , and include the statins , Plavix , interferon , warfarin , and the antibiotic flucloxacillin . 
The main side-effect of statins , which lower cholesterol in the blood , is severe muscle inflammation , and it can now be predicted with a simple genotype test , as can the response to Plavix , the second most commonly prescribed drug after statins . 
Those individuals who carry at least one copy of the gene variant that does not allow the body to metabolize Plavix have a 300 % higher risk of clotting a stent . 
This variation of the genome is exceptionally common , present in 30 % of individuals of European ancestry and more than 50 % of those of Asian ancestry . 
In many such patients , doubling the dose of Plavix , and checking the platelet function with a point-of-care test to assure suppression , can override the lack of response . 
There are alternative drugs , such as prasugrel or ticagrelor , which can be used instead of Plavix to bypass the problem . 
The story of interferon , given for one year to patients with hepatitis C virus , is particularly striking . 
This treatment is very costly ( about $ 50,000 ) and makes all patients feel quite ill with flu-like symptoms and general malaise . 
But the drug works in only half of the people treated . 
We now know that a simple genotype sorts out who will or will not benefit from interferon , and there are many new drugs in development for those who will not . 
The list goes on . 
For warfarin , a widely prescribed drug used to prevent blood clots , genotyping can guide the right dose and hasten the time it takes to get to steady state . 
Genotyping can also predict severe liver toxicity for drugs such as flucloxacillin or lumiricoxib . 
To be sure , our predictive ability is far from complete . 
We know only common gene variants from the GWAS approach . 
Furthermore , most drugs have not even been studied yet , so there is a long way to go fill in the holes . 
Nevertheless , substantive and remarkable progress has been made , all in the last few years . 
Moreover , someday we will know - via sequencing of the whole genome - about rarer genomic variations that are correlated with treatment response or side-effects . 
This has paved the way for next-generation pharmacies . 
Genotyping can now be accomplished in 20 minutes , and over time will get even faster . 
To fill a prescription for a drug with a known pharmacogenomic profile , a customer can get rapid genotyping to determine appropriate dose , drug , or predilection for serious side-effects . 
Or even better , many people will submit a saliva sample to a consumer genomics company , which will analyze all of their pharmacogenomic data and perform an extensive panel of genotypes , updated every month , and store the data on their smart phones . 
For mail-order prescriptions , such genomic data would be a routine part of the customer database . 
In the United States , pharmacy benefit managers ( PBM ) handle prescriptions for almost all large employers and account for more than 200 million individuals . 
Two of the largest PBMs , Medco and CVS / Caremark , have announced plans to conduct large-scale genotyping for many drugs . 
Their motives include more efficient use of prescription drugs , along with getting an edge on other PBM competitors . 
With annual expenditures for prescription drugs in the US totaling $ 300 billion , there is certainly room to cut costs . 
Unfortunately , the medical community is resisting the use of pharmacogenomic data in clinical practice , despite regulatory authorities &quot; recommendations for many drugs . 
PBMs and consumer genomic companies can be a positive force by facilitating or advancing the use of such data . 
The ultimate goal of pharmacogenomics is to provide the right drug , at the right dose , for the right individual , without any significant side-effects . 
Despite widespread misperceptions about the practical impact of genomic research , the science has hit its stride , and we need to capitalize on this momentum if we are to realize the opportunity of individualized medicine . 
Next-generation pharmacies represent a promising step toward that goal .
