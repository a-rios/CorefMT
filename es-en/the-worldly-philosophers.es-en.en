The Worldly Philosophers 
John Maynard Keynes , perhaps the greatest political economist of the 20th century , once said that in the long run , the course of history is determined as much by ideas and intellectuals as by politicians . 
He did not mean special advisers , or producers of programmes for immediate use and writers of speeches for presidents and prime ministers . 
Nor did he mean the newspaper and television commentators and pundits whose writings provide the background music to politics . 
He meant the authors of truly seminal ideas , like his own notion that from time to time capitalism must be saved by state intervention to manage aggregate demand . 
Keynes , of course , also reminded us that in the long run we are all dead . 
When his own influence was greatest - in the 1950 &apos;s and , above all , the 1960s - he in fact was dead . 
Others who had inspired ( if that is the correct word ) the totalitarian menaces of the 20th century had long been dead by the time their ideas came to fruition . 
Thus , the political effect of intellectuals is rarely immediate . 
It must bide its time . 
This has to do with another characteristic of the great ideas that define historical periods , namely the fact that they come from the margin of prevailing orthodoxies . 
When first produced and published , these ideas seem almost irrelevant , and at any rate out of tune with the spirit of the times . 
This was true of Friedrich von Hayek &apos;s &quot; Road to Serfdom &quot; and Karl Popper &apos;s &quot; Open Society and Its Enemies , &quot; both published at the end of WWII . 
Their real triumph occurred in 1989 , when Communism collapsed and the emerging new societies needed a language to express their goals . 
It was no accident that the books were then translated into almost every language of Eastern and Southeastern Europe . 
Similarly , Milton Friedman &apos;s panegyrics to pure capitalism seemed curiously out of place during the heyday of the social democratic age , the 1960 &apos;s . 
But then stagflation - the combination of weak economic growth and inflation - set in , in the late 1970 &apos;s . 
While gloomier economists like Mancur Olson surmised that only revolution or war could dissolve the rigidities of the status quo , Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher remembered Friedman &apos;s worldview , along with that of Hayek and others . 
Again , it was a question of giving substance and a language to vaguely perceived intentions that were slightly ahead of the popular mood but in keeping with its thrust . 
I never believed that the &quot; Third Way &quot; politics that held such sway in recent years had quite the same significance or intellectual pedigree . 
Squaring the circle of justice and growth was a necessary idea but not one that could ever inspire widespread enthusiasm and popular support . 
Even John Rawls &apos;s seminal &quot; Theory of Justice &quot; remained a pastime for the few rather than a precept for the many . 
While the Third Way lasted , however , another set of ideas , which originally seemed marginal and even absurd , gained ground . 
It built on the Friedman-Hayek conception of rolling back the social-democratic welfare state , but added a new set of ideas to the rudimentary state that remained - a state imbued solely with what Joseph Nye called &quot; hard power . &quot; 
Such hard power means &quot; law and order &quot; within and military might without . 
It is a state for a Hobbesian world in which security is the highest value . 
Such notions go back a long way . 
In the 20th century , some trace them to the German American émigré Leo Strauss , even to Carl Schmitt , Hitler &apos;s Jurist . 
More recently , authors assembled around the American magazine &quot; Commentary &quot; have espoused them . 
Washington think tanks helped turn them into a powerful intellectual arsenal for the neo-conservatives who thrive within the Bush Administration ( although the President himself is not one of them ) . 
So , once again , we find ideas that go back a long way coming to the fore . 
They were generated at the margin of an age with a much more liberal orthodoxy and picked up when the time was ripe by politicians who have found in them a useful organizing principle . 
They provide both maxims for action and a language to &quot; sell &quot; such action to the wider public . 
They dominate the intellectual scene to such an extent that alternatives seem to have no chance . 
They make even liberals look a bit faded . 
Or is there another Keynes in the wings somewhere ?
