A Post-Growth World ? 
PRINCETON - In a provocative recent paper , Robert Gordon of Northwestern University concludes that the rate of technological progress has slowed sharply , and that the rise in standards of living ( at least in the world &apos;s rich countries ) is thus set to decelerate . 
In the twentieth century , he says , per capita income in the United States doubled about every 25-30 years . 
But the next doubling will likely occur only over 100 years , a pace last seen in the nineteenth century . 
Long-term growth considerations , while recognized as crucial , seem distant from the here and now of financial repair and restoration of confidence . 
So the commentary on Gordon &apos;s paper has been largely dissociated from the policy discussions addressing the ongoing Great Recession . 
But a realistic assessment of growth prospects is precisely what is needed right now to design appropriate and feasible policies . 
Gordon &apos;s point is not that growth will decelerate in the future , but rather that underlying productivity growth moved to a sharply lower trajectory around the year 2000 . 
We lived the better part of the subsequent decade with a misguided sense of extended prosperity and inflated a financial bubble . 
Worse , we are treating the present as if the bubbly growth from 2000 to 2007 will return . 
Consider the International Monetary Fund &apos;s regular projections of world growth . 
In April 2010 , about 18 months after the Lehman Brothers meltdown , the crisis seemed over . 
The forecast was for world GDP to grow at about 4.5 % annually until 2015 , which is slightly higher than the pace during the pre-crisis decade , while the average annual inflation rate was projected to be lower , at 2.9 % . 
The future looked bright . 
Instead , after successive revisions , world GDP in 2012 is now expected to grow by only 3.3 % while inflation is forecast to reach 4 % , signaling much weaker global economic momentum than was anticipated . 
Lower-than-expected growth and higher-than-expected inflation have affected most economies . 
In 2011 and 2012 , the United Kingdom stood out among the advanced economies in this regard ; but the pattern holds even for Germany . 
The shine has similarly worn off the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) . 
Although projections by the IMF and others have been persistently optimistic , each setback has been treated as a temporary deviation , associated with its own unique cause : the Greek bailout , the tragic tsunami in Japan , the spike in volatility following Standard 
Poor &apos;s downgrade of US debt , and so on . 
The return to 4.5 % world growth has merely been pushed back - in the latest forecasts to 2015 . 
Faith in renewed growth is an ill-advised policy strategy . 
At its core , the global economic crisis is a growth crisis . 
Financial institutions and markets assumed productivity would continue to grow at the pace of the late 1990 &quot; s , which fostered an asset-price boom that conveyed an illusion of well-being ; those not directly involved in the financial bubble were coopted through buoyant international trade . 
European growth , with its heavy dependence on trade , received a special boost , as did emerging markets . 
Once the Great Recession began , this process operated in reverse , unwinding the excesses . 
But policymakers continued to benchmark recovery prospects to pre-crisis growth performance . 
When reality proved otherwise , the return of the past was not abandoned , but merely postponed . 
Continuing to assume the resumption of pre-crisis growth was necessary to justify postponing hard decisions . 
For example , a growth rebound underpins the expectation that the European periphery will not restructure or inflate away its sovereign debt . 
The assumption that the German economy will accelerate out of its current crawl is essential to confidence in Europe &apos;s financial safety net , and to a banking union that credibly shares risks across the eurozone . 
Resumption of robust world economic growth is the basis for delaying the implementation of the Basel III bank rules . 
And , if the BRICs slow down , they may be more prone to debt and currency crises . 
What is to be done ? 
Because the elixir of growth in policymakers &quot; forecasts cannot be counted on to solve the problems , dealing with financial excesses becomes even more urgent . 
That means more debt restructuring and more bank closures now , rather than watering down proposals to rein in freewheeling markets . 
Looking ahead , as Robert Shiller of Yale University has repeatedly emphasized , public policy must help to forge futures markets that hedge risks better and more reliably align incentives . 
There is no magical path to higher productivity growth . 
Even if Gordon &apos;s pessimism is excessive , the timing of the next breakthrough in technology is impossible to predict . 
So-called &quot; structural &quot; reforms may help , but the likely gains are small and uncertain . 
It may simply be time to learn how to live with less .
