Twenty-First Century Populism 
In Venezuela , Bolivia , and Ecuador a new left is said to being born , which their presidents call &quot; twenty-first century socialism . &quot; 
But , despite the supposed novelty of their vision , their actions seem only to be replicating the self-destructive policies that have brought such agony to Cuba . 
Unlike the old leftist movements , which relied on armed struggle , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , Bolivian President Evo Morales , and Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa came to power through the ballot box . 
In Venezuela , Chávez has strengthened his political position through a Constituent Assembly that changed the constitution . 
Bolivia &apos;s Morales also has managed to impose a similar Assembly , though with uncertain results , and Correa is wielding the threat of constitutional change against &quot; the traditional parties , the native oligarchies , and the empire &quot; - the common enemies of all three presidents . 
The Constituent Assembly approach has , so far , proven to be very effective in helping these new caudillos to consolidate their power . 
Because it is a process that calls for total reform , it helps them avoid debates about specific changes . 
Instead , social change is mingled with institutional reform in ways that may seem incomprehensible to voters . 
For example , Chávez &apos;s and Morales &quot; Constituent Assemblies are attractive not only to all of Venezuela &apos;s or Bolivia &apos;s radical groups who are seeking to re-found their Republics and reinvent history , but also to those who want to create a forum for democratic deliberation . 
As they deliberate , however , more and more power is concentrated in the new caudillos . 
The experiences of Venezuela and Bolivia suggest that the process only frustrates both radical and democratic forces . 
The radicals soon discover that changing norms is not enough to change reality , while the democrats find that heightened social mobilization makes dialogue impossible . 
In the end , the establishment of a Constituent Assembly merely weakens all other institutions . 
Since its focus is the &quot; law of laws , &quot; the Assembly implicitly questions the status of all public norms and bodies , thus eroding the political system . 
When this happens , the presidency is strengthened , enabling the incumbent &apos;s transformation into a caudillo . 
As is always the case , those who promote the concentration of power find justification for their acts in the revolutionary need to change structures , liberate the nation , and overcome poverty . 
But when this concentrated power actually begins to take action , all the old confusions of the left come back to life , as is now the case in Venezuela and Bolivia . 
The most flagrant confusion is that which conflates state and nation . 
As a result , transferring resources to the state is seen as putting them into the hands of the nation . 
Misled by this confusion , Venezuelans and Bolivians enthusiastically support the rebirth of state companies , without realizing that this only wastes resources that could have been spent better and more efficiently elsewhere , since few state companies ever succeed in ridding themselves of bureaucratic inefficiency or corruption . 
Another confusion , and perhaps a more dangerous one , similarly conflates &quot; the people &quot; with the so-called &quot; masses &quot; going out into the streets . 
The logic of this type of mobilization is that resources are directed to the group that shouts the loudest and is able to trigger social conflict . 
This means that attention is diverted from the weakest and those most in need to those who already are well enough off to be organized . 
Indeed , often it is the state itself , now controlled by a powerful president , that mobilizes chosen groups , aided by the concentration of enormous resources in the government &apos;s hands which has arisen due to greater state intervention in the economy . 
The fight to control oil and gas revenues is paramount in this regard . 
More than 90 % of Venezuela &apos;s export earnings come from the oil and gas sectors , which provide about half of the government &apos;s income . 
In Ecuador and Bolivia , income from oil and gas is more modest , but in both cases hydrocarbon exports account for the largest share of total exports , and provide about one-third of government revenue . 
This concentration of revenues radically changes the relationship between society and the state . 
In all three countries , the government &apos;s financial situation does not depend on the economic fate of companies or workers . 
When social organizations are limited and weak , as in Venezuela , this concentration of resources means that concentrated political power can perpetuate itself by reducing huge parts of the economy to dependent clients . 
When social organizations are strong , conflict arises to control public resources . 
In both cases , independent institutions begin to be perceived as enemies , which the caudillos and their client corporate groups seek to destroy . 
Latin American populism has always nurtured itself on this dynamic . 
Looking beyond the rhetoric of the new left in Venezuela , Bolivia , and Ecuador , it is already clear that today &apos;s &quot; twenty-first century socialism &quot; is no different from its twentieth-century antecedents . 
The main lesson seems to be that natural abundance may support democracy and development only when they are not in the hands of bureaucrats or caudillos .
