A Tale of Two Defaults 
BRUSSELS - Once upon a time , there was a country plagued by large deficits , high inflation , and decades of economic stagnation . 
When economic problems once again became particularly acute , the country &apos;s leadership embraced a radical approach to achieving price stability . 
A new currency was introduced and pegged to the US dollar at a one-to-one exchange rate . 
A new law stipulated that this quasi-monetary union was to last forever . 
Moreover , the economy was opened , state enterprises were privatized , and the country participated in an important regional free-trade initiative . 
Initially , the new arrangement worked very well . 
Growth returned , and confidence among foreign investors was such that large inflows of foreign direct investment , especially in the banking sector , arrived . 
But , after about 10 years , the success story turned bitter . 
The region &apos;s dominant trading partner devalued , and the US dollar appreciated considerably . 
The country thus had problems exporting . 
It developed external deficits and growth slowed . 
Moreover , fiscal policy had not been kept under control , resulting in increasing public debt . 
International investors were initially quite willing to finance the government , but risk premia started to increase when the deficits became chronic . 
The difficulties intensified when risk aversion in international financial markets increased markedly , owing to other emerging-market defaults . 
When the risk premia threatened to become unbearable , the international community responded with large financial support packages , financed principally by the International Monetary Fund and some friendly countries . 
The first rescue package envisaged a resumption of growth , a decline in the fiscal deficit , and structural reforms . 
None of this was achieved , as the economy deteriorated under the impact of the fiscal measures , which were not offset by a surge in exports , because wages could not be lowered to gain competitiveness . 
One year later , risk premia were even higher than before , and a second bailout package was put together , followed by a large &quot; voluntary &quot; debt rescheduling . 
But none of this was enough to restore the confidence of international investors , who were not convinced that the government could service its debt in the face of mounting social resistance and an economy that continued to contract . 
Even worse , the country &apos;s savers lost trust in their own government , and started to withdraw their deposits . 
As the deposit flight accelerated , the economy went into a tailspin and social tensions exploded . 
The government fell , and one of its fleeting successors announced a cessation of payments to foreign bondholders and an end to the currency peg . 
The country was Argentina , which took about 10 years to move from its hard exchange-rate peg to the dollar , introduced in 1991 , to its messy default at the turn of 2001-2002 . 
The Greek experience - so far , at least - looks like a replay of the Argentine drama . 
Greece also had a history of fiscal problems and inflation , which were supposed to be cured by admission to the European Union &apos;s Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) in 2001 ( coincidentally , just as Argentina was preparing to default ) . 
Its first decade in EMU was also characterized by rapid economic growth , fueled mainly by abundant and cheap capital inflows . 
But during this first decade , a key underlying problem emerged as Greece lost competitiveness relative to Germany , just as Argentina had lost competitiveness to Brazil . 
While Argentina had been hit by the fallout from the emerging-market debt crisis of the late 1990 &quot; s , Greece is now being hit by the increase in risk aversion since the financial crisis of 2008 . 
As with Argentina a decade ago , Greece no longer looks solvent to international investors when they consider the country &apos;s slow growth and higher risk premia . 
Their skepticism seems justified , since the usual indicators of debt sustainability look much worse for Greece than they did for Argentina . 
The Greek fiscal and external deficits are about three times larger , and the accumulated debt level is more than twice that of pre-default Argentina . 
The first large bailout package for Greece has also met a fate similar to Argentina &apos;s . 
One year on , risk premia are even higher , a second package is being put together , and private creditors are being asked to roll over their bond holdings &quot; voluntarily . &quot; 
Greece is also receiving much more foreign financial support than Argentina did . 
With the two rescue packages , Greece has been promised official credits worth € 230 billion - more than 100 % of its GDP . 
On top of this , Greece has received € 90 billion from the ECB ( at an interest rate of 1.25 % ) . 
This huge funding has so far saved the Greek banking system from collapse , and it constitutes the key advantage of joining a real monetary union as opposed Argentina &apos;s &quot; quasi-monetary union &quot; with the USD . 
But what happens if , like in Argentina , deposit flight continues and accelerates ? 
If Greek savers withdraw only one-half of their remaining deposits , the ECB will have to lend another € 100 billion to Greek banks to keep them afloat . 
Indeed , Greece might ultimately require more than € 400 billion in official support - almost 200 % of its GDP today . 
If Greece were to follow the Argentine script and be forced to leave the eurozone after a messy default , its nominal GDP is likely to be halved . 
In that case , the Greek government &apos;s debt to its eurozone partners would be equivalent to 400 % of its GDP , very little of which would be repaid . 
Argentina defaulted on its private debt , but at least it repaid all its official debt . 
Karl Marx famously wrote that history repeats itself as farce . 
In the case of Greece , history might turn out more like a much larger version of Argentina &apos;s tragedy .
