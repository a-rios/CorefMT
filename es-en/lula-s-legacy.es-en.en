Lula \ u0027s Legacy 
MEXICO CITY - The first round in Brazil &apos;s upcoming presidential elections , scheduled for October 3 , may turn out to be the only round . 
Rousseff &apos;s main opponent , São Paulo Governor José Serra , has not gained traction with voters , owing to his inconsistent stances - ranging from withering criticisms of Lula &apos;s foreign policy to outright support for his social policies . 
According to some polls , Serra is more than 20 points behind . 
Lula leaves office with astonishing popularity for a two-term Latin American president . 
The economy is growing at a double-digit rate , and the 2014 Soccer World Cup and 2016 Olympics are on the horizon . 
Under Lula &apos;s stewardship , millions of Brazilians emerged from poverty , and the middle class has become a majority - albeit a small one . 
Brazil has acquired an international stature worthy of its size and success , though perhaps not of its ambitions . 
Its democracy is thriving and vibrant , if not always effective or without corruption . 
But there are grounds for skepticism about Lula &apos;s legacy , and the fact that they are rarely mentioned does not diminish their significance . 
First , economic growth continues to be essentially based on domestic consumption and commodity exports . 
There is nothing wrong with either per se , so long as they are sustainable in the medium term and viable in the long term . 
The problem is that Brazil &apos;s overall investment rate remains around 16 % of GDP , far less than Mexico &apos;s or the Latin American average , not to mention China ( 40 % ) . 
At that rate , the country &apos;s infrastructure and competitiveness will inevitably decline . 
Rousseff &apos;s solution is massive state-funded investment , financed by the National Development Bank ( BNDS ) , in key economic sectors ( oil , meat-packing , construction ) . 
But that strategy will most likely reinforce the corruption that has been a fixture of Brazilian politics for decades - and which improved little under Lula . 
A second issue is the highly touted Bolsa Familia , which began under Lula &apos;s predecessor as Bolsa Escola , and was originally devised by the economist Santiago Levy under Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo . 
These &quot; conditional cash transfers &quot; were initially intended to stop inter-generational poverty by helping to ensure that children are properly fed , schooled , and kept healthy . 
But , under Lula ( and under Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón in Mexico , for that matter ) , they became a direct anti-poverty program aimed at the current generation of poor . 
No one questions the generosity of this mutation , but it is far from clear that the nearly 15 million families receiving Bolsa Familia will maintain their current income level when the stipend disappears , or that it can be sustained indefinitely . 
Bolsa Familia has been a stunning electoral success , and undoubtedly increased bottom-of-the-pyramid consumption in Brazil . 
But there are doubts as to what it can achieve in the long run to eradicate poverty . 
Third , Rousseff &apos;s rhetoric and origins as a militant leftist feed doubts as to whether she will pursue Lula &apos;s pragmatic , centrist economic and social policies . 
Her democratic credentials are as solid as his , but there are worries about her apparent enthusiasm for state intervention in the economy - she seems to believe in the virtues of Keynesian fiscal stimulus at all times - as well as her ability to control the Workers &quot; Party the way that Lula did . 
Foreign policy has been the most criticized aspect of Lula &apos;s tenure , and Rousseff will most likely make things worse . 
As an opponent of the military dictatorship that ruled his country years ago , Lula advocated respect for human rights , free and fair elections , and representative democracy . 
But he paid little heed to these issues in office , dismissing concerns about human rights and democracy throughout the region and elsewhere , particularly in Cuba , Venezuela , and Iran . 
Lula accentuated the traditional Brazilian attitude of not meddling in Cuban affairs , to the point of traveling to Havana shortly after a hunger-striking dissident died in prison there . 
When asked what he thought , Lula practically blamed the hunger striker for his death . 
He also welcomed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejhad in Brasilia and São Paulo almost as a hero barely three months after Ahmadinejhad stole Iran &apos;s presidential election in 2009 , which resulted in a wave of violent repression . 
And , within a year of the vote , Lula traveled to Iran . 
Lula also turned a blind eye to Hugo Chávez &apos;s increasingly heavy hand in Venezuela , never protesting or questioning his jailing of opponents , his crackdowns on the press , trade unions , and students , or his tampering with the electoral system . 
Brazilian corporations , especially construction companies , have huge investments and contracts in Venezuela , and Lula has used his friendship with the Castro brothers and Chávez to placate the left wing of his party , which has never been comfortable with his orthodox economic policies . 
Brazil &apos;s ambivalent stance on human rights and democracy under Lula goes hand in hand with its attitude toward nuclear proliferation . 
A signatory in the 1960 &quot; s of the Tlatelolco Treaty , which banned nuclear weapons from Latin America , Brazil dismantled its enrichment process and research facilities during the 1990 &quot; s and ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1998 . 
Then , in May of this year , Lula teamed up with Turkey in proposing a deal with Iran on its nuclear program , which the latter nominally accepted but the rest of the world did not . 
Whereas Brazil and Turkey claimed that the arrangement had been accepted by the US and Europe , the US called for - and got , with the support of Europe - new and stronger United Nations sanctions , which only Brazil and Turkey opposed . 
Brazil is on the cusp of sustained growth , higher international stature , and consolidating its middle-class status . 
But , until it develops a mature foreign policy that matches its economic aspirations - a foreign policy based on principled leadership , not heedless Third World solidarity - its global influence will be constrained .
