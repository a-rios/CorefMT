A New Greek Test for Europe 
PRINCETON - Over the last year , it has been easy to lose sight of the Greek debt crisis . 
Brimming with official funds , Greece was apparently on the mend . 
Though privatization plans lagged , the Greeks won high marks for doubling down on fiscal austerity . 
In Europe &apos;s summer of quiet triumphalism , ever-lower expectations were easy to beat . 
But Greece is set to test Europe again , with a vengeance . 
Greece &apos;s crisis was spectacularly outsize . 
After it was revealed that successive governments had misled their way to mammoth fiscal deficits and macroeconomic imbalances , Greece lost access to international bond markets . 
Since 2010 , the country has been dependent on unprecedentedly large official bailout funds . 
But , because Greece &apos;s creditors - the International Monetary Fund and European governments - misread the challenges facing the country , the rescue merely delayed the inevitable sovereign default and caused the Greek economy to contract sharply , magnifying the pain . 
The hope was that the Greeks would ultimately bear their own burden . 
That was never realistic . 
The Greek crisis was always destined to spill across national borders - the question was who would share the cost . 
Today , the leading edge of that dénouement is the impending decision on the next round of Greek aid , which threatens to break the mold on the scale of official debt forgiveness , defy the IMF &apos;s presumed insulation from default , and fundamentally alter the eurozone &apos;s legal framework . 
The conclusion that Greece needed official loans to repay its private creditors ensured that Greek debt remained large , compelling eurozone leaders to demand economically debilitating fiscal austerity . 
Last year , it became clear that Greece could not repay its official creditors on the agreed terms . 
But the European debt-forgiveness plan , though painstakingly crafted , was bogus . 
Continued reduction of interest rates and extension of repayment maturities have served only to prolong Greece &apos;s struggles . 
Greece has so far repaid almost none of the € 282 billion ( $ 372 billion ) in loans that it has received since 2010 . 
And matters may be even worse . 
Some analysts argue that , given guarantees of debt incurred by public corporations , the Greek government &apos;s obligations are even higher . 
To escape from this morass , Greece needs a massive debt write-down . 
But there is a twist . 
Virtually all of the debt repayments due in the next few years are to the IMF , whose implicit status as &quot; senior &quot; creditor ensures that it is repaid first . 
Because Greece is rapidly running out of cash , it will first have to borrow more from either its European neighbors or the IMF itself . 
If the IMF were to ease the terms on its Greek loans , it would likely face fierce protests from its less wealthy debtors and risk compromising its status as senior creditor - an outcome that even the Fund &apos;s largely quiescent Board of Governors is unlikely to accept . 
The Fund , having swooped in to pluck Greece from the abyss , is ready to step back from the brink . 
For that reason , European governments will probably lend new money , despite knowing that they will not be repaid . 
For the creditor countries &quot; leaders , a write-down would mean breaking the promise that their taxpayers would not foot the bill - a pledge that also formed the legal basis for supporting Greece . 
The European Court of Justice ruled that loans to protect financial stability would not violate the Lisbon Treaty &apos;s &quot; no bailout &quot; clause , provided that their terms were &quot; reasonable . &quot; 
But how reasonable is it if Greece does not have to fulfill its repayment obligations ? 
Despite domestic opposition , German Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to commit to keeping Greece in the eurozone , because the risk that a Greek exit would precipitate the monetary union &apos;s disintegration was deemed too great . 
But this logic failed to account for the political ramifications , which threaten to undermine European unity further . 
German voters - who will head to the polls later this month - are unmistakably anxious . 
While it may be too late to avoid forgiving Greece &apos;s existing debt , Germany &apos;s next government will not have a mandate to provide more loans . 
As a result , important projects like establishing a European banking union , which would require a fiscal backstop , are likely to be delayed or even endangered . 
The practice of presenting technocratic faits accomplis to national parliaments will only breed deeper resentments . 
To be sure , there is always the possibility that Greece &apos;s increasingly dire situation will finally catalyze the creation of a democratically legitimate pan-European bailout fund that provides automatic and unconditional relief to struggling countries . 
The European Union would thus be transformed into a true federation , the United States of Europe . 
That would be a triumph for the European project . 
Given the improbability of such an outcome , Europeans must brace themselves for another bout of political and legal turmoil . 
The Europe that emerges from it could look , for better or worse , very different from the Europe of today .
