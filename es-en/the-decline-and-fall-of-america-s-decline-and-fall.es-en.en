The Decline and Fall of America &apos;s Decline and Fall 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States is going through difficult times . 
Its post-2008 recovery has slowed , and some observers fear that Europe &apos;s financial problems could tip the American and world economy into a second recession . 
American politics , moreover , remains gridlocked over budgetary issues , and compromise will be even more difficult on the eve of the 2012 election , when Republicans hope that economic problems will help them unseat President Barack Obama . 
In these circumstances , many are predicting America &apos;s decline , especially relative to China . 
And it &apos;s not just pundits who think so . 
A recent Pew poll found that in 15 of 22 countries surveyed , most people believe that China either will replace or has replaced America as &quot; the world &apos;s leading superpower . &quot; 
In Britain , those putting China on top rose to 47 % , from 34 % in 2009 . 
Similar trends are evident in Germany , Spain , and France . 
Indeed , the poll found more pessimistic views of the US among our oldest and closest allies than in Latin America , Japan , Turkey , and Eastern Europe . 
But even Americans are divided equally about whether China will replace the US as a global superpower . 
Such sentiments reflect the slow growth and fiscal problems that followed the 2008 financial crisis , but they are not historically unprecedented . 
Americans have a long history of incorrectly estimating their power . 
In the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , after Sputnik , many thought that the Soviets might get the better of America ; in the 1980 &quot; s , it was the Japanese . 
Now it is the Chinese . 
But , with America &apos;s debt on a path to equaling its national income in a decade , and a fumbling political system that cannot seem to address the country &apos;s fundamental challenges , are the &quot; declinists &quot; finally right ? 
Much will depend on the uncertainties - often underestimated - brought about by future political change in China . 
Economic growth will bring China closer to the US in power resources , but that doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that China will surpass the US as the most powerful country . 
China &apos;s GDP will almost certainly surpass that of the US within a decade , owing to the size of its population and its impressive economic-growth rate . 
But , measured by per capita income , China will not equal the US for decades , if then . 
Moreover , even if China suffers no major domestic political setback , many current projections are based simply on GDP growth . 
As Japan , India , and others try to balance Chinese power , they welcome an American presence . 
It is as if Mexico and Canada sought a Chinese alliance to balance the US in North America . 
As for absolute decline , the US has very real problems , but the American economy remains highly productive . 
America remains first in total R D expenditure , first in university rankings , first in Nobel prizes , and first on indices of entrepreneurship . 
According to the World Economic Forum , which released its annual report on economic competitiveness last month , the US is the fifth most competitive economy in the world ( behind the small economies of Switzerland , Sweden , Finland , and Singapore ) . 
China ranks only 26th . 
Moreover , the US remains at the forefront of such cutting-edge technologies as biotech and nanotechnology . 
Some observers worry that American society will become sclerotic , like Britain at the peak of its power a century ago . 
But American culture is far more entrepreneurial and decentralized than was that of Britain , where industrialists &quot; sons sought aristocratic titles and honors in London . 
And despite recurrent bouts of concern throughout its history , America reaps huge benefits from immigration . 
In 2005 , foreign-born immigrants had participated in 25 % of technology start-ups in the previous decade . 
As Singapore &apos;s Lee Kuan Yew once told me , China can draw on a talent pool of 1.3 billion people , but the US can draw on the world &apos;s seven billion , and can recombine them in a diverse culture that enhances creativity in a way that ethnic Han nationalism cannot . 
Many commentators worry about America &apos;s inefficient political system . 
True , America &apos;s founding fathers created a system of checks and balances designed to preserve liberty at the price of efficiency . 
Moreover , the US is now experiencing a period of intense partisan polarization . 
But nasty politics is nothing new to the US : its founding era was hardly an idyll of dispassionate deliberation . 
American government and politics have always experienced such episodes , and , though overshadowed by current melodramas , they were sometimes worse than today &apos;s . 
The US faces serious problems : public debt , weak secondary education , and political gridlock , to name just a few . 
But one should remember that these problems are only part of the picture - and , in principle , they can be solved over the long term . 
It is important to distinguish such problems from those that cannot , in principle , be solved . 
Of course , whether America can implement the available solutions is uncertain ; several commissions have proposed feasible plans to change America &apos;s debt trajectory by raising taxes and cutting expenditures , but feasibility is no guarantee that they will be adopted . 
Still , Lee Kuan Yew is probably right to say that China &quot; will give the US a run for its money , &quot; but not surpass it in overall power in the first half of this century . 
If so , the gloomy predictions of absolute American decline will turn out to be as misleading as similar predictions in decades past . 
And , in relative terms , while the &quot; rise of the rest &quot; means that America will be less dominant than it once was , this does not mean that China will necessarily replace the US as the world &apos;s leading power .
