Europe &apos;s New Year &apos;s Irresolution 
BERLIN - Will the eurozone crisis end in 2013 , or will it drag on throughout the year , and perhaps even deteriorate anew ? 
This is likely to be not only the crucial question for the European Union &apos;s further development , but also a key issue affecting the performance of the global economy . 
While the EU clearly needs internal reforms , two external political factors are central to its prospects this year . 
The first is America &apos;s self-imposed fiscal cliff , which , if not avoided , could throw the United States into recession , with massive repercussions for the world economy , and thus for Europe . 
Second , a hot war in the Persian Gulf , in which Israel and / or the US confronts Iran over its nuclear program , would result in a sharp rise in global energy prices . 
Either scenario would greatly aggravate Europe &apos;s crisis : soaring oil costs or another US recession would harm even the strong northern European economies , to say nothing of the already-depressed countries in Europe &apos;s south . 
Indeed , Europe &apos;s crisis only seems to be economic or financial in nature ; in reality , it is political to the core , for it has revealed that Europe lacks two things : a political framework - that is , more statehood - for its monetary union , and the vision and leadership to create it . 
Since the eruption of the European crisis in 2009 , the EU and the eurozone have experienced massive , unprecedented changes . 
Today , the eurozone is on its way toward implementing a banking union , probably followed by a fiscal union , which in turn will lead to a genuine political union that centralizes sovereignty over essential economic policymaking . 
Had there been no crisis , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other national leaders in the EU would never have been prepared to take these steps . 
And this is not likely to change in 2013 . 
Even today , with the eurozone &apos;s essential players apparently convinced that they are out of the woods , national narrow-mindedness is experiencing a revival in the EU , and the desire for change seems to be slackening . 
In particular , Merkel wants to be re-elected in 2013 , and appears content to leave Europe for later . 
Unfortunately , with the election set for September , that means that three-quarters of the year will be wasted . 
As a result , developments in southern European will remain a key factor determining Europe &apos;s course in 2013 . 
The depression will continue , dimming prospects for economic growth throughout the EU and the eurozone . 
The gap between the rich north and the crisis-ridden south will widen , highlighting their contradictory interests and thus exacerbating Europe &apos;s tendency toward separation , primarily between the north and the south , but also between the eurozone and the rest of the EU . 
The European Central Bank will serve as the eurozone &apos;s center of power even more than it does today , because it is the monetary union &apos;s only institution that can actually act . Though the ECB has absolutely nothing in common with the old Deutsche Bundesbank , the German public has not recognized this . 
But the fact that the ECB &apos;s power is only a technocratic substitute for the eurozone &apos;s missing democratic political institutions will remain a growing problem in 2013 . 
This is also true , more generally , of German dominance of the EU . 
Should it continue without new institutional regulations that mutualize its role within the eurozone , 2013 will be a year of further disintegration . 
It will also be a year of destiny for France , whose government is keenly aware that , without painful reforms , the country might be doomed ; the only question that remains is whether it can implement them . 
The answer will determine not only President Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s political future , but also the future of the EU , because , without a strong German-French tandem , Europe &apos;s crisis cannot be overcome . 
Meanwhile , Europe &apos;s negative political trends are reinforced by uncertainty in Britain about whether to remain in the EU , Italy &apos;s upcoming general election , and aggressive nationalism in many member states . 
Given this , Europe &apos;s condition is quite obviously far from being stabilized , despite some leading Europeans &quot; recent statements suggesting otherwise . 
Europe in 2013 will continue to need the pressure from the crisis in order to find a way to overcome it once and for all . 
Regardless of electoral outcomes in important EU member states , Europeans will remain unable to expect much from their political leaders , because opposition forces generally have little more to offer than the incumbents do . 
We should wish Europe a successful year , but it would be foolish to bet on it .
