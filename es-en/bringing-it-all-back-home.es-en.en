Bringing It All Back Home 
PARIS - Global policymakers regularly congratulate themselves on having avoided the policy errors of the 1930 &quot; s during the financial crisis that began in 2008 . 
Led by US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke , an economic historian of the Great Depression , they remembered the ideas of John Maynard Keynes and loosened monetary and fiscal policy to avoid the worst . 
We are still coping with the budgetary consequences , especially in Europe , but it is true that the world did not end in 2008 . 
Monetary tightening was not the only major policy error of the 1930 &quot; s ; so was a retreat into protectionism , symbolized by the Smoot-Hawley tariff increases at the beginning of that decade . 
Historians continue to debate the centrality of the Smoot-Hawley law itself , but the subsequent tariff war certainly damaged trade and economic growth , making a bad situation worse . 
Today &apos;s statesmen like to say that they have avoided the protectionist error as well , but is that true ? 
Certainly I do not expect a tariff war to break out in the near term , but there are dangerous indicators of trade trouble ahead . 
The Doha round of global free-trade talks has been abandoned , and the World Trade Organization is now languishing by the lake in Geneva , uncertain of its future . 
Perhaps Doha was unlikely to achieve much in the current circumstances , but the absence of any continuing dialogue on world trade - at worst , a useful safety valve - adds a new level of risk . 
While people are talking , they are less likely to act precipitately . 
In the financial arena , there are many signs of a revival of nationalistic approaches to regulation and currency policy . 
The crisis challenged the Washington Consensus , which assumed that the world was moving gradually towards free movement of capital and market-determined exchange rates . 
Several countries - including Brazil , South Korea , and Turkey - have now imposed capital controls of various kinds . 
Even the International Monetary Fund , long the embodiment of the Washington Consensus , has acknowledged that &quot; capital controls are a legitimate part of the toolkit to manage capital flows in certain circumstances . &quot; 
American Congressmen view the Chinese as archetypal currency manipulators , but the Swiss have introduced a firm cap on the franc &apos;s appreciation . 
These early signs of deglobalization of financial markets have their parallels in commercial banking , with some of the biggest global institutions retrenching rapidly . 
Citibank and HSBC had gone further than most in developing a global footprint ; indeed , one can hardly get on a plane nowadays without being reminded that the latter is &quot; the world &apos;s local bank . &quot; 
But both are closing down in many countries . 
Likewise , many other European banks are cutting back their overseas business sharply . 
The impact is particularly vivid in trade finance , where European banks have been major participants in Asia . 
Now they are in rapid retreat from that market , creating a worrying gap that Asian banks are seeking to fill . 
There is more to come . 
As they struggle to raise new capital , European banks and insurers are likely to be forced to sell overseas assets . 
If this were simply a sign of a new , tighter focus on viable long-term strategies , it might be regarded it as a benign development . 
But there are indications that the process is being driven by regulatory change , and in some cases by regulatory protectionism . 
Banks are overseen by a &quot; home &quot; regulator in their country of incorporation , and by a series of &quot; host &quot; regulators where they operate . 
&quot; Home &quot; regulators and lenders of last resort are increasingly worried about their potential exposure to losses in banks &quot; overseas operations . 
As Mervyn King , the Governor of the Bank of England , acutely observed , &quot; banks are global in life , but national in death . &quot; 
In other words , home authorities are left to pick up the tab when things go wrong . 
Host regulators are increasingly nervous about banks that operate in their jurisdictions through branches of their corporate parent , without local capital or a local board of directors . 
So they are insisting on subsidiarization . 
From the banks &quot; perspective , that means that capital is trapped in subsidiaries , and cannot be optimally used across its network . 
So banks may prefer to pull out instead . 
A particular version of this phenomenon is at work in the European Union . 
In the single financial market , banks are allowed to take deposits anywhere , without local approval , if they are authorized to do so in one European country . 
Yet when the Icelandic banks failed , the British and Dutch authorities had to bail out local depositors . 
Now regulators are discouraging such cross-border business , leading to a process with the ugly new name of &quot; de-euroization . &quot; 
We can only hope that it does not catch on . 
Regulators , recognizing the risks of allowing financial deglobalization to accelerate , have been seeking better means of handling the failure of huge global banks . 
If banks can be wound up easily when things go wrong , with losses equitably distributed , regulators can more easily allow them to continue to operate globally and efficiently . 
So a major effort to construct a cross-border resolution framework is under way . 
But it is uphill work , and Daniel Tarullo , a governor of the Federal Reserve , has acknowledged that &quot; a clean and comprehensive solution is not in sight . &quot; 
Does all of this amount to a serious threat to the benefits of globalization ? 
The cautious answer would be that it is too early to say . 
Perhaps we are just seeing the beginnings of a changing of the guard , and that HSBC and Citibank will be replaced as global players by China &apos;s ICBC , Brazil &apos;s Itau Unibanco , or Russia &apos;s Sberbank . 
But it may be that we are seeing a revival of a less benign Keynesian doctrine : &quot; ideas , knowledge , science .... should of their nature be international . 
But let goods be homespun wherever it is reasonably and conveniently possible and , above all , let finance be national . &quot;
