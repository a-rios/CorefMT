Flexible Employment is Key 
GLATTBRUG , SWITZERLAND - Rising youth unemployment , especially in Europe , is making headlines worldwide . 
Roughly 5.5 million Europeans under the age of 25 are unemployed . 
More than 7.5 million people aged 15-24 are &quot; NEETs &quot; - not in employment , education , or training . The youth unemployment rate exceeds 25 % in 13 European countries , amounting to roughly 30 % in Italy , Ireland , Bulgaria , Cyprus , Latvia , Hungary , and Slovakia , and surpassing 55 % in Greece and Spain . 
Furthermore , more than 30 % of jobseekers under 25 have been unemployed for more than 12 months , and their chances of finding employment remain low . 
Less than one-third of young people who were unemployed in 2010 found a job in 2011 , and their chances continue to decline . 
According to a recent report by Eurofound , the economic cost ( benefits paid plus tax-revenue lost ) of young NEETs exceeds € 150 billion ( $ 196 billion ) annually - more than 1.2 % of the European Union &apos;s total GDP . 
In some countries - such as Bulgaria , Cyprus , Greece , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Latvia , and Poland - youth unemployment costs more than 2 % of GDP . 
If allowed to continue , Europe &apos;s labor-market crisis will inflict lasting damage on an entire generation , with unforeseeable medium- and long-term effects on employment , productivity , and social cohesion . 
Reversing this trend will require concrete proposals and decisive action . 
Countries must pursue solutions that help companies to create jobs by becoming more flexible , thus increasing their competitiveness . 
The European Commission has placed youth unemployment high on its agenda . 
Indeed , last month , European Commissioner László Andor announced the adoption of the &quot; Youth Employment Package , &quot; a set of proposals designed to help EU member states and relevant stakeholders to tackle youth unemployment and social exclusion . 
A key recommendation is the creation of national &quot; youth guarantee schemes , &quot; which would ensure that all citizens under 25 can obtain a job , an apprenticeship , or a traineeship within four months of leaving formal education or becoming jobless . 
Given the potential of such schemes to narrow the gap between education and work , and to improve young people &apos;s employability , member states should pursue this recommendation earnestly , by implementing measures aimed at enabling labor integration and forging partnerships with stakeholders . 
Private employment agencies are already helping to develop comprehensive solutions , connecting industry and business with governing bodies and institutions at all levels - including the EU , the OECD , the G-20 , and the International Labor Organization - through national and regional mechanisms and even global platforms like the World Economic Forum . 
Given that putting people to work forms the bedrock of their business model , such agencies are ideally suited to provide this link . 
They know that employment opportunities constitute a basic human right , and that work is a source of dignity , giving individuals a sense of purpose and strengthening communities . 
Moreover , in balancing companies &quot; needs with workers &quot; skills , private employment agencies gain a comprehensive understanding of the labor market . 
They help workers and companies alike to tackle labor-market challenges , while meeting demand for flexibility ( an important potential catalyst for both companies and workers ) - that is , if certain structural and regulatory requirements are implemented . 
Although regulation poses significant challenges for the staffing industry , among others , properly regulated labor markets are crucial to ensuring that workers are protected and companies remain competitive . 
Fallout from austerity policies has often hindered needed labor-market reforms , a trend that must be reversed . 
The private employment industry has pledged to help 75 million young people to enter the labor market . 
But , this promise can be fulfilled only if multinational companies support the effort , empowering staffing agencies to deliver quality employment . 
Companies worldwide - whether in countries experiencing jobless or job-poor economic recovery , or in thriving countries where the mismatch between available positions and workers &quot; skills worsens daily - must recognize that creating additional flexible jobs will advance their business and boost their competitiveness . 
Employment - particularly among young people - must top the global economic agenda . 
With the right tools and support , private employment agencies can help to arrest the downward spiral of youth unemployment . 
But they cannot do it alone . 
It is time for all stakeholders to devise and implement measures that give young people the opportunity to make a better life through better work .
