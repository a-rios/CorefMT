Obama &apos;s Policy of Nuclear Balance 
WASHINGTON , DC - Perhaps never in history have nuclear security , non-proliferation , and arms control received the prominence that they will during this month &apos;s strategic trifecta : the April 6 release of the latest United States Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) , the April 8 signing in Prague of the New START Treaty , and the April 12-13 Nuclear Security Summit . 
These events will flow into May &apos;s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) Review Conference . 
US President Barack Obama has become one of the most prominent global advocates of abolishing nuclear weapons , a position for which he unexpectedly received a Noble Peace Prize last year . 
But Obama &apos;s actions have been considerably more restrained than is often assumed . 
In general , Obama has pursued a policy of nuclear balance in which steps towards disarmament are accompanied by measures to retain America &apos;s nuclear primacy . 
The former underscore his administration &apos;s commitment to meeting its obligations under the NPT , while the latter reassure the US Congress and allies skeptical of bold new approaches . 
The administration &apos;s policies strive to address the aspirations of global disarmament advocates in several ways . 
The NPR , for example , further reduces America &apos;s reliance on nuclear weapons by adopting an almost no-first-use doctrine . 
Only in &quot; extreme circumstances &quot; would the US consider using nuclear weapons . 
For the first time , the US pledges not to retaliate with a nuclear strike even if attacked by chemical or biological weapons . 
The NPR also commits the US not to develop new nuclear weapons , missions , or capabilities . 
Obama &apos;s administration will instead continue to enhance the roles and capabilities of US conventional forces to perform missions previously assigned to nuclear weapons . 
In addition , his administration pledges not to resume testing nuclear weapons by detonating them , and to seek to bring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) into force by securing its ratification by the US Senate and all other countries . 
Symbolic of the administration &apos;s commitment to transparency and openness , the Obama NPR is the first such document to be entirely unclassified . 
In describing the New START Treaty , Obama administration officials stress the magnitude of the reductions . 
The number of permissible deployed warheads , 1,550 , is 74 % lower than the limit of the 1991 START Treaty and 30 % below the cap set by the 2002 Moscow Treaty . 
The limit for strategic nuclear-delivery vehicles is less than half that of the original START Treaty . 
The administration describes these lower ceilings , and its pursuit of other arms control measures , as meeting America &apos;s non-proliferation and disarmament obligations under the NPT . 
Nevertheless , the administration has sought to meet the concerns of those Americans and US allies worried that Obama might pursue a na√Øve and reckless path toward nuclear disarmament . 
Although Obama has endorsed the goal of abolishing nuclear weapons , he has described this as a long-term effort , and offered no concrete time-line for achieving it . 
No date has been set when Obama will ask the Senate to reconsider the CTBT . 
Whereas advocates of abolishing nuclear weapons wanted his administration to employ a zero-based approach to nuclear planning , with the burden of proof on those seeking to retain nuclear weapons to fulfill essential military functions , the NPR presumes the continuation of current nuclear roles and missions unless convincing arguments exist to end them . 
It presumes that &quot; the United States will sustain a safe , secure , and effective nuclear deterrent ... as long as nuclear weapons exist . &quot; 
The NPR affirms the policy of extended nuclear deterrence , under which the US retains the option to employ nuclear weapons to defend its allies . 
Skeptics doubt the credibility of this policy , which in principle obliges the US to sacrifice New York in response to an attack on Warsaw , or endanger Los Angeles to defend Taipei . 
But proponents of such US guarantees believe that they discourage aggression and contribute to nuclear non-proliferation by reducing the incentive of US allies to seek their own nuclear deterrents . 
In this context , the administration has rejected calls to withdraw US tactical nuclear weapons from Europe unilaterally , insisting that it will only do so with the consent of all NATO members . 
Moreover , the no-first-use pledge in the NPR contains an important hedge . 
It commits the US not to employ or threaten to employ nuclear weapons against states that do not possess them , provided that these countries remain in compliance with the NPT and their other nuclear non-proliferation obligations . 
The Obama administration considers both Iran and North Korea to be outside this category . 
American START negotiators argued with their Russian colleagues for months to exclude legally binding language that might constrain missile defenses or the use of non-nuclear warheads on long-range ballistic missiles . 
Although some US officials remain skeptical about these capabilities , they appreciate that Congress might not ratify a START Treaty that included formal limitations on these options . 
Even with the lower ceilings found in the New START Treaty , the US will maintain thousands of nuclear weapons , as well as the long-standing US &quot; strategic triad &quot; of intercontinental land-based and submarine-launched ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable bombers . 
Having this mixture helps ensure that if technological developments render one leg vulnerable , the others can still threaten sufficient retaliation . 
The US will seek to guarantee the reliability of its nuclear weapons by spending billions of dollars to improve its nuclear weapons infrastructure and conduct tests not involving nuclear detonations . 
The Nuclear Security Summit plays an essential role in linking both strands of Obama &apos;s nuclear policies . 
American liberals and conservatives , as well as US friends and allies , all favor the principle of enhancing the security of dangerous nuclear materials and reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism , which could plausibly threaten anyone . 
Obama has introduced important innovations in US nuclear policy , but much important continuity with previous policies exist . 
Given the stakes , continuing to rely on proven approaches , even while trying to promote a world with fewer and safer nuclear weapons , is a judicious strategy .
