Escape from Mecca 
LOS ANGELES - The recent stampede in Mecca , in which more than a thousand pilgrims making the hajj were trampled to death , is a tragic but powerful reminder of the city &apos;s prominence in the Muslim world . 
According to theological tradition , every Muslim is required to make a trip to the city once in their lifetime , if they are able to do so . 
In practice , however , it is only in recent times that making a pilgrimage to Mecca has come to play such an important role in Islam . 
The city has always had symbolic significance , but its importance to millions of Muslims worldwide is largely a modern phenomenon , one that has grown in recent decades as Saudi officials and fundamentalist Wahhabi clerics promoted religious tourism as a means of spreading their influence . 
For most of Islamic history , the overwhelmingly majority of Muslims did not travel to Mecca . 
Instead , they made local pilgrimages to the major shrines that still garland the Muslim world . 
Some are to Koranic prophets even older than Muhammad ; others are to Shia imams or Sufi saints ; and still others are to hallowed Muslim women . 
The name of one holy place , the necropolis of Makli in Pakistan , hints at its medieval ambition to become an alternative destination for pilgrims : Makli means the &quot; little Mecca . &quot; 
The modern hajj has its origins in the rise of religious tourism to Mecca in the nineteenth century , when steamships began transporting large numbers of pilgrims to the Arabian Peninsula . 
Then , as now , there was little local effort to limit the number of pilgrims to safe levels or to provide adequate infrastructure and security to handle the masses of visitors . 
Annual influxes of hundreds of thousands of pilgrims closely packed into steamships were blamed for spreading cholera through port cities from Bombay to Hamburg , making the hajj a major cause of death around the world . 
For the most part , the pilgrimage &apos;s religious nature has muted criticism of the way it was handled . 
But contemporary accounts make clear that not all were pleased with Mecca &apos;s management of the event . 
In the 1860s , the female Indian Muslim ruler of Bhopal , Sikandar Begum , wrote a warts-and-all account of Mecca as a &quot; wild and melancholy-looking &quot; city whose &quot; dirty and ill-drained &quot; streets were filled with disease and disorder . 
A half-century later , the Central Asian pilgrim &quot; Abd al-Rashid Ibrahim described the holy city &apos;s filth and squalor , recounting stories of pilgrims walking through streets ankle deep in excrement . 
Religious tourism played a central role in the region &apos;s nineteenth-century economy ( until the arrival of Texas oilmen in the 1930s , Mecca was almost entirely dependent on visiting pilgrims ) . 
But the numbers of visitors began to rise sharply after the city fell under the control of the Saudi royal family in 1924 . 
Until then , the only way to reach Mecca was by pack animal . 
The Ottoman Empire raised funds from pious Muslims ( and brought in German technicians ) to lay a railway from Damascus to Medina . 
But the last leg of the journey - to Mecca itself - remained a monopoly of the camel-owning Bedouin . 
When the Saudi government introduced Fords to the area in around 1930 , it needed all of its military resources to prevent the Bedouin from destroying them . 
To be sure , the Saudi government faces massive demand from Muslims to be allowed to make the hajj , and it has introduced a quota system to limit their numbers . 
Even so , it maintains strenuous efforts to attract pilgrims - particularly wealthy ones - by building attractions , including vast shopping malls and a colossal copy of London &apos;s Big Ben that now looms incongruously over the Ka &apos;ba . 
And the authorities &quot; admission of more pilgrims than the city &apos;s infrastructure can safely handle is indisputable ; the proof is repeated disasters like the one in September . 
Indeed , since taking control of Mecca , the Saudi government has used the city and the hajj as centerpieces in its efforts to place the kingdom at the center of the Muslim world and spread Wahhabi Islam . 
As soon as the Saudi royal family seized the city , the new rulers destroyed the Shia and Sufi shrines that might have undermined their sought-after monopoly over the ritual aspects of the pilgrimage . 
And their approach seems to have worked . 
It is not uncommon for pilgrims from , say , India or Indonesia to adopt strict , conservative tenets after their return from Mecca . 
As influence is ultimately a matter of numbers , it should come as no surprise that the Saudis seek to maximize the inflows of Muslim pilgrims each year . 
Even when faced with calamitous death tolls , the Saudi establishment is unlikely to change its approach . 
It is up to the rest of the Muslim world to provide alternatives to the modern idea , championed by Saudi Wahhabis and other arch-conservatives , that Mecca is the inexorable and inevitable center of the Muslim world . 
There is nothing stopping Muslim governments from taking a page out of the Saudi handbook and promoting the neglected shrines in their own territories . 
Doing so would not only reduce the number of pilgrims traveling to Mecca , making the visits safer ; it would also force Saudi Arabia to share the enormous profits of religious tourism . 
Even more important , moving beyond the modern hajj to a more plural pattern of pilgrimage could help stem the Wahhabi takeover of the faith .
