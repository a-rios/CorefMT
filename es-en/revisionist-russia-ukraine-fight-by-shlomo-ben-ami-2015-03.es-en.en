Taking On Revisionist Russia 
MADRID - For some countries , military or political defeat is so intolerable , so humiliating , that they will do whatever it takes to overturn what they view as an unjust international order . 
One such revisionist power was Egypt , which resolved to undo its 1967 defeat by Israel and regain the Sinai Peninsula . 
This was ultimately achieved , but only after President Anwar Sadat embraced a strategy of peace by journeying to Jerusalem . 
The most ominous case , however , was Germany in the 1930s , which systematically shredded the European order that had emerged after World War I. 
History suggests that a revisionist power can be disciplined in two ways . 
It can be opposed with equal fervor , like that which enabled Europe &apos;s conservative powers to defeat Napoleon in 1815 and the Allies to defeat Germany in World War II . 
Or it can reach the limits of its military and economic strength , as in the case of the Soviet Union at the time of its disintegration . 
At that point , the country has a choice . 
Though Putin is undoubtedly the main actor driving this strategy , Ukraine &apos;s pursuit of closer ties with the European Union - a move that Europe and the United States generally welcomed - was bound to accelerate it . 
Putin knew that he could take advantage of Ukraine &apos;s ethno-religious division ( the eastern regions are overwhelmingly Russian Orthodox and loyal to the Kremlin ) to undermine these efforts . 
Europe , it seems , underestimated Russia &apos;s determination to uphold what it considers a core interest in Ukraine . 
The struggle for influence in Ukraine is a game that Putin cannot afford to lose . 
For the West , the principle of not redrawing borders by force is a vital political concern - indeed , it is a pillar of a civilized world order . 
But both the US and Europe have made it clear that Ukraine &apos;s sovereignty is not worth dying for , with the EU disinclined even to follow America &apos;s lead in imposing increasingly tough sanctions . 
Putin gained the upper hand early in the crisis with the annexation of Crimea . 
Now , in eastern Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region , he is shrewdly forcing a divided and risk-averse West to choose between war and accommodation . 
While neither option is particularly appealing , the dangers of a war with Russia cannot be overestimated . 
After all , in such a fight , both sides would possess large nuclear arsenals . 
That is why , as Sir Adrian Bradshaw , NATO &apos;s second in command , recently suggested , war can be contemplated only if Russia invades a NATO state - a step that Putin is unlikely to take , even as he ramps up his provocations , including cross-border kidnappings . 
And , even then , there would be reasons for hesitation . 
The Western powers &apos; aversion to war raises risks of its own . 
Russia &apos;s blatant disregard for the 1994 Budapest Memorandum - in which it , the US , and the United Kingdom promised that Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity would be respected if it surrendered its own nuclear weapons - is sending a dangerous message to nuclear states like Iran , North Korea , India , and Pakistan . 
Nonetheless , the West &apos;s views about a war over Ukraine are unlikely to change . 
And sanctions , despite having crippled Russia &apos;s economy , have proved inadequate , thus far , to breaking Putin &apos;s will . 
This leaves only accommodation - which means effectively granting legitimacy to the Kremlin &apos;s claim to authority over Ukraine and , presumably , the rest of its &quot; near abroad . &quot; 
In this scenario , Russia would avoid attempting to govern Ukraine directly but would insist that Ukraine refrain from joining hostile blocs and alliances . 
As then President-elect Dmitri Medvedev said in 2008 &quot; no country would be happy about a military bloc to which it did not belong approaching its borders . &quot; 
If the West acquiesces on this critical point , Putin will be eager to end the current war , which Russia &apos;s economy is losing badly . 
But the Kremlin-driven crisis would not be over . 
Indeed , Putin &apos;s revisionist agenda extends far beyond Ukraine to include the &quot; Finlandization &quot; of other nearby states , including EU members like Hungary and Romania . 
If Putin &apos;s dangerous brinkmanship is to be stopped , Western leaders will need to find a way to initiate strategic cooperation with Russia . 
Specifically , they must devise a grand bargain for peace that addresses the fundamental questions relating to global security norms and arms control that have so far impeded such cooperation . 
Of course , Russia is no longer a global superpower . 
Any realistic grand bargain would have to account for this . 
As for Ukraine , the way forward is difficult to discern - not least because of the conflicting experiences of buffer states in the past . 
Kaiser Wilhelm II invaded neutral Belgium to start WWI . 
Hitler swallowed Austria and Czechoslovakia when it suited him ; but Austria &apos;s neutrality after 1955 was enough to satisfy the Cold War &apos;s two blocs , and now it is part of the EU . 
Likewise , since 1967 , Jordan has served as an informal buffer state between Israel and the rest of the Arab world . 
Any future Palestinian state would have to assume a similar position , as Israel would never accept its accession to some hostile military alliance . 
The Franco-German plan for Ukraine calls for a demilitarized zone separating government and separatist forces , and granting what French President Fran√ßois Hollande defined as &quot; rather strong &quot; autonomy to the Russian-speaking eastern regions . 
In other words , it fulfills Russia &apos;s vision of a federated Ukraine , whereby the Russian-oriented east would have a say in foreign affairs and security matters . 
But such a plan cannot be counted on to curb Putin &apos;s broader revisionist ambitions . 
Only a united and determined West can do that .
