Investing in Happy Endings 
LONDON - Public and private investment in the real economy has been under attack since the 2008 financial crisis . 
In difficult economic times , it may seem logical to cut investments that yield results only in the long term , and thereby conserve money and resources to address short-term problems . 
In fact , cutting investment in our future - be it in people , the planet , political institutions , or business - is deeply irrational . 
It is only through investment in visionary ideas , blue-skies thinking , research and development , and innovation that we can ensure that the future will be better - freer , more peaceful , and more prosperous - than the past . 
Early-childhood education , preventive medicine , libraries , physical infrastructure , and basic scientific research , for example , all cost money - and studies show that they are worthwhile . 
But when policymakers need to cut spending , investment in these public goods is often the first thing to go , because voters do not feel the effects in the short term . 
Most of the pain is deferred , which is precisely why such cuts are politically attractive . 
But this is low-hanging fruit that societies cannot afford to pick . 
We must start investing in people at the earliest possible moment - right from birth . 
Universal access to high-quality nutrition and preventive health care , as well as early-childhood learning programs , are necessary to provide strong foundations upon which countries around the world can ensure their future social advancement and economic growth . 
Likewise , for children and adults alike , there is real value in , say , public libraries - secular and free gathering spaces that offer universal access to learning and , increasingly , provide a gateway to digital services . 
The same is true of cultural programs and institutions that stimulate growth in the arts and sciences ; they , too , are necessary to ensure that citizens can contribute productively to their societies and economies . 
The temptation to cut long-term investment in economic hard times stalks the private sphere as well . 
And companies around the world , big and small , have been succumbing to it since the beginning of the global economic downturn . 
As companies are forced to look to their bottom line and become leaner , they cut investment in research and development , employee development and training , infrastructure , and more . 
Making matters worse , these budget lines are the last to be restored when economic prospects brighten . 
For example , in the face of investor pressure , pharmaceutical companies have cut their research activities dramatically , relying instead on acquisition strategies . 
The aim is to &quot; de-risk &quot; by buying up firms that have already carried out all of the costly blue skies research and have developed proven drugs . 
Obviously , such strategies will not work in the long term if no one is willing to invest in the earliest stages of research in critical areas like biotechnology , digital technology , renewable energy sources , and the like . 
With early-stage investors scarce , governments turning away from blue-sky science , and funders of university-based research increasingly demanding that grantees &quot; show the &quot; impact &quot; of their work , who will fund risk-taking ? 
If no one does , the well will run dry , and there will be nothing to acquire . 
Likewise , instead of investing in new infrastructure , companies patch up the old . 
But patching broken things can work for only so long . 
By not committing resources to invest in new , cost-efficient , environmentally-friendly operations , or in developing the skills and knowledge of employees , or in innovation , companies will find that their short-term savings come at the expense of their long-term success . 
The choices that companies are making not only affect their own operations , but also have profound consequences for their customers , suppliers , and the societies in which they are embedded . 
Failure to invest in the future will affect that future for everyone . 
Not everything that is worthwhile has an immediate positive effect on financial bottom lines , or can be put neatly in a box . 
If public and private investment decisions are driven only by the easily measured and easily defined , we will miss out on the breakthrough moments that characterize so much of human achievement and advancement . 
In both the public and private sectors , we need to commit ourselves to long-term investment , whether in children and education , science and technology , and health and medicine , or in building strong institutions that can serve as the sustainable foundations of peaceful , democratic , and prosperous societies . 
An investment in our future is never wasted . 
Investing in beginnings is the only way we will live to see happy endings .
