Turkey Plays the European Card 
Elected with a parliamentary majority almost big enough to change the country &apos;s constitution , Turkey &apos;s new Islamist government faces daunting challenges . 
The most urgent is the looming war between America and Iraq . 
Will Turkey maintain its vital diplomatic and logistical support for its American ally ? 
Or will religious solidarities reshape Turkey &apos;s orientation , as the new government joins other Muslim countries in opposing any invasion of Iraq ? 
Obviously , Turkey &apos;s Islamists are not the only ones with serious doubts about the war . 
Many Turks share the view that the war could have harsh consequences for their country , both in the short and long run . 
The struggling economy does not need the disruption of even a rapidly resolved military conflict . 
The Turkish establishment ( the military as well as the diplomatic corps ) worries about the possibility that a war will fracture Iraq , leading to an independent Kurdish state on Turkey &apos;s southern border that would inevitably serve to strengthen Kurdish nationalism within Turkey , raising new threats to Turkey &apos;s unity and stability . 
Turkey &apos;s secular bureaucratic establishment has traditionally been pro-West but with a strong dose of nationalism . 
Aside from the Kurdish issue , their attention is now focused on Cyprus as well . 
The Cyprus problem has reached a critical turning point , following a peace proposal put on the table by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan with a deadline impending at the end of February . 
Meanwhile , the Greek Cypriots have been given their entry invitation to the EU , despite the fact that there is still no agreement on the Cyprus problem . 
Cyprus now becomes a key issue athwart the road of Turkey eventually joining the EU . 
Unresolved , it will provide a sure means of preventing Turkey &apos;s membership by those who are against it . 
This constitutes another potential trap for the new government . 
Despite the importance of Cyprus , it is the possible war with Iraq that poses the most severe test of the delicate balance that now exists between Turkey &apos;s conservative old guard and the more liberal reformers within the ruling Justice and Development Party . 
Could it lead to a new power struggle in the party ? 
The fact that the party leader Mr.Erdogan was prevented through technicalities from becoming a deputy in the Parliament and thus Prime Minister makes the maintenance of this balance even more tricky . 
Any open rupture will weaken the hands of the reformers who want to have close ties with the West and the US . 
Though the Justice and Development Party has held power only briefly , it has already given clear indications of its choice . 
Well aware of western doubts about the party , Erdogan travelled immediately after the elections to western capitals , pressing his argument that the change in government had not changed Turkey &apos;s fundamental orientation . 
He is well aware of the contrast with the approach taken by Turkey &apos;s previous Islamist-led government . 
Elected in 1996 , after a campaign marked by strong claims of religious revival , the Welfare Party &apos;s Necmettin Erbakan made a conspicuous point of making his first official visits to Iran , Libya , Indonesia and Malaysia . 
Erdogan stressed this pro-Western orientation again but a few weeks later , at the EU enlargement summit held in Copenhagen in mid-December . 
The new government &apos;s aggressive lobbying before the summit was perceived both at home and abroad as a clear sign of its commitment to the EU cause . 
Rejecting Erbakan &apos;s earlier accusation that the EU was a &quot; Christian Club , &quot; Erdogan has campaigned openly for full membership . 
In this , he received enthusiastic support from the Bush administration , which hopes that Erdogan might have found a way to mix democracy and Islam . 
So far , Erdogan has played the European card skillfully , reassuring Turkey &apos;s western allies and boxing in the Turkish military , which remains skeptical of his party &apos;s intentions . 
By accepting European demands for democratic reform as a pre-condition for EU membership , Erdogan played a liberalizing role , reinforcing his claim that his party represents a genuinely democratic option for a Muslim-majority country B indeed , that it is an Islamic version of the Christian Democratic parties that have long dominated Europe &apos;s political right . 
There is no doubt that the political and economic program of Erdogan and his party is a dramatic departure from traditional Turkish Islamism . 
Islamist movements have generally been characterized by strong anti-market and anti-western attitudes . 
Yet Prime Minister Gul routinely calls his government &quot; business friendly . &quot; 
The coming months will be crucial . 
To convince skeptics , the party will have to break with conventional Turkish policies on Cyprus , and with conventional Islamist doubts about Europe . 
To top it off , Turkey must reach some agreement with its closest ally , the US , if it moves against Iraq . 
Erdogan &apos;s insistent opening to Europe may be the key to how this all turns out . 
By pressing for membership in the EU , he is reinforcing Turkey &apos;s long-held western orientation . 
This may give him room to distance himself somewhat from American policy . 
After all , in becoming more European , isn &apos;t Turkey entitled to share Europe &apos;s doubts about a war with Iraq ?
