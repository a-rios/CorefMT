King Ludd is Still Dead 
CAMBRIDGE - Since the dawn of the industrial age , a recurrent fear has been that technological change will spawn mass unemployment . 
Neoclassical economists predicted that this would not happen , because people would find other jobs , albeit possibly after a long period of painful adjustment . 
By and large , that prediction has proven to be correct . 
Two hundred years of breathtaking innovation since the dawn of the industrial age have produced rising living standards for ordinary people in much of the world , with no sharply rising trend for unemployment . 
Yes , there have been many problems , notably bouts of staggering inequality and increasingly horrific wars . 
On balance , however , throughout much of the world , people live longer , work much fewer hours , and lead generally healthier lives . 
But there is no denying that technological change nowadays has accelerated , potentially leading to deeper and more profound dislocations . 
In a much-cited 1983 article , the great economist Wassily Leontief worried that the pace of modern technological change is so rapid that many workers , unable to adjust , will simply become obsolete , like horses after the rise of the automobile . 
Are millions of workers headed for the glue factory ? 
As Asian wages rise , factory managers are already looking for opportunities to replace employees with robots , even in China . 
As the advent of cheap smartphones fuels a boom in Internet access , online purchases will eliminate a vast number of retail jobs . 
Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that , worldwide , technological change could easily lead to the loss of 5-10 million jobs each year . 
Fortunately , until now , market economies have proved stunningly flexible in absorbing the impact of these changes . 
A peculiar but perhaps instructive example comes from the world of professional chess . 
Back in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , many feared that players would become obsolete if and when computers could play chess better than humans . 
Finally , in 1997 , the IBM computer Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a short match . 
Soon , potential chess sponsors began to balk at paying millions of dollars to host championship matches between humans . 
Isn &apos;t the computer world champion , they asked ? 
Today , the top few players still earn a very good living , but less than at the peak . 
Meanwhile , in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms , second-tier players earn much less money from tournaments and exhibitions than they did in the 1970 &quot; s . 
Nevertheless , a curious thing has happened : far more people make a living as professional chess players today than ever before . 
Thanks partly to the availability of computer programs and online matches , there has been a mini-boom in chess interest among young people in many countries . 
Many parents see chess as an attractive alternative to mindless video games . 
A few countries , such as Armenia and Moldova , have actually legislated the teaching of chess in schools . 
As a result , thousands of players nowadays earn surprisingly good incomes teaching chess to children , whereas in the days before Deep Blue , only a few hundred players could truly make a living as professionals . 
In many US cities , for example , good chess teachers earn upwards of $ 100- $ 150 per hour . 
Yesterday &apos;s unemployed chess bum can bring in a six-figure income if he or she is willing to take on enough work . 
In fact , this is one example where technology might actually have contributed to equalizing incomes . 
Second-tier chess players who are good teachers often earn as much as top tournament players - or more . 
Of course , the factors governing the market for chess incomes are complex , and I have vastly over-simplified the situation . 
But the basic point is that the market has a way of transforming jobs and opportunities in ways that no one can predict . 
Technological change is not all upside , and transitions can be painful . 
An unemployed autoworker in Detroit may be fully capable of retraining to become a hospital technician . 
Yet , after years of taking pride in his work , he could be very reluctant to make the switch . 
I know a chess grandmaster who , 20 years ago , prided himself on his success at winning money in tournaments . 
He vowed that he would never end up teaching children &quot; how horsey moves &quot; ( the reference is to the knight , also called the horse ) . 
But now he does exactly that , earning more from teaching &quot; how horsey moves &quot; than he ever did as a competitive chess player . 
Still , it beats being sent to the knacker . 
Of course , this time technological change could be different , and one should be careful in extrapolating the experience of the last two centuries to the next two . 
For one thing , mankind will be confronted with more complex economic and moral questions as technology accelerates . 
Still , even as technological change accelerates , nothing suggests a massive upward shift in unemployment over the next few decades . 
Of course , some increase in unemployment as a result of more rapid technological change is certainly likely , especially in places like Europe , where a plethora of rigidities inhibit smooth adjustment . 
For now , however , the high unemployment of the past several years should be mainly attributed to the financial crisis , and should ultimately retreat toward historical benchmark levels . 
Humans are not horsies .
