The Fed &apos;s Dollar Distraction 
CAMBRIDGE - In its September policy statement , the US Federal Reserve took into consideration - in a major way - the impact of global economic developments on the United States , and thus on US monetary policy . 
Indeed , the Fed decided to delay raising interest rates partly because US policymakers expect dollar appreciation , by lowering import prices , to undermine their ability to meet their 2 % inflation target . 
In reality , while currency movements can have a significant impact on inflation in other countries , dollar movements have rarely had a meaningful or durable impact on prices in the US . 
The difference , of course , lies in the US dollar &apos;s dominant role in the invoicing of international trade : prices are set in dollars . 
Just as the dollar is often the unit of account in debt contracts , even when neither the borrower nor the lender is a US entity , the dollar &apos;s share in invoicing for international trade is around 4.5 times America &apos;s share of world imports , and three times its share of world exports . 
The prices of some 93 % of US imports are set in dollars . 
In this environment , the pass-through of dollar movements into non-fuel US import prices is one of the lowest in the world , in both the short term ( one quarter out ) and the longer term ( two years out ) , for three key reasons . 
First , international trade contracts are renegotiated infrequently , which means that dollar prices are &quot; sticky &quot; for an extended period - around ten months - despite fluctuations in the exchange rate . 
Second , because most exporters also import intermediate inputs that are priced in dollars , exchange-rate fluctuations have a limited impact on their costs and thus on their incentive to change dollar prices . 
And , third , exporters who wish to preserve their share in world markets - where prices are largely denominated in dollars - choose to keep their dollar prices stable , to avoid falling victim to idiosyncratic exchange-rate movements . 
What little impact import price shocks have on US inflation is highly transitory , with most of the effect tapering off after just two quarters . 
A sharp 10 % appreciation of the US dollar , for example , would reduce inflation for non-fuel imports by 4.4 % cumulatively over the next 2-3 quarters , but would have only a negligible impact on inflation after that point . 
If one accounts for consumer goods expenditure on imports , that 10 % appreciation would lower inflation , as measured by the consumer price index ( CPI ) , by just 0.5 percentage points in the first two quarters . 
And that is likely to be an upper bound , because it assumes that US retailers will pass through to consumers the full amount of any increase in import prices . 
In practice , they are more likely to increase retail markups and lower cost pass-through . 
The estimated price pass-through for imported manufactured goods , which would better represent what enters the consumption bundle , is even lower than that for all non-fuel imports . 
Although these factors insulate the US from the inflationary pressures stemming from exchange-rate fluctuations , they increase the vulnerability of other countries , especially emerging economies . 
Because the dollar prices of most of these countries &quot; imports are not very responsive to exchange-rate movements , the pass-through of those movements into import prices denominated in their home currencies is close to 100 % . 
The impact of exchange-rate movements on inflation in most countries is thus 3-4 times larger than in the US . 
A 10 % depreciation of the Turkish lira , for example , would raise cumulative CPI inflation by 1.65-2.03 percentage points , over two years , all else being equal . 
Despite this imbalance , the US dollar &apos;s dominance as an invoicing currency is unlikely to change anytime soon - not least because bringing about a shift would require coordination among a huge number of exporters and importers worldwide . 
The euro might seem like a strong contender , given the volume of trade among eurozone countries ; but , outside Europe , the currency is not used nearly as widely as the dollar . 
In deciding when to normalize interest rates , the Fed has placed considerable weight on the weakness of inflation , and its global underpinnings . 
But while it is true that some global developments - especially falling commodity prices , and perhaps also slowing emerging-economy growth and rising financial volatility - may push down inflation , dollar appreciation will not , at least not in any meaningful way . 
A stronger dollar thus is not a legitimate reason to delay the normalization of US interest rates .
