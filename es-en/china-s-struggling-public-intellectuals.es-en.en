China &apos;s Struggling Public Intellectuals 
Is China &apos;s political environment loosening up , or is the government cracking down ? 
It &apos;s hard to tell . 
President and Communist Party General Secretary Hu Jintao sometimes seems to be going both ways simultaneously . 
For example , Hu has decided to honor the memory of his mentor , former General Secretary Hu Yaobang , in order to burnish his aura as a reformist . 
But , in many ways , Hu Jintao &apos;s tenure as the head of the fourth generation of Communist leaders , which began when he became party secretary in 2002 , differs sharply from that of his mentor . 
Hu Yaobang was a founder of the China Youth League , regarded as a relatively liberal institution in the People &apos;s Republic , who in the 1980 &quot; s promoted political reforms and rehabilitated virtually all the victims of the Mao Zedong &apos;s purges . 
By contrast , the younger Hu has narrowed the public space for political discourse that had opened up during the latter years of his predecessor , Jiang Zemin , when market pressure was forcing media outlets to be more daring and wide-ranging . 
Since taking over , Hu Jintao has arrested a number of outspoken journalists in an effort to rein in the media . 
His government has also detained an array of public intellectuals who have been critical of its policies , including cyber-dissidents Liu Di and Shi Tao ( who was arrested thanks to Yahoo &apos;s collaboration with the police in identifying him ) and freelance writers Yu Jie and Liu Xiaobo . 
Military doctor Jiang Yanyong was detained in 2003 after he publicly rebutted the Party &apos;s assertion that the SARS epidemic had been brought under control . 
In 2004 , he was placed under surveillance when he called on the Party to revise its judgment of the 1989 Tiananmen demonstration . 
Hu &apos;s tightening of controls over political discourse and the media intensified with the publication in September 2004 of a list of &quot; Top Fifty Public Intellectuals &quot; in Southern Weekly . 
The list , dominated by intellectuals who in the 1990 &quot; s had called for freedom of speech and political participation , appeared with the statement : &quot; This is the time when China is facing the most problems in its unprecedented transformation , and when it most needs public intellectuals to be on the scene and to speak out . &quot; 
On November 23 , 2004 , an article in the Shanghai Party Committee &apos;s orthodox Liberation Daily disagreed . 
It attacked the concept of &quot; public intellectuals , &quot; claiming that their &quot; independence drives a wedge &quot; between intellectuals and the Party and between intellectuals and the masses . 
Hu &apos;s leadership has tried to draw public attention to the growing gap between rich and poor . 
But its reaction to the book A Survey of Chinese Peasants , which is based on interviews over several years with farmers in the poor province of Anhui , was a telling reminder that public intellectuals are not welcome to contribute to that effort . 
The authors , the husband-and-wife team of Chen Guidi and Wu Chuntao , who spent their early years in the countryside , described in detail the imposition of unfair taxes by local officials and the authorities &quot; rapacious seizure of land farmed by rural residents . 
The increasingly impoverished lives of peasants that the book vividly documented resulted from the very abuses of power that Hu Jintao had declared himself to be against . 
Yet , in February 2004 , one month after its publication , A Survey of Chinese Peasants was banned . 
Hu &apos;s government has also tightened controls over the media . 
Reports on peasant and worker demonstrations against corrupt officials and illegal property confiscations have been banned . 
Those who dare to protest , such as Beijing University journalism professor Jiao Guobiao , are silenced . 
Similarly , Wang Yi , a law lecturer at Chengdu University who called for freedom of speech and association , was barred from teaching . 
The liberal journal Strategy and Management was closed down . 
Even the editor-in-chief of China Youth Daily , the newspaper affiliated with Hu Jintao &apos;s own China Youth League power base , which had been aggressive in exposing official corruption , was recently detained . 
Hu Jintao &apos;s rule is not a return to the Mao Zedong era . 
Despite the regime &apos;s vast means of censorship , its embrace of new communications technologies like the Internet make it increasingly difficult for the party to maintain effective control over people &apos;s views . 
Moreover , persecution of political dissenters does not now reach far beyond the accused to involve their associates . 
While scores have lost their positions and others have been imprisoned , most are briefly detained and then allowed to find other jobs in China &apos;s burgeoning civil society . 
By comparison with the late 1990 &quot; s , however , the space for political discourse has undeniably narrowed , crushing expectations that the country would continue on a liberalizing course . 
Hu Jintao may have made a genuflection to his more liberal mentor , but in the two decades since the elder Hu &apos;s fall from power , even as private space has expanded , China has become a politically far less open society .
