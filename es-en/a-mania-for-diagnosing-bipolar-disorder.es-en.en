A Mania for Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder 
PROVIDENCE , RI - During the past few years , many experts have suggested that bipolar disorder - a serious illness resulting in significant psychosocial morbidity and excess mortality - is under-recognized , particularly in patients with major depression . 
Even patients who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after initially seeking treatment for the correct diagnosis to be made . 
The clinical implications of the failure to recognize bipolar disorder in depressed patients include the under-prescription of mood-stabilizing medications , and an increased risk of rapid &quot; cycling &quot; - swings between manic and depressive phases . 
But , perhaps as a consequence of concerted efforts to improve the recognition of bipolar disorder , during the past few years we have observed the emergence of an opposite phenomenon - over-diagnosis . 
In my own practice , my colleagues and I have encountered patients who reported that they were previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder , despite lacking a history of manic or hypomanic episodes . 
To be sure , we have also seen patients seeking treatment for depression who really did have bipolar disorder . 
However , there seemed to be more over-diagnosis than under-diagnosis . 
We therefore conducted a study to examine empirically how often bipolar disorder might be over- and under-diagnosed . 
Seven hundred psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV ( SCID ) and completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked whether they had been previously diagnosed by a health-care professional with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder . 
Family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate relatives . 
Slightly more than 20 % ( 145 patients ) in our sample reported that they had been previously diagnosed as having bipolar disorder , significantly higher than the 12.9 % rate based on the SCID . 
Less than half of those who reported that they had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on the SCID . 
Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their immediate family members than patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID . 
Patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID did not have a significantly higher risk for bipolar disorder than the patients who were negative for bipolar disorder by self-report and the SCID . 
Our findings , validated by family history , thus suggest that bipolar disorder was over-diagnosed . 
Any study seeking to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it upon re-interview . 
Such is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis . 
The question , then , is not whether 
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder has costs . 
Mood stabilizers are the treatment of choice , and , depending on the medication , they can produce potentially significant health complications affecting renal , endocrine , hepatic , immunologic , or metabolic function . Thus , over-diagnosing bipolar disorder can unnecessarily expose patients to serious side-effects of medication . 
Direct-to-consumer advertisements that refer individuals to screening questionnaires can result in patients suggesting to their doctors that they have bipolar disorder . 
We have seen evidence of this in our practice . 
This does not necessarily reflect a problem with the performance of a screening questionnaire , but rather how these scales are used . 
Screening questionnaires maximize sensitivity , at a cost of false positives , because it is presumed that they are followed by expert clinical evaluation . 
Clinicians are inclined to diagnose disorders that they feel more comfortable treating . 
We believe that the increased availability of medications that have been approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder might be influencing clinicians who are unsure whether or not a patient has bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder to err on the side of diagnosing the disorder that is responsive to medication . 
This bias is reinforced by the marketing message of pharmaceutical companies to physicians , which has emphasized research on delayed diagnosis and under-recognition of bipolar disorder , possibly sensitizing clinicians accordingly . 
The campaign against under-recognition has probably resulted in some anxious , agitated , and / or irritable depressed patients who complain of insomnia and &quot; racing thoughts &quot; being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder . 
The results of our study are consistent with prior studies suggesting possible problems with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder . 
With the greater number of medications approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder , along with multiple reports cautioning clinicians against under-diagnosis , it appears that over-diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-diagnosis . 
Both can have negative consequences .
