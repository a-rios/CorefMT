Saving a World that Doesn \ u0027t Save 
Around the world , social security and health care are today &apos;s hottest economic issues due to the rising dependency ratio : the proportion of elderly people relative to younger , economically active , workers . 
According to the Population Resource Center , this ratio will double in the world &apos;s more developed regions and triple in less developed regions by 2050 . 
With so many more old people in coming decades , governments will be hard pressed to raise enough money to pay for their needs by taxing the young . 
None of this is news . 
But that is the point : despite the vast attention currently paid to the looming old-age crisis , household saving rates have been falling in most of the world &apos;s rich countries . 
Why aren &apos;t people saving more for their future retirement ? 
Why are they actually doing the opposite by saving less ? 
According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , household saving rates declined between 1984 and 2001 in Australia , Austria , Belgium , Canada , Finland , Italy , Japan , Korea , New Zealand , Portugal , Spain , the United Kingdom , and the United States . 
In some countries , the decline has been dramatic : in the US during this period , the annual household saving rate - expressed as the share of disposable income - fell from 10.6 % to 1.6 % . 
One might think that , with declining birthrates in rich countries in recent decades , it should be easy to save more . 
Fewer children mean fewer expenses , and adults can work longer to earn extra income beyond their immediate needs . 
So why have so many different countries experienced a decline in savings ? 
The answer must be that people do not decide whether to increase their savings on the basis of careful calculations about their future needs . 
The decision to stop spending and save stems from more immediate concerns , and we have to look at the economic factors - common to many countries of the world - that play on those concerns . 
A study in 2000 of saving rates in 150 countries , headed by Norman Loayza at the World Bank , found that some basic economic factors explained much of the variation in national saving rates , without any reference to cultural differences . 
Surprisingly , the study found that saving rates tend to be high when inflation is high , and to decline when inflation declines . 
Since inflation has been declining in most countries of the world over the last 20 years or so , this could help explain the global decline in saving rates . 
Loayza and his colleagues thought that inflation encourages saving because it creates an atmosphere of uncertainty . 
When people see high inflation , they conclude that the economy is precarious , so perhaps they should tighten their belts . 
Thus , inflation serves as a visceral reminder to save , while old age seems too far away for most people to think about . 
There is another reason why the high inflation of the past encouraged saving : the high interest rates that tend to accompany rapid price growth . 
Borrowers may be forced to &quot; save &quot; more by paying higher mortgage rates . 
Consider the US in 1980 , when the personal saving rate was 11 % . 
The inflation rate was 12 % and 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages were over 15 % . 
The real interest rate was not really high - just 3 % - but one still had to pay that 15 % interest out of current income . 
Imagine buying a house valued at three years &apos; income and paying 45 % of your income just to make mortgage payments . 
In America in 1980 , this effectively forced some households to reduce their consumption expenditures drastically , contributing to the high saving rate of the time . 
When inflation fell , people eventually refinanced their mortgages at lower rates , breathed a sigh of relief , and started spending more . 
That example also underscores the strong improvement seen in mortgage institutions around the world during the past 20 years - another force tending to reduce saving . 
The easier it is to get a home mortgage , and the lower the down payment that lenders demand , the less young people need to save to buy their first house . 
The increase in credit cards and consumer credit has had the same general effect . 
Finally , declining saving rates around the world reflect strong growth in asset markets - namely , stocks and real estate - over the last twenty years . 
The explanation for this growth is subject to dispute , but it seems to reflect an optimistic attitude towards the future , as we enter a modern world in which technological advances are supposed to make corporations extremely valuable and our economies perform well . 
We value our assets more because we imagine that they will be in great demand in the future . 
Rising asset prices follow from this psychology . 
For most people , the troubles caused by the old-age crisis seem remote , while booming share or housing prices look concrete in brokerage statements or on the business pages of newspapers . 
People feel richer and save less . 
The problem is that these increases in value create the impression that our lack of saving for the last decade has had no serious consequences . 
We think we &apos;re still getting richer even though we save less . 
But since speculative prices are ultimately determined by psychology , they can also suddenly be deflated by psychology . 
Unless we come to terms with the lethal combination of declining saving rates and falling birthrates , many more people may retire poor than we ever imagined .
