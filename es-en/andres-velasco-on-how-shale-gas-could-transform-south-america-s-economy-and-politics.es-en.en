Dead Cow Walking ? 
SANTIAGO - Simón Bolívar , the South American independence hero who hoped to weave the continent into a single nation , would shudder at the disintegration that prevails today in the continent &apos;s energy sector . 
Surely he would understand that no community can be built on so fragmented a foundation . 
Peru has gas , which it sells to Mexico . 
Bolivia also has gas , but it has been under-exploiting it ever since it nationalized the industry in 2006 . 
Argentina used to have a gas industry , but it was decimated by years of misguided government policies . 
Brazil discovered hydrocarbons deep in the Atlantic Ocean a few years ago and has begun auctioning off rights , but actual production is still years away . 
Chile has no oil or gas , and no one in the neighborhood will sell it any , so it has to buy its supplies from as far away as Indonesia . 
Moreover , South America &apos;s electricity grids are seldom interconnected , and rates for power vary widely . 
Brazil and Chile have the region &apos;s highest electricity prices ( which are also among the highest in the world ) . 
Optimists imagine a scenario in which production is rationalized , pipelines are built , grids are interconnected , and gas from Bolivia , Argentina , or elsewhere fuels growth throughout the continent , benefiting everyone in the process . 
But such dreams always hit a formidable obstacle : national rivalries that date back decades - in some cases centuries - and that repeatedly keep mutually profitable energy-integration agreements from being signed . 
Or , if they are signed , they are often broken when compelling short-term considerations intervene . 
For example , a decade ago , contracts promising a steady supply of Argentine gas at pre-set prices led Chile to spend billions refitting its power stations . 
But , after a long period of price controls and massive underinvestment , domestic demand in Argentina was far outpacing supply . 
So then-President Néstor Kirchner &apos;s government tore up the contracts and cut off exports to Chile , stunting its economic growth and leaving painful memories among its citizens . 
But now a new and powerful factor could change this dismal political equation : shale gas , which is already having an important effect on the United States and its economy . 
With US natural-gas prices down to just over $ 4 per million BTU ( from $ 13 just a few years ago ) , even prudent analysts expect the shale-energy revolution to increase America &apos;s potential economic growth and add as many as two million new jobs . 
The impact of shale energy on South America is twofold . 
For starters , there is the potential for cheaper imports for those countries with no gas ( Chile ) or where local demand could exceed local supply ( Brazil ) . 
For a country like Chile , where large hydroelectric projects have been politically controversial , and where solar and wind power have been too slow in coming , gas imports from the US would be a tremendous boon . 
In 2013 , the US Department of Energy authorized the first substantial gas-export facilities ; while the trickle is not yet a steady flow , the gap between US and much-higher world prices implies tremendous potential benefits . 
Then there is the shale gas to be exploited closer to home . 
Argentina reportedly has the world &apos;s third-largest shale-gas reserves , after the US and China . 
The huge Vaca Muerta ( Dead Cow ) field , owned by the energy company YPF , is just now beginning to be explored . 
Argentina &apos;s government expropriated YPF from Spain &apos;s Repsol in 2012 , with the resulting suits and countersuits delaying any potential investment in shale . 
But , with Argentina and Repsol recently reaching a settlement , interest has revived . 
Surely , the technical challenges of exploiting such shale-gas reserves are huge , and only a handful of firms in the world have the necessary knowhow . 
The financial challenges are even greater : analysts speak of tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in required investment . 
But the potential for Argentina and the region is tremendous . 
Federico Sturzenegger , an Argentine economist and President of Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires , has estimated the value of Vaca Muerta gas ( at the prices Argentina currently pays for gas imports ) to be equal to nine times the country &apos;s GDP . 
But , because world prices are likely to drop fast as the US steps up exports , Argentina has to act quickly in order to capture these potential gains . 
Sturzenegger has called the decision about shale gas &quot; the most important &quot; in Argentina &apos;s economic history . 
Argentina &apos;s choices could matter not just for the region &apos;s economy , but also for its politics . 
Because Vaca Muerta holds much more gas than Argentina could ever burn , exports are the inescapable way forward , and neighboring Brazil and Chile are among the natural customers . 
The shift in the regional balance of gas-based power could in turn cause nationalists in Bolivia , Peru , and elsewhere to rethink their policies . 
Integration in the oil , gas , and other energy industries , along with the interconnection of national power grids , could follow . 
South America &apos;s economic and political landscape would be changed forever . 
Is this too optimistic ? 
Perhaps . 
The political and legal safeguards needed to make energy flows safe and reliable would have to be built . 
Time and again , nationalism and shortsighted politics have trumped reason . 
But the stakes are so high , and the potential so great , that the least one must do is hope .
