China &apos;s Visionary Stimulus 
SHANGHAI - In March of last year , the first session of China &apos;s 12th National People &apos;s Congress began with then-Premier Wen Jiabao delivering his tenth and final &quot; report on the work of the government . &quot; 
When he had finished , the 3,000 representatives in attendance gave him a resounding ovation that was surely a response to more than the report ; it was a display of praise and respect for his achievements as the head of China &apos;s government . 
Since then , however , assessments of Wen &apos;s leadership - particularly his stewardship of the economy - have varied widely . 
Whereas Wen &apos;s supporters remain adamant that he fundamentally supported a shift toward democracy and a market economy for China , his critics lambast him for failing to fulfill his promises of political and economic reform . 
As Wen &apos;s successor , Li Keqiang , attempts to engineer deep systemic reforms , understanding Wen &apos;s policy decisions could not be more relevant . 
Wen &apos;s most contentious economic policy was the CN ¥ 4 trillion ( $ 586 billion ) stimulus package that his government launched in response to the 2008 financial crisis . 
Though the policy succeeded in buttressing China &apos;s economic growth , it was widely criticized as an overreaction - one that led to excessive monetary expansion . 
Indeed , the surge in bank loans caused China &apos;s M2 ( a broad measure of the money supply ) to soar , from 150 % of GDP in 2008 to some 200 % , or more than CN ¥ 100 trillion , today . 
The massive injection of liquidity into China &apos;s economy has contributed to rising debt , especially among local governments and firms , while fueling massive real-estate bubbles , and resulting in significant excess capacity . 
Over the last 18 months , Li &apos;s government has been attempting to address these challenges , by overhauling China &apos;s industrial structure , reducing excess production capacity , restricting lending , containing the shadow banking sector , and curbing real-estate investment . 
And he has had some success - at the expense of economic growth . 
Though the current rate of 7 % is comfortable , it is far lower than the double-digit rates that prevailed prior to 2008 . 
Given the need for further economic restructuring - and in view of long-term demographic trends , which will reduce the labor supply - pre-2008 growth rates are unlikely to be restored . 
This is fine with Li , who recognizes that structural transformation and industrial upgrading - not an unsustainable credit-led growth model - is the key to achieving high-income status . 
But there is more to assessing Wen &apos;s stimulus than the growth / reform trade-off . 
The policy also helped to expand China &apos;s foreign trade and boost its external financial strength ( with a robust balance-of-payments position , large international reserves , and a stable currency ) , thereby creating space for Li to carry out his ambitious reform agenda . 
At the same time , the global financial crisis triggered a shift in the relative price of assets worldwide . 
As developed countries were plunged into debt crises , with shrinking asset values and declining exchange rates , China &apos;s international purchasing power grew . 
This , together with Wen &apos;s stimulus , bolstered China &apos;s investment and financing capabilities considerably . 
Countries like New Zealand and Peru , unable to depend on developed countries for export demand , signed bilateral free-trade agreements with China . 
Likewise , when developed countries cut back on their foreign investment , China stepped in to inject much-needed capital into the global economy . 
In fact , many countries began to pursue improved bilateral relations with China , in order to gain access to its capital . 
For example , in 2009 , Jamaica was faced with a plummeting currency , surging unemployment , and considerable banking-sector risks stemming from exposure to government debt . 
When its traditional allies , the United States and the United Kingdom , rejected its pleas for help , it turned to China , which provided $ 138 million in loans to prop up the economy . 
By next year , China &apos;s outward investment is likely to reach over $ 100 billion annually - bringing it close to parity with inflows . 
It will not be long before China undergoes an historic shift from net merchandise exporter to net capital exporter . 
And China &apos;s external financing activities do not end there . 
In 2009-2010 , China also invested heavily in the International Monetary Fund , with the People &apos;s Bank of China announcing in 2009 that it would buy up to 32 billion special drawing rights ( the IMF &apos;s quasi-currency ) - the equivalent of about $ 50 billion . 
Over the same period , China signed multiple bilateral currency-swap agreements , offered policy loans and special assistance , and contributed to regional investment funds . 
In the coming years , China &apos;s engagement with the developing world will continue to deepen . 
The National People &apos;s Congress has discussed using a portion of China &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves to finance infrastructure projects in developing countries . 
Such a Chinese &quot; Marshall Plan &quot; could seek to strengthen developing countries &quot; capacity to absorb Chinese goods , or it could advance a broader development agenda . 
Some central-bank officials have even advocated the establishment of a supra-sovereign wealth fund for developing-country investment . 
China &apos;s continued development demands that it continues to enlarge its capacity and influence in foreign assistance . 
The global economic crisis accelerated the timetable for this process considerably , forcing China &apos;s leaders to pursue it simultaneously with the economy &apos;s structural transformation . 
In this respect , Wen gave Li an invaluable head start .
