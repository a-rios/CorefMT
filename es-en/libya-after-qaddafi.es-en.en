Libya After Qaddafi 
BENGHAZI - Middle Eastern autocrats routinely warn their people of rivers of blood , Western occupation , poverty , chaos , and Al Qaeda if their regimes are toppled . 
Those threats were heard in Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and - rendered in black-comedy style - in Libya . 
But there is a strong belief across the region that the costs of removing autocracies , as high as they might be , are low compared to the damage inflicted by the current rulers . 
In short , freedom is worth the price . 
In Libya , four scenarios may negatively affect prospects for democratization : civil / tribal war , military rule , becoming &quot; stuck in transition , &quot; and partition . 
Given the high price Libyans have paid , those scenarios should be prevented rather than cured . 
The civil / tribal war scenario is the worst risk . 
Egypt &apos;s revolutionaries understood this . 
When sectarian violence erupted there following the removal of Hosni Mubarak , the revolutionary coalitions adopted the slogan , &quot; You won &apos;t gloat over this , Mubarak . &quot; 
Repressive dictatorships cannot win free and fair elections . 
But they can use extreme violence to consolidate their control over the state , its people , and its institutions . 
So , to win , Libya &apos;s Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi has deliberately and successfully turned a civil-resistance campaign into an armed conflict . 
That will have ramifications in the post-authoritarian context . 
A study published by Columbia University on civil resistance has shown that the probability of a country relapsing into civil war following a successful anti-dictatorship armed campaign is 43 % , versus 28 % when the campaign is unarmed . 
According to the same study , which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between 1900 and 2006 , the likelihood of democratic transition within five years following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3 % , compared to 51 % when campaigns were unarmed . 
Libya , of course , can survive the gloomy prospect of post-authoritarian civil war . 
But this requires containing tribal and regional polarization , as well as the rivalries between the Interim National Council ( INC ) and the Military Council ( MC ) , and between senior military commanders . 
Violent polarization has developed not only between Eastern and Western tribes , but also between some of the Western tribes . 
Last month , for example , armed clashes erupted between rebels in al-Zintan and the villagers of al-Rayyaniya , 15 kilometers away . 
Six people were killed - a reminder of what can happen if violent polarization continues between neighboring towns and villages . 
Vendetta politics is not unknown in Libya , and , in an armed society comprising more than 120 tribes - including around 30 with significant numbers and resources - it can become extremely dangerous . 
Another negative scenario is military rule . 
Several figures from the &quot; free officers &quot; - the group that plotted the 1969 coup against the monarchy - are leading the INC . 
They include General Abd al-Fattah Younis , General Soliman Mahmoud , Colonel Khalifa Haftar , Major Mohamed Najm , and others . 
Those figures hold a mix of historical legitimacy , for participating in the 1969 coup , and current legitimacy , for helping the 17th February revolution . 
They also belong to several large tribes , guaranteeing wide tribal representation if a military council were to take power , as in Egypt . 
Unlike Egypt , however , whoever takes power in Libya will not necessarily inherit poor economic conditions that could threaten their legitimacy and undermine their popularity . 
This might lead a group of senior officers to rule directly , especially if victory in Libya comes militarily . 
A move by army officers in Tripoli against Qaddafi and his sons might end the conflict , with military commanders getting the credit - and the political capital . 
But four decades of military-based dictatorship may be enough for Libyans , a majority of whom never really benefited from their country &apos;s wealth or potential . 
When it comes to producing terrorists and undocumented immigrants - two critical issues for Europe - Arab military dictators have an inglorious record . 
Algeria in the 1990 &quot; s is a potent reminder of this , and Western governments do not want the vicious cycle of repressive autocrats producing violent theocrats and refugees to restart . 
Getting &quot; stuck in transition &quot; is a third possible scenario , with Libya remaining in a &quot; gray zone &quot; - neither a fully-fledged democracy nor a dictatorship , but &quot; semi-free . &quot; 
This means regular elections , a democratic constitution , and civil society , coupled with electoral fraud , skewed representation , human rights violations , and restrictions on civil liberties . 
Getting stuck in transition usually kills the momentum for democratic change , and widespread corruption , weak state institutions , and lack of security serve to reinforce a myth of the &quot; just autocrat . &quot; 
Vladimir Putin &apos;s rule in Russia illustrates this outcome . 
Unfortunately , a study published in the Journal of Democracy showed that out of the 100 countries that were designated &quot; in transition &quot; between 1970 and 2000 , only 20 became fully democratic ( for example , Chile , Argentina , Poland , and Taiwan ) . 
Five relapsed into brutal dictatorships ( including Uzbekistan , Algeria , Turkmenistan , and Belarus ) , while the rest were stuck somewhere in transition . 
Given Libya &apos;s lack of democratic experience , some view this as a likely outcome in the post-Qaddafi era . 
But Libya is not the only country that has tried to move from dictatorship to democracy with weak institutions and strong tribal identities . 
Albania , Mongolia , and India successfully passed more complicated tests - and offer some useful lessons in democratic transitions under unfavourable conditions . 
The fourth scenario is partition , with the old three-province , Ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned : Cyrenaica ( east ) , Fezzan ( south ) , and Tripolitania ( west ) . 
Cyrenaica is Qaddafi-free , Tripolitania is not , and Fezzan did not fully join the revolution . But the administrative borders of these districts were never fully established , and they have changed at least eight times since 1951 . 
In 2007 , Libya had 22 sha &apos;biya ( administrative districts ) , not three . 
All of these scenarios will be affected by outcomes in Egypt and Tunisia . 
In the case of democratic transitions , a success nearby often helps at home . 
Either country , or both , could offer Libya successful transition models , erecting an important obstacle to military dictatorship or civil war .
