Toppling the Arab Berlin Wall 
Tens of millions of Arabs witnessed the toppling of Saddam Hussein last spring , and saw in his fall reflections of their own situation . 
Rightly so , for Iraq &apos;s transition can mark the start of the fall of the &quot; Arab Wall &quot;  - the invisible barrier of authoritarianism and rigidity that isolates the region as surely as the Berlin Wall once cut Europe in two . 
Given the Middle East &apos;s deep malaise , today &apos;s Arab status quo cannot long endure . 
But what will replace it ? 
Three dark possibilities exist : anarchy of the type that allowed Osama bin Laden to flourish in Afghanistan , civil wars of the sort that ravaged Algeria and Sudan , or a new Saddam-style authoritarianism . 
To realize any of these scenarios , the world need do nothing but wait and watch the present status quo rot and sink into chaos . 
But there is a positive alternative : a reformist path leading to the establishment of the rule of law , individual rights , a more robust civil society , and democratization across the Arab world . 
Despite the violence now plaguing Iraq , finding that path is possible . 
The Arab world has been relatively stable for the past decade or two . The assassinations , coups , and social disorder that dominated the region between 1945 and 1990 have virtually disappeared , the two big exceptions being the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict . 
But relative stability has not improved matters , delivering only failed governments , negative growth , the rise of radical Islam , and ever more repression . 
Such inertia breeds hopelessness , and a nihilist yearning for violence . 
As one young Arab told me when describing his homeland : &quot; The country never invests in the young , we have no place , we are not wanted . 
I could easily burn this place and move on with no regrets . &quot; 
How can the Middle East halt this downward spiral of despair and rage ? 
Muslims have experimented with most of modernity &apos;s political faiths : socialism ( Algeria , Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria , and Yemen ) , communism ( South Yemen ) , state capitalism fused with monarchy ( the Gulf states , Jordan , and Morocco ) . 
They have even experimented with homegrown ideologies - Nasserism , Ba &apos;athism , and Khomeinism . 
Just about the only untested ideology in the region is liberal capitalist democracy . 
The Kuwaitis , along with the region &apos;s other royal states - Bahrain , Qatar , Oman , and the UAE - may be the best bet to pursue a liberal approach , given the already tolerant nature of their kings and emirs . 
The call for Saddam Hussein &apos;s resignation by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan of the UAE before the US invasion suggests that at least some Arab leaders are prepared to welcome far-reaching change in their region . 
By contrast , viable reform in Saudi Arabia faces much greater challenges . 
The al-Saud royal family failed to back the US effort in Iraq because of domestic concerns . 
The country &apos;s religious laws and character - central to the regime &apos;s legitimacy - undermine liberal forces , and many Saudis fear that the pressures surrounding religious and political reform will lead to an explosion . 
But the Saudi establishment &apos;s serious response to the May 2003 attack on a civilian compound in Riyadh at least gives a glimmer of hope that the al-Saud may see reform as their only hope of survival . 
In Jordan , reform will require rebalancing the country &apos;s social fabric , with Palestinian Jordanians given greater freedom to contribute politically in meaningful ways . 
But they will first have to make a conscious decision to accept Jordan as their home . 
The Middle East &apos;s secular states confront different problems . 
Egypt &apos;s once preeminent leadership role in the Arab world has eroded as influence shifted to Qatar , the UAE , even Syria - and now potentially to a democratic Iraq . 
Egypt can reclaim Arab leadership only if it guides the region in the quest for cultural renaissance , liberalism , democracy , educational reform , and economic development . 
Egypt &apos;s history could support this role . 
The monarchy was overthrown in 1952 without violence , and for 250 years Egypt has shown itself capable of producing both radical and reformist political trends . 
Indeed , the fate of reform in Egypt will in some ways mean either the death or the renewal of the Arab world . 
Syria profited directly from trade with Iraq and from oil transport fees , while Saddam &apos;s fall turned the spotlight on subjects that the regime prefers to keep in the dark : Syria &apos;s role in Lebanon , its support for Hezbollah and some Palestinian organizations , one-party rule , and human rights violations . 
Above all , Syria wants to bypass Washington &apos;s reform agenda and preserve the domestic status quo . 
So the regime hopes that Iraq becomes a quagmire , forcing the US to ask Syria for help . 
But if Bashir Assad wants Syria to avoid sinking deeper into poverty and irrelevance , he must undertake political , cultural , and economic liberalization . 
Assad has the capacity to take bold steps , but he is constrained by the establishment that he inherited ( and of which he is a product ) . 
For the Middle East &apos;s monarchical regimes , and secular ones like Assad &apos;s , reform does not necessarily mean self-destruction . 
As Mexico and postcommunist Europe demonstrated , nimble elites can re-invent themselves as they change their political system . 
Iran , however , does not have this luxury . 
Iranians yearn for reform , reflected in President Khatami &apos;s two landslide electoral victories . 
But the ruling mullahs &apos; stiff resistance to even modest changes suggests that they understand that serious reforms will put their rule at stake . 
Even so , the possibility of reform has never been closer because Iran &apos;s huge and young population demands it . 
No Arab country has yet produced such powerful social and cultural movements demanding change . 
But indigenous reform in the Middle East is only half the battle . 
The other half is bringing peace to Palestinians and Israelis . 
Reform cannot succeed in the midst of a conflict that bolsters extremists and hatred . 
All the walls that separate the region from integration into the modern and global community must be brought down .
