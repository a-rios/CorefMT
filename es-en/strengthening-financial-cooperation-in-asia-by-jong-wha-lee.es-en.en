Euro Lessons for East Asia 
SEOUL - East Asia could learn two valuable lessons from the eurozone crisis . 
First , do not rush the process of financial and monetary integration ; and , second , develop adequate institutional frameworks before proceeding . 
In fact , East Asian countries are unlikely to move toward a regional fixed exchange-rate system or a monetary union with a single currency in the immediate future , owing to the region &apos;s great diversity in terms of economic and political conditions . 
Perhaps , in a few decades , the region &apos;s countries will develop institutions to promote financial integration , such as a single bank supervisory agency of the type that the European Union is now creating . 
Nevertheless , Asian policymakers should improve cooperation mechanisms designed to prevent and manage crises . 
Most promising is the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization ( CMIM ) of the ASEAN + 3 - the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China , Japan , and South Korea . 
This $ 120 billion regional reserve pool was launched in 2010 to provide short-term liquidity to members in an emergency . 
The ASEAN + 3 is now strengthening the CMIM by doubling the total fund size to $ 240 billion . 
The group also agreed to enhance the CMIM &apos;s flexibility by reducing the minimum portion of crisis lending to be tied to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s lending program from 80 % to 70 % . 
The CMIM has yet to be tested in a crisis . 
In its infancy , it might not be able to provide adequate emergency support in a timely and flexible manner . 
The $ 240 billion fund is small , amounting to only about 1.5 % of the region &apos;s GDP . 
European experience suggests that large-scale systemic shocks call for greater financial support . 
Unlike the IMF or the European Stability Mechanism , CMIM contributions are self-managed by the respective country &apos;s authorities . 
And countries may choose not to contribute to a swap request . 
This suggests that the CMIM could be especially constrained amid a systemic shock or political disputes among member countries . 
Moreover , an &quot; IMF stigma &quot; remains among those countries in the region that were discontented with the Fund &apos;s role during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis . 
IMF conditionality for the activation of the majority of their borrowing could make countries reluctant to turn to the CMIM for support . 
Another challenge is the CMIM &apos;s limited capacity for economic surveillance and monitoring . 
Last year , ASEAN + 3 established a regional surveillance unit , the ASEAN + 3 Macroeconomic Research Office ( AMRO ) , to monitor regional economies , detect emerging vulnerabilities , and support effective decision-making by the CMIM . 
But it is unclear whether AMRO has sufficient capacity and expertise to monitor 13 countries effectively . 
Indeed , East Asian countries may find it difficult to conduct candid surveillance of one another &apos;s policies and enforce firm policy conditionality . 
The example of Greece before and during the eurozone crisis shows that it is often hard for countries to be tough on their neighbors . 
The ASEAN + 3 must continue to increase its resources , enhance its independence and improve its operational procedures . 
A fully capable regional financial safety net could contain the contagion of financial shocks emanating from individual economies and prevent disruptions to the region &apos;s key growth drivers - intra-regional trade and investment . 
The CMIM could help East Asian countries to reduce their reliance on accumulating , as a form of self-insurance , costly reserves that fuel global imbalances . 
With greater resources and an improved governance structure , AMRO could play a more effective role in regional economic surveillance and monitoring , without which moral-hazard risks associated with financial safety nets would rise . 
Enhanced regional control would contribute to better information-sharing and decision-making as well , implying that the IMF-linked portion of CMIM crisis lending could be reduced in step with the strengthening of AMRO &apos;s capacity and performance . 
The ASEAN + 3 should aim to develop the CMIM into a full-capacity regional financial safety net supported by AMRO as a capable and credible secretariat - a de facto Asian Monetary Fund , possibly with broader membership . 
But , until the CMIM and AMRO are fully developed , their close cooperation with the IMF is desirable . 
Indeed , at the Cannes G-20 Summit in November 2011 , leaders agreed on principles for cooperation between the IMF and regional financing arrangements , including open information-sharing and joint missions . 
In particular , the IMF and ASEAN + 3 financing arrangement should establish a regular channel of dialogue to facilitate information exchange and prepare concrete guidelines for cooperation and an appropriate division of tasks . 
Establishing constructive and effective guidelines could help to prevent the sort of conflicts and confusion over lending conditions during crises that we have seen among the IMF , EU , and the European Central Bank in the eurozone . 
Given the &quot; IMF stigma &quot; in Asia , a co-financing facility that provides precautionary credit lines without policy conditionality to qualified member countries would be useful . 
Asian countries have learned from their region &apos;s own crisis in the 1990 &quot; s , as well as from the eurozone &apos;s ongoing crisis , that effective management of cross-border capital flows requires well-constructed national , regional , and global responses . 
To respond effectively to crises , East Asian countries must continue to improve the regional financial safety net and surveillance mechanism , while strengthening their cooperation with the IMF .
