Our Other Drug Problem 
MILAN - With all the official and media attention given to the worldwide trade in illicit drugs , the public has at most a dim awareness of the serious problems affecting the production , testing , and sale of the legal kind : the medicines that we take to treat or cure everything from AIDS to Yellow Fever . 
The development of new drugs is a complex and lengthy process . 
It starts with an idea and requires a wide range of skills to bring that idea to fruition : synthesis or extraction of more or less complicated molecules , proof of their therapeutic effect in cell cultures and animals , testing for toxicity , and clinical studies . 
Along this path , many potential drugs are withdrawn , and even successfully tested drugs face the additional hurdle of regulatory approval . 
Finally , the drug reaches the market , where it must be followed closely , because many adverse reactions are detected only with a large number of patients and after years of use . 
There are several thousand drugs currently on the market , with a worldwide value of about $ 3 trillion . 
Ideally , drugs should have a favorable risk-benefit ratio . 
Compared with other drugs with the same indications , new drugs should be selected on the basis of their safety , effectiveness , and cost . 
What can be done ? 
First , new drugs should always offer added value - better efficacy , lower toxicity , or greater ease of treatment . 
Unfortunately , this is not required by current legislation in Europe , where only quality , efficacy , and safety must be demonstrated , without any need for comparative studies . 
There is therefore the risk that new drugs may in fact be worse than products already on the market . 
New drugs are often tested against placebos or drugs that are not the best treatment available , the point being to demonstrate that the new drug is not inferior to any already on the market . 
Patients &quot; informed consent usually does not provide a clear description of a non-inferiority trial , and the lack of added value indicates that in many cases the development of a new drug is driven by commercial aims rather than patients &quot; needs . 
Second , improvement of drug development requires more transparency from the regulatory bodies . 
At present , a new drug &apos;s producer prepares the entire dossier presented to the regulatory authority for approval ; in the interests of the public , at least one of the clinical trials should be carried out by an independent non-profit organization . 
Moreover , only the regulators can examine the dossiers , which are highly confidential . 
It is unacceptable that patients participating voluntarily in clinical trials , and their representatives , have no right to see data that would not exist without them . 
Third , better conditions for the approval of new drugs should be matched by better use of drugs , which requires better information for prescribers . 
Today , information provided by drug makers largely predominates over independent information . 
As a result , certain drugs are used much more frequently than would be expected from their approved indications . 
This so-called &quot; off-label &quot; use is sustained by continuous propaganda aimed not only at doctors , but also directly at the public . 
Direct but shadowy information tends to lead to &quot; disease mongering &quot; - the creation of diseases in order to boost prescriptions . 
For example , the concept of &quot; pre-hypertension &quot; could extend the use of anti-hypertensive drugs dramatically , because everybody &apos;s blood pressure rises with age . 
Likewise , the notion that blood cholesterol should be as low as possible clears a path to treating healthy people with anti-cholesteremic agents . 
Clearly , health authorities must take closer control of information by becoming more responsible for physicians &quot; continuous education . 
If the conditions for drug approval and marketing become more severe , pharmaceutical companies will be forced to produce fewer me-too drugs and more products of clinical importance . 
Requiring longer testing periods , and possibly extra resources , could be compensated by new drugs &quot; greater longevity on the market , and patent coverage could be extended . 
Finally , incentives must be found to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs that fulfill the needs of patients still awaiting therapy . 
There are more than 6,000 rare and neglected diseases - many in developing countries - that lack remedies . 
The challenge is how to produce new drugs that - because patients are too few or too poor - promise very limited returns . 
A partnership between governments , non-profit research institutions , charities and pharmaceutical companies might be one way to clean up the approval process for new drugs . 
If public awareness of the current problems stimulates politicians to find a solution that works , better drugs and better drug use will be achievable .
