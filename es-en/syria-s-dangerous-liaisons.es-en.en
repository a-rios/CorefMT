Syria &apos;s Dangerous Liaisons 
All eyes turned to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri . 
Opposition groups in Lebanon , as well as Hariri supporters , openly accused Syrian President Bashar Assad &apos;s regime of being responsible for the killing . 
The Bush administration , while not formally blaming Syria , virtually did so and recalled its ambassador to Damascus . 
The US is said to be extremely angry at Syria &apos;s refusal to withdraw its forces from Lebanon in line with a United Nations resolution . 
Growing opposition to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is but one of four related problems Syria faces , all of which it has addressed inadequately . 
The other three are Syria &apos;s behavior in Iraq , its relations with the US , and the need for domestic reform . 
While corrosive immobility is a trademark of the Syrian regime , these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria internationally even more so than today . 
In Lebanon , the Syrians have repeatedly misread the Bush administration &apos;s intentions . 
Last September , the US , together with France , sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding a Syrian pullout and the disarming of militias - mainly Hezbollah . 
This came after Assad last September imposed an unconstitutional extension of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud &apos;s mandate , despite French and American warnings . 
Yet to this day , Syrian officials privately say that they don &apos;t think the US is serious about a withdrawal . 
Syria &apos;s leaders also continue to dismiss demands from within Lebanon for an end to Syria &apos;s 28-year military presence . 
Such demands escalated dramatically after Hariri &apos;s death , as tens of thousands of the former prime minister &apos;s partisans , who previously sat on the fence when it came to Syria , shouted &quot; Syria out . &quot; 
Indeed , a broad multi-communal opposition front has formed in Beirut to demand Syria &apos;s departure . 
Yet rather than address the front &apos;s demands and shape a healthy bilateral relationship between equal countries , Syria has sought to divide the opposition and reassert control . 
Hariri &apos;s assassination makes that far more difficult , and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France . 
In Iraq , since the fall of Baghdad on April 9 , 2003 , Damascus has shown undue nostalgia for the old system . 
Though the Syrian and Iraqi Baath parties were bitter foes , there was consolation in that both were members of a confederacy of despotisms . 
For the Syrians , a democratic Iraq friendly to the US was always far worse than Saddam Hussein , the enemy they knew - and later profitably traded with - during the years of international sanctions against Iraq . 
Syria &apos;s suspected support for Iraqi Baathist exiles threatens to damage relations with the new Iraq . 
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the Assad regime of allowing Iraqi funds to be channeled to insurgents , and recently notified the Syrians that the photograph of a senior Syrian intelligence official taken with an Islamist combatant was found on the latter &apos;s body in Falluja . 
As a legitimate Iraqi authority emerges following the elections , the Syrians will have to show foresight in jettisoning their pro-Saddam acquaintances . 
The Bush administration &apos;s growing impatience with Syrian involvement in the Iraqi insurgency is a major reason for Syria &apos;s deteriorating relationship with the US . 
Indeed , there is palpable disdain for Syria in Washington . 
That is why Syria &apos;s denials that it is playing a spoiler role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously , and why Assad has not gained American support for renewed negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights . 
There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well . 
For example , Assad apparently still does not realize how much the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism . 
Syrian officials believe that because the Baath Party is secular , the US will invariably support it against an Islamist resurgence . 
They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories , Iraq , and Lebanon . 
At home , Assad &apos;s regime also finds itself in a bind . 
Political and economic reform , when it advances , does so at a glacial pace . 
A major item of discussion in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system offering few incentives except to regime grandees . 
France &apos;s opposition to Syria &apos;s presence in Lebanon was at least partly a reflection of disenchantment with Assad &apos;s reformist ambitions , and the European Union has expressed similar reservations . 
Assad is now in a consolidation phase , leaving little room for reform . 
Indeed , his new interior minister , Ghazi Kanaan , an old-school hardliner , spearheaded a crackdown on reformers and Kurds in the past year or so . 
The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad &apos;s preferences . 
In the coming month , several rounds of retirements should allow the president to place more of his people in positions of power . 
Consolidation , however , is not reform . 
Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation . 
Until now , the president has toed a hard line on Iraq , on Lebanon , and in domestic affairs . 
If he &apos;s a reformer , few are convinced . 
Syria may pay a heavy price for that ambiguity .
