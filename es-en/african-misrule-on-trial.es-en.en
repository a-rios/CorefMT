African Misrule on Trial 
THE HAGUE - As the world focuses on the inauguration of America &apos;s first black president and celebrates an important milestone in the ongoing struggle for racial equality , recent developments across the Atlantic represent significant progress in a related global campaign to end impunity for mass crimes . 
In the coming days , judges sitting on the International Criminal Court in The Hague will decide whether to issue a warrant for the arrest of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for the crime of genocide . 
Neither event is earth shattering , but , taken together , these two steps mean that a new system of international justice is working . 
Government and rebel leaders around the globe have been put on notice that criminal conduct will no longer be given a free pass . 
Although the threatened indictment of al-Bashir has prompted protest in Khartoum , no one expects him to appear in court soon . 
As for Lubanga , he is one of many in the Congo who has used civilians as pawns in a war that has cost more than five million lives in the past decade . 
Though serious , the charges against him - recruiting child soldiers - do not pretend to encompass the range of abuses committed . 
Five years after the world &apos;s first permanent criminal tribunal commenced operations , it has made its mark . 
The ICC has opened four active investigations , issued public charges against twelve people , and to date secured custody of four . 
Nonetheless , the Court has come under fire for three alleged failings . 
First , some argue that by interjecting itself into ongoing conflicts , the ICC has impeded efforts to secure peace . 
In northern Uganda , ICC charges against leaders of the rebel Lord &apos;s Resistance Army have helped bring an end to years of brutal fighting , and marginalized the LRA &apos;s chief , Joseph Kony . 
Similarly , in Sudan &apos;s Darfur region , there has been no genuine peace process to disrupt , as attacks on civilians continue to be reported , even after the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the ICC in 2005 . 
Even so , the ICC prosecutor &apos;s application for an arrest warrant for al-Bashir - announced this past July - has yet to provoke a widely-feared crackdown on humanitarian organizations . 
On the contrary , it may have prompted the arrest of a lower-level indictee for crimes in Darfur . 
In short , more law , rather than less , is needed to help stem the violence . 
Second , the ICC is said to have allowed itself to become a tool of national political leaders . 
The fact that national governments referred three of the Court &apos;s four active cases - and that in each of those cases only armed rebels or government opponents have been charged so far - has contributed to this perception . 
Navigating this interplay between law and politics is perhaps the ICC &apos;s greatest challenge . 
On the one hand , the Court &apos;s actions often have political consequences : however well-founded , accusing the leader of a rebel army may be seen as taking sides in a conflict . 
On the other hand , the Court cannot charge - or refrain from charging - a senior political or military official responsible for grave crimes solely to avert negative political repercussions . 
Nor would it be proper , where the gravity and scale of crimes materially differ , to charge all sides in a conflict in order to preserve a false sense of parity . 
Both of these complaints reflect a third : unease with the Court &apos;s overwhelming focus on Africa . 
Some suggest that this is yet another example of Western institutions applying to Africa principles that they don &apos;t apply to themselves . 
The long history of Africa &apos;s exploitation demands that this concern not be dismissed out of hand . 
Nevertheless , Africa is the site of many of the world &apos;s worst conflicts . 
Nor is the ICC a foreign body . 
Thirty African governments have ratified the ICC &apos;s governing statute , and several of the Court &apos;s 18 judges hail from Africa , as does a substantial portion of its staff . 
Still , the Court should not hesitate to act outside Africa when mass atrocities demand redress . 
The experience of other war crimes tribunals suggests that questions about political bias may take years to overcome . 
Only by demonstrating professionalism in its work , and willingness to hold senior government figures accountable where appropriate , can the ICC engender broad and lasting support . 
Over time , the ICC &apos;s example should foster more effective national and regional prosecutions of serious crimes such as genocide , crimes against humanity , and war crimes . 
For now , the Court can best address skeptics by more regularly and transparently explaining itself - its decisions , its mandate , and its constraints - to a global public to whom it ultimately must answer .
