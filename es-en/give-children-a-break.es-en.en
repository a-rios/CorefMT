Give Children a Break 
The buzzword of preschool and primary school education in many countries over the past 20 years has been &quot; accountability . &quot; 
Advocates suggest - rightfully , I think - that scarce tax dollars should be spent only on programs that &quot; work . &quot; 
But one of the less noticed effects of the movement for greater accountability has been that children &apos;s opportunities for free time and opportunities to interact with their peers , especially at recess , has been eliminated or diminished in many school systems in the United States , Canada , and Great Britain . 
Politicians and school superintendents view &quot; accountability &quot; as a way to prove that they are &quot; tough on education &quot; and are striving to improve academic performance . 
Indeed , it seems like common sense that reducing recess time would have a positive effect on achievement - a position endorsed by educational leaders like Benjamin Canada , a former superintendent of schools in Atlanta , Georgia . 
But there is no empirical or theoretical evidence to support this claim . 
On the contrary , whereas many educators recognize the centrality of teaching skills and maximizing efficient use of classroom time , they also advocate breaks between periods of intense work to allow children to relax and interact with peers . 
They also hope that children will return to their classrooms after their breaks and work with renewed interest . 
There can be common ground between these two positions , particularly with respect to primary schools . 
While accepting the need for accountability , our best theory and empirical evidence must be used to guide practice . 
To do otherwise is to squander the trust and resources of children , families , taxpayers , and educators . 
Indeed , far too many of the policies being recommended for primary schools have no scientific basis . 
I am not aware of any data supporting the idea that eliminating recess maximizes children &apos;s attention to classroom tasks . 
In fact , experimental data supports the argument that what goes on during recess periods is &quot; educational &quot; in the traditional sense . 
Specifically , children are more attentive to classroom tasks after recess than before recess . 
Attention to classroom tasks , such as reading , is related to more general indicators of cognitive performance , such as reading achievement , so it is an important indicator of the effects of break time . 
Anecdotal evidence from East Asia also suggests that children &apos;s attention to classroom work is maximized when instructional periods are relatively short and followed by breaks . 
In most East Asian primary schools , for example , children are given a 10-minute break every 40 minutes or so . 
When children come back from these breaks , they seem more attentive and ready to work than before . 
American experimental evidence that my colleagues and I gathered also supports these claims . 
To illustrate the role of recess on attention , consider the findings of a series of experiments conducted in a public elementary school , in which we manipulated recess timing , or the time children spent doing seatwork before recess . 
On randomly assigned days , the children went out to recess at 10 a.m. or at 10 : 30 a.m. 
Before and after the break , children &apos;s attention to classroom tasks was coded . 
In three of the four experiments , we also controlled the tasks on which children worked before and after recess . 
In all the experiments , the children were more attentive after the recess than before , and they were less attentive when the break came later . 
Furthermore , in many cases , gender moderated the effects of recess . 
First , in reading assignments , the children were more attentive to same-gender , relative to other-gender , books . 
Second , boys &quot; attention was especially sensitive to recess timing : boys were more likely than girls to be inattentive when recess came later . 
In one of our experiments , the recess period was held indoors rather than outdoors . 
We chose this venue first , because the effects of indoor recess on children &apos;s attention would provide insight into the role of a relatively sedentary break period on subsequent attention . 
If children &apos;s attention were greater after the indoor break than before , the role of physical activity per se would be minimal . 
Second , as a policy matter , educators sometimes use indoor recess as an alternative to outdoor breaks . 
The results from this experiment replicated the findings from the outdoor recess results : the children were more attentive after recess than before . 
In conclusion , these experiments support the idea that providing breaks over the course of instruction facilitates children &apos;s attention to classroom tasks . 
The fact that these results were obtained using well-controlled field experiments and replication across a number of studies instills confidence in the findings . 
Educational policymakers should therefore use these findings to guide policy . 
If they do not , concerned citizens should demand that educators provide a justification for the policy that they do impose on schoolchildren . 
School officials and politicians often extol Asian educational practices , but they should also consider Asian recess practices in the context of an extended school day and academic year . 
Extending the length of the school day and the academic year - a key priority of &quot; accountability &quot; advocates - might positively affect children &apos;s achievement while simultaneously providing parents with badly needed additional childcare . 
But requiring that children spend more time in school will not boost cognitive performance and social competence unless we also increase the time children spend outside the classroom .
