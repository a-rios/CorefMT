Turkey &apos;s Balancing Act 
EAST LANSING , MICHIGAN - Turkey has over the past few weeks become the spearhead of a joint Western-Arab-Turkish policy aimed at forcing President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria . 
This is quite a turnaround in Turkish policy , because over the past two years the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had gone out of its way to cultivate good relations with neighboring Syria , with whom it shares a long land border . 
This change of course on Syria has also cost Turkey a great deal in terms of its relations with Iran , the principal supporter of Assad &apos;s regime , which Turkey had also cultivated as part of Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu &apos;s &quot; zero problems with neighbors &quot; policy . 
Given these new strains , it is worth recalling that a only few months ago many American leaders were livid at what they perceived to be Turkey &apos;s betrayal . 
In their view , Turkey had re-oriented its foreign policy toward the Muslim Middle East and away from the West - a shift supposedly reflected in the country &apos;s deteriorating relations with Israel and improving ties with Iran and Syria . 
Many American policymakers and publicists , unable or unwilling to distinguish Turkish-Israeli relations from Turkish-American relations , interpreted Erdoğan &apos;s condemnation of Israel &apos;s blockade of Gaza as a bid to cozy up to his Arab neighbors at the expense of Turkey &apos;s relations with not only Israel but with the West in general . 
Turkey &apos;s attempt to mediate between the major Western powers and Iran concerning the Islamic Republic &apos;s uranium stockpile went unappreciated in the West ; indeed , the United States scuttled the effort just as it seemed to be bearing fruit . 
And Turkey &apos;s subsequent vote in the United Nations Security Council against imposing additional sanctions on Iran seemed to offer further proof that Turkey had adopted an &quot; Islamic &quot; foreign policy . 
America &apos;s anxiety assumed that it is a contradiction for Turkey to seek good relations with both the West and the Muslim Middle East , and that Ankara &apos;s decision to improve its relations with its Muslim neighbors was motivated primarily by religious and ideological concerns considered important by the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) . 
Turkey &apos;s recent tense relations with Iran demonstrate this assumption &apos;s basic fallacy , and point to a non-ideological foreign policy that caters to Turkish national interests as defined by the country &apos;s political elite - including the post-Islamists in power today . 
Disagreement between Turkey and Iran initially centered on their conflicting approaches to the internal rebellion against Assad &apos;s dictatorship . 
Iran has been heavily invested in the Assad regime , its lone Arab ally and the main conduit for delivering material support to Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
Turkey , on the other hand , after some initial hesitation , has thrown its weight fully behind Assad &apos;s opponents , including by providing refuge to them , as well as to defectors from Syria &apos;s army . 
Indeed , Turkey has gone further by helping the divided Syrian opposition to come together on its territory to establish a joint front against the Assad regime and provide a credible alternative to it . 
Turkey abruptly shifted its stance on Syria , and aligned its position with that of the major Western powers , for two reasons . 
First , the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) could not afford to be seen as opposing democracy in Syria , given that its own legitimacy rests heavily on its democratic credentials . 
Second , once Erdoğan &apos;s government concluded that Assad &apos;s regime was bound to fall , it sought to secure its future interests in Syria , which is of strategic importance to Turkey - even at the cost of jeopardizing relations with Iran . 
Iran &apos;s displeasure at Turkey &apos;s &quot; betrayal &quot; of Assad was compounded by the Erdoğan government &apos;s recent decision to install a NATO anti-missile early-warning facility - aimed at tracking Iranian missile activity - in Malatya in eastern Turkey . 
According to Iranian authorities , NATO &apos;s system is designed to neutralize Iran &apos;s deterrent capacity vis-à-vis Israel , thereby increasing the likelihood of an Israeli or US strike against Iranian nuclear facilities . 
Iranian officials went so far as to warn Turkey that it would make the Malatya facility its first target in retaliation for a Western strike on Iran . 
In reality , Israel can track Iranian missile activity from several sites other than Malatya . 
Iran &apos;s threat , therefore , is an expression more of discontent with Turkey than of genuine concern that the Malatya facility will adversely affect its deterrent capacity . 
Iranian-Turkish tensions reflect three larger realities . 
First , the Arab Spring , and especially the Syrian uprising , exposed the two sides &quot; underlying rivalry for influence in the Middle East and the Arab world . 
Second , Turkey &apos;s turn toward the east is not ideologically or religiously inspired , but instead is based on solid strategic and economic calculations ; as the fluid situation in the Middle East continues to develop , Turkey will adapt its policies accordingly . 
Finally , Turkey has invested far too much in its strategic relations with NATO , and with the US in particular , to fritter them away in exchange for uncertain gains in relations with Iran . 
This does not mean that Turkey will return to its traditional strategic dependence on the US and its allies , an approach that defined Turkish foreign policy throughout the Cold War and the decade following it . 
The AKP government is committed to the country &apos;s strategic autonomy and to greater activism in the Middle East . 
But it is also aware that such policies must not cost Turkey its relationship with NATO and the US . 
Turkey is engaged in an intricate effort to preserve its old relationship with the West while building new ties with its Muslim neighbors . 
Turkey &apos;s leaders understand that the country can best preserve and enhance its leverage with both sides by maintaining good relations with each .
