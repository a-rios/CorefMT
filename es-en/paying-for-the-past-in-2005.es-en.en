Paying for the Past in 2005 
The beginning of each year is high season for economic forecasters . 
With few exceptions , Wall Street economists try to give as upbeat an interpretation as the data will allow : they want their clients to buy stocks , and gloom-and-doom forecasts do little to sell them . 
But even the salesmen are predicting that the American economy will be weaker in 2005 than in 2004 . 
I agree , and am actually on the pessimistic side : this may be the year in which we begin to pay for past mistakes . 
The biggest global economic uncertainty is the price of oil . 
Clearly , oil producers failed to anticipate the growth of demand in China - so much for the wisdom and foresight of private markets . 
Supply-side problems in the Middle East ( and Nigeria , Russia , and Venezuela ) are also playing a role , while Bush &apos;s misadventure in Iraq has brought further instability . 
While there has been some weakening of prices from their peaks , OPEC has made it clear that it does not intend to allow much price erosion . 
High oil prices are a drain on America , Europe , Japan , and other oil importing countries . 
The increase in America &apos;s oil import bill over the past year alone is estimated to be some $ 75 billion . 
The effect is just like a huge tax that transfers wealth to the oil-exporting countries . 
If there were any assurance that prices would remain permanently above even $ 40 a barrel , alternative energy sources ( including shale oil ) would be developed . 
But we are now in the worst of all possible worlds - prices so high that they are damaging the global economy , but uncertainty so severe that the investments needed to bring prices down are not being made . 
Meanwhile , central bankers around the world have been trained to focus exclusively on inflation . 
So when high oil prices drive up the inflation rate , many will most likely respond as they &apos;ve been taught . 
Interest rates will rise , and one economy after another will slow . 
The march towards higher interest rates has already begun in the United States , where the Federal Reserve is betting on a fundamental market asymmetry . 
For the past three years , falling interest rates have been the engine of growth , as households took on more debt to refinance their mortgages and used some of the savings to consume . 
The Fed is hoping that all of this will not play out in reverse - that higher interest rates will not dampen consumption . 
Hope may not be enough . 
American households are far deeper in debt today than four years ago , magnifying the potential adverse effects of an increase in interest rates . 
Of course , American mortgage markets allow households to lock in the lower interest rates . 
But in economics , there is no such thing as a free lunch , and here the cost can be enormous : new home buyers will have to pay more , and thus will be less willing and able to pay as much . 
Real estate prices could well decline , with a strong likelihood , at the very least , of a slowdown in the rate of increase . 
This too will dampen demand . 
This is only one of the uncertainties facing the US economy . 
Then there is America &apos;s huge fiscal and trade deficits , which not only jeopardize the well-being of future American generations , but represent a drag on the current US economy . 
As one of my predecessors as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers , Herb Stein , famously put it , &quot; If something can &apos;t go on forever , it won &apos;t . &quot; 
But no one knows how , or when , it will all end . 
Indeed , President Bush has indicated an intention to spend the political capital he earned during the election ; the problem is , he appears intent on spending America &apos;s economic capital as well . 
What , exactly , this will do to business confidence and currency markets is anybody &apos;s guess , but it won &apos;t be pretty . 
As a result , an even weaker dollar is a strong possibility , which will further undermine the European and Japanese economies . 
And this is not a zero sum situation , with America &apos;s gains equal to Europe &apos;s losses : the uncertainty is bad for investment on both sides of the Atlantic , and if lack of confidence in the dollar leads to a shift out of American bonds and stocks , the American economy could be weakened further . 
Europe is finally beginning to recognize the problems with its macro-economic institutions , particularly a stability pact that restricts the use of fiscal policy and a central bank that focuses only on inflation , not on jobs or growth . 
But there is a good chance that reforms will not come fast enough to lift the economy in 2005 . 
China - and Asia more generally - represents the bright spot on the horizon . 
It may be too soon to be sure , but prospects for taming the over exuberance of a year ago appear good , bringing economic growth rates to sustainable levels that would be the envy of most other countries . 
By contrast , the world &apos;s other major economies will probably not begin performing up to potential in the next twelve months . 
They are all caught between the problems of the present and the mistakes of the past : in Europe , between institutions designed to avoid inflation when the problem is growth and employment ; in America , between massive household and government debt and the demands of fiscal and monetary policy ; and everywhere , between America &apos;s failure to use the world &apos;s scarce natural resources wisely and its failure to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East .
