The African Paradox 
PARIS - Earlier this month , the trial of Pascal Simbikangwa , accused of complicity in the genocide in Rwanda , in which 800,000 people were killed between April and July 1994 , began in Paris . 
Unfortunately , mass killings in Africa continue . 
In South Sudan , Africa &apos;s newest state , massacres of civilians are still taking place , particularly around the city of Bor . 
And French military intervention in the Central African Republic has not put an end to severe inter-communal violence there . 
Yet , paradoxically , even as such episodes continue to occur in Africa , perhaps on a larger scale than anywhere else in the world , the continent has also become a beacon of hope . 
Indeed , the perpetuation of extreme violence contrasts starkly with Africa &apos;s favorable demographic profile , and its economic - and even political and social - progress in recent years . 
One way to think about this paradox is in terms of the closing of a four-century-long parenthesis . 
Since the seventeenth-century , Africa has been mainly an object of history . 
Its people were first treated by the slave trade as mere commodities , necessary for economic growth elsewhere . 
Then colonial powers carved up the continent artificially and arbitrarily , masking their greed behind noble-sounding goals : theirs was a &quot; civilizing &quot; mission . 
Later , during the first half of the twentieth century , Africa offered the blood of its inhabitants , and then recourse to its territories , to a European continent in the throes of two world wars . 
And , in the second half of the twentieth century , after a brutal anti-colonial struggle , Africa &apos;s newly independent countries became proxy battlegrounds in the Cold War . 
Today , by contrast , Africa is in the process of returning as a subject of history . 
With more than one billion inhabitants , representing 18 % of the world &apos;s population , Africa is regaining the place it occupied at the beginning of the sixteenth century . 
Then , with 100 million people , it represented 20 % of the world &apos;s population . 
By the middle of the nineteenth century , after more than 200 years of colonialism and slavery , Africa &apos;s population had fallen to 95 million - just 9 % of the world total - whereas other continents had experienced a large population increase over the same period . 
Economically , Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced a decade of 5-6 % average annual GDP growth . 
In Tanzania , growth this year should be around 7 % . 
At a time when the major emerging economies - with the exception of China - are facing a sharp slowdown , Africa , with its untapped energy resources and precious raw materials , including rare earth minerals , has naturally become a focus of investors &quot; attention . 
But , though Africa can be described as the continent of hope , it is unlikely to become the &quot; New Asia &quot; - that is , a long-term dynamo of global growth - for a combination of cultural , political , geopolitical , and perhaps psychological reasons . 
Asia has experienced the historical continuity of great empires . 
China is the best illustration of this phenomenon . 
It is a reemerging power , not an emerging one , a decisive factor that explains Chinese confidence . 
Asia &apos;s long history of rivalry and competition among its various powers has also been an important factor in its recent economic success . 
The dynamic of competition and emulation among China , Japan , and South Korea has not existed in peacefully reconciled post-WWII Europe ; there is nothing like it in Africa , either . 
Nigeria is not Africa &apos;s equivalent of what China is for Asia . 
And post-apartheid South Africa , for all its progress , has not fulfilled the expectations placed on it , and remains unlikely to become the continent &apos;s gendarme . 
Colonialism and the slave trade constituted a historical rupture for Africa . 
Beyond the human toll - including 10-15 million direct victims - absolute subjugation begot a unique loss of confidence . 
Who today can name Africa &apos;s great empires and kingdoms ? 
Who knows where the worlds &quot; gold came from before its discovery in Latin America in the sixteenth century ? 
Africa must find the confidence it desperately needs in the way others look at it . 
The problem is that others are abysmally ignorant about the continent &apos;s pre-colonial past . 
One may criticize the cynicism of the Chinese , but it is China that has contributed more than any other country to the transformation of Africa &apos;s self-image . 
Today , it is Africans themselves who hold their continent &apos;s future in their hands . 
And , as Africa returns as a subject , rather than an object , of world history , it appears to embody all the fears and hopes of humanity . 
Everything is there in extreme form : desertification , mass movements of populations , and , yes , genocidal violence - but also the hope for new forms of economic growth , if not new modes of governance .
