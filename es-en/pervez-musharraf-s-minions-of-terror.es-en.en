Pervez Musharraf &apos;s Minions of Terror 
After his ill-advised dismissal of the chief justice of Pakistan &apos;s Supreme Court ignited a firestorm of violent protests , President General Pervez Musharraf may be banking on Islamic fanatics to create chaos in the nation &apos;s capital , Islamabad . 
Many suspect that an engineered bloodbath that leads to army intervention , and the declaration of a national emergency , could serve as a pretext to postpone the October 2007 elections . 
This could make way for Musharraf &apos;s dictatorial rule to continue into its eighth year - and perhaps well beyond . 
This perverse strategy sounds almost unbelievable . 
Musharraf , who President George W. Bush describes as his &quot; buddy &quot; and supports an &quot; enlightened moderate &quot; version of Islam , wears religious extremists &quot; two close attempts on his life as a badge of honor . 
But his secret reliance upon the Taliban card - one that he has been accused of playing for years - increases as his authority weakens . 
Signs of government-engineered chaos abound . 
In the heart of Islamabad , vigilante groups from a government-funded mosque , the Lal Masjid , roam the streets and bazaars imposing Islamic morality and terrorizing citizens in full view of the police . 
Openly sympathetic to the Taliban and tribal militants fighting the Pakistan army , the two cleric brothers who head Lal Masjid , Maulana Abdul Aziz and Maulana Abdur Rashid Ghazi , have attracted a core of banned militant organizations around them . 
These include the Jaish-e-Muhammad , considered to be the pioneer of suicide bombings in the region . 
The clerics openly defy the state . 
Since January 21 , baton-wielding , burqa-clad students of the Jamia Hafsa , the woman &apos;s Islamic university located next to Lal Masjid , have forcibly occupied a government building , the Children &apos;s Library . 
In one of their many forays outside the seminary , this burqa brigade swooped upon a house , which they claimed was a brothel , and kidnapped three women and a baby .

Male students from Islamabad &apos;s many madrasas are even more active in terrorizing video shop owners , whom they accuse of spreading pornography . 
Newspapers have carried pictures of grand bonfires made with seized cassettes and CD &apos;s . 
Most video stores in Islamabad have now closed . 
Their owners duly repented after a fresh campaign on May 4 by militants blew up a dozen music and video stores , barbershops and a girl &apos;s school in the Northwest Frontier Province . 
Astonishing patience has been shown by the Pakistani state , which on other occasions freely used air and artillery power to combat such challengers . 
The Lal Masjid clerics operate with impunity - no attempt has been made to cut off its electricity , gas , phone , or Web site - or even to shut down its illegal FM radio station . 
The chief negotiator appointed by Musharraf , Chaudhry Shujaat Husain , described the burqa brigade kidnappers as &quot; our daughters , &quot; with whom negotiations would continue and against whom &quot; no operation could be contemplated . &quot; 
Clerics realize that the government wants to play ball . 
Their initial demand - the rebuilding of eight illegally constructed mosques that had been knocked down by Islamabad &apos;s civic administration - became a call for enforcement of Sharia law across Pakistan . 
In a radio broadcast on April 12 , the clerics issued a threat : &quot; There will be suicide blasts in the nook and cranny of the country . 
We have weapons , grenades , and we are expert in manufacturing bombs . 
We are not afraid of death .... &quot; 
The Lal Masjid head cleric , a former student of my university in Islamabad , added the following chilling message for our women students : 
The government should abolish coeducation . 
Quaid-e-Azam University has become a brothel . 
Its female professors and students roam in objectionable dresses . 
I think I will have to send my daughters of Jamia Hafsa to these immoral women . 
They will have to hide themselves in hijab , otherwise they will be punished according to Islam .... 
However , such a threat could be used for creating the fear of Islam among sinful women . 
There is no harm in it . 
There are far more horrible punishments in the hereafter for such women . 
Indeed , on May 7 , a female teacher in the QAU history department was physically assaulted in her office by a bearded , Taliban-looking man who screamed that he had instructions from Allah . 
What &apos;s next ? 
As Islamabad heads the way of Pakistan &apos;s tribal towns , the next targets will be girls &quot; schools , Internet cafes , bookshops , and stores selling Western clothing , followed by purveyors of toilet paper , tampons , underwear , mannequins , and other un-Islamic goods . 
In a sense , the inevitable is coming to pass . 
Until a few years ago , Islamabad was a quiet , orderly , modern city no different from any other in Pakistan . 
Still earlier , it was largely the abode of Pakistan &apos;s hyper-elite and foreign diplomats . 
But the rapid transformation of its demography brought with it hundreds of mosques with multi-barreled audio cannons mounted on minarets , as well as scores of madrasas illegally constructed in what used to be public parks and green areas . 
Now , tens of thousands of their students with little prayer caps dutifully chant the Koran all day . 
In the evenings , they roam in packs through the city &apos;s streets and bazaars , gaping at store windows and lustfully ogling bare-faced women . 
The stage is being set for transforming Islamabad into a Taliban stronghold . 
When Musharraf exits - which may be sooner rather than later - he will leave a bitter legacy that will last for generations , all for a little more taste of power .
