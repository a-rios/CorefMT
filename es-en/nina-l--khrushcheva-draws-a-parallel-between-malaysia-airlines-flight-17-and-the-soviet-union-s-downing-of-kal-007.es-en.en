Putin &apos;s Tipping Point ? 
NEW YORK - When incompetence in the Kremlin turns murderous , its incumbents can begin to tremble . 
As news of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine trickled into Russia , people with a long memory recalled the Soviet Union &apos;s attack , 31 years ago this September , on Korean Air Lines Flight 007 , and its political consequences . 
Back then , the Kremlin first lied to the world by saying that it had nothing to do with the missing KAL plane . 
Later it claimed that the South Korean jet was on an American spy mission . 
It ended the career of Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov , Chief of the General Staff and a hardliner of the hardest sort , whose inconsistent and unconvincing efforts to justify the downing of the plane proved deeply embarrassing to the Kremlin . 
Ogarkov &apos;s ineptness ( and inept mendacity ) , together with the mounting failure since 1979 of the Soviet Union &apos;s war in Afghanistan , exposed the system &apos;s advanced decrepitude . 
The stagnation that had begun during Leonid Brezhnev &apos;s rule deepened after his death in 1982 . 
His successors , first the KGB &apos;s Yuri Andropov and then the Communist Party Central Committee &apos;s Konstantin Chernenko , not only had one foot in the grave when they came to power , but were also completely unequipped to reform the Soviet Union . 
The huge loss of life in Afghanistan ( equal to the United States &quot; losses in Vietnam , but in a far shorter period of time ) already suggested to many that the Kremlin was becoming a danger to itself ; the attack on a civilian airliner seemed to confirm that emerging view . 
It was this realization that spurred Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s rise to power , as well as support among the leadership for Gorbachev &apos;s reformist policies of perestroika and glasnost . 
Of course , history is not destiny , but one can be sure that at least some in Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s entourage , if not Putin himself , have been thinking about Ogarkov &apos;s failure and its impact on the Soviet elite . 
After all , Kremlin leaders , Putin included , define themselves through what was , not what could be . 
Indeed , Putin &apos;s rationale for annexing Crimea closely resembles Brezhnev &apos;s reasoning for invading Afghanistan : to confound enemies seeking to surround the country . 
In 2004 , speaking to Russian veterans about the Afghan invasion , Putin explained that there were legitimate geopolitical reasons to protect the Soviet Central Asian border , just as in March he cited security concerns to justify his Ukrainian land grab . 
In the Brezhnev era , expansionist policies reflected the country &apos;s new energy-derived wealth . 
Putin &apos;s military build-up and modernization of the past decade was also fueled by energy exports . 
Moreover , Putin &apos;s incompetence extends far beyond the economy . 
His security forces remain brutal and unaccountable ; in some parts of the country , they have merged with criminal gangs . 
His managed judiciary provides no comfort to ordinary people ; and the country &apos;s military installations , submarines , oilrigs , mining shafts , hospitals , and retirement homes regularly blow up , collapse , or sink , owing to neglect and zero liability . 
When public support for Putin &apos;s annexation of Crimea wanes - as it will - his failings will shine more starkly in the light of the MH17 catastrophe . 
If the Russian state functioned well , Putin could continue to withstand pressure from opposition leaders . 
By making himself , in effect , the state , Putin , like the gerontocracy that collapsed with Gorbachev &apos;s rise , is increasingly viewed as responsible for all state failures . 
And though thoughtful Russians may be hostages to Putin &apos;s arrogance and blunders , the rest of the world is not . 
And Europe &apos;s last blinders about Putin seem to have fallen , with the result that serious sanctions are almost certain to be imposed . 
By overplaying its hand in Afghanistan and lying to the world about the downing of KAL 007 , the Soviet regime exposed and accelerated the rot that made its collapse inevitable . 
There is no reason to believe in a different fate for Putin &apos;s effort to re-establish Russia as an imperial power .
