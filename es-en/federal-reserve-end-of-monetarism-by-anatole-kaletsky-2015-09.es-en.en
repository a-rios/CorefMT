Why the Fed Buried Monetarism 
LONDON - The US Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to delay an increase in interest rates should have come as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to Fed Chair Janet Yellen &apos;s comments . 
The Fed &apos;s decision merely confirmed that it is not indifferent to international financial stress , and that its risk-management approach remains strongly biased in favor of &quot; lower for longer . &quot; 
So why did the markets and media behave as if the Fed &apos;s action ( or , more precisely , inaction ) was unexpected ? 
What really shocked the markets was not the Fed &apos;s decision to maintain zero interest rates for a few more months , but the statement that accompanied it . 
The Fed revealed that it was entirely unconcerned about the risks of higher inflation and was eager to push unemployment below what most economists regard as its &quot; natural &quot; rate of around 5 % . 
It is this relationship - between inflation and unemployment - that lies at the heart of all controversies about monetary policy and central banking . 
Friedman &apos;s theory asserted that inflation would automatically accelerate without limit once unemployment fell below a minimum safe level , which he described as the &quot; natural &quot; unemployment rate . 
In Friedman &apos;s original work , the natural unemployment rate was a purely theoretical conjecture , founded on an assumption described as &quot; rational expectations , &quot; even though it ran counter to any normal definition of rational behavior . 
The theory &apos;s publication at a time of worldwide alarm about double-digit inflation offered central bankers exactly the pretext they needed for desperately unpopular actions . 
By dramatically increasing interest rates to fight inflation , policymakers broke the power of organized labor , while avoiding blame for the mass unemployment that monetary austerity was bound to produce . 
A few years later , Friedman &apos;s &quot; natural &quot; rate was replaced with the less value-laden and more erudite-sounding &quot; non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment &quot; ( NAIRU ) . 
But the basic idea was always the same . 
A monetary policy aiming for sub-NAIRU unemployment must therefore be avoided at all costs . 
A more extreme version of the theory asserts that there is no lasting tradeoff between inflation and unemployment . 
All efforts to stimulate job creation or economic growth with easy money will merely boost price growth , offsetting any effect on unemployment . 
Monetary policy must therefore focus solely on hitting inflation targets , and central bankers should be exonerated of any blame for unemployment . 
The monetarist theory that justified narrowing central banks &quot; responsibilities to inflation targeting had very little empirical backing when Friedman proposed it . 
Since then , it has been refuted both by political experience and statistical testing . 
But , despite empirical refutation , the ideological attractiveness of monetarism , supported by the supposed authority of &quot; rational &quot; expectations , proved overwhelming . 
As a result , the purely inflation-oriented approach to monetary policy gained total dominance in both central banking and academic economics . 
That brings us back to recent financial events . 
The inflation-targeting models used by the Fed ( and other central banks and official institutions like the International Monetary Fund ) all assume the existence of some pre-determined limit to non-inflationary unemployment . 
The Fed &apos;s latest model estimates this NAIRU to be 4.9-5.2 % . 
And that is why so many economists and market participants were shocked by Yellen &apos;s apparent complacency . 
With US unemployment now at 5.1 % , standard monetary theory dictates that interest rates must be raised urgently . 
Otherwise , either a disastrous inflationary blowout will inevitably follow , or the body of economic theory that has dominated a generation of policy and academic thinking since Friedman &apos;s paper on &quot; rational &quot; expectations and &quot; natural &quot; unemployment will turn out to be completely wrong . 
What , then , should we conclude from the Fed &apos;s decision not to raise interest rates ? 
One possible conclusion is banal . 
Because the NAIRU is a purely theoretical construct , the Fed &apos;s economists can simply change their estimates of this magic number . 
In fact , the Fed has already cut its NAIRU estimate three times in the past two years . 
But there may be a deeper reason for the Fed &apos;s forbearance . 
To judge by Yellen &apos;s recent speeches , the Fed may no longer believe in any version of the &quot; natural &quot; unemployment rate . 
Friedman &apos;s assumptions of ever-accelerating inflation and irrationally &quot; rational &quot; expectations that lead to single-minded targeting of price stability remain embedded in official economic models like some Biblical creation myth . 
Instead , central bankers now seem to be implicitly ( and perhaps even unconsciously ) returning to pre-monetarist views : tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment are real and can last for many years . 
Monetary policy should gradually recalibrate the balance between these two economic indicators as the business cycle proceeds . 
When inflation is low , the top priority should be to reduce unemployment to the lowest possible level ; and there is no compelling reason for monetary policy to restrain job creation or GDP growth until excessive inflation becomes an imminent danger . 
This does not imply permanent near-zero US interest rates . 
The Fed will almost certainly start raising rates in December , but monetary tightening will be much slower than in previous economic cycles , and it will be motivated by concerns about financial stability , not inflation . 
As a result , fears - bordering on panic in some emerging markets - about the impact of Fed tightening on global economic conditions will probably prove unjustified . 
The bad news is that the vast majority of market analysts , still clinging to the old monetarist framework , will accuse the Fed of &quot; falling behind the curve &quot; by letting US unemployment decline too far and failing to anticipate the threat of rising inflation . 
The Fed should simply ignore such atavistic protests , as it rightly did last week .
