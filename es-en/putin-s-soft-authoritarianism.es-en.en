Putin \ u0027s Soft Authoritarianism 
A joke making rounds in Moscow nowadays goes like this : Americans didn &apos;t know who their President was two months after their last presidential election , but we Russians knew who was going to occupy the Kremlin two years before our recent election . 
Russia &apos;s political class has ample grounds to be slyly and cynically proud of the system they invented - it guarantees the result it wants . 
Despite its lack of drama , intrigue , and competitiveness , the election was important not because Russia &apos;s political class renounced all the key elements of authentic democratic electoral procedures , but because it closed the chapter on Russia &apos;s liberal democratic experiment , legitimizing Putin &apos;s new Russian political system . 
What is the nature of the new system ? 
Is it democracy with adjectives , such as &quot; managed &quot; democracy , &quot; illiberal &quot; democracy , or &quot; electoral &quot; democracy ? 
Only a few pundits stubbornly adhere to this approach . 
Or is the system simply that of a conniving authoritarian ? 
This view is already conventional wisdom , not only in America , but in Europe as well . 
In reality , however , Putin &apos;s regime is a strange and complicated mix , which relies upon two important elements : the personal power of Vladimir Putin himself and the growing role of Russia &apos;s consolidating democratic institutions . 
The tension between these two forces will drive Russia &apos;s political dynamics for the next four years . 
Complicating the picture further is the fact that Putin represents the most pro-Western force in Russia , while the state apparatus remains conservative , traditional , and archaic . 
So Russia &apos;s liberals and democrats face a harsh choice : do they support Putin &apos;s personal authoritarianism or seek to weaken and delegitimize him and thus restore the role of an ascendant bureaucracy ? 
How do the siloviki , the now notorious representatives of Russia &apos;s security and power structures , fit in this picture ? 
Everybody likes this myth of the siloviki , because it &apos;s so easy to explain Russian developments by ascribing events to a &quot; KGBization &quot; of power . 
They lack a leader , have no agenda , and failed to seize power during Putin &apos;s first term . 
I think they will fail again during Putin &apos;s second term . 
Indeed , in coming years , other forces have much greater potential to consolidate power , with the siloviki used only as their praetorian guards . 
So who is responsible for the fact that liberal democracy has ended in Russia ? 
Well , Putin , of course , and Yeltsin before him . 
Moreover , ordinary Russians are becoming allergic to liberal democracy , because liberal technocrats have consistently served as window dressing for an illiberal Kremlin regime . 
Having tied themselves to Russia &apos;s existing power structures , liberals are now in no position to become convincing critics . 
Indeed , Putin &apos;s soft authoritarianism is now probably the greatest threat to greater democratization in Russia . 
Paradoxically , because Putin &apos;s &quot; strong &quot; leadership incorporates liberals and even democrats so as to preserve a pro-Western façade , a truly liberal opposition cannot emerge . 
By contrast , a genuinely repressive iron hand would be far likelier to spur a more potent democratic resistance . 
Of course , Putin has concentrated so much authority and control over the levers of power in his own hands that he appears capable of anything . 
He &apos;s not yet a hostage of the bureaucracy , but he regularly loses major battles . 
So what will happen when Russia &apos;s political class and the President himself discover that &quot; bureaucratic authoritarianism &quot; is not the recipe for modernization à la South Korea that they hoped for ? 
What will they do when they realize that it has failed to secure sustainable economic growth and political stability ? 
Under the current soft authoritarian regime , I can see only one rather negative scenario for the future : authentic , full-fledged dictatorship . 
The question is whether it will be a Pinochet-style dictatorship bent on economic modernization , or a dictatorship with a revived totalitarian ideology ? 
By winning so decisively , Putin has legitimately made himself responsible for everything . 
There is no government below him to take the blame for failure , and failure is the easiest way to lose legitimacy . 
Failure , moreover , will likely bring with it a split in the political class , making it very difficult to find a single candidate to become Putin &apos;s successor . 
Not one political force in Russia knows how to answer the challenges that &quot; soft authoritarianism &quot; has brought . 
Russia has never made a successful transformation of any kind in a time of peace . 
Change comes through war and domestic conflict . 
For those who seek a democratic and liberal Russia , the quandary is awful , because to delegitimize Putin only risks bringing darker and more archaic powers to the surface .
