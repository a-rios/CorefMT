Does Iran &apos;s Parliamentary Election Matter ? 
TEHRAN - Does Iran &apos;s upcoming Parliamentary election on March 14 deserve to be taken seriously ? 
Paradoxically , Iranian elections are abnormal by both democratic and autocratic standards . 
While they are neither free nor fair , there are real differences among candidates , and the outcomes are often unpredictable . 
In contrast to rigged elections in which the victors are pre-determined , Iran &apos;s system allows competitive elections among pre-selected candidates . 
Hardly anyone predicted the reformist Mohammed Khatami &apos;s resounding presidential victory in 1997 , and even fewer foresaw hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad &apos;s victory in 2005 . 
For those who view Iran &apos;s democratic glass as being half full , the March 14 Majles elections will mark the 28th national election since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979 , further entrenching a political culture unique in the Middle East . 
As Iran scholar Mohsen Milani puts it , &quot; With all its serious flaws , it is through this process that changes in Iranian policy and behavior can be expected . &quot; 
But there are valid reasons to view Iran &apos;s democratic glass as being half empty . 
Candidates deemed insufficiently pious or lacking loyalty to the country &apos;s theocratic constitution cannot run . 
This year , hundreds of reformist candidates were disqualified . 
Even a grandson of Ayatollah Khomeini decided against running after he was initially disqualified and his religious values and political loyalties were called into question . What &apos;s more , the 290-seat Majles is a second-tier player in Iran &apos;s power structure . 
On the surface , it looks like any other parliament . 
Its members draft legislation , ratify international treaties , and sign off on the nation &apos;s annual budget . 
In theory , they even have the authority to remove cabinet ministers and impeach the president for misconduct . 
In practice , however , all of the Majles &apos;s decisions are subject to the approval of the Guardian Council , an unelected body of twelve jurists ( all of whom are either directly or indirectly appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei ) that has the constitutional authority to vet all electoral candidates and veto any parliamentary legislation . 
Ironically , in 2003 the reformist parliament passed legislation aimed at limiting the power of the Guardian Council , which predictably rejected it . 
Nonetheless , in a political system in which decisions are made by consensus , the Majles can play an important role in framing national debates . 
The reformist-dominated Majles that served from 2000-2004 comprised allies of Khatami who sought to expand the realm of acceptable political discourse , champion democracy and human rights , and advocate a more conciliatory approach to foreign policy . 
By contrast , the current parliament , elected following a massive purge of reformists , began its inaugural session with chants of &quot; Death to America . &quot; 
Its members share Ahmedinejad &apos;s social conservatism and aversion to diplomatic compromise on the nuclear issue . 
In the upcoming Majles elections , the battle between conservatives and reformists has largely been superseded by one between hardliners sympathetic to Ahmedinejad and more pragmatic conservatives less beholden to revolutionary ideology . The latter group is coalescing under the leadership of former chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani , Tehran mayor Mohammmed Bagher Ghalibaf , and former Revolutionary Guard commander Mohsen Rezaii . 
While these individuals were themselves considered hardliners three years ago , today , compared to Ahmedinejad , they appear moderate . 
The hardliners &quot; Achilles heel is Ahmedinejad &apos;s mismanagement of the economy . 
Heat shortages at the height of this year &apos;s bitter winter left more than 60 people dead , and Iran is perhaps the only major oil producer whose population claims that economic conditions have worsened despite a tripling of oil prices . 
This should help the more pragmatic conservatives . 
But elections in Iran are notoriously unpredictable for two reasons . 
First , it is difficult to gauge popular sentiment outside the capital . 
Though Tehran is Iran &apos;s political heart and soul , low turnout among disaffected urban voters has reduced its influence over the rest of the country . 
Ahmedinejad understands this , making frequent visits to the provinces with promises of economic handouts . 
Second , in a country that lacks organized political parties , the campaign role played by paramilitary and military organizations loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei could prove decisive . 
Their mass mobilization helped propel Ahmedinejad to victory in 2005 . 
A victory for the more pragmatic conservatives is unlikely to have a marked impact on Iranian foreign policy . 
However , it would be a welcome reprieve for Iranians and those in the international community concerned about Iran &apos;s seeming return to revolutionary radicalism . 
Though it might be premature to write Ahmedinejad &apos;s political obituary if his allies are defeated , a victory for them now would increase the likelihood of his reelection in June 2009 . 
For this reason alone , the upcoming election must be taken seriously .
