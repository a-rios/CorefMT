Risky Growth Engines 
WASHINGTON , DC - While the rich world puts its post-crisis house in order , developing countries as a whole are becoming the new engine of global growth . 
Increasingly , they are a force pulling the advanced economies forward . 
But switching locomotives is never free of risk . 
As my colleague Marcelo Giugale and I argue in our recent book The Day After Tomorrow , there are at least four tracks along which this switchover is taking place . 
First , public- and private-sector balance sheets in most emerging economies are relatively clean . 
While deleveraging is ongoing in advanced economies , many developing countries will be able to explore untapped investment opportunities - infrastructure bottlenecks being a glaring example . 
Second , there is a large inventory of technologies that the developing world is yet to acquire , adopt , and adapt . 
Thanks to breakthroughs in information and communication , transferring those technologies is becoming cheaper and safer . 
Furthermore , decreased transportation costs and the breakup of vertical production chains in many sectors are facilitating poorer countries &quot; integration into the global economy . 
Third , a flipside of the emergence of new middle classes in many emerging markets is that domestic absorption ( consumption and investment ) in developing countries as a whole may rise relative to their own production potential . 
Provided that South-South trade linkages are reinforced , one might see a new round of successful export-led growth in smaller countries . 
Finally , resource-intensive developing countries may benefit from strong projected relative demand for commodities in the medium term . 
As long as appropriate governance and revenue-administration mechanisms are put in place - particularly to avoid rent-seeking behavior - natural-resource availability may turn out to be a blessing rather than a curse for these countries . 
Most developing countries were already moving along these four tracks before the global financial crisis , owing largely to improvements in their economic policies during the previous decade . 
Given that these policies enabled these countries to respond well to shocks coming from the crisis epicenter , there are strong incentives to keep them in place . 
There is , however , a major threat to a smooth transition to new sources of global growth : the possibility of overshooting in the inevitable asset-price adjustment accompanying the shift in relative growth prospects and perceptions of risks . 
Indeed , because the creation of new assets in developing countries will be slower than the increase in demand for them , the price of existing assets in those markets - equities , bonds , real estate , human capital - are likely to overshoot their long-term equilibrium value . 
Recent history is full of examples of the negative side-effects that can arise . 
Each and every one of the recent booms and busts - in Latin America , Asia , and Russia in the 1990 &quot; s , and in Eastern Europe , Southern Europe , and Ireland more recently - shared some combination of unsustainably low financial costs , asset bubbles , over-indebtedness , wage growth unwarranted by productivity gains , and domestic absorption in excess of production . 
In every case , these imbalances were fueled by easily identifiable periods of euphoria and sudden asset-prices increases . 
True , external factors , such as foreign liquidity , were conducive - or at least permissive - to such periods of euphoria . 
Twin current-account and fiscal deficits ( and / or currency and debt-maturity mismatches ) were the rule . 
But our point is that powerful forces that drive up asset prices may be unleashed even without massive liquidity inflows . 
The scramble for available assets and a dangerous euphoria may occur through purely domestic mechanisms . 
So what should developing countries do , aside from maintaining sound macroeconomic policies , curbing excessive domestic financial leverage , and attempting to isolate themselves from volatile capital inflows ? 
The most important task is to facilitate and strengthen the creation of new assets , and there is much that developing countries can do in this regard . 
They can take advantage of the current bonanza in available capital to build contestability , transparency , and institutional quality around markets in which greenfield investments can be implemented . 
They can ensure that the rules they have in place are consistent and favorable to funding investment projects with long maturities . 
And they can invest in their own capacity for project selection and design . 
These and other internal reforms would serve to moderate the furious rise in the price of developing-country assets . 
For that reason , they also constitute the best way to ensure that the next locomotives of global growth - and all the economies that are pulled by them - remain on the rails .
