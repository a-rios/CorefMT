The Rise of the Robots 
LONDON - What impact will automation - the so-called &quot; rise of the robots &quot; - have on wages and employment over the coming decades ? 
Nowadays , this question crops up whenever unemployment rises . 
In the early nineteenth century , David Ricardo considered the possibility that machines would replace labor ; 
Around the same time , the Luddites smashed the textile machinery that they saw as taking their jobs . 
Then the fear of machines died away . 
New jobs - at higher wages , in easier conditions , and for more people - were soon created and readily found . 
But that does not mean that the initial fear was wrong . 
On the contrary , it must be right in the very long run : sooner or later , we will run out of jobs . 
For some countries , this long-run prospect might be uncomfortably close . 
So , what are people to do if machines can do all ( or most of ) their work ? 
Recently , automation in manufacturing has expanded even to areas where labor has been relatively cheap . 
In 2011 , Chinese companies spent Â¥ 8 billion ( $ 1.3 billion ) on industrial robots . 
Foxconn , which build iPads for Apple , hopes to have their first fully automated plant in operation sometime in the next 5-10 years . 
Now the substitution of capital for labor is moving beyond manufacturing . 
The most mundane example is one you will see in every supermarket : checkout staff replaced by a single employee monitoring a bank of self-service machines . 
( Though perhaps this is not automation proper - the supermarket has just shifted some of the work of shopping onto the customer . ) 
For those who dread the threat that automation poses to low-skilled labor , a ready answer is to train people for better jobs . 
But technological progress is now eating up the better jobs , too . 
A wide range of jobs that we now think of as skilled , secure , and irreducibly human may be the next casualties of technological change . 
As a recent article in the Financial Times points out , in two areas notoriously immune to productivity increases , education and health care , technology is already reducing the demand for skilled labor . 
Translation , data analysis , legal research - a whole range of high-skilled jobs may wither away . 
Optimists airily assert that &quot; many new types of job will be created . &quot; 
They ask us to think of the lead drivers of multi-car road trains ( once our electric cars join up &quot; convoy-style &quot; ) , big data analysts , or robot mechanics . 
That does not sound like too many new jobs to me . 
Imagine a handful of technicians replacing a fleet of taxi drivers and truckers , a small cadre of human mechanics maintaining a full robot workforce , or a single data analyst and his software replacing a bank of quantitative researchers . 
What produces value in such an economy will no longer be wage labor . 
We can see hints of that future now . 
Twitter , the social-media giant , is an employment minnow . 
It is valued at $ 9 billion , but employs just 400 people worldwide - about as many as a medium-size carpet factory in Kidderminster . 
It is not true that automation has caused the rise of unemployment since 2008 . 
What is noticeable , though , is that structural unemployment - the unemployment that remains even after economies have recovered - has been on an upward trend over the last 25 years . 
We are finding it increasingly difficult to keep unemployment down . 
Indeed , the days when we in Britain thought it was normal to have an unemployment rate of 2 % have long since passed . 
It was considered a great achievement of the last government that it brought unemployment down to 5 % at the height of an unsustainable boom . 
And it only succeeded in doing so by subsidizing a lot of unnecessary jobs and useless training schemes . 
No doubt some of the claims made for robots replacing human labor will prove as far-fetched now as they have in the past . 
But it is hard to resist the conclusion that &quot; technological unemployment , &quot; as John Maynard Keynes called it , will continue to rise , as more and more people become redundant . 
The optimist may reply that the pessimist &apos;s imagination is too weak to envisage the full range of wonderful new job possibilities that automation is opening up . 
But perhaps the optimist &apos;s imagination is too weak to imagine a different trajectory - toward a world in which people enjoy the fruits of automation as leisure rather than as additional income . 
During the Industrial Revolution , working hours increased by 20 % as factories replaced feasting . 
With our post-machine standard of living , we can afford to shed some of the Puritan guilt that has , for centuries , kept our noses to the grindstone . 
Today we find a great deal of work-sharing in poor countries . 
Economists call it &quot; disguised unemployment . &quot; 
If escape from poverty is the goal , disguised unemployment is a bad thing . 
But if machines have already engineered the escape from poverty , then work-sharing is a sensible way of &quot; spreading the work &quot; that still has to be done by human labor . 
If one machine can cut necessary human labor by half , why make half of the workforce redundant , rather than employing the same number for half the time ? 
Why not take advantage of automation to reduce the average working week from 40 hours to 30 , and then to 20 , and then to ten , with each diminishing block of labor time counting as a full time job ? 
This would be possible if the gains from automation were not mostly seized by the rich and powerful , but were distributed fairly instead . 
Rather than try to repel the advance of the machine , which is all that the Luddites could imagine , we should prepare for a future of more leisure , which automation makes possible . 
But , to do that , we first need a revolution in social thinking .
