The EU vs. Democracy 
ROME - One of the ways in which the European Union effectively asserts the fundamental values of democracy and the rule of law is through its External Cooperation Programs , whereby , on the invitation of local authorities , it provides support in the form of electoral assistance projects and election observation missions . 
So , during the course of 2009 , the EU sent election observation missions to various countries , including Mozambique , Afghanistan , Guinea Bissau , Lebanon , Malawi , and Bolivia . 
Just this month the European Parliament sent observers to Ukraine &apos;s presidential election . 
At the end of each mission , a couple of days after the election , the Head of Mission , who is normally a member of the European Parliament , first issues a preliminary report on the election and on the handling of the electoral process , followed by a final report a few months later . 
On December 6 last year , Evo Morales was re-elected President of Bolivia with more than 60 % of the popular vote . 
In her preliminary statement , the EU Head of Mission , MEP Renate Weber , stated that the electoral process had , in general terms , adhered to international standards with respect to democratic elections , and that the Bolivian Electoral Commission had acted in a transparent , neutral , and efficient way . 
But the preliminary report also included some criticism that irked the Bolivian administration . 
In particular , the report stated that the country &apos;s sharp political polarization was highly visible in the media , in particular on Bolivian television stations . 
In fact , while opposition candidates were given fair exposure on private TV and radio , the EU Head of Mission observed various cases in which their state-controlled counterparts privileged the government &apos;s parliamentary candidates . 
For example , Bolivia TV devoted 62.7 % of its news bulletins to the government party &apos;s candidates , whereas the seven opposition parties combined mustered only a 37.2 % share . This , according to Weber , amounted to an &quot; abuse of institutional propaganda . &quot; 
I believe that it is important that the EU carries out such monitoring in non-EU states . But what about elections in EU member states ? 
Shouldn &apos;t what is good for the goose also be good for the gander ? 
I have in mind the two countries of which I am a citizen ( Italy and Malta ) , where the media situation is an absolute disaster . 
More or less everybody is acquainted with the situation in Italy , where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi not only owns the three major private TV stations , but , as the head of government , also &quot; manages &quot; indirectly at least two of the three state-owned TV channels . 
Media manipulation has become the order of the day in Italy , but , unfortunately , the EU , behaving on the premise that it will not interfere in internal matters , refuses to say a word about any of this . 
The situation is even worse in the smallest EU member country , Malta . There , the only two political parties represented in parliament since independence in 1964 have ganged up to ensure for themselves an oligarchic duopoly on anything that goes on in the country . 
The political leaders of the Nationalist ( Christian Democratic ) Party and the Labor Party have enacted a law whereby , since 1994 , they alone share more than â‚¬ 200,000 state financing . 
Not content with this , the two parties passed a law in 1992 that gave each of them - and no other parties - a national TV station . 
Getting greedier by the day , they then decided to share on a 50-50 basis both the National Electoral Commission and the National Broadcasting Authority . 
Nor have they shrunk from constitutional tinkering in order to lock in their power . 
Indeed , they have changed the constitution three times since 1987 to ensure that every vote for the Nationalist Party and the Labor Party is given a higher weighting than votes received by any of the country &apos;s other political parties when it comes to translating votes into parliamentary seats . 
All of this is happening not in some remote country , far removed from civilization . 
It is happening in an EU member state . 
When will the EU intervene to stop this internal rot ?
