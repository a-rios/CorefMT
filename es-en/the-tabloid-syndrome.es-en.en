The Tabloid Syndrome 
The world is a complex and intricate place . 
So how are we to understand even just a piece of it , say , the United States government and its economic policies ? 
It is a big problem , for the standard sources that I was taught as a child to rely upon - newspapers and television news - are breaking down . 
For example , in early February 2004 , the then Chairman of the President &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers , N. Gregory Mankiw , spent some time trying to explain the issues surrounding &quot; outsourcing &quot; to America &apos;s elite political news reporters . 
Mankiw &apos;s standard description of outsourcing is very much like mine - indeed , like that of all neoclassical and neoliberal economists - and goes something like this : 
As with any change in technology that increases the volume of international trade in goods and services , the outsourcing of service-sector jobs creates winners and losers - but almost surely more and bigger winners than losers . 
Big winners are workers in poor countries who get better jobs working for firms that can now export services to rich countries . 
The major losers are those who previously held the now-outsourced service-sector jobs ; they must now find new and different jobs and almost surely find that their skills are worth less . 
But even in the US , losers &quot; losses are outweighed by winners &quot; gains . 
Workers in certain industries find their skills in higher demand as foreigners spend their increased dollar earnings , consumers benefit from lower prices , and shareholders and managers see their companies &quot; profits increase . 
However much we may worry about the distributional consequences of outsourcing , we should never overlook the fact that it increases the total size of the economic pie . 
Mankiw made that argument , but he failed to be understood . 
Indeed , on February 10 , 2004 , he woke up to an unpleasant news story in the Washington Post : &quot; President Bush &apos;s top economist yesterday said the outsourcing of US service jobs to workers overseas is good for the nation &apos;s economy .... 
It happened again on February 11 : &quot; Democrats ... lit into President Bush &apos;s chief economist yesterday for his laudatory statements on the movement of U.S. jobs abroad .... 
Of course , the Washington Post &apos;s journalists know , on some level , that they were being unfair to Mankiw . 
They didn &apos;t claim that what he said was inaccurate , or shortsighted , or analytically unsound . 
The descriptive terms they used - &quot; discordant , &quot; &quot; embarrassing , &quot; &quot; political liability &quot; - suggest that they knew they were giving Mankiw a raw deal . 
But was there any sign of the standard economic analysis of outsourcing in their stories ? 
Not one . 
Greg Mankiw thought a bunch of reporters were coming to talk to him about the state of the economy and the analysis made by the Council of Economic Advisers in its &quot; 2004 Economic Report of the President . &quot; 
But the last thing the reporters wanted to do was to convey a thumbnail summary of Mankiw &apos;s analysis of outsourcing . 
That &apos;s simply not the business they saw themselves as being in . 
The problem is not that the Washington Post and papers like it hire people who are unintelligent or lazy . 
The problem is that conveying accurate information about the economy is far down the list of priorities for normal news reporters . 
Making a splash matters . 
So does pleasing your editors so that they &apos;ll give your stories better placement , and pleasing your sources so that they &apos;ll keep talking to you . 
Compared to these imperatives , there is little to be gained from informing the public about how the economy really functions and about the dilemmas of economic policy . 
Indeed , the economy is vastly inferior to Hollywood as a source of glitterati gossip , but much economic reporting makes the coverage of the birth of Brad Pitt &apos;s and Angelina Jolie &apos;s baby look profoundly serious . 
Likewise , government is vastly inferior to the World Cup as a sporting spectacle , but much political reporting focuses on who played well and who played badly . 
What can we do about this ? 
The answer is simple , and it is a matter of demand , not supply . 
After all , few people go into journalism to deliberately mislead the public . 
If we demand better economic and political journalism the way we demand excellent coverage of the World Cup , we &apos;ll get it .
