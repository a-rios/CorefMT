Last Exit from Kabul ? 
NEW DELHI - America &apos;s war in Afghanistan is approaching a tipping point , with doubts about President Barack Obama &apos;s strategy growing . 
Yet , after dispatching 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan , Obama is considering sending another 14,000 . 
Let &apos;s be clear : America &apos;s Afghan war is not winnable , even though Obama has redefined American goals from defeating the Taliban to preventing Al Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base to launch attacks on the United States . 
But Al Qaeda is no longer a serious factor in the Afghan war , where the principal combatants are now the American military and the Taliban , with its associated militias and private armies . 
Rather than seeking to defeat the Taliban , the US has encouraged the Pakistani , Afghan , and Saudi intelligence services to hold proxy negotiations with the Taliban &apos;s top leadership , holed up in the Pakistani city of Quetta . 
The US is fighting the wrong war . 
After America &apos;s invasion drove Al Qaeda &apos;s leaders from Afghanistan , Pakistan emerged as the main base and sanctuary for transnational terrorists . 
Support and sustenance for the Taliban and many other Afghan militants also comes from inside Pakistan . 
Despite this , Obama is pursuing a military surge in Afghanistan but an aid surge to Pakistan , which is now the single largest recipient of US assistance in the world . 
To defeat Al Qaeda , the US doesn &apos;t need a troop buildup - certainly not in Afghanistan . 
Without a large ground force in Afghanistan or even major ground operations , the US can hold Al Qaeda &apos;s remnants at bay in their havens in the mountainous tribal regions of Pakistan through covert operations , Predator drones , and cruise-missile attacks . 
And isn &apos;t that what the CIA is doing already ? 
Indeed , US intelligence experts believe that Al Qaeda already is badly fragmented and in no position to openly challenge American interests . 
According to the latest Annual Threat Assessment of the Intelligence Community released last February , &quot; Because of the pressure we and our allies have put on Al Qaeda &apos;s core leadership in Pakistan ... Al Qaeda today is less capable and effective than it was a year ago . &quot; 
Had Obama &apos;s goal been to rout the Taliban , a further military surge may have made sense , because a resurgent Taliban can be defeated only through major ground operations , not by airstrikes and covert action alone . 
In reality , what the Obama administration calls a &quot; clear , hold , build &quot; strategy is actually a &quot; surge , bribe , run &quot; strategy - except that the muddled nature of the mission and deepening US involvement undermine the &quot; run &quot; component . 
Before Afghanistan becomes a Vietnam-style quagmire , Obama must rethink his plan for another troop surge . 
Gradually drawing down US troop levels makes more sense , because what unites the disparate elements of the Taliban syndicate is a common opposition to foreign military presence . 
On the contrary , it would remove the Taliban &apos;s unifying element and unleash developments - a vicious power struggle in Afghanistan along sectarian and ethnic lines - whose significance would be largely internal or regional . 
The Taliban , with the active support of the Pakistani military , would certainly make a run for Kabul to replay the 1996 power grab . 
Moreover , the non-Taliban and non-Pashtun forces are now stronger , more organized , and better prepared than in 1996 to resist any advance on Kabul , having been empowered by provincial autonomy or by the offices they still hold in the Afghan federal government . 
After all , it was American air power , combined with the Northern Alliance &apos;s ground operations , which ousted the Taliban in 2001 . 
In fact , the most likely outcome of any Afghan power struggle triggered by an American withdrawal would be to formalize the present de facto partition of Afghanistan along ethnic lines - the direction in which Iraq , too , is headed . 
In this scenario , the Tajiks , Uzbeks , Hazaras , and other ethnic minorities would be able to ensure self-governance in the Afghan areas that they dominate , leaving the Pashtun lands on both sides of the British-drawn Durand Line in ferment . 
Thanks to ethnic polarization , the Durand Line , or the Afghanistan-Pakistan border , exists today only on maps . 
On the ground , it has little political and economic relevance , and it would be militarily impracticable to re-impose the line . 
As in Iraq , an American withdrawal would potentially unleash forces of Balkanization . 
An American pullout actually would aid the fight against international terrorism . 
Instead of remaining bogged down in Afghanistan and seeking to cajole and bribe the Pakistani military into ending their support for Islamic militants , the US would become free to pursue a broader , more balanced counterterrorism strategy . 
For example , the US would better appreciate the dangers to international security posed by Pakistani terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed . 
The threat of an Islamist takeover of Pakistan comes not from the Taliban , but from groups that have long drawn support from the Pakistani army as part of a long-standing military-mullah alliance . 
That is where the focus of the fight should be .
