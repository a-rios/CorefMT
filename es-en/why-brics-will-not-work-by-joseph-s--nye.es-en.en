BRICS Without Mortar 
CAMBRIDGE - Last month , China &apos;s new president , Xi Jinping , chose Moscow for his first foreign visit . 
He and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a number of agreements and then traveled to Durban , South Africa , for the fifth &quot; BRICS &quot; summit , where they joined with the leaders of India , Brazil , and South Africa to announce the creation of a new development bank that could challenge the dominance of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 
The five leaders &quot; speeches referred to a shifting world order , and Xi said &quot; the potential of BRICS development is infinite . &quot; 
It looked as if the BRICS had finally come of age . 
Three years ago , I was skeptical about the BRICS . 
And , despite the recent summit &apos;s apparent success , I still am . 
Nearly 12 years ago , Jim O &apos;Neill , then the chief economist for Goldman Sachs , coined the term &quot; BRIC &quot; to describe the &quot; emerging markets &quot; of Brazil , Russia , India , and China . 
From 2000 to 2008 , these four countries &quot; share of global output rose rapidly , from 16 % to 22 % ( in purchasing power parity terms ) , and their economies performed better than average in the subsequent global recession . 
For investors , that outcome justified the creation of the catchy acronym . 
But then a strange thing happened : the investors &quot; creature came to life . 
In 2009 , the four countries met for the first time in Russia in an effort to forge an international political organization . 
South Africa joined the bloc in late 2010 primarily for political reasons . 
As O &apos;Neill recently told China Daily , &quot; South Africa is quite fortunate enough to be in the group , as , economically , it is rather small compared to the others . &quot; 
Moreover , its economic performance has been relatively sluggish , with a growth rate of just 2.3 % last year . 
Indeed , while the BRICS may be helpful in coordinating certain diplomatic tactics , the term lumps together highly disparate countries . 
Not only is South Africa miniscule compared to the others , but China &apos;s economy is larger than those of all of the other members combined . 
Likewise , India , Brazil , and South Africa are democracies , and occasionally meet in an alternative forum that they call &quot; IBSA . &quot; 
And , while the large autocracies , Russia and China , find it diplomatically advantageous to tweak the Americans , both have different but crucial relationships with the United States . 
And both have worked to thwart efforts by India , Brazil , and South Africa to become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council . 
As I wrote three years ago , in analytical terms , it makes little sense to include Russia , a former superpower , with the developing economies . 
Russia lacks diversified exports , faces severe demographic and health problems , and , in former President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s words , &quot; greatly needs modernization . &quot; 
Little has changed since Putin returned to the presidency last year . 
While economic growth benefited from the dramatic growth in oil and gas prices during the last decade , other competitive industries have yet to emerge , and the country now faces the prospect of declining energy prices . 
While it aims to maintain 5 % annual growth , its economy was relatively flat last year . 
If Russia &apos;s power resources seem to be declining , Brazil &apos;s appear to be more impressive , given it has a territory nearly three times the size of India &apos;s , a 90 % literacy rate , and triple the per capita income of India ( and nearly twice that of China ) . 
But , in the three years since my earlier assessment , Brazil &apos;s performance has slipped : annual economic growth has slowed from 7.5 % in 2010 to 1 % last year , with a 3.5 % rate expected in 2013 . 
Like Brazil , India experienced a spurt of output growth after liberalizing its economy in the 1990 &quot; s ; indeed , until a few years ago , GDP growth was approaching Chinese-style rates . 
This year , however , output is expected to rise by a relatively sluggish 5.9 % . 
Unless it improves its infrastructure and literacy rate ( particularly for women ) , India is unlikely to catch up with China . 
So , should we take today &apos;s BRICS more seriously than the BRICs of three years ago ? 
Tellingly , the meeting in Durban failed to produce any details of the structure of the proposed new development bank , suggesting that little progress had been made in the year since the BRICS &quot; last meeting in New Delhi , where the plan was announced . 
In fact , despite a commitment to launch &quot; formal negotiations &quot; to establish the bank , disagreements about the size and shares of the bank &apos;s capital have not been resolved . 
That lack of unity is symptomatic of the BRICS members &quot; underlying incompatibilities . 
In political terms , China , India , and Russia are vying with each other for power in Asia . 
And , in economic terms , Brazil , India , and South Africa are concerned about the effects of China &apos;s undervalued currency on their economies . 
Three years ago , I wrote that , &quot; BRIC is not likely to become a serious political organization of like-minded states . &quot; 
The BRICS &quot; most recent meeting has given me no reason to revise that assessment .
