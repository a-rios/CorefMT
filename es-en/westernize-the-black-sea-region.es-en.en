Westernize the Black Sea Region 
The bloody end to the schoolhouse hostage crisis in North Ossetia , and recent clashes in Georgia between government troops and separatist forces , have put the troubled Black Sea region on the front pages of newspapers once again . 
This rising violence is also a wake-up call for the West , highlighting the need for a new Euro-Atlantic strategy in a vitally important region that lies at the crossroads of Europe , Eurasia , and the Middle East . 
Indeed , the Black Sea region is the Euro-Atlantic community &apos;s eastern frontier with the wider Middle East . 
With Afghanistan , Iraq , and Iran topping the list of strategic challenges facing the West , anchoring democracy and security in these new borderlands of the Euro-Atlantic community has become imperative for both the United States and the EU . 
Moreover , success here can provide lessons in how to facilitate the daunting process of reform and modernization in the wider Middle East . 
Georgia &apos;s &quot; Rose Revolution &quot; last winter demonstrated that the will to implement radical reform now exists . 
For the first time , a country in the region is matching its aspirations with the concrete steps needed to become a viable candidate for eventual membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions . 
A visitor to Georgia &apos;s capital , Tbilisi , now sees the same level of determination to join the West that existed a decade ago in the Baltic states . 
America and Europe share an interest in the success of these efforts , particularly as they seek to diversify energy supplies away from Saudi Arabian and Persian Gulf oil . 
The Black Sea is poised to become a key conduit for non-OPEC , non-Gulf oil and natural gas flowing into European markets and beyond . 
The Black Sea region &apos;s long-term stability and integration with the West is thus critically important to the long-term energy security strategy of EU and NATO members . 
Anchoring these countries to the West will not be easy . 
Whether the end result is better relations or full integration of these countries into the EU and NATO is an open question . 
What should a new bold yet realistic EU and NATO outreach strategy for the Black Sea region look like ? 
Clearly , the region &apos;s countries are weaker and further behind previous candidates for Western integration . 
If the EU and NATO decide to launch a bold outreach strategy for the region , they will be able to draw on existing tools , conceptual talent , and practical experience . 
For example , NATO already has three members - Bulgaria , Romania , and Turkey - bordering the Black Sea . 
As for the EU , the candidacies of Romania and Bulgaria need to be concluded successfully , together with the issue of Turkey &apos;s membership aspirations . 
An EU that includes Sofia and Bucharest , and that is on track with Ankara , will be well positioned to engage the wider region . 
The EU also needs to put meat on the bones of its new Neighborhood Policy , while NATO must apply new mechanisms for strengthening ties with the region . 
As opposed to a 100- or 200-meter sprint , both organizations need to think more in terms of a much longer race , perhaps a marathon . 
If countries in the region embrace the idea , a network of current EU and NATO members could step forward with projects and assistance aimed at promoting a Black Sea identity and community . 
Recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region &apos;s &quot; frozen conflicts &quot; - i.e. , those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , of Transdneistria in Moldova , and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority . 
In reality , these conflicts are not frozen ; they are festering wounds that breed corruption and organized crime . 
They inhibit democratization and incite instability . 
While these conflicts involve historical grievances , outside actors - particularly Russia - contribute to their lack of resolution , which is essential for successful reform . 
So far , neither America nor Europe has made these conflicts a top priority . 
Resolving these semi-dormant wars requires stepped-up political involvement , economic engagement , and a willingness to provide Western peacekeeping forces and monitors if and when they are needed . 
But the long-term peace and stability needed to advance economic and political reform in the region will also require either a change in Russian behavior or a reduction in Russian influence . 
The experience of the last decade suggests that a policy of engaging the Kremlin intensely while protecting fundamental Western interests may be the best way to proceed . 
Developing a new Euro-Atlantic strategy for the Black Sea region must start with the democracies of North America and Europe recognizing their moral and political stake in the outcome . 
Projecting stability and security in these countries is the next logical step in building a Europe &quot; whole and free &quot; and securing the Euro-Atlantic community &apos;s eastern frontier with the Middle East . 
This task will be as important over the next decade as integrating Central and Eastern Europe into the West was in the 1990 &apos;s .
