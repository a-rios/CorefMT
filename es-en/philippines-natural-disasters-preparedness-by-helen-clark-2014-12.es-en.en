Disaster and Development 
NEW YORK - When Typhoon Hagupit made landfall in the Philippines on December 6 , memories of Typhoon Haiyan , which killed more than 6,300 people , were fresh in people &apos;s minds . 
Some 227,000 families - more than a million people - were evacuated ahead of Hagupit &apos;s arrival , according to the United Nations . 
The typhoon , one of the strongest of the season , killed some 30 people . 
All deaths from disasters are a tragedy , but the fact that this number was not much higher attests to the efforts that the Philippines has made to prepare for natural disasters . 
As Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , I have seen firsthand the devastation and heartbreak caused by disasters around the world . 
Since the beginning of the century , more than a million people have died in storms like Hagupit and other major disasters , such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake , with economic damage totaling nearly $ 2 trillion . 
These losses are tragic , but they are also avoidable . 
The argument for investing in disaster preparedness is simple . 
If countries expect to experience natural hazards , such as violent storm seasons or major earthquakes , then investing time and resources in preparing for shocks will save lives and protect communities from other losses . 
Unfortunately , governments often put different priorities ahead of disaster preparation . 
Other investments often take precedence , and donors have historically funded emergency relief much more readily than pre-disaster preparedness . 
The measures that are implemented tend to be stand-alone and piecemeal , rather than part of a larger , systematic risk-reduction plan . 
That needs to change . 
Countries like the Philippines continue to demonstrate the benefits of investing in preparedness , especially when done as part of a larger risk-mitigation effort . 
The Philippine government &apos;s quick , effective response saved many lives . 
But it is important to note that its efforts were not simply an overnight reaction to the oncoming storm . 
Officials were wise to acknowledge their country &apos;s vulnerabilities and to commit the resources and capital needed to build resilience . 
The Philippines includes preparedness as a core component in its overall strategy for reducing disaster risk . 
Over the last decade , the country &apos;s authorities have raised awareness , established and strengthened disaster-management institutions , and worked on recovering from past disasters , including Typhoon Haiyan . 
National and local disaster plans have been improved , standard operating procedures have been developed , and early warning systems have been put in place . 
The end result has been nothing short of a transformation of how the Philippines reacts to disasters . 
The UNDP , and the wider UN system , is supporting governments as they place greater emphasis on disaster-risk reduction , including preparedness , by strengthening their institutional capacity to plan and act when needed . 
In addition to assisting with emergency relief , it is crucial that the international community help to introduce basic procedures for responding long before disaster strikes . 
First responders , for example , need training and tools . 
Emergency shelters and evacuation routes must be planned and established using risk assessments and actual simulations . 
If communities are to be expected to make use of available resources , they need to be involved in the design and development of emergency plans . 
Risk reduction , including preparedness , is also , first and foremost , rooted in responsive governance . 
In March 2015 a new global framework for disaster reduction will be agreed in Sendai , Japan . 
It is crucial that delegates push for transformational change that enables preparedness and saves lives . 
Furthermore , risk reduction needs to be integral to sustainable-development strategies . 
The Philippines can serve as an example . 
The archipelago will always be in the path of tropical storms . 
But what they can do - and have done - is emphasize risk reduction and strengthen preparedness , thereby saving lives and building greater resilience . 
That is a lesson that all of us must learn .
