A Window of Opportunity for European Defense 
MADRID - With budgets exceptionally tight in Europe nowadays , worries about European defense have been growing . 
Paradoxically , however , developments in 2010 offer hope for the future . 
The defense agreement signed in November by France and the United Kingdom is composed of two treaties , which cover joint deployment of their armed forces , nuclear deterrence , and improved equipment and communications . 
This initiative has the firm political backing of both countries &quot; leaders , and expresses a clear determination to unite against common threats . 
Implemented correctly , these treaties could become a hopeful precedent for the entire European Union . 
By transcending strictly national limits , these treaties chart the future path of European defense and will help determine the course of Europe &apos;s relations with the United States and NATO . 
To better judge the treaties &quot; worth , we must remember the context in which they were conceived . 
In 1998 , the Saint Malo Declaration by French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair indicated both countries &quot; determination to reinforce the EU &apos;s security and defense capabilities . 
Originally reluctant to accept a Europe with autonomous military capacity , the United Kingdom had learned from the intervention in Kosovo that the EU must be able to respond to crises rapidly and efficiently . 
The Saint Malo Declaration signaled that the EU &apos;s leading military powers were prepared to develop their own defense policy , though one not fully autonomous of NATO . 
Indeed , through the Berlin Plus agreements , which facilitate use of NATO resources for missions undertaken under the European Defense and Security Policy ( ESDP ) , NATO recognized the ESDP &apos;s maturation over the past decade . 
Indeed , the EU has undertaken 24 missions in Europe , Africa , and Asia , differing in nature , scope , and aims , and combining military and civilian means . 
Today , the EU is being asked to conduct complex missions in adverse circumstances . 
In doing so , Europe must draw on the lessons of its past successes . 
We Europeans need to respond favorably , quickly , and effectively . 
Defense missions must be more adaptable , prompt , multinational , and multi-instrumental . 
They must be focused on stability and security , regardless of the security situation or the nature of the conflict . 
Yet it is clear that European defense is now struggling mightily with public financing . 
Moreover , the latest Eurobarometer poll shows that defense is the last thing that Europeans are worried about . 
It is precisely here that the Franco-British agreement becomes vitally important . 
The treaties mark an attempt to balance action and ambition in a context of economic crisis , fiscal consolidation , large-scale defense transformations , increasing interdependencies , and global threats - from terrorism and nuclear proliferation to climate change , resource scarcity , and epidemics - that are impossible to tackle unilaterally . 
It also sets a precedent for the UK , preparing the way for future prime ministers to make advances in this direction . 
Reinforcing both countries &quot; military capacities indirectly reinforces those of the EU . 
The quest for synergies and efficiency that is implied by the agreement could well become a driving force for the European Defense Agency . 
The British may now consider the EDA a defense expenditure , but , when better defined , it could represent a source of savings for every EU country . 
Moreover , the agreements foresee cooperation on cyber-security , terrorism , satellite communications , and maritime security , which are also key elements of the Lisbon Treaty . 
Likewise , the joint expeditionary forces established under the treaties could lead to the eventual creation of a wider structure , as they already contemplate &quot; bilateral cooperation with NATO , the European Union , the United Nations , or other operations . &quot; 
Solidarity and agreement on political objectives are the pressing concerns of our age . 
The new pact between France and the UK could be a historic step toward rationalizing defense spending rather than toward demilitarizing Europe . 
It all depends on the path chosen . 
In times of financial crisis , EU member states are unlikely to increase defense spending . 
By forcing greater efficiency and collaboration , misfortune can yield benefit . 
This path can also ease US concerns about lower European defense spending . 
The Franco-British treaties do not address commitments to NATO , a key US interest , because any reduction in the number of European troops deployed abroad inevitably implies a greater economic burden for the US . 
The Franco-British agreement does , however , imply progress toward joint European military action , both in Europe and on the international scene , which will encourage the US . 
All of this is part of the transatlantic community &apos;s continuing transformation from a set of organizations designed to defend territory against a known aggressor to something more flexible and dynamic . 
Establishing joint management and overhauling conventional defense capacities will be a two-pronged challenge : functional , owing to the traditional schema of defense organizations , and political , inasmuch as a cession of state sovereignty will be required . 
Another , equally important challenge is cooperation between NATO and Russia , which agreed at NATO &apos;s Lisbon summit in November to collaborate on the Alliance &apos;s anti-missile defenses . 
This relationship must be based on cooperation that benefits both sides , and that respects certain common principals of governance and non-interference . 
Here , the EU can exercise leadership , for this is a political process that has only just begun . 
As British Prime Minister David Cameron said of the agreement with France : &quot; This is the beginning of something new , not an end in itself &quot; - words that echo those of Jean Monet , one of the Union &apos;s founding fathers , on cooperation in the West . 
The Franco-British agreement in 2010 was one hopeful sign for 2011 and beyond : a step along the arduous but necessary path toward greater European security .
