The Anatomy of Sarkozy 
A majority of the French say that they want Finance Minister Nicholas Sarkozy to play an important role in shaping the country &apos;s future . 
No Frenchman wants that more than the ambitious &quot; Sarko &quot; himself . 
So Sarkozy will step down as finance minister next month to take the reigns of the ruling conservative party ( UMP ) , washing his hands of Chirac &apos;s muddled government and hoping to use the party machine to bulldoze his way into the Elysée Palace in two years . 
But is Sarkozy much different from Chirac ? 
Will he really try to end France &apos;s misguided belief in its own economic &quot; exceptionalism ? &quot; 
The challenge is massive : a 10 % unemployment rate that has lasted for 20 years , with more than 20 % of people under 25 unemployed , and five million people - nearly a quarter of the working population - employed by the state . 
The salaries and pensions of these fonctionnaires represent about 40 % of the national budget . 
This &quot; French exception &quot; also includes vested interests like the railways and agriculture , sectors so powerful that any attempt at reform is immediately frozen by street demonstrations . 
Indeed , instead of being turned off by such tactics , ordinary Frenchmen and women often turn violent activists like Jose Bové , who destroyed a McDonald &apos;s restaurant , into heroes . 
Can &quot; Supersarko &quot; ( the satirical Canard Enchaîné newspaper &apos;s nickname ) tackle &quot; la France des privileges ? &quot; 
Possibly . 
Sarkozy does not identify with the privileged elite . 
Although born into comfort , he did not pass through the elite training grounds , the Grandes Écoles , but instead went to university like millions of other French . 
He cultivates the image of a &quot; regular guy &quot; who doesn &apos;t read poetry or philosophy at breakfast . 
Hence the sneering elite suspicion - evident , among other places , in the pages of Le Monde - that he is a mere populist . 
But these are appearances . 
What does Sarkozy &apos;s record as finance and economy minister say about his instincts ? 
As finance minister , Sarkozy presided over improving economic indicators that are due more to luck than skill . 
For example , the French statistical agency now expects annual real GDP growth to accelerate to 2.5 % this year , compared to the 1.7 % on which the budget was based . 
This recovery - almost entirely based on domestic demand - gave Sarkozy an extra five billion euros in tax revenues . 
Without having to resort to big spending cuts , he could announce that France will reduce its budget deficit in 2005 from 3.6 % to 2.9 % - below the 3 % ceiling for eurozone countries for the first time since 2001 . 
To keep consumer spending high , Sarkozy has moved forward with tax reform and reduction - including inheritance tax breaks encouraging the drawdown of savings , worker tax credits , and incentives to prevent outsourcing of jobs abroad . 
Unsurprisingly , consumer spending rose by 6 % year on year in the second quarter of this year , while the household savings rate is set to fall to 14 % this year , from 17 % in 2002 . 
Sarkozy is also planning to cut corporate taxation , which , at 35.4 % , remains 20 % higher than the European average . 
At the same time , Sarkozy has shown some inclination towards structural reform . 
He recently blamed France &apos;s budgetary problems on the country &apos;s 35-hour workweek . 
Besides the adverse effect such tight restrictions have on companies &apos; flexibility and effectiveness , these rules also cost 16 billion euros per year - more than is spent on higher education . 
Sarkozy has also spoken of forcing France &apos;s eager healthcare consumers to pay a flat fee covering part of the costs of treatment . 
But this economic modernizer has a populist side , leading the charge for standardized tax rates in the EU and &quot; encouraging &quot; retailers to cut the price of brand-name products like Coca Cola and Danone yogurt . 
Moreover , Sarkozy displays plenty of the interventionist and nationalist instincts of the establishment that he appears to challenge , including the recent announcement of an &quot; economic growth package &quot; - code for demand-boosting public expenditure . 
To be sure , Sarkozy seems free of the most powerful negative impulse of French nationalism , anti-Americanism . 
He likes to point out that most French young people want to go to the US , and has even been nicknamed &quot; Sarkozy the American . &quot; 
But Sarkozy &apos;s bailout of Alstom - a company regarded as a &quot; national champion &quot; - had all the hallmarks of the old dirigisme , calling for the government to take a bigger stake while ruling out a strategic partnership with Germany &apos;s Siemens . 
For good measure , Sarkozy said that France had become too exclusively friendly with Germany . 
Corporatist France is hard to govern . 
The trap for politicians like Sarkozy lies in adding new layers of state bureaucracy instead of trying to dismantle and deregulate . 
On the one hand , the government heavily taxes enterprises , impeding job creation ; on the other , France is to spend 12.8 billion euros on &quot; social cohesion &quot; to tackle unemployment , disaffection , and increasing religious extremism . 
In other words , the state spends in order to clean up the mess it created . 
Can Sarkozy break this vicious circle ? 
Can he reform a state that undermines output by taxing producers and encourages idleness by increasing unemployment benefits ? 
Mr Chirac &apos;s future is behind him , so he dreads Sarkozy . 
The battle that will now take place between them seems certain to paralyze government and any hope of reform in the short run . 
He has many enemies , but also a reputation for prodigious energy and efficiency . 
Sarkozy &apos;s maverick ways could save France .
