The Making of Sputnik 
MOSCOW  -  
Chief Designer Sergei Korolev was expected to call from the Tyuratam launch site ( later renamed Baikonur Cosmodrome ) in Kazakhstan to report on the launch of the world &apos;s first man-made satellite . 
Earlier that day , my father was in Kyiv , Ukraine , on military business . 
He attended a demonstration of tanks crossing the Dnieper River , then discussed with Soviet generals the fate of Defense Minister Marshal Georgy Zhukov . 
( Zhukov was suspected of plotting to seize power , and , before forcing a decorated World War II general to resign , my father and his colleagues enlisted the support of other high-ranking generals , who all agreed with Khrushchev &apos;s plan . ) 
That evening , my father dined with the Ukrainian leaders . 
I sat at the end of the table , not paying attention to their conversation . 
Around midnight , the door opened and the secretary asked my father to take a phone call . 
When Khrushchev came back , he was smiling : Sputnik &apos;s launch was successful . 
Soviet engineers began designing Sputnik in January 1956 . 
But the rest of the world paid no attention to the vague pronouncements of a possible launch that had been appearing in the Soviet press ; everybody outside the Soviet Union knew the United States would launch the world &apos;s first satellite . 
Soviet scientists believed that the Americans would keep their plans secret until after they had succeeded in launching a satellite , so all our efforts were put into beating the Americans to the launch . In August and September , R-7 missiles were successfully launched twice . 
Work went on around the clock . 
Sputnik &apos;s launch made the front page of Pravda , but just barely . 
The story occupied the same amount of space as a report on Zhukov &apos;s visit to Yugoslavia , and ran in a less prestigious position . 
There were no banner headlines or enthusiastic comments . 
The reason was simple . 
My father and all the Soviet people thought that Sputnik &apos;s success was natural , that , step by step , we were getting ahead of the Americans . 
After all , we - not the Americans - had opened the world &apos;s first nuclear power plant . 
The Soviet MiG set world records in the 1950 &quot; s , and the Soviet Tu-104 was the most efficient airliner of its class . 
So Sputnik did not surprise us . 
Nor did the press report Korolev &apos;s name . 
The KGB knew that there was really no need to keep his name secret , but , as KGB chief Ivan Serov told me , the enemy &apos;s resources were limited , so let them waste their efforts trying to uncover &quot; non-secret &quot; secrets . 
But the world was desperate to learn his identity . 
The Nobel Prize committee decided to give an award to Sputnik &apos;s &quot; chief designer , &quot; but first it needed the person &apos;s name . 
The committee requested it from the Soviet government . 
My father weighed his response carefully . 
The matter was complicated , and his concern wasn &apos;t confidentiality . 
The Council of Chief Designers was in charge of all space projects . 
Korolev was the head of the council , but the other Chief Designers Â­ - more than a dozen - considered themselves no less significant . 
My father understood that the Chief Designers were ambitious and jealous people . 
If the Nobel committee were to give the award only to Korolev , my father thought , the members would fly into a rage . 
They would refuse to work with Korolev . 
A well-organized team would collapse like a house of cards , and the hopes for future space research and missile design would be dashed , threatening the country &apos;s security . 
As my father saw it , you could order scientists and engineers to work together , but you couldn &apos;t force them to create something . 
In the end , my father told the Nobel committee that all of the Soviet people had distinguished themselves in the work on Sputnik , and that they all deserved the award . 
Korolev was offended but kept silent . 
The Nobel Prize went to somebody else . 
But , despite the pains my father had taken , the other designers expressed growing discontent about Korolev getting all the publicity , even if anonymously . 
In their &quot; secret &quot; world , it wasn &apos;t any secret who was behind the title &quot; Chief Designer . &quot; 
The first to revolt was engine designer Valentin Glushko , whose RD-170 liquid-propellant engine is used on Russian and some American rockets . 
During one council meeting , Glushko said , &quot; My engines could send into space any piece of metal . &quot; 
Korolev was offended ; his rocket wasn &apos;t just a piece of metal , and , after his success with Sputnik , he no longer considered Glushko his equal . 
The dispute was hushed up , but the resentment lingered . 
Soon , Glushko offered his services to other Soviet rocket designers , Mikhail Yangel and Vladimir Chelomei - Korolev &apos;s rivals . 
Even my father couldn &apos;t make peace between them . 
Technically , Glushko , by government order , continued to design engines for Korolev , but the work wasn &apos;t good . 
So , despite Sputnik &apos;s initial triumph , a decade later the Soviets lost the race to the moon to the Americans .
