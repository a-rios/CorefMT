Three Cures for Three Crises 
A full-scale financial crisis is triggered by a sharp fall in the prices of a large set of assets that banks and other financial institutions own , or that make up their borrowers &quot; financial reserves . 
The cure depends on which of three modes define the fall in asset prices . 
The first - and &quot; easiest &quot; - mode is when investors refuse to buy at normal prices not because they know that economic fundamentals are suspect , but because they fear that others will panic , forcing everybody to sell at fire-sale prices . 
The cure for this mode - a liquidity crisis caused by declining confidence in the financial system - is to ensure that banks and other financial institutions with cash liabilities can raise what they need by borrowing from others or from central banks . 
This is the rule set out by Walter Bagehot more than a century ago : calming the markets requires central banks to lend at a penalty rate to every distressed institution that would be able to put up reasonable collateral in normal times . 
Once everybody is sure that , no matter how much others panic , financial institutions won &apos;t have to dump illiquid assets at a loss , the panic will subside . 
And the penalty rate means that financial institutions can &apos;t profit from the investment behavior that left them illiquid - and creates an incentive to take due care to guard against such contingencies in the future . 
In the second mode , asset prices fall because investors recognize that they should never have been as high as they were , or that future productivity growth is likely to be lower and interest rates higher . 
Either way , current asset prices are no longer warranted . 
This kind of crisis cannot be solved simply by ensuring that solvent borrowers can borrow , because the problem is that banks aren &apos;t solvent at prevailing interest rates . 
Banks are highly leveraged institutions with relatively small capital bases , so even a relatively small decline in the prices of assets that they or their borrowers hold can leave them unable to pay off depositors , no matter how long the liquidation process . 
In this case , applying the Bagehot rule would be wrong . 
The problem is not illiquidity but insolvency at prevailing interest rates . 
But if the central bank reduces interest rates and credibly commits to keeping them low in the future , asset prices will rise . 
Thus , low interest rates make the problem go away , while the Bagehot rule - with its high lending rate for banks - would make matters worse . 
Of course , easy monetary policy can cause inflation , and the failure to &quot; punish &quot; financial institutions that exercised poor judgment in the past may lead to more of the same in the future . 
But , as long as the degree of insolvency is small enough that a relatively minor degree of monetary easing can prevent a major depression and mass unemployment , this is a good option in an imperfect world , this is a good option in an imperfect world . 
The third mode is like the second : a bursting bubble or bad news about future productivity or interest rates drives the fall in asset prices . 
But the fall is larger . 
Easing monetary policy won &apos;t solve this kind of crisis , because even moderately lower interest rates cannot boost asset prices enough to restore the financial system to solvency . 
When this happens , governments have two options . 
First , they can simply nationalize the broken financial system and have the Treasury sort things out - and re-privatize the functioning and solvent parts as rapidly as possible . 
Government is not the best form of organization of a financial system in the long term , and even in the short term it is not very good . 
The second option is simply inflation . 
Yes , the financial system is insolvent , but it has nominal liabilities and either it or its borrowers have some real assets . 
Print enough money and boost the price level enough , and the insolvency problem goes away without the risks entailed by putting the government in the investment and commercial banking business . 
The inflation may be severe , implying massive unjust redistributions and at least a temporary grave degradation in the price system &apos;s capacity to guide resource allocation . 
But even this is almost surely better than a depression . 
Since late summer , the United States Federal Reserve has been attempting to manage the slow-moving financial crisis triggered by the collapse of America &apos;s housing bubble . 
At the start , the Fed assumed that it was facing a first-mode crisis - a mere liquidity crisis - and that the principal cure would be to ensure the liquidity of fundamentally solvent institutions . 
But the Fed has shifted over the past two months toward policies aimed at a second-mode crisis - more significant monetary loosening , despite the risks of higher inflation , extra moral hazard , and unjust redistribution . 
As Fed Vice Chair Don Kohn recently put it , &quot; we should not hold the economy hostage to teach a small segment of the population a lesson . &quot; 
No policy makers are yet considering the possibility that the financial crisis might turn out to be in the third mode .
