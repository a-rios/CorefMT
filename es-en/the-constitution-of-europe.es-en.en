The Constitution of Europe 
The strange document that emerged from extended meetings of the Inter-Governmental Conference of member states of the European Union is technically not a constitution . 
Nowhere , for example , does it say &quot; We , the people of Europe ... &quot; 
It is to be ratified by national parliaments , in some cases through referenda , and it can be amended only by further Inter-Governmental Conferences , not by the European Parliament , let alone by the ( non-existent ) &quot; people of Europe . &quot; 
The Treaty is especially ambiguous where it uses the language of constitutions . 
The so-called &quot; Charter of Fundamental Rights , &quot; for example , appears to protect civil liberties . 
In fact , it applies solely to acts by European Union institutions . 
&quot; The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the Institutions , bodies and agencies of the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law &quot; ( Art . 
II-51 ) . 
Wherever specific rights are guaranteed , the following clause is added : &quot; in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of these rights . &quot; 
Similarly , in its description of the EU &apos;s institutions , the Treaty essentially summarizes existing law . 
Some new provisions - such as the weighting of national votes in the Councils of the Union - have been , and will continue to be , widely discussed . 
Provisions like those setting up a Commission of 25 - and perhaps soon 30 members - will probably be changed before long , because they are simply not viable . 
In any case , it is certain that the current text of the Treaty will not survive more than two centuries ( as has the United States &apos; Constitution ) , or even two decades . 
So why are so many intelligent politicians making such a fuss ? 
Europe , one must realize , is as much about symbolic acts as it is about tangible realities . 
This is why it has the curious quality that sometimes you see it and sometimes you don &apos;t . 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair had said for a long time that the Treaty was a mere tidying-up exercise and therefore not to be taken too seriously . 
Then the symbolic debate overwhelmed him and he changed tack entirely . 
Indeed , to almost everyone &apos;s surprise , he now promises a referendum on the Treaty and says that this will decide once and for all whether Britain is in or out of the Union . 
A similar debate is taking place in Sweden . 
Elsewhere , notably in Germany and France , such sweeping claims have been made for the so-called Constitution that the few who actually look at the draft must wonder why its 125 mostly dense if not opaque pages of text should save Europe . 
Charles Grant , the head of Britain &apos;s Centre for European Reform , has speculated on what would happen &quot; if Britain votes No . &quot; 
If it was just Britain , he argues , there would indeed be pressure for the country to vote again ( as Denmark did in 1992 and Ireland in 2001 ) , or to remove the country from the Union to some sort of associate status . 
If several others , and not just &quot; small countries , &quot; also vote No , there will be a tendency ( according to Grant ) , especially in France and Germany , &quot; to move ahead with a core Europe . &quot; 
But what , one must ask , would this &quot; core Europe &quot; do ? 
In particular , how would the governments of any &quot; core Europe &quot; deal with the fact that , as the European elections in early June have shown , their own peoples are far from enthusiastic about the Union ? 
All this suggests conclusions that give pause for thought . 
It appears that in the absence of substantive policy projects the European Union has turned inward , producing a document that claims to be far more than it actually is . 
Where people have a say , they will express considerable doubts , as they did in the recent European elections . 
Indeed , the older and more embedded democracy is in European countries , the more skeptical are their citizens towards the claims of the constitutional treaty . 
Thus , the gap between visions of Europe and the reality of the EU is growing . 
What is to be done if one believes in the real Europe and its common purposes ? 
The first requirement is to reduce the temperature of the debate about the Treaty . 
Unsustainable claims should not be made for it . 
The enlarged Europe can survive without it . 
The second requirement is to give more prominence to the real Europe . 
The single market is far from complete . 
There are major unresolved issues in the &quot; near-abroad &quot; of the enlarged Union , in Eastern Europe , and in the Balkans . 
In short , the order of the day should be less abstract worry about Europe &apos;s identity and more practical action to define it in deeds , not symbols .
