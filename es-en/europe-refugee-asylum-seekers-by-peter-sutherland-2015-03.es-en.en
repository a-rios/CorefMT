A Safer Path to Asylum 
LONDON - In 2014 , more than 190,000 people risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Europe . 
Some 3,500 lost the gamble , dying as they tried to traverse what has become the world &apos;s deadliest frontier . 
There can be no doubting that some who undertook the perilous journey did so simply to search for better-paying jobs . 
But the origins of those attempting the trip indicate that many are political refugees , not economic migrants . 
The majority of those who crossed the Mediterranean last year come from Eritrea and Syria . 
Many have been formally recognized as refugees by the United Nations Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) in the countries to which they initially fled . 
Some 90 % of those who apply for asylum in Europe are granted some sort of protection - a further testament to their status as bona fide refugees . 
It is time for the European Union to separate the discussion of the crisis in the Mediterranean from its broader immigration debate . 
The policies , language , and response to the events unfolding on the EU &apos;s southern border must be different from those concerning the voluntary movement of job seekers from one safe country to another . 
Indeed , the proper context of the discussion is European countries &apos; obligations under international refugee law . 
The policies put in place by the EU and its member states are directly responsible for the plight of those who die attempting to cross the Mediterranean . 
Efforts to discourage refugees from arriving have not diminished the number of people who are granted asylum in Europe ; they have merely made the process of being granted refugee status more random and dangerous . 
Every country in Europe is party to international treaties that recognize the rights of refugees to seek asylum and not be forcibly returned to countries where they will be unsafe . 
And yet , despite calls by frontline Mediterranean states to establish systems to improve the handling of the crisis and share the burden , little is being done to make things safer for refugees or more manageable for the countries in which they arrive . 
The countries neighboring Syria and Iraq are facing the largest inflows of refugees fleeing the violence there , and the UNHCR has appealed for assistance in resettling a limited number of the neediest . 
So far , however , the response from the countries that can most easily afford to take in refugees has been pathetic . 
Even worse , many people who , as recently as a few years ago , would have easily obtained permission to study , work , or visit relatives in Europe are being denied visas simply because of their refugee status . 
There is no reason to require people seeking an asylum hearing to run a gamut of desert crossings , abuse by smugglers , beatings , extortion , rape , and exploitation - or to have them experience the trauma of watching their friends and family die along the way . 
Doing so is cruel and inhumane , and it violates the spirit of all refugee , human rights , and immigration laws . 
In the past , resettlement programs in Africa , Asia , and the Middle East screened people to establish their status as refugees ; assessed their education , skills , and family relations to determine where they might be integrated most easily ; and worked with European , North American , and Australian governments to find them new homes . 
In the 1980s , such programs helped thousands of Ethiopians , Vietnamese , and Argentines , and a look at the communities in which the beneficiaries were resettled reveals that the vast majority have become self-reliant taxpayers . 
There is no reason that something similar cannot be done for those fleeing violence and persecution today . 
If asylum seekers were provided with opportunities to present their claims in the countries where they currently find themselves , they would not be forced to risk their lives at sea to reach Italy or Greece . 
Eritreans could file applications in Khartoum for asylum in Sweden , Germany , or the United Kingdom . 
Syrians in Cairo or Beirut could do the same . 
The claims could be prioritized and processed in a regular manner , and the refugees could arrive in Europe healthy and ready to work or study . 
The crisis in the Mediterranean cannot be managed in a piecemeal manner . 
The financial costs of patrolling its waters and rescuing those adrift are exorbitant . 
The loss of lives is inexcusable . 
But we do not have to wait until the root causes of displacement - state failure and civil war - are addressed . 
We need only to find the courage to create a system in which desperate people do not have to risk their lives to apply for asylum and resettlement .
