The Silver Lining in High Commodity Prices 
Cambridge - Today &apos;s soaring commodity prices scream a fundamental truth of modern life that many politicians , particularly in the West , don &apos;t want us to hear : the world &apos;s natural resources are finite , and , as billions of people in Asia and elsewhere escape poverty , Western consumers will have to share them . 
Here is another truth : the price mechanism is a much better way to allocate natural resources than fighting wars , as the Western powers did in the last century . 
The United States &quot; ill-considered bio-fuels subsidy program demonstrates how not to react . 
Rather than acknowledge that high fuel prices are the best way to inspire energy conservation and innovation , the Bush administration has instituted huge subsidies to American farmers to grow grains for bio-fuel production . 
Never mind that this is hugely inefficient in terms of water and land usage . 
Moreover , even under the most optimistic scenario , the US and the world will still be relying mainly on conventional fossil fuels until the hydrocarbon era comes to an end ( which few of us will live to see ) . 
Last but not least , diverting vast tracts of agricultural land into fuel production has contributed to a doubling of prices for wheat and other grains . 
With food riots in dozens of countries , isn &apos;t it time to admit that the whole idea was a giant , if well-intentioned , mistake ? 
Another wrong turn is the proposal recently embraced by two American presidential candidates to temporarily scrap taxes on gasoline . 
As laudable as it may be to help low-income drivers deal with soaring fuel costs , this is not the way to do it . 
The gas tax should be raised , not lowered . 
The sad fact is that by keeping oil prices high , OPEC is doing far more for environmental conservation than Western politicians who seek to prolong the era of ecologically unsustainable Western consumerism . 
Of course , it is not just oil prices that are high , but all commodity prices , from metals to food to lumber . 
Prices for many commodities have doubled over the past couple of years . Oil prices have risen almost 400 % in the last five years . 
The proximate cause is a global economic boom that has been stronger , longer , and more broad-based than any in modern history . 
Asia has led the way , but the past five years have been the best Latin American and Africa have enjoyed in decades . 
Broad-based commodity shortages often begin to emerge at the end of long global expansions , and in this respect , the present boom is no different . 
Some politicians also complain about speculators who , more and more , are trading commodities on complex and growing markets that allow them to bet on whether , say , future demand from emerging markets is likely to outstrip growth in future supply . 
But why is this a bad thing ? 
If &quot; speculators &quot; are bidding up today &apos;s commodity prices because they realize that future generations are going to want commodities , too , isn &apos;t that a healthy development ? 
High prices for commodities today mean more supply for future generations , while at the same time creating an incentive to develop new ways to conserve on consumption . 
Again , high prices are helping in ways that Western politicians seem afraid to contemplate . 
Admittedly , the global commodity price boom has had profound , albeit enormously complex and uncertain , effects on poverty . 
While surging commodity prices are helping poor farmers and poor resource-rich countries , they are a catastrophe for the urban poor , some of whom spend 50 % or more of their income on food . 
One element of the solution is to compensate the very poor for the higher cost of survival . Over the longer term , more money for fertilizer , and other aid to promote self-sufficiency , is also essential . 
The World Bank , the United Nations , and even the Bush administration have moved to help , albeit in small measure relative to the scale of the problem . 
Of course , it should be noted that if economic reform in resource-rich Africa had been proceeding at the same pace as in Asia , the era of soaring commodity prices might have been postponed for another century . 
For now , though , instead of whining about high commodity prices , governments should be shielding only their very poorest citizens , and letting the price spikes serve as a wake-up call for the rest of us . 
The end to Western consumerism is not yet at hand , but high commodity prices are a clear warning that big adjustments will be needed as Asia and other emerging nations begin to consume a larger share of the global pie . 
True , when today &apos;s global economic boom ends , as it inevitably will , commodity prices will plummet , easily 25 % , quite possibly 50 % or more . 
Western politicians will cheer , and many pundits will express relief that less money will be flowing to undemocratic countries in the developing world . 
But today &apos;s era of high commodity prices is not just a bad dream that should be forgotten when it ends . 
High prices send a real message about scarcity in a globalizing world . 
Those who ignore it , especially by blocking market forces , are making a tragic mistake .
