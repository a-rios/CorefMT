Saddam Hussein Before the Law 
What is at stake in the trial of Saddam Hussein , which is set to begin on October 19 ? 
Coming just four days after the referendum on Iraq &apos;s constitution and touted as a &quot; constitutional moment &quot; akin to the trials of Kings Charles X and Louis XVI , the proceedings are supposed to help advance Iraq &apos;s transition from tyranny to democracy . 
Will they ? 
So far , all signs suggest that the trial is unlikely to meet its ambitious aims . 
From the outset in postwar Iraq , criminal justice resembled deracinated constitutionalism : atomistic trials , radical purges , and compromised elections . 
Most egregious was the post-invasion rush to &quot; de-Ba &apos;athification , &quot; which eviscerated many of the country &apos;s existing institutions . 
The mix of individual and collective responsibility associated with repressive regimes often creates a dilemma concerning how to deal with the old institutions . 
But , in Iraq , flushing out the military and the police merely left the country in a domestic security vacuum . 
By the time that mistake was recognized , the damage was done , needlessly sacrificing security . 
Moreover , potential sources of legitimacy in Iraq &apos;s ongoing constitutional reform , such as parliament , were also destroyed . 
The lack of legitimate institutions needed to rebuild the rule of law is evident in the debate over what authority and whose judgment ought to be exercised over Saddam Hussein . 
Should the tribunal be national or international ? 
This question highlights the problematic relationship of international humanitarian law to the use of force . 
In the Balkans , the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic by the United Nations &quot; International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) provided a boost to political change in the region . 
Regime delegitimation has become a leading function of the new permanent International Criminal Court . 
But Iraq was different . 
Instead of recurring to an international forum , a devastating war was declared that went beyond deposing Saddam , wreaking damage on tens of thousands of civilians , and thus confounding the message of condemnation . 
The origins of successor justice in the war means that the debate over its legitimacy overlaps with the broader schism over the intervention itself . 
So far , the UN , the European Union , and most human rights groups have not cooperated with the Iraqi Special Tribunal ( IST ) , owing to their opposition to the original military intervention , as well as the IST statute &apos;s authorization of the death penalty . 
Ultimately , the debate over international versus national jurisdiction reflects a dichotomy that is no longer apt in contemporary political conditions , for it obscures the fact that international law is increasingly embedded within domestic law . 
Despite being putatively &quot; national , &quot; the Iraq tribunal couches the relevant offenses in terms of &quot; crimes against humanity . &quot; 
But it is only now , after the war , that successor justice is being aimed at refining and consolidating the message of delegitimation and regime change . 
Despite its close links to the invasion , Saddam &apos;s trial is expected somehow to represent an independent Iraqi judgment , thereby constituting local accountability without exacerbating tensions and destabilizing the country further . 
Can it succeed ? 
From the start , the IST must constitute a robust symbol of Iraqi sovereignty . 
But its close association with the United States-led invasion leaves it vulnerable to the charge of &quot; victor &apos;s justice . &quot; 
Although officially adopted in December 2003 by the Iraqi Governing Council , the IST &apos;s statute was framed under contract to the US government and approved by L. Paul Bremer , the Coalition Provisional Authority &apos;s Administrator . 
The US remains the driving force behind the IST , supplying the needed expertise . 
For many Iraqis , it is hard to view the IST as anything other than an expression of the occupiers &quot; will . 
Indeed , the IST &apos;s close association with the US-backed establishment of a successor regime is fraught with political pitfalls . 
Transitional criminal justice must be broad enough to reconcile a divided Iraq , and , therefore , include Shi &apos;a and Kurdish crimes against humanity , while it apparently must also avoid embarrassing the US or its allies , particularly regarding their extensive dealings with Saddam &apos;s regime . 
But the appearance of selective or controlled justice will defeat the tribunal &apos;s purpose . 
So will the specter of illiberal trial procedures - another reason for the lack of international support for the IST . 
The original selection of judges by what was widely viewed as a wing of the occupation exposes the tribunal to allegations of bias and partiality , as have issues regarding access and transparency for defendants and others . 
Moreover , the IST statute says nothing about the standard of proof , which means that guilt does not clearly have to be established beyond a reasonable doubt . 
While the first set of charges concerns the well-documented killings in Dujail and elsewhere in the 1980 &quot; s , Milosevic &apos;s trial by the ICTY shows that it is far more difficult to establish &quot; superior authority , &quot; linking the killings to the leader . 
According to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , this problem has ostensibly been &quot; solved &quot; by means of extracted confessions . 
Of course , if the IST &apos;s aim is to evoke the possibility of show trials rather than bolstering the rule of law , Talabani is quite right : problem solved . 
Criminal proceedings may then be downsized to a confession of a single massacre , as subsequent trials are shelved to open the way for punishment - unlike , say , the Milosevic trial , which is now dragging into its fourth year . 
But rapid punishment - most likely execution - threatens to bury the full record of decades of tyranny under the apparently overriding purpose of fighting the insurgency by other means . 
Saddam &apos;s trial will thus demonstrate the limits of the law in jumpstarting regime transition . 
An intractable dilemma of transitional justice is that societies ravaged by brutal human rights legacies often appeal to the law to shore up the legitimacy of the successor regime , only to see these salutary aims subverted by the challenges and compromises that are inherent to the transition itself .
