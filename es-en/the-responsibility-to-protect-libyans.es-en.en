The Responsibility to Protect Libyans 
ABU DHABI - Sovereignty is not a license to kill . 
No state can abdicate the responsibility to protect its own people from crimes against humanity , let alone justify perpetrating such crimes itself . 
When a state manifestly fails in that protection , it is the wider international community &apos;s responsibility to provide it by taking &quot; collective , timely , and decisive &quot; action through the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter . 
This is the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; principle , as embraced unanimously by the World Summit of heads of state and government sitting as the UN General Assembly in 2005 , and endorsed subsequently by the Security Council . 
There is no clearer case for its application than in Libya today . 
Colonel Muammar Qaddafi &apos;s forces , on the ground and from the sky , have massacred hundreds - perhaps over a thousand - of Libyans protesting , at first peacefully , against the excesses of his regime . 
A bigger bloodbath seems inescapable if he does not step down . 
The need for &quot; collective , timely , and decisive &quot; action is overwhelming . 
The Security Council , after moving with painful caution the first few days of the crisis , has now both invoked the responsibility to protect principle and - in an historic first - agreed on a substantial package of measures to implement it : an arms embargo , asset freeze , travel bans , and , importantly , reference of the situation to the International Criminal Court . 
Such measures , like the steps being taken in the UN Human Rights Council and elsewhere , are necessary to demonstrate that Qaddafi has no remaining international support . 
They are coercive , but they fall short of the threat or use of military force . 
Will they be enough to stop the killing ? 
Is it time to apply and enforce a no-fly zone ? 
Or to go further still and send in ground forces with a mandate to do what it takes ? 
This is a difficult call . 
Not even the most passionate advocate of the responsibility to protect can pretend otherwise . 
Declaring a no-fly zone is not a &quot; soft &quot; option : it must mean being prepared to shoot down any fighters , bombers , or helicopter gunships that breach it . 
That poses a huge risk of hostage-taking or other reprisals against any intervening country &apos;s nationals still in Libya . 
An invasion force , assuming that one could be mustered on short notice , would raise the stakes higher still . 
It is important to keep in perspective what the responsibility to protect is about , and what the principle was designed to achieve . 
The background to its introduction was a decade of gut-wrenching international division in the 1990 &quot; s about how to react to mass atrocity crimes , with the global North by and large supporting &quot; humanitarian intervention , &quot; the South rallying to the old cry of non-interference in states &quot; domestic affairs , and consensus nowhere in sight . 
The result was either UN-authorized action that was erratic , incomplete , or counterproductive - as in the Somalia debacle of 1993 , the Rwandan genocide in 1994 , and the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 - or action that was eventually effective , but not UN-authorized - and thus unlawful - as in Kosovo in 1999 . 
The &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; sought to recast the issue in terms of responsibility rather than rights , and protection rather than intervention , while identifying a wide spectrum of appropriate preventive and reactive responses , with coercive military intervention only a last resort . 
The hope was that states &quot; failure to protect their inhabitants would no longer be seen as nobody else &apos;s business , as had been the case for centuries , but as the entire world &apos;s concern . 
That part of the job is now fairly well accomplished . 
The global response to the horrors in Kenya in 2008 was a spectacular contrast to the indifference that greeted the butchery in Rwanda . 
Nobody is claiming that sovereignty confers immunity ; the shift in the normative consensus is more or less complete . 
But the second great hope of responsibility-to-protect advocates was that this consensus in principle would make agreement on what to do in practice - how to translate normative consensus into action - easier to achieve . 
That has proved harder , as experiences in Darfur , the Democratic Republic of Congo , and Sri Lanka have demonstrated . 
Given the complexity and sensitivity of the issues - never more so than when military action is an option - it is not surprising that the responsibility to protect remains a work in progress . 
The lesson is not that the principle is irrelevant , but that we have to do better in applying it in the future - and that future , with Libya , is now . 
Sanctions , embargoes , and diplomatic isolation are the absolute minimum in terms of what is required . 
If these measures do not bite immediately , and the carnage continues , there will be no alternative but to do more . 
Military options should always be a last resort , but they can &apos;t be excluded in extreme cases , and Libya is as extreme as it gets . 
A no-fly zone will be easier to contemplate as the last vulnerable expatriates leave the country , and planning for its application should be rapidly advanced . 
For all that it has done so far , the ball remains in the Security Council &apos;s court . 
Not only is the credibility of the responsibility-to-protect principle at stake , but also its own .
