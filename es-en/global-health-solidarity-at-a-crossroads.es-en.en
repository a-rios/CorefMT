Global Health Solidarity at a Crossroads 
KIGALI - A decade ago , the global community stood together to declare that where people live should not determine whether they live or die when confronted by the scourge of AIDS , tuberculosis , or malaria . 
This act of solidarity - unprecedented in human experience - led to revolutionary advances in promoting health care as a human right . 
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria , along with the United States President &apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) , quite literally changed the course of history . 
Programs directly supported by the Global Fund have saved nearly eight million lives since 2002 - an average of more than 4,400 lives every day . 
But , while much has been accomplished , much more remains to be done - and the Global Fund needs at least $ 2 billion to reverse a funding freeze that is in place through 2014 . 
So the world now plays a waiting game to see whether governments will step up and fill the gap . 
To be blunt , many of the world &apos;s largest economies are not fulfilling their financial pledges to the Fund . 
Their politicians cite budget constraints and the need to prioritize domestic programs over fighting diseases that disproportionately kill the world &apos;s poorest . 
My country , Rwanda , has been a recipient of Global Fund grants since 2002 . 
Just 18 years ago , our society was torn apart by a brutal genocide that killed more than one million people . 
Today , Rwanda is a peaceful country full of promise and hope , with one of the world &apos;s fastest-growing economies . 
With Global Fund support for our national institutions , we have achieved universal access to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV , and we have stabilized HIV prevalence at around 3 % of the population . 
Similarly , Rwanda &apos;s tuberculosis program has become a model for Africa , and all Rwandan families now have access to insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent malaria , contributing to an 87 % drop in cases during the last seven years . 
Integration of services for infectious diseases and primary care has contributed to some of the steepest declines in child and maternal mortality ever observed . 
And , as life expectancy in Rwanda continues to climb ( from below 30 in 1995 to 55 in 2010 ) , we are now taking action against non-communicable diseases such as heart disease , cancer , and diabetes . 
The flexible , country-owned support provided by the Global Fund has been crucial to our success . 
My country is living proof that investing in health is not only the right thing to do , but that it can also create virtuous cycles that promote security and development . 
In fact , after receiving Global Fund support for years , Rwanda recently made its first donation of $ 1 million to the Fund . 
Unfortunately , infectious diseases are far from under control around the world . 
Less than a quarter of the world &apos;s children living with HIV have access to treatment , and up to a million people still die of malaria each year . 
And , alarmingly , only one in six patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis currently receives proper treatment . 
Moreover , reports of &quot; totally drug-resistant tuberculosis &quot; have recently emerged from India . 
Policymakers would do well to remember that it only takes one airplane flight for such a pathogen to go global . 
Infectious diseases neither respect national borders nor conveniently follow economies into recession . 
History has shown that retreating from the fight against an epidemic can lead to a renewed plague that is immune to our best drugs , requiring far more expensive measures to control . 
Our choice could not be clearer : either we resolve to answer the call of history and provide the Global Fund with the resources that it needs , or we allow political lassitude to undermine a decade of progress and consign untold thousands to preventable deaths . 
Investing now , on the other hand , would pay off in the long term : just $ 6 billion more per year for the AIDS response today would save more than $ 40 billion in averted treatment costs alone over the next decade . 
The international community &apos;s regard for the health of the world &apos;s poorest in the face of financial uncertainty will be a standard by which history measures not only our ability to stand together in weathering economic upheaval , but also our capacity for justice . 
Now is the time for donor countries , including middle- and low-income countries , to rise to the challenge and ensure that the Global Fund has the resources needed to accept new grant applications as soon as possible . 
The costs of inaction are morally - and economically - untenable .
