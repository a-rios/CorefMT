China Must Do More than Mediate 
Despair is dangerous in diplomacy . 
But North Korea &apos;s latest actions are making much of Asia hopeless . 
Only China , long reluctant to flex its diplomatic muscles , now has the power to find a diplomatic solution to the North Korean nuclear problem . 
But the question everyone from Tokyo to Seoul and from Washington to Moscow is asking is this : will China act in time ? 
China &apos;s influence on North Korea is uniquely powerful . 
China is keeping its increasingly desperate neighbor on life support by providing most of the non-food aid and energy that North Korea receives from abroad . 
But to prevent North Korea from realizing a fait accompli in its pursuit of nuclear weapons , China must do more than mediate between North Korea and the US , the role it has so far played . 
Instead , it must now prompt North Korea to halt its nuclear development activities and return to the six-party talks with America , Japan , China , Russia , and South Korea that broke up weeks ago . 
Recent developments indicate that North Korea &apos;s nuclear threat is becoming more serious by the day . 
Two weeks ago , North Korea declared that in June it successfully reprocessed some 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods and now possesses &quot; nuclear deterrence , &quot; suggesting that Kim Jong Il &apos;s regime may actually be making atomic bombs . 
Not only does North Korea show little interest in holding another session of the six-party talks that the Bush administration and the other participants are calling for ; it now wants to ban the Japanese from participating . 
Kim accuses Japan of introducing unnecessary obstacles and complications into resolution of the nuclear question by raising the sensitive issue of North Korea &apos;s abduction of Japanese citizens . 
But this is nothing more than a political diversion . 
It is inconceivable that multilateral negotiations could result in a breakthrough toward a diplomatic solution while North Korea is actively engaged in pursuing its nuclear weapons program . 
It must be clear by now that Pyongyang is determined to keep its nuclear weapons program in order to obtain a credible assurance from the US that its bizarre and repressive regime will be allowed to survive . 
Unless America accommodates North Korea &apos;s demands for concluding a nonaggression treaty and ending &quot; hostile &quot; policies , Kim &apos;s regime is likely to keep its nuclear weapons program as its most effective deterrent against any preemptive US attack - something that the Bush administration , indeed , refuses to rule out . 
America &apos;s military victory in the war in Iraq probably hardened North Korea &apos;s resolve to rely on the nuclear option as its primary means of ensuring regime survival . 
But that should not surprise anyone : the North Korean regime has always been committed to making military power the &quot; first priority &quot; in the state budget . 
This contrasts sharply with policies pursued by China and Vietnam , Asia &apos;s two other communist powers . 
In both countries , the leadership places military power last in their national development strategies . 
It would be difficult for the US to change the highest priority of its own national security strategy - preempting terrorism and fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially with another nuclear threat looming in Iran . 
Insofar as the goal of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula is concerned , the US has thus succeeded by sustaining an ad hoc concert of powers thus far with China , Japan , Russia , and South Korea . 
Indeed , in their first-ever joint declaration , Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao , Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi , and South Korean President Roh Moo Hyun issued a plea on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit held in Bali on October 8 for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula . 
All sides realize that failure to achieve this would most likely result in a nuclear chain reaction with Japan , South Korea , and perhaps even Taiwan embarking on their own nuclear weapons development programs . 
That scenario is China &apos;s worst nightmare . 
So the question now is what can China do to freeze - and , if possible , to reverse - North Korea &apos;s nuclear program . 
China finds itself in a delicate position , pulled in one direction by its desire to avoid a precipitous North Korean collapse , and in the opposite direction by its overriding need to deepen economic relations with the US , Japan , and South Korea . 
This is why at the UN Security Council China opposed any military action or sanctions against North Korea , a country for which it sacrificed almost one million troops during the Korean War in 1950-53 . 
It is in China &apos;s vital national interest to halt North Korea &apos;s quest to become another declared nuclear power . 
China &apos;s success here would not only enhance its own international prestige , but would also contribute immensely to promoting regional stability and prosperity throughout East Asia .
