Soulless Bodies 
The world &apos;s leading scholar in artificial intelligence once described people as machines made of meat . 
But , with the exception of a small minority of philosophers and scientists , nobody takes this view seriously . 
It is offensive . 
It violates the tenets of every religion , and it conflicts with common sense . 
We do not feel , after all , that we are just material bodies , mere flesh . 
Instead , we occupy our bodies . 
We own them . 
We are spontaneously drawn to the view defended by Ren√© Descartes : We are natural-born dualists , so we see bodies and souls as separate . 
This dualism has significant consequences for how we think , act , and feel . 
The philosopher Peter Singer discusses the notion of a moral circle - the circle of things that matter to us , that have moral significance . 
This circle can be very small , including just your kin and those with whom you interact on a daily basis , or it can be extremely broad , including all humans , but also fetuses , animals , plants , and even the earth itself . 
For most of us , the circle is mid-sized , and working out its precise boundaries - does it include stem cells , for instance ? - can be a source of anguish and conflict . 
The nature of these boundaries is related to our common-sense view that some objects have souls and others do not . 
If one attributes a soul to something , then it has value ; if one sees something as a mere body , it does not . 
This is often explicit ; historically , debates about abortion , for example , are often framed in terms of the question : When does the soul enter the body ? 
This reasoning can apply as well to how we regard adults . 
Normally , when we interact with others we see them as both body and soul . 
We appreciate that they have beliefs , desires , and consciousness , and we recognize that they are solid physical things that take up space and are subject to gravity . 
Both stances coexist well enough in the normal course of things . But when we emphasize one perspective over another , there are moral consequences . 
Social psychologists have shown that simply getting an experimental subject to take another person &apos;s perspective will make the subject care more about the person and be more likely to help . 
Focusing on the soul , then , leads to moral concern , and can expand the moral circle . 
The opposite can occur when someone is viewed solely as a body , and one emotion that supports this outcome is disgust . 
The psychologist Paul Rozin has shown how disgust , as Charles Darwin first noted , is an evolutionary adaptation that deters us from bad meat , so it is naturally triggered by animals and animal waste products . 
People , after all , are made of meat . 
Hence , every movement designed to stigmatize or malign some group - Jews , blacks , gays , the poor , women , and so on - has used disgust . 
Once a group of people is viewed as disgusting , attention shifts away from them as moral individuals . 
They become soulless bodies , and the moral circle closes in to exclude them . 
Our reaction to soulless bodies is well illustrated in a story told about Descartes after he died . 
It was known that Descartes had an illegitimate daughter , Francine , who died when she was five years old . 
According to the story , Descartes was so struck with grief that he created an automaton , a mechanical doll , built to appear identical to his dead daughter . 
The two were inseparable . 
When Descartes crossed the Holland Sea , he kept the doll in a small trunk in his cabin . 
Curious about the contents of the trunk , the captain of the ship crept down to Descartes &quot; cabin one night and opened it . 
To his horror , the robot Francine arose . 
The captain , struck with revulsion , grabbed her , dragged her up to the deck of the ship , and threw her overboard . 
This story captures how disturbing - in some cases , revolting - we find a body without a soul , and it embodies the emotional pull that our common-sense dualism often has . 
Science tells us that common-sense dualism is wrong . 
There is no consensus as to precisely how mental life emerges from a physical brain , but there is no doubt that this is its source . 
Thus , if a &quot; soul &quot; means something immaterial and immortal , then it does not exist . 
All of us are soulless bodies , no less than the robot Francine . 
This is perhaps the main reason why the scientific rejection of dualism may be so hard to swallow : it seems to diminish the moral status of people . 
If we are to accept scientific facts , we need to construct morality on a new foundation , one without souls .
