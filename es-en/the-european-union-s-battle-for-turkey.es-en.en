The European Union \ u0027s Battle for Turkey 
When the plotters behind the recent suicide attacks in Istanbul launched their human bombs against Jewish synagogues and British office buildings , they had several audiences in mind . 
One audience - and potentially the most important - are the citizens of the European Union , which Turkey &apos;s political class is eager to join as soon as possible . 
The battle over Turkish membership in the EU will be fought on many fronts : in the country itself , where the government is currently undertaking major reforms in order to qualify for candidate status ; at the negotiating table once the European Council in December 2004 authorizes the Commission to enter into formal accession talks ; and among the public within the existing member countries . 
Of the three fronts , the latter will be the most demanding . 
Most EU citizens are uneasy today over the prospect of Turkish membership . 
Those responsible for the atrocities in Istanbul may have calculated that Islamic terrorism will increase that uneasiness further . 
Traditionally , Europe &apos;s citizens have always accepted the new members that queued up to join the club as it went from the original group of six countries to the 25 that will form the EU in 2004 . 
Once a purely West European community , the Union has pushed out its frontiers in all directions . 
From next year , it will stretch from the north of Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south , from Ireland in the west to the Baltic states in the east . 
While the people inside have often worried that newcomers would take away their jobs and subsidies , they usually acquiesced in the end . 
But Turkey is different . 
The 10 new countries that will join next year - and even the Balkan countries that are now being offered the prospect of future membership - are all embraced by a traditional definition of Europe . 
None of them is of a size that could upset the EU &apos;s current balance . 
Neither applies to Turkey . 
Except for a small stretch of land , its territory lies in Asia , not Europe ; its culture is Islamic , not Christian , and if it should join in , say , 2013 , its population will be by far the largest - and youngest - of any EU member . 
Moreover , because Turkey borders on such countries as Iran , Iraq and Syria , it will bring to the EU a disturbing neighborhood : a part of the world incapable of developing a regional order on its own , a cockpit of Islamic radicalism and terrorism , a collection of fragile states imbued with nationalism , a field of competition for arms , even nuclear arms , a region where the US will remain strategically involved and where Israel will continue to provide a rallying point for anti-Western sentiments . 
With Turkey as a member , the EU will be part of the troubled and troubling wider Middle East , the most challenging region in today &apos;s world . 
Yet it is precisely because of these implications that the advantages of having Turkey inside the EU far outweigh the risks . 
First and foremost , the prospect of membership is the most powerful force for modernization in Turkey , and a modern , democratic , and prosperous Turkey is of central interest to Europe , whether inside or outside . 
Moreover , including within the EU the moderate type of Islam for which Turkey stands will be a major help in integrating Muslim minorities within European countries - already large and growing even without the addition of Turkey &apos;s population . 
Finally , with the opportunities that Turkey &apos;s Islamic traditions , regional contacts , resources , and geography provide , the EU will be much better placed to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will affect Europe &apos;s security in any case . 
These are powerful arguments . 
The big question is whether they are powerful enough to sway a skeptical European public . 
It would take only one country out of perhaps 30 EU members in 2013 to bloc Turkey &apos;s accession . 
No doubt some of them will put the matter to a referendum that will leave the decision to the people , not just their parliaments . 
Even in Germany , where referenda are not envisaged by the constitution , there are calls to hold one over Turkey &apos;s entry ; one opposition party has already announced that it will make this a central issue in next year &apos;s election campaign for the European Parliament . 
Once public unease towards Turkey can find focus in a referendum on the country &apos;s potential EU membership , the chances for it joining look fairly slim . 
At the end of the negotiations it may thus come to pass that Turkey is ready for Europe , but Europe is not yet ready for Turkey . 
This is why the battle over Turkish membership has already begun , and the bombers of Istanbul seem to have understood this . 
Those who believe that the EU is right for both Turkey and Europe must also start to fight for what they profess . 
Nothing would be worse - for both Turkey and Europe - than European governments wanting Turkey in but then failing to take their people along . 
Terrorists will no doubt continue to instill fear of an Islamic Turkey among Europe &apos;s fainthearted . 
Let us hope that in the end , the attacks on innocent people in the crowded streets of Istanbul do not foster European fears , but rather a sense of solidarity with that moderate and dynamic country in the face of a common enemy .
