Escape from the World Bank 
PHILADELPHIA - The elephants in the room at the annual International Monetary Fund / World Bank meeting in Lima , Peru , were the China-inspired Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) and New Development Bank ( or &quot; BRICS Development Bank , &quot; as it was originally called ) . 
Will these new institutions behave like the World Bank or the more conventionally &quot; bank-like &quot; European Investment Bank ( EIB ) ? 
Above all , will they be vehicles to promote - or , paradoxically , constrain - China &apos;s interests ? 
The reality is that over the next decade , these new institutions will not be huge lenders . 
The paid-in capital of each is $ 10 billion ; so , even with an equity-to-loan ratio of 20 % ( the current floor for the World Bank ) , each will be able to lend only about $ 50 billion over the next decade - not chump change , but hardly a game changer - unless they &quot; crowd in &quot; substantial private investment . 
What matters is that the larger emerging markets are putting substantial capital into institutions that will be dominated by China - an indication of how frustrated they are with the World Bank and the IMF . 
The World Bank is like an old ship : in its seven decades , all kinds of barnacles - sticky budgetary accretions and transaction costs - have accumulated on its hull , steadily impeding its speed and performance . 
In the 2015 financial year , the EIB lent more than twice the amount provided by the Bank , but with one-sixth the staff . 
Whether measured by flows ( loan disbursements ) or stock ( loans outstanding ) , the World Bank is massively over-staffed , with a much higher administrative budget than the EIB . 
When the Bank was formed , the key governance mechanism was a resident Board of Directors that reported to a Board of Governors - usually finance ministers or equivalent senior authorities from member countries . 
Over time , new offices proliferated : an Office of Internal Audit , an Independent Evaluation Office , an Inspection Panel , a Chief Ethics Officer , and an Office of Institutional Integrity . 
Most of this bureaucratic growth was the result of pressure from developed countries , which timed their efforts with the periodic replenishment of the International Development Association ( the World Bank &apos;s window for soft loans ) . 
Criticism from well-organized Western NGOs put more pressure on the Bank , deflecting attention from any real structural changes in the institution &apos;s governance . 
And savvy Bank presidents have known that the best way to deflect political pressure is to add yet more bells and whistles - especially when they are visible and loud . 
Around two decades ago , there was an Ombudsman and a World Bank Administrative Tribunal to address internal staff grievances . 
Now there is a whole paraphernalia of &quot; Internal Justice Services &quot; : the Respectful Workplace Advisers , an Office of Mediation ( presumably an Office of Meditation will follow ) , Peer Review panels , an Office of Ethics and Business Conduct , and an entire Integrity Vice-Presidency . 
To paraphrase the comedian Fred Allen , &quot; On ships they call them barnacles ; at the World Bank , they attach themselves to desks and are called vice presidents . &quot; 
And , after the last reorganization , there are more than two dozen of them . 
Meanwhile , the Bank &apos;s extreme risk-averse culture reflects a rational response to critics who make a huge fuss about every project or program failure . 
Critics who take failures in commercial projects in stride find the Bank sloth-like compared with the private sector and become indignant when its projects fail . 
Yet , instead of making the case that risk is intrinsic to economic development and developing a risk-balanced portfolio of projects ( and loans priced accordingly ) , the Bank pretends that it can be infallible . 
As a result , the best has become the enemy of the good . 
Risk aversion has gone hand in hand with skewed institutional priorities , as is evident in the Bank &apos;s budget . 
In the 2015 financial year , $ 623 million was allocated to &quot; Client Engagement , &quot; while nearly 1.5 times that amount , or $ 931.6 million , went to &quot; Institutional , Governance &amp; Administration &quot; ( the remaining $ 600 million , for &quot; Program and Practice Management , &quot; is ostensibly for supporting lending operations ) . 
Expenses for the Executive Board alone were $ 87 million . 
The Bank loudly proclaims the virtues of research - and then spends almost as much - $ 44 million - on &quot; External and Corporate Relations . &quot; 
Many of the challenges facing the World Bank come from the pressures placed on it by its larger shareholders . 
Because they refuse to cede power to smaller shareholders , or to allow a substantial increase in resources to meet much greater global needs , emerging economies had little choice but to create their own institutions . 
The World Bank will not disappear : there are too many vested interests ( including academics and NGOs ) eager for a share of other people &apos;s money . 
But the Bank &apos;s performance epitomizes how even well designed and well-built ships slow down as the barnacles build up , until they must cede the way to newer vessels .
