Blatant Benevolence 
PRINCETON - Jesus said that we should give alms in private rather than when others are watching . 
That fits with the commonsense idea that if people only do good in public , they may be motivated by a desire to gain a reputation for generosity . 
Perhaps when no one is looking , they are not generous at all . 
That thought may lead us to disdain the kind of philanthropic graffiti that leads to donors &quot; names being prominently displayed on concert halls , art museums , and college buildings . 
Often , names are stuck not only over the entire building , but also on as many constituent parts of it as fundraisers and architects can manage . 
According to evolutionary psychologists , such displays of blatant benevolence are the human equivalent of the male peacock &apos;s tail . 
Just as the peacock signals his strength and fitness by displaying his enormous tail - a sheer waste of resources from a practical point of view - so costly public acts of benevolence signal to potential mates that one possesses enough resources to give so much away . 
From an ethical perspective , however , should we care so much about the purity of the motive with which the gift was made ? 
Surely , what matters is that something was given to a good cause . 
We may well look askance at a lavish new concert hall , but not because the donor &apos;s name is chiseled into the marble fa√ßade . 
Rather , we should question whether , in a world in which 25,000 impoverished children die unnecessarily every day , another concert hall is what the world needs . 
A substantial body of current psychological research points against Jesus &apos;s advice . 
One of the most significant factors determining whether people give to charity is their beliefs about what others are doing . 
Those who make it known that they give to charity increase the likelihood that others will do the same . 
Perhaps we will eventually reach a tipping point at which giving a significant amount to help the world &apos;s poorest becomes sufficiently widespread to eliminate the majority of those 25,000 needless daily deaths . 
That is what Chris and Anne Ellinger hope their Web site , www.boldergiving.org , will achieve . 
The Web site tells the story of more than 50 members of the 50 % League - people who have given away either 50 % of their assets or 50 % of their income in each of the last three years . 
Members of the league want to change expectations about what is a &quot; normal &quot; or &quot; reasonable &quot; amount to give . 
They are a diverse group of people . 
Tom White ran a big construction company , and started giving millions to Paul Farmer &apos;s efforts to bring health services to Haiti &apos;s rural poor . 
Tom Hsieh and his wife , Bree , made a commitment to live on less than the national median income , currently $ 46,000 a year . 
As Hsieh , who is 36 , earned more , they gave away more , mostly to organizations helping the poor in developing countries . 
Hal Taussig and his wife have given away about $ 3 million , amounting to 90 % of their assets , and now live happily on their social security checks . 
Most donors see giving as personally rewarding . 
Hsieh says that whether or not his giving has saved the lives of others , it has saved his own : &quot; I could easily have lived a life that was boring and inconsequential . 
Now I am graced with a life of service and meaning . &quot; 
When people praise Hal Taussig for his generosity , he tells them , &quot; Frankly , it &apos;s my way of getting kicks out of life . &quot; 
The 50 % League sets the bar high - perhaps too high for most people . 
James Hong started www.hotornot.com , a Web site that allows people to rate how &quot; hot &quot; other people are . 
It made him rich . 
Hong &apos;s Web site , www.10over100.org , invites others to do likewise . 
So far , more than 3,500 people have . 
Hong sets the bar low . 
If you earn less than $ 100,000 , you don &apos;t have to give away anything at all , and if you earn , say , $ 110,000 , you would be required to give away only $ 1,000 - less than 1 % of your income . 
That is not generous at all . 
Many of those earning less than $ 100,000 can also afford to give something . 
Still , Hong &apos;s formula is simple , and it starts to bite when earnings get really big . 
If you earn a million dollars a year , you have pledged to give $ 90,000 , or 9 % of what you earn , which is more than most rich people give . 
We need to get over our reluctance to speak openly about the good we do . 
Silent giving will not change a culture that deems it sensible to spend all your money on yourself and your family , rather than to help those in greater need - even though helping others is likely to bring more fulfillment in the long run .
