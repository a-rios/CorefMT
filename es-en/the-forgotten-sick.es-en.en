The Forgotten Sick 
LIVERPOOL - The developed world is familiar with the global threats of viral infections that incite fear in both rich populations and poor . 
The pandemics of SARS , avian , and swine influenza have cost the global economy an estimated $ 200 billion . 
These threats emerge frequently and unpredictably from human contact with animals . 
Rapid response is required of governments , United Nations agencies , regulatory authorities , and the pharmaceutical industry for coordination , surveillance , and vaccine production . 
But the poorest people - those who live on less than $ 2 per day - are often not considered important when a pandemic threat emerges . 
They do not contribute significantly to the global economy , and their countries &quot; health systems function on a tiny fraction of what advanced economies devote to their populations &quot; health . 
Conversely , the developed countries &quot; view of the diseases of the developing world is that only three are important : AIDS , tuberculosis , and malaria . 
This stems from the power of advocacy constituencies and the recognition that these diseases might threaten the developed world . 
As a result , these diseases receive a disproportionate amount of funding for research and control , while other infections kill , blind , deform , and disable many more - the &quot; bottom billion &quot; - who have little access to health care . 
These infections are known as the Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) . 
They are unfamiliar to the developed world , and their names are often difficult to pronounce : filariasis ( elephantiasis ) , onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) , schistosomiasis ( bilharzia ) , and others , particularly intestinal worms . 
These are not familiar diseases to people lucky enough to live in the world &apos;s richest countries , but they are household names to hundreds of millions of poor people , who are often infected with more than one of them . 
They are long-lasting conditions , often contracted at an early age , and both the illnesses and their symptoms are progressive . 
Indeed , whereas the misery that worm diseases cause is extensive and the burden excessive - as much as tuberculosis or malaria - they do not kill immediately . 
Instead , they gradually erode children &apos;s development prospects . 
And symptoms accumulate : sight is gradually lost , genital lesions appear around puberty ( sometimes increasing risk of HIV ) , and skin condition declines as millions of microscopic worms become intolerably itchy . 
Blood loss , causing anemia , is the result of thousands of worms chewing at the wall of the gut . 
Other diseases , such as sleeping sickness , transmitted by tsetse flies are fatal if untreated , as is leishmaniasis , if the parasites that cause it - transmitted by tiny sandflies - invade the liver and spleen . 
Again , the misery caused by these infections exceeds the burden of tuberculosis or malaria . 
The good news is that NTDs can be treated , as quality drugs - donated by the major pharmaceutical companies - are made available . 
These drug donations for river blindness , trachoma ( another blinding disease ) , leprosy , elephantiasis , worms , and bilharzia , as well as for sleeping sickness , give hope to millions . 
Moreover , the cost of the annual treatment recommended by the World Health Organization is often less than $ 0.50 , and much less in Asia , with delivery carried out by communities or through schools . 
The increase in treatment has been spectacular - more than 500 million people in 51 countries treated for elephantiasis in 2007 , and 60 million in 19 countries have been treated for river blindness . 
Guinea disease is now endemic in only four countries , and leprosy is a problem in only six . 
These are impressive figures , and the expense is trivial compared to the anti-retroviral drugs needed to treat AIDS , which cost more than $ 200 annually and must be taken every day , not every year . 
Given that roughly one billion people are infected with NTDs , compared to 40 million with HIV , and that the drugs targeting them are donated and actually prevent disease and stop transmission , treating NTDs is a major opportunity to lift populations out of poverty . 
The main challenge is to convince policymakers that there is more to reducing poverty than focusing on just three diseases . 
In fact , NTDs are &quot; low-hanging fruit . &quot; 
If the international community is serious about alleviating poverty and achieving development goals , tackling the diseases so directly associated with economic misery should be a fundamental objective . 
We can easily meet that objective , because we have drugs that are effective , free ( or very cheap ) , that have low delivery costs , and that provide add-on benefits . 
Now is the time to rethink our public-health investments and messaging , and evaluate whether we are getting the best value for our donor dollars , or whether we should do much more to tackle diseases that we have so far largely ignored .
