Is Middle East War Inevitable ? 
BERLIN - Fuad Siniora , Lebanon &apos;s former prime minister , is a thoughtful man with deep experience in Middle Eastern politics . 
So when he speaks of &quot; trains with no drivers that seem to be on a collision course , &quot; as he recently did at a private meeting in Berlin , interested parties should probably prepare for unwanted developments . 
Of course , no one in the region is calling for war . 
Four factors , none of them new but each destabilizing on its own , are compounding one another : lack of hope , dangerous governmental policies , a regional power vacuum , and the absence of active external mediation . 
It may be reassuring that most Palestinians and Israelis still favor a two-state solution . 
It is less reassuring that most Israelis and a large majority of Palestinians have lost hope that such a solution will ever materialize . 
Add to this that by September , the partial settlement freeze , which Israel &apos;s government has accepted , will expire , and that the period set by the Arab League for the so-called proximity talks between the Palestinians and Israelis , which have not seriously begun , will also be over . 
Serious direct negotiations are unlikely to begin without a freeze on settlement building , which Israel &apos;s Prime Minister Netanyahu is unlikely to announce or implement , given resistance within his coalition government . 
Syria , which until the end of 2008 was engaged in its own Turkish-mediated proximity talks with Israel , does not expect a resumption of talks with Israel anytime soon . 
This may be one reason why Syrian President Bashar al-Assad mentions war as an option , as he recently did in Madrid . 
Moreover , Israelis and people close to Hezbollah in Lebanon are talking about &quot; another round , &quot; while many pundits in the Middle East believe that a limited war could unblock a stagnant political situation . 
Their point of reference is the 1973 war , which helped to bring about peace between Egypt and Israel . 
Iran , whose influence in the Levant is not so much the cause of unresolved problems in the Middle East as the result of them , continues to defy the imposition of new sanctions by the United Nations Security Council . 
Iranian rulers have as little trust in the West as the West has in them , and they continue to increase international suspicion by their words and actions . 
Repeated calls by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about Israel &apos;s eventual disappearance play into the hands of those in Israel who argue that Iran &apos;s nuclear program must be ended militarily . 
Some of the Middle East &apos;s most important players are increasing the risks of confrontation because they have either lost a proper feeling for their regional and international environment , or seek to increase their own political power through provocation and brinkmanship . 
Netanyahu &apos;s short-sighted reluctance to give up settlements and occupied territory threatens Israel &apos;s long-term interest to reach a fair settlement with the Palestinians . 
In its deadly assault on the Gaza flotilla in May , Netanyahu &apos;s government demonstrated a kind of political autism in its inability to realize that even Israel &apos;s best friends no longer wish to accept the humanitarian consequences of the Gaza blockade . 
In the Arab world , there is currently no dominant power able to project stability beyond its own national borders . 
It will take time before Iraq will play a regional role again . 
The Saudi reform agenda mainly concerns domestic issues . 
Egypt &apos;s political stagnation has reduced its regional influence . 
Qatar over-estimates its own strength . 
The only regional power in the Middle East today is Iran , but it is not a stabilizing force . 
The Arab states are aware of this . 
Much as they dislike it , they are also fearful of a war between Israel or the United States and Iran , knowing that they would have little influence over events . 
Indeed , intra-regional dynamics in the Middle East today are driven by three states , none of which is Arab : Israel , Iran , and , increasingly , Turkey . 
In recent years , Turkey tried to mediate between Israel and Syria , Israel and Hamas , opposing factions in Lebanon , and lately between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany . 
Turkey should continue to play this role . 
The Obama administration has had a strong start with respect to the Middle East . 
Domestic issues are likely to preoccupy Obama and his team at least up until the mid-term elections this November , thus precluding active diplomacy during the critical months ahead . 
And the European Union ? 
There has not been much active crisis-prevention diplomacy from Brussels or from Europe &apos;s national capitals . 
None of the leading EU states &quot; foreign ministers seems even to have made an attempt to mediate between Europe &apos;s two closest Mediterranean partners , Israel and Turkey . 
Twenty years ago , in the weeks that preceded Iraq &apos;s invasion of Kuwait , many observers saw signs of a looming crisis . 
That crisis , and others before and since , showed that tensions in the Middle East rarely dissolve with the passage of time . 
Sometimes they are resolved through active diplomatic intervention by regional or international players .
