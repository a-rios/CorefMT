Russia &apos;s War on Ukraine &apos;s Economy 
WASHINGTON , DC - Ukraine &apos;s economy may no longer be in free fall , but it remains in dire straits . 
The country &apos;s GDP contracted by 6.8 % last year , and is forecast to shrink by another 9 % this year - a total loss of roughly 16 % over two years . 
While things seem , to some extent , to be stabilizing - depreciation of the hryvnia has eliminated the country &apos;s current-account deficit , and a massive fiscal adjustment brought Ukraine &apos;s budget into cash balance in the second quarter of this year - the situation remains precarious . 
Ukraine &apos;s primary economic challenges are not homegrown ; they are the result of Russian aggression . 
The country &apos;s belligerent eastern neighbor has annexed Crimea , sponsored rebels in eastern Ukraine , pursued a trade war , intermittently cut off its supply of natural gas , and is threatening financial attack . 
So far , Ukraine has miraculously managed to withstand these assaults with little international support - but it is in desperate need of assistance . 
Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea in March 2014 seized 4 % of Ukraine &apos;s GDP . 
Since then , Russian-supported armed forces have occupied territories in eastern Ukraine that accounted for 10 % of the country &apos;s GDP in 2013 . 
With the Donbas region &apos;s production having plummeted by 70 % in the months since , this has cost Ukraine some 7 % of its 2013 GDP . 
Since 2013 , Russian trade sanctions have slashed Ukraine &apos;s exports to the country by 70 % - accounting for a drop of 18 % in Ukraine &apos;s total exports . 
Last year alone , Ukraine &apos;s exports to Russia - which included machinery , steel , agricultural goods , and chemicals - fell by half . 
Logistical issues , the lack of commercial links , and the specialization of some products meant that the goods could not be redirected in the short term . 
I estimate that the loss is likely to correspond to a 6 % decline in Ukraine &apos;s GDP . 
Businessmen everywhere are aware of Russia &apos;s assault on Ukraine , and , unsurprisingly , few want to invest in a war zone . 
As a consequence , Ukraine &apos;s net foreign-direct investment , which was slightly over 3 % of GDP before the start of hostilities , has evaporated . 
This amounts to a corresponding reduction of 3 % of GDP . 
In addition to this , Ukraine has faced an intermittent gas war . 
A financial assault may be yet to come . 
Leaving Crimea aside , we can attempt conservatively to sum up Ukraine &apos;s economic losses from Russia &apos;s aggression . 
Roughly 7 % from lost production in occupied eastern Ukraine , 6 % losses from trade sanctions , plus 3 % from lost foreign direct investment amounts to 16 % of GDP - that is , the total amount Ukraine is estimated to have lost from the beginning of 2014 to the end of this year . 
Russia &apos;s apparent but undeclared aim is to make sure that democratic Ukraine fails , without looking entirely guilty of having caused that failure . 
One does not counter military aggression only with stabilization credits , but also with military support . 
European countries should note that , given the Kremlin &apos;s saber-rattling in the Baltic and the Balkans , there is little reason to believe that the Russian threat is limited to Ukraine . 
Delivering arms to Ukraine before Russia attacks , openly or covertly , should be a priority . 
On July 1 , Russia opened a new front in the economic war on Ukraine when the energy giant Gazprom , which is majority-owned by the Russian state and slavishly pursues Russian foreign-policy objectives , decided unilaterally to cut off the country &apos;s gas supply . 
Given the global gas surplus , Europe is in a position to tell Russia in no uncertain terms that its corrupt practices are no longer acceptable . 
In particular , the European Commission should insist that Ukraine be able to continue to import gas from Gazprom in order to augment European supplies . 
Furthermore , the economic war is making it almost impossible for Ukraine to deal with the humanitarian emergency that Russian aggression has caused : more than 6,000 citizens killed , tens of thousands injured , and 1.3 million people internally displaced . 
The international community , again with the EU in the lead , must provide substantial humanitarian assistance . 
Ukraine &apos;s stabilization program with the International Monetary Fund is sound but underfunded . 
An additional credit of roughly $ 10 billion is needed to raise Ukraine &apos;s international reserves and stabilize its currency so that controls can be lifted . 
This money should come from the EU and the United States . 
Meanwhile , the EU should make Russia &apos;s trade war with Ukraine the focal point of any trade negotiations with the Kremlin . 
Finally , every legal avenue to holding Russia to account must be pursued . 
Sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s cronies should not only be continued , but also deepened . 
Given that many of them have international bank accounts in US dollars , they are liable to American prosecution . 
Ukraine should not be left to face Russia on its own .
