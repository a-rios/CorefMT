A Happier Ending for IMF Reform ? 
NEWPORT BEACH - Despite an elegant solution that involved no new commitments of resources , the US Congress has refused to take up a long-delayed funding proposal for the International Monetary Fund . 
In the process , it derailed a multilateral agreement that was hammered out back in 2010 - ironically , in the eyes of the rest of the world , with US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration taking a leading role . 
And it did so at a time when financial disruption in emerging economies is reminding the world of the importance of a strong stabilizing anchor at the core of the international monetary system . 
After the initial disappointment , many are hoping that Congress will again take up the Obama administration &apos;s IMF request after a short interlude . 
It will certainly have several opportunities to do so while working on other financial legislation . 
This is an unfortunate and regrettable outcome for both the IMF and the international community as a whole . 
Congressional obstinacy is forcing the Fund to miss out on an opportunity to strengthen its finances at a time when most other countries have already approved the initiative . 
It is also being held back from addressing , albeit modestly , governance and representation deficits that have steadily eroded the integrity , credibility , and effectiveness of this important multilateral institution . 
Meanwhile , global developments confirm that the recent period of financial tranquility remains a tentative one . 
Rather than being anchored by fundamental and durable reforms , the current calm has been secured through prolonged reliance on central banks &quot; experimental monetary policies , especially in the United States , Europe , and Japan . 
These policies have improved domestic prospects in advanced countries , but they have accentuated the policy dilemmas facing many emerging economies . 
In some cases , they have overwhelmed policymaking capability and added to internal political instability - all of this at a time when no one knows the full range of side effects and unintended consequences of the West &apos;s unconventional measures . 
Yes , this is an important lost opportunity for all who value global growth and financial stability . 
The 2010 agreement was , after all , a compromise - albeit a hard-fought one - that advanced only marginally the cause of long-delayed IMF reforms . 
Moreover , there were insufficient assurances that the limited changes would end up providing a springboard for more meaningful reforms down the road . 
Indeed , rather than modernizing economic multilateralism and revamping its governance , what many would have regarded as an unsatisfactory yet final partial compromise could have played into the hands of those who advocate regional arrangements as a substitute for multilateralism , not a compliment to it . 
But this new opportunity , born of disappointment , will not be seized if the international community &apos;s approach is simply to wait for the US president to submit the same set of limited reforms to Congress again and again . 
Instead , leaders need to come together and support the initiation of discussions on a more comprehensive set of reforms . 
Such reforms could start by targeting a more aggressive , and much-needed , realignment of voting power and representation at the IMF - one that reflects the world of today and tomorrow , rather than that of decades ago . 
This could be achieved by pursuing three specific initiatives . 
· Leaders should target a much bigger shift in favor of emerging economies and away from Europe - in voting power , representation on the IMF &apos;s Executive Board , and funding obligations . 
· The outmoded relic of a system that de facto reserves the position of Managing Director for European citizens should be eliminated once and for all . 
· Third , policymakers should build on recent progress to ensure a more level operational playing field for the implementation of Fund surveillance . 
There is no better time than now to start working on these three initiatives . 
The last two - further improving the procedures governing the election of the next Managing Director , and more even-handed surveillance - could be pursued rather quickly and without having to secure parliamentary approval . 
What is required is stronger political will by governments and , in the case of Europe , greater humility . 
The first initiative , pertaining to voting power and representation , would inevitably take longer and be much more complicated to implement . 
In many countries , governments would need to obtain parliamentary approval . 
To adapt a concept that the columnist Thomas Friedman recently used for the Middle East , the key is to recognize that , at the national level , it is about &quot; no victor , no vanquished . &quot; 
This is not about individual countries , but rather about the well-being of an international system that can better serve and protect individual countries &quot; interests over the longer-term . 
Acting through its 24 representatives on the IMF &apos;s Executive Board , the international community would be well advised to move quickly to empower the Managing Director to appoint an independent committee of outside experts to devise detailed proposals in each area , including by drawing on work that has already been undertaken . 
Indeed , the emerging world &apos;s recent bouts of instability , and the risk that they may spillover to advanced countries where growth has yet to achieve &quot; escape velocity , &quot; are a timely reminder of the danger of reform paralysis . 
Anyone who wishes to see a strong IMF at the center of a fluid international monetary system - and most economists see great merit in this - would agree that such a multi-speed outcome is far superior to doing more of the limited same .
