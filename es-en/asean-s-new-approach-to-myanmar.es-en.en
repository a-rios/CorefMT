ASEAN &apos;s New Approach to Myanmar 
NEW YORK - The recent decision by Myanmar &apos;s government to sentence pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to a further 18 months &quot; house arrest shows how difficult it is to deal with that country &apos;s ruling generals . 
Yet the first steps toward a new approach may already have been taken . 
The clearest sign comes from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , of which Myanmar is a member . 
At first , most of ASEAN &apos;s member governments responded mildly to the verdict , expressing their &quot; disappointment &quot; - a stance that reflects the group &apos;s principle of noninterference in fellow members &quot; internal politics . 
But Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya then consulted his counterparts in Cambodia , Indonesia , Singapore , and Vietnam . 
As current ASEAN chair , he floated the idea of concertedly requesting a pardon for Aung San Suu Kyi . 
ASEAN government officials have since met to draft a text . 
Approval by the association &apos;s foreign ministers may come in September , with ASEAN leaders tackling the issue in October . 
Of course , amendments and objections to the draft should be expected . 
But the pardon request is already significant . 
It seeks to be finely balanced , respecting the regime &apos;s sovereignty while subtly pressing home the point in unison , as neighboring states . 
The request would be politely worded , but it would also be an official and public mode of communication , instead of the usual behind-the-scenes quiet diplomacy . 
What ASEAN says or does not say will not change things immediately . 
Cynics might add that even if Aung San Suu Kyi is pardoned , she may yet still be detained on political grounds or face other barriers aimed at preventing her from competing in the elections promised in Myanmar for 2010 . 
But Western sanctions have not worked , either . 
Since the 1990 &quot; s crackdown , human rights violations have continued , most recently with the suppression of the protests led by Buddhist monks in 2007 . 
The average citizen has grown poorer , even as those close to the junta become ostentatiously rich . 
Western sanctions instead paved the way for investments in Myanmar by those with less concern about human rights violations - first by ASEAN neighbors in hotels and other sectors , and more recently by China and India , which are vying for projects and influence in the strategic energy sector . 
As a result , Myanmar &apos;s generals have been able to play one side off against another . 
The game , however , may now be changing . 
ASEAN &apos;s initiative is a new step forward for the group . 
While ASEAN rejected previous calls to impose sanctions , or even to expel Myanmar , this step shows that it will not remain inert regardless of what the generals do . 
Moreover , some ASEAN member countries , like Singapore , have explicitly called for Aung San Suu Kyi to be allowed to participate in the 2010 elections . 
The ASEAN effort coincides with two other developments . 
One is the decision by the United States to reconsider its policy of sanctions , becoming more flexible while remaining true to its values and interests . 
Some activists have criticized US Senator Jim Webb &apos;s journey to Yangon to obtain the release of John Yettaw , the American whose actions triggered the charges against Aung San Suu Kyi . 
But this is consistent with the Obama administration &apos;s policy of seeking a dialogue even with those who are not America &apos;s friends . 
Such dialogue is vital if Myanmar is to be prevented from possibly pursuing nuclear weapons and rigging elections , Ã  la Iran . 
The other development is less obvious . 
After the court delivered its verdict , the regime halved the sentence and agreed to keep Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest , rather than moving her to one of its worst jails . 
This may not seem like much of a concession . 
But the junta seems to be trying to cause less offense . 
Consider , too , the junta &apos;s gesture in handing over Yettaw to Senator Webb , and its interaction with the international community on humanitarian assistance after Cyclone Nargis . 
Might it be possible that the generals in Myanmar recognize that they are in a cul de sac ? 
Could the regime be seeking ways out of its isolation in the run-up to the 2010 elections ? 
Could it welcome dialogue and engagement ? 
How the generals respond to the ASEAN request will be an important signal of the regime &apos;s intentions . 
Even if the regime does want to begin talking , sustaining a dialogue will be no easier than has been the case with North Korea . 
ASEAN , as the organization of neighboring states , is important to achieving that goal , but US involvement is key , as is inclusion of China and India . 
They must be pressed to see more than the opportunity for strategic access to energy and other natural resources . 
Japan , too - still the largest Asian economy and a traditional donor to the region - must also play a role . 
A moral but pragmatic community needs to be constructed , with all in agreement on how to deal with Myanmar . 
Even if , like an orchestra , different countries use different instruments and play different notes , the main theme must be consistent . 
If this can be done , the chances of progress in the run-up to the 2010 elections will be strengthened . 
Success may still prove elusive , but a new game with a greater possibility for success will have begun .
