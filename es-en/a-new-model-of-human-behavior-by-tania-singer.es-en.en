Beyond Homo Economicus 
LEIPZIG - Humanity currently faces numerous global challenges , including climate change , resource depletion , financial crisis , deficient education , widespread poverty , and food insecurity . 
But , despite the devastating consequences implied by a failure to address these issues , we have not risen to the occasion . 
Economies , both crisis-stricken and thriving , are failing to eliminate poverty , improve the provision of public services like education , and maintain and allocate collective goods , such as fish stocks and rain forests , effectively and equitably . 
At the same time , societies are increasingly fragmented , with perceived loneliness and stress-related illnesses on the rise . 
And existing governance structures are inadequate to improve the situation . 
Clearly , a new approach is needed . 
But developing effective mechanisms for addressing large-scale shared challenges must begin with a fundamental shift in the way human motivation and cognition are understood . 
The concept of homo economicus , which asserts that humans are rational actors who make decisions based on narrow self-interest , has dominated political and economic thinking since the 1970 &quot; s . 
But , while the pursuit of self-interest may be advantageous in certain contexts , it is not the only , or even the principal , driver of human behavior - and it is not conducive to overcoming today &apos;s most pressing global issues . 
It is time to replace the framework of homo economicus with a model that reflects humans &quot; capacity for altruism and pro-social behavior . 
By illuminating opportunities for human cooperation , such a framework would provide a useful foundation for political and economic systems that succeed where existing arrangements have failed . 
Achieving such an understanding of human nature requires a comprehensive , interdisciplinary approach that moves beyond the social sciences . 
In recent years , developments at the frontier of evolutionary biology , psychology , and anthropology , together with the emergence of new fields , such as neuroeconomics , social and affective neuroscience , and contemplative neuroscience , have shown that humans can be motivated by pro-social preferences , like fairness and concern for others &quot; welfare or rights . 
In fact , humans are often driven to help those in need , even complete strangers , by feelings of empathy and compassion . 
This idea is reinforced by a vast amount of neuroscientific evidence , which contradicts the emphasis on individualism that prevails in Western societies , suggesting instead that the human brain is wired for affective resonance , with people naturally reflecting each other &apos;s emotions and motivational states . 
Moreover , experimental data suggest that , contrary to mainstream economic theory , people &apos;s preferences are changeable . 
Shifting environmental factors shape human decision-making by activating motivational systems related to threat , achievement , and power motivation , as well as to care for others and social affiliation . 
The emerging field of contemplative neuroscience has begun to produce evidence for plasticity of pro-social preferences and motivation . 
Short- and long-term mental-training studies ( such as the ReSource project ) reveal that mental-training programs can enhance cognitive and socio-affective faculties like attention , compassion , and empathy . 
More specifically , training programs aimed at boosting pro-social motivation have led to increased activity in neural networks related to positive emotions and affiliation , as well as to reduced stress-relevant hormonal responses and increased immune markers , when participants are exposed to distress in others . 
In other words , such mental-training programs make participants more efficient and more focused , while improving their capacity to cope with stress . 
At the same time , they promote pro-social behavior and a broader , less self-centered perspective that accounts for humans &quot; interdependence . 
Such findings have started to inspire fields like experimental microeconomics and neuroeconomics , which , in turn , have begun to incorporate pro-social preferences into their decision-making frameworks . 
These promising findings should now be incorporated into new economic models and concrete policy proposals . 
Given that brains are at their most malleable during childhood , beginning mental training in school would help to create a solid foundation for the kind of secular ethics that would contribute to the development of a more compassionate society . 
But mental training also has benefits for adults , so businesses , political authorities , and research institutions should collaborate in establishing &quot; mental gymnasiums . &quot; 
Furthermore , institutional reform could be aimed at adapting social environments to foster cooperation instead of competition , and to activate our motivation to engage in caring behavior , rather than seeking achievement , power , and status only . 
In the long run , striving only for the latter leads to imbalance and resource depletion not only on the individual level , but also globally . 
Humans are capable of far more than selfishness and materialism . 
Indeed , we are capable of building sustainable , equitable , and caring political systems , economies , and societies . 
Rather than continuing to indulge the most destructive drivers of human behavior , global leaders should work to develop systems that encourage individuals to meet their full socio-emotional and cognitive potentials - and , thus , to create a world in which we all want to live .
