The Hidden Future of the US Economy 
CAMBRIDGE - Just how bad is the outlook for the United States &quot; economy ? 
Unfortunately , you cannot tell from the forecasts . 
These days , it is common to read forecasts predicting that the US economy will grow at a 3 % annual rate in the coming year . 
But just what does that mean ? 
The forecaster is not saying that he or she is confident that growth will be exactly 3 % . 
Every forecaster recognizes that the actual growth rate may be higher or lower than the number that he states . 
There is a distribution of possible growth rates , and the forecaster is telling us just one of the outcomes that he can contemplate . 
But if a forecaster tells us that he &quot; expects &quot; a growth rate of 3 % , does that mean that he thinks that it is as likely to be above 3 % as it is to be below 3 % - the &quot; median , &quot; as he sees it , of the distribution of possible growth rates ? 
Or could it mean that the he thinks the most likely growth rate will be close to 3 % ( the &quot; modal &quot; value ) , even though he may believe that it is much more likely to be less than that value than to be greater ? 
Many forecasters currently believe that there is a significant probability that the economy will slump during the next 12 months - a &quot; double dip &quot; in the expansion process . 
It is possible for them to hold that view and still forecast 2 % growth for the next 12 months as the most likely outcome or the &quot; median &quot; of their probability distribution . 
Any decision maker who depends on forecasts - a businessman , an investor , or a government official - needs to know the probability of very low or very high growth rates , as well as the median forecast . 
But that information remains hidden . 
Some surveys of forecasts report the distribution of the forecasts of the different individuals being surveyed . 
We might read that the average forecast of 20 different forecasters is 2.8 % , with the five highest forecasts above 3.2 % and the five lowest forecasts below 2.5 % . 
While that is useful information , it does not say anything about the extent to which each forecaster believes that growth might turn out to be less than 1 % , or even less than zero . 
Recent US data have clearly raised the probability that the economy will run out of steam and decline during the next 12 months . 
The key reason for increased pessimism is that the government stimulus programs that raised spending since the summer of 2009 are now coming to an end . 
As they have wound down , spending has declined . 
The government programs failed to provide the &quot; pump-priming &quot; role that was intended . 
They provided an early spark , but it looks like the spark did not catch . 
For example , a tax subsidy for car purchases caused GDP to rise in the third quarter of 2009 , with more than two-thirds of the increase attributable to motor-vehicle production . 
But now that the subsidies have ended , the level of both sales and production has declined . 
A recent survey of consumers reported the lowest level of intended car buying in more than 40 years . 
Although annual GDP growth was 3 % in the first quarter of this year , almost all of it reflected inventory accumulation - some of which , no doubt , was unwanted build-up caused by disappointing sales . 
When inventory accumulation is excluded , first-quarter growth of &quot; final sales &quot; was just 0.8 % in annual terms - and 0.2 % compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 . 
The second quarter benefited from a surge in home purchases , as individuals rushed to take advantage of the tax subsidy for home buyers that expired in April . 
But what will happen in the third quarter and beyond now that that program has ended ? 
While it would be rash to forecast a double dip as the most likely outcome for the economy during the rest of this year , many of us are raising the odds that we attribute to such a downturn . Unfortunately , those forecasts of what might happen remain hidden .
