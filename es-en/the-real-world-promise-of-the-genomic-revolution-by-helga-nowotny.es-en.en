Fulfilling the Genomic Promise 
VIENNA - For most people , a promise is a reason to expect something , a well-founded hope without hype . 
And it is a promise in this sense that connects science to society : the public trusts that scientific and technological advancement are the keys to navigating the uncertain road to a better world , in which future generations can live longer , healthier , and happier lives . 
This promise originated almost 400 years ago , with the institutionalization of modern science . 
After discovering that mathematics could be applied to understanding the physical world , a small group of natural philosophers turned toward experimental empiricism with practical objectives . 
Spearheaded by this minority , the scientific revolution swept through Europe and , later , spread to the rest of the world . 
In his Instauratio Magna , Francis Bacon , one of modern science &apos;s most articulate proponents , conveyed a vision of a new world , transformed through the systematic inquiry of natural phenomena . 
By imitating and twisting nature , he declared , its secrets would be revealed - and could be manipulated to improve humans &quot; lives . 
Bacon &apos;s pragmatic objective of using a scientific understanding of natural causes to &quot; effect all things possible &quot; - what is now called innovation - was science &apos;s original promise to society , and formed the core of the Age of Enlightenment . 
While many of science &apos;s promises have been fulfilled - notably , the dramatic extension of the human lifespan and of leisure time - many others have been only partly achieved , or not at all . 
And yet society &apos;s trust in science has not wavered . 
While specific objectives have changed , the overarching belief that scientific knowledge transforms people &apos;s lives - as cultural , educational , and institutional factors converge with technological and industrial dynamics - has remained strong . 
Today , genetics is the leading source of scientific promise . 
Since James D. Watson and Francis Crick uncovered DNA &apos;s structure in 1953 , a massive amount of available genetic data has been identified , and novel forms of scientific organization and modes of working have emerged . 
As a result , genetics has brought science to the brink of a new era of enlightenment , in which individuals are understood in terms of the relationships among their unique genomic data . 
This movement - the latest incarnation of the endless quest for human advancement - poses new challenges to the relationship between science and society . 
As the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition : &quot; The genomic revolution is here - are you ready ? &quot; 
For example , this revolution will undoubtedly lead to the engineering of life through synthetic biology , a prospect that remains controversial . 
Likewise , epigenetics ( the study of heritable changes in gene function that occur without altering the DNA sequence ) has reshaped the old nature-versus-nurture debate by highlighting the multi-dimensional character of the relationship between biological and social development . 
The growing understanding of transgenerational epigenetic modifications , whether nutritional or neurological , has opened new perspectives on the plasticity of the phenotype ( an organism &apos;s observable characteristics ) , and the factors that might affect it . 
As a result , it is now clear that people &apos;s lifestyles do not concern only themselves . 
These developments - and the questions that they raise - underscore the need to redraw the map of the sciences . 
A more integrated research agenda that includes the social sciences is crucial to ensuring that the promise of genetic research benefits all . 
In fact , such research is integral to improving upon the factors that contribute most to a society &apos;s wealth : health , education , and ethics . 
Indeed , more encompassing knowledge of personal genomics can engender a new sense of commonality . 
With a better understanding of people &apos;s relationships to each other - from the impact that one &apos;s lifestyle could have on the health of future generations to the corrosive effects of existing inequalities and the concomitant risk of a new genetic divide - a healthier , more equal society could be created . 
But realizing this vision requires accounting for the different choices that people make within a pluralistic society . 
To this end , the collaboration of social and scientific institutions would help to break down language and cultural barriers , ensuring that the genomic revolution aids , rather than alienates , the public , and thereby passes the true test of any scientific advancement : relevance to everyday experience . 
In a world characterized by multiple , overlapping crises , people need to see , understand , and identify with what genetics has to offer . 
When asked what should keep us awake at night , the economist Amartya Sen answered , &quot; The tragedies that we can prevent , the injustice that we can repair . &quot; 
Applying scientific advances to the prevention of tragedy and the redress of injustice fulfills science &apos;s core promise . 
Strengthening the real-world role of genetics is an essential step in that direction .
