No Child Left Out 
SEOUL - On a recent visit to a camp for Syrian refugees in Turkey , I witnessed some of the most powerful displays of human endurance that anyone can imagine . 
And yet , amid all the stories of trauma and loss , what affected me the most was these refugee families &quot; unquenchable thirst for education . 
The children I spoke to told me of their continued desire to learn in the camp &apos;s makeshift schools , crammed into classes and taught in shifts running from before dawn until after dark . 
Their parents spoke of the hope they place in the transformative power of education . 
Syria once boasted universal education . 
Now , with more than four million people forced to flee their homes because of the violence wracking the country , it has become one of the world &apos;s many places suffering from what can only be described as a global education crisis . 
There are an estimated 58 million primary-school-aged children out of school worldwide , and those affected by conflict and natural disasters are among the hardest to reach . 
Worse , the number of child refugees cut off from school - in places like Nepal , Myanmar , and Yemen - is increasing at an alarming rate . 
If the international community does not act to nurture and educate these children , the cycle of poverty and conflict will be reproduced for generations to come . 
The fact that so many children are cut off from education constitutes a clear failure on the part of the world &apos;s governments , which promised in 2000 , when the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) were adopted , to ensure primary schooling for all children by 2015 . 
To achieve this , it is not enough to enroll children in school ; they must be kept there and provided a quality education . 
UNESCO estimates that at least 250 million of the world &apos;s children of primary-school age are unable to read , write , or do basic arithmetic . 
This week , the international community will have a chance to do something about this scandalous state of affairs . 
Policymakers from around the world will meet in South Korea at the World Education Forum to agree on the global education targets that are set to replace the MDGs . 
It is truly fitting that South Korea is hosting this forum , because it is so often seen as a model of what investment in education can deliver . 
Some 8 % of South Korea &apos;s GDP is spent on education , and UNESCO estimates that every dollar invested in primary schools generates $ 10- $ 15 in economic returns . 
South Korea , which has lifted itself up from the ranks of the world &apos;s poorest countries to among its richest in just two generations , is living proof that education pays off . 
The new Sustainable Development Goals that are to be agreed this year underscore the challenges that world governments must address by 2030 . 
I insist that quality universal primary education must be one of the SDGs &quot; top priorities . 
The emphasis here is on quality . 
Success is measured not only by the number of children we enroll , nor by their achievements on standardized tests ; the most important outcomes are the tangible and intangible impacts of education on the quality of students &quot; lives . 
This is the unfinished business of the MDGs . 
Wherever I travel with the Education Above All foundation , I encounter bright , motivated children who have been denied the chance to learn . 
As the world moves on to new priorities , we cannot forget our responsibility to those who have been failed by our complacency . 
The job is not done . 
We must remain committed to achieving the goal of quality primary education for all children - not some , and not even most - wherever they live .
