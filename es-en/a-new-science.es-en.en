A New Science 
An unusual meeting of scientists took place in Paris this summer , when scientists gathered to brainstorm about the need for a new science , one that could be as revolutionary as Einstein &apos;s insights were a century ago . 
Most scientists assume that the basics of science are known . 
In terms of big challenges , the conventional wisdom is that few things are left to discover . 
The remaining options are said to fall into three groups : &quot; grand scientific quandaries &quot; ( such as uniting gravity and electricity into one theory ) which require a huge investment and first world infrastructure ; &quot; data collection , &quot; which is the field work associated with archeological digs and biological / genetic surveys ; and &quot; science-informed problems , &quot; such as combating AIDS or addressing global warming . 
Beyond that , many believe the only hard work will be to use existing laws to benefit humankind in new technological ways . 
Who can argue ? 
After all , today &apos;s models work . 
But an emerging group of scientists points to phenomena that current theories do not address well . 
These problems are exceedingly common and artfully avoided because the science that would account for them just doesn &apos;t exist . 
This missing science would describe processes , and how entire systems evolve . 
Individual scientific disciplines are understood fairly well . 
Physics , at least the physics we encounter as ordinary humans , is well mapped . 
Chemistry and biochemistry are similarly solid  -  there are some things we don &apos;t understand about the body , but it is believed that the basic machinery of how cells and molecules interact is known . 
Slightly apart from these are the new social sciences , which deal with humans and societies . 
In each of these areas  -  physics , biochemistry and social science  -  the theories are mature and largely uncontroversial . 
Each discipline has its own language and its own separate machinery . 
Rarely is a scientist an expert in more than one area , because the worlds and languages are so different . 
This means that we can &apos;t answer complex questions that depend on more than one field . 
Consider the brain , for example . 
This complex organ is composed of molecules that interact using the principles of physics . 
That information moves according to the laws of electricity . 
There is also a system of specialized cells , and these interact , exchanging chemicals that also convey information . 
The interaction between two brains adds another level : here , information is exchanged by means of languages , signs and ideas . 
Information is at work on each level and comfortable theories explain how the separate ones operate . 
But information is being exchanged between the levels as well . 
There is no science that explains this , even at the most rudimentary level . 
To cope with this deficiency , some scientists have tried to reinvent the tools of one level in order to apply them to another . 
This leads to such things as a &quot; language &quot; at the level of cells and &quot; energy &quot; behind organized societies . 
Sometimes the transplant works well enough , but it does not address the central problem : What is the nature of the information conveyed between each level , and how is it conveyed ? 
As it happens , nearly every system in the world is composed of such layers . 
A similarly embarrassing lack of understanding about how the whole system works exists in every case . 
The group of interdisciplinary scientists that met in Paris is loosely affiliated under the banner &quot; Foundations of Information Science . &quot; 
They have been working in a distributed collaboration for eight years and come from a range of countries and specialties . 
As well as scientists from the relevant disciplines , art theorists , psychiatrists , language experts and philosophers are beginning to participate in the discussion . 
Most of the group is banking on the &quot; transplant &quot; strategy , in which the basic science of one layer is placed in another , tweaked and supplemented in order to be functional . 
Others think that a whole new approach is required . 
They assume that many scientific conventions are accidents of history and new abstractions can be devised . 
If the FIS group is lucky , there will also be some radical input from thinkers that do not presently have access to first world infrastructure . 
Independent thinking is an underestimated factor . 
Nearly all the activities collected under the banner of &quot; science &quot; have developed institutional tendencies that are similar to their economic counterparts . 
It is usually assumed that developing economies need to build resources that emulate those in the developed world , but this could actually stifle the most creative thinking . 
Many scientific disciples are going through a revolution , and a lot of those ideas  -  sometimes revolutionary ideas  -  are bubbling up from labs and research centers that are unaffiliated with large institutions . 
Twenty years of the most advanced thinking for mathematical algorithms came from a Soviet empire starved of computing power . 
The cleverest , most literally earth-shattering notions of physics for two generations came not from the expected powerhouses of the day , but from Budapest . 
Iran has a tradition of architectural design that has revealed key insights to cognitive scientists . 
Today , some of the most radical new ideas in second generation artificial intelligence ( so-called &quot; autonomous agents &quot; ) are incubating in Prague . 
The most creative breakthroughs became famous events . 
When Einstein added new abstractions to the language of physics , the identity of space and time changed . 
The FIS meeting in July was the unheralded beginning of an attempt to remodel the universe in such a way . 
The group identified the gaps that need explanation . 
They will expand their pool of thinkers to include scientists from necessarily innovative regions . 
Following this , they will identify which problems might be solved if this new science is developed . 
Or if you wish , discovered .
