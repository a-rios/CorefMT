Free Trade Forever 
NEWTON , MASSACHUSETTS - On December 7 , representatives from the World Trade Organization &apos;s 159 member countries reached agreement on the first multilateral trade deal in the WTO &apos;s 19-year history . 
Although the Trade Facilitation Agreement - dubbed the &quot; Bali package , &quot; after the Indonesian island where the meeting took place - did not address the most pressing North-South trade issues , it remains an important economic and political milestone . 
The Bali package commits WTO members to moving toward lowering non-tariff trade barriers - for example , by establishing more transparent customs regulations and reducing trade-related paperwork . 
These changes might seem like bureaucratic minutiae , but the agreement &apos;s impact - adding $ 1 trillion to global output and creating 21 million jobs worldwide - will be substantial . 
The agreement has been criticized for failing to meet the goals set out in the WTO &apos;s 2001 Doha Development Agenda . 
But these objectives - including improvement of market access in agriculture , manufacturing , and services ; clarification of international trade rules ; and progress on addressing relevant environmental issues - were overly ambitious . 
Even the modest Bali package was touch and go , requiring an extra day of negotiations to reach agreement on contentious issues like Indian farm subsidies and the US embargo of Cuba . 
Nonetheless , it is clear that trade liberalization is gaining momentum . 
Consider the impressive scale and scope of other multilateral trade agreements - such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership , the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership , and the Trade-in-Services Agreement - that are currently being negotiated . 
Current progress toward trade liberalization underscores how trade policy - especially that of the United States - has improved over the last hundred years . 
The early nineteenth century was characterized by high tariff rates in both the US and Europe . 
But , during the last few decades of the century , European tariff rates fell substantially , largely in response to the United Kingdom &apos;s unilateral repeal of the Corn Laws , which had imposed substantial tariffs on imported grain . 
The US , however , continued to charge much higher tariffs . 
Unlike in Europe , partisan politics shaped US trade policy before World War II , with the Republicans raising tariffs and the Democrats reducing them . 
One of the most notable hikes occurred in 1922 , when the Republican-controlled government passed the Fordney-McCumber Tariff , which raised the average import tariff rate by 64 % . 
This triggered vehement protests - and strong retaliation - from America &apos;s trading partners . 
From 1925 to 1929 , 33 tariff revisions were made in 26 European countries , and 17 were made in Latin America . 
International conferences in Brussels in 1920 , Portorose in 1921 , and Genoa in 1922 - as well as the League of Nations &quot; World Economic Conference in Geneva in 1927 - endorsed a tariff truce , but to no avail . 
In 1930 , US President Herbert Hoover and a Republican Congress , enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act , sending the tariff war into high gear . 
Though the Smoot-Hawley tariff increases were modest compared to those under Fordney-McCumber , their timing turned the act into a virtual synonym for bad trade policy . 
According to the League of Nations , Smoot-Hawley triggered &quot; an outburst of tariff-making activities in other countries , at least partly by way of reprisals , &quot; with substantial duty hikes made almost immediately by Canada , Cuba , France , Italy , Mexico , and Spain . 
Thus , though Smoot-Hawley was not a direct cause of the Great Depression , as many have claimed , it did contribute to a breakdown of international trade precisely when the world could least afford it . 
The two-thirds decline in aggregate imports from 1929 to 1933 was only partly a result of falling incomes , and hence import demand ; retaliatory trade and exchange-rate policies also played a major role in bringing about the global trade collapse . 
Even when world trade finally began to revive after the depression ended , it remained fragmented , developing primarily within trading blocs and regions . 
It was only after World War II - when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( succeeded in 1995 by the WTO ) began the process of multilateral trade liberalization - that Smoot-Hawley &apos;s destructive legacy was finally overcome . 
Of course , protectionist pressures have occasionally arisen since then . 
For example , during the 1992 US presidential campaign , Ross Perot argued that ratifying the North American Free Trade Agreement would lead to a &quot; giant sucking sound , &quot; as US jobs migrated to Mexico and American workers &quot; wages fell . 
And many countries have introduced minor - and not so minor - impediments to trade since WWII . 
Nonetheless , the overall trend has been toward increased openness . 
In fact , the post-war era has been the longest sustained period of trade liberalization in history - a particularly impressive feat , given that the world has just suffered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression . 
Indeed , policymakers nowadays seem genuinely disinclined to resort to tariff increases . 
There is no denying that Bali was not a complete success , and much of the WTO &apos;s Doha agenda remains unfulfilled .
