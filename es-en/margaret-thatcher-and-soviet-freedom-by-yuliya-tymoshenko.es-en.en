The Iron Lady as Liberator 
KHARKIV , UKRAINE - Prison is always a place of mourning . 
But perhaps learning of Margaret Thatcher &apos;s death in this place is grimly appropriate , because it made me remember the imprisoned society of my youth that Thatcher did so much to set free . 
For many of us who grew up in the Soviet Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe , Margaret Thatcher will always be a heroine . 
Not only did she espouse the cause of freedom - particularly economic freedom - in Britain and the West ; by proclaiming Mikhail Gorbachev a man &quot; we can do business with &quot; ( at a time when almost every democratic leader was deeply suspicious of his policies of perestroika and glasnost ) , she became a vital catalyst in unlocking our gulag societies . 
Indeed , for everyone in the former communist world who sought to build a free society out of the wreckage of totalitarianism , the &quot; Iron Lady &quot; became a secular icon . 
Her qualities of courage and persistence - of being &quot; not for turning &quot; - provided a living example for us of a type of leadership that does not buckle at moments of political peril . 
I have certainly taken inspiration from her fidelity to her principles and absolute determination to fight , and fight again , when the cause is just . 
One of the true joys of my life in politics was the opportunity to have a quiet lunch with Thatcher in London some years ago , and express my gratitude to her for recognizing our chance for freedom and seizing the diplomatic initiative to help realize it . 
Throughout my premiership , I kept a quote of hers in mind : &quot; I am not a consensus politician ; 
I am a conviction politician . &quot; 
When Thatcher first expressed her belief in the potential of Gorbachev &apos;s pro-democracy reforms , I was a 24-year-old recent university graduate beginning my career . 
There was scant hope that my life would be better than that of my mother and , more dispiriting , even less hope that I would be able to build a better life for my young daughter . 
Thatcher &apos;s embrace of the cause of our freedom was electrifying for me . 
The great dissident writer Nadezhda Mandelstam had seen for us a future in which we could only &quot; hope against hope &quot; ; yet here was a leader who saw for us a future not of squalor and moral compromise , but of freedom and opportunity . 
I still shake my head in wonder that she could embrace the abandoned hope of liberation when almost no one else - not even Gorbachev - could even imagine it . 
But , of course , Thatcher understood freedom , because it was in her very sinews . 
She was assuredly not for turning , but she also was not for taking orders or settling for the restricted life that her society seemed to hold in store for her . 
In a Britain where social class still typically determined one &apos;s destiny , the grocer &apos;s daughter from the north made her way to Oxford and starred as a student of chemistry . 
Then she dared to enter the exclusive male preserve of politics . 
When she became the first woman to be British Prime Minister , she fired the ambitions of countless young women around the world ( including mine ) . 
We could dream big because of her example . 
And , as a woman , Thatcher knew that she brought something unique to the corridors of power . 
As she said on taking office in 1979 , &quot; Any woman who understands the problems of running a home will be nearer to understanding the problems of running a country . &quot; 
That common-sense fusion of family values and fiscal probity set an example for every elected leader who has followed her . 
Of course , I well understand that many in Britain felt left behind by the economic and social revolution that Thatcher unleashed . 
But the entire point of Thatcherism , as I understood it from afar , was to create conditions in which everyone could work hard and achieve their dreams . 
That is what I - and all of Ukraine &apos;s democrats - want for our country : a society of opportunity , under the rule of law and not under the thumb of cronies and oligarchs , in an open Europe . 
The record speaks for itself . 
Before Thatcher &apos;s premiership , Britain was widely considered the &quot; sick man of Europe &quot; - afflicted by stifling regulation , high unemployment , constant strikes , and chronic budget deficits . 
When she stepped down 11 years later ( the country &apos;s longest-serving prime minister since Lord Liverpool left office in 1827 ) Britain was among Europe &apos;s - and the world &apos;s - most dynamic economies . 
As a result , we are all Thatcherites now .
