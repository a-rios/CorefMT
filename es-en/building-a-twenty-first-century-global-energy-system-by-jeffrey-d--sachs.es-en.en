Paths to Sustainable Power 
NEW YORK - The surest bet on the future of energy is the need for low-carbon energy supplies . 
Around 80 % of the world &apos;s primary energy today is carbon based : coal , oil , and gas . 
We will need to shift to no- or low-carbon energy by mid-century . 
The big questions are how and when . 
Low-carbon primary energy means three options : renewable energy , including wind , solar , geothermal , hydropower , and biomass ; nuclear energy ; and carbon capture and sequestration , which means using fossil fuels to create energy , but trapping the CO2 emissions that result and storing the carbon safely underground . 
There are three compelling reasons for the world to make the shift to low-carbon energy . 
First , higher levels of CO2 are making the world &apos;s oceans acidic . 
If we continue with business as usual , we will end up destroying a vast amount of marine life , severely damaging the food chains on which we rely . 
Second , CO2 is dangerously changing the world &apos;s climate , even if many Big Oil interests would have us believe otherwise . 
( So , too , did the tobacco companies spend vast sums on political lobbying and bogus science to deny the links between smoking and lung cancer . ) 
Third , we face steeply rising prices for fossil fuels , as developing countries &quot; growth drives up demand and conventional supplies of coal , oil , and gas are depleted . 
Sure , we can find more fossil fuels , but at much higher cost and at much greater environmental risk from industrial spills , waste products , leaks , and other damage . 
Even the much-heralded shale-gas revolution is a lot of hype - similar to the gold rushes and stock bubbles of the past . 
Shale-gas wells deplete far more rapidly than conventional fields do . 
And they are environmentally dirty to boot . 
The United States has developed many new low-carbon energy technologies , but other countries are currently far more intent , far-sighted , and decisive than the US to put these technologies to large-scale use . 
Politically , America is still the land of Big Oil . 
Americans are bombarded by industry-funded media downplaying climate change , while countries that are much poorer in fossil fuels are already making the necessary transition to a low-carbon future . 
Two neighbors in Europe , Germany and France , are showing the way forward - or , more precisely , the alternative ways forward - to a low-carbon future . 
They are going about it in ways that reflect their different resource endowments , industrial histories , and political pressures . 
Germany is undertaking the Energiewende , or transition to sustainable energy - a remarkable effort ( indeed , unprecedented for a large advanced economy ) to meet the country &apos;s entire energy demand with renewable energy , especially solar and wind power . 
Meanwhile , France relies heavily on low-carbon nuclear power , and is switching rapidly to electric vehicles , such as the pioneering Renault-Nissan Leaf . 
Of the two approaches , Germany &apos;s is the more unusual bet . 
After Japan &apos;s nuclear disaster at Fukushima , Germany decided to shut down its entire nuclear power industry and shift entirely to a strategy based on greater energy efficiency ( lower energy input per unit of national income ) and renewables . 
There really is no clear roadmap for such a huge energy transformation , and Germany almost surely will need to rely on a European-wide electricity grid to share clean energy , and eventually on imported solar power from North Africa and the Middle East . 
France &apos;s bet on nuclear power is a more proven option . 
After all , most of France &apos;s electricity has come from nuclear power for many years . 
And , though anti-nuclear sentiment is very strong in Europe - and , increasingly , even in France - nuclear power will remain part of the global energy mix for decades to come , simply because much of Asia ( including China , India , South Korea , and Japan ) will remain major users of it . 
The key point is that France and Germany , and many other European countries - including the Scandinavian countries , with their considerable wind and hydropower potential - are all recognizing that the world as a whole will have to move away from a fossil-fuel-based energy system . 
That is the right calculation . 
Many will no doubt argue about which alternative - France &apos;s bet on nuclear power or Germany &apos;s solar pathway - is wiser . 
But both strategies are probably correct . 
Most studies show that deep de-carbonization of the world economy from now to mid-century , a time horizon mandated by environmental realities , will require that all low-carbon options - including greater efficiency and renewables - be scaled up massively . 
One of the highest priorities of the new Sustainable Development Solutions Network , which I direct on behalf of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , will be to elaborate alternative pathways to a low-carbon economy , taking into account the specific conditions of countries around the world . 
Different countries will choose different strategies , but we will all need to get to the same place : a new energy system built on low-carbon sources , electrification of vehicles , and smart , energy-efficient buildings and cities . 
Early movers may pay a slightly higher price today for these strategies , but they and the world will reap long-term economic and environmental benefits . 
By embracing truly sustainable technologies , France , Germany , and others are creating the energy system that will increasingly support the world economy throughout this century .
