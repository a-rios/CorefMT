The Stressed-Out Brain 
NEW YORK - Stress contributes to the onset of cardiovascular disease and depression , among other illnesses . 
This burden of chronic stress , called &quot; allostatic overload , &quot; reflects not only the impact of life experiences but also our genetic constitution . 
Moreover , individual habits such as diet , exercise , the quality and quantity of sleep , and substance abuse also play a major role , as do early life experiences that set life-long patterns of behavior and physiological reactivity . 
There are three categories of stress : 
· Positive stress , for which a person feels rewarded by surmounting a challenge . 
· Tolerable stress , which results from serious life events - for example , divorce , death of a loved one , loss of a job - but where the affected person has good support systems . 
· Toxic stress , which involves the same types of serious events , as well as the accumulation of daily struggles , but without good support systems . 
The difference between tolerable and toxic stress depends on the perceived degree of control that a person experiences . 
Moreover , low self-esteem exacerbates a feeling of helplessness and lack of control . 
Social support by friends and family is vital to ameliorating the effects of tolerable stress and keeping it from becoming toxic . 
These are all functions of the brain - the key organ in our response to stress . 
The brain interprets what is threatening and , therefore , stressful ; regulates behavioral and physiological stress responses - the latter through the autonomic , immune , and neuroendocrine systems ; and is a target of stress , undergoing structural and functional remodeling of its circuits that affects its performance . 
This remodeling includes limited replacement of neurons in the hippocampus , a brain region important for spatial memory and memory of events in our daily lives . 
The recognition of the brain &apos;s vulnerability and plasticity under stress began with investigations of the hippocampus , and it now includes the amygdala , a brain region involved in fear , anxiety , and mood , and the prefrontal cortex , which is important in decision making , memory , and top-down control of impulsive behavior , as well as regulation of the autonomic nervous system and stress hormone axis . 
Repeated stress causes neurons in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex to shrink and lose connections with other nerve cells , while it also causes neurons in the amygdala to grow and form new connections . 
Because the remodeling of neurons by stress is reversible , researchers now believe that chronic anxiety disorders and depression represent a lack of resilience , or spontaneous recovery , in susceptible individuals . 
Such a lack of recovery then requires medication , behavioral interventions , or both . 
Hormones associated with stress protect the body and brain in the short run and promote adaptation , but the chronic activity of these same hormones brings about changes in the body that cause allostatic overload , along with its potential follow-on diseases . 
For example , the immune system is enhanced by acute stress but suppressed by chronic stress . 
By the same token , the brain shows enhanced activity during acute stress , with improvement in certain types of memory , but undergoes structural changes that increase anxiety and decrease mental flexibility and memory capacity as a result of chronic stress . 
Developmental influences involving the quality of parenting and acquisition of attachment have a powerful influence on subsequent stress vulnerability during the rest of our lives - for example , abuse and neglect in childhood increase our vulnerability to physical and mental disorders , including obesity , cardiovascular disease , depression , post-traumatic stress disorder , substance abuse , and antisocial behavior . 
Among the most potent causes of stress in adult life are those arising from competitive interactions between animals of the same species , leading to the formation of dominance hierarchies . 
Psychosocial stress of this type not only alters cognitive function in lower-ranking animals , but it can also promote disease ( for example , atherosclerosis ) among those vying for the dominant position . 
Social ordering in human society is associated with gradients of disease , with an increasing frequency of mortality and morbidity as one descends the scale of socioeconomic status , which reflects both income and education . 
Although the causes of these gradients of health are very complex , they are likely to reflect , with increasing frequency at the lower end of the scale , the cumulative burden of coping with limited resources and stressors as well as differences in lifestyle , and the resulting allostatic overload that this burden places on the physiological systems involved in adaptation and coping . 
The brain &apos;s response to stress does not necessarily constitute &quot; damage &quot; per se and is amenable to reversal as well as prevention by treatments that include drugs , exercise , diet , and social support . 
This may occur through policies that improve education , provide better housing , improve commuting , regulate working conditions , increase availability of health foods , and provide tax relief for those in the lower and middle classes . 
Such policies might well prevent disease , thereby saving money , reducing human suffering , and promoting healthier and more meaningful lives .
