France &apos;s Identity Politics 
One big surprise of the current presidential campaign in France is how &quot; national identity &quot; has surged to the forefront of the political debate . 
During the 1995 presidential campaign , the main issues were unemployment and social divisions . 
In 2002 , the priority was security . 
But the three main candidates this time around - Nicolas Sarkozy , Ségolène Royal , and François Bayrou - have given an entirely different shape to this campaign . 
Sarkozy , for example , proposes to establish a ministry of immigration and national identity . 
Likewise , while Royal carefully maintains the distinction between nation and nationalism , she is drifting away from the Socialist Party &apos;s old embrace of The Internationale , instead defending La Marseillaise and suggesting that all citizens should display a French flag on the National Day . 
Bayrou criticizes the &quot; nationalist obsession &quot; of his competitors , but he supports abrogating the jus soli ( the right to obtain French nationality by birth ) for people from the French island of Mayotte , owing to massive inflows of pregnant women to the island . 
For his part , the far-right leader , Jean-Marie Le Pen , says that he is very happy with this evolution . 
Indeed , the debate over national identity is nothing new . 
The problem is that French identity has always been made up of contradictory and sometimes adversarial elements , such as France &apos;s Catholic and secular traditions , its revolutionary ideology and conservative inclinations , and the cultural outlooks of its rural and working-class citizens . 
The historian Ernest Renan , who pondered about national identity after France &apos;s 1871 defeat in the Franco-Prussian War , has defined the nation as a &quot; soul &quot; made up of two parts . 
One part , the &quot; rich inheritance of memories , &quot; is rooted in the past , while the other , related to the present and opening the way to the future , consists in the common will of citizens to build their public life together . 
Renan gave priority to this will for a common life over any ethnic definition and set the French idea of the nation in direct contrast to the almost racial notion of people ( Volk ) that dominates the German tradition . 
In this view , national identity , is a &quot; spiritual concept &quot; based on a common history and set of values . 
Some of these values are rooted in a kind of secular Christianity , and others in the Enlightenment &apos;s revolutionary beliefs about human rights , equality , the French language , secular schooling , and the idea that the state is responsible for the common interest and application of republican principles . 
It is this view of national identity - one that transcends race , color , origin and religion - that is now disputed . 
The identity crisis now roiling France is fueled by the conjunction of many factors : globalization , which produces uncertainty , the European Union , which curtails the freedom of national leaders , American strategic dominance , which has reduced France &apos;s position in the world , and the rising Asian powers . 
This represents a serious challenge to thinkers who sometimes ridicule the idea of the nation itself , arguing that we now inhabit a &quot; post-national &quot; world . 
For them , national identity should be abandoned in favor of a European identity , even if the feeling of belonging to Europe is not deeply held among the peoples of the EU . 
Instead , the link between identity and immigration , an old refrain of the far right , remains strong , and the issue has grown more heated because of France &apos;s inability to develop an effective policy to integrate immigrants from Africa . 
Making matters worse , while religion and culture have traditionally been restricted to the personal sphere in France , some religious demands have intruded into public life , as demonstrated by the disputes over Muslim girls &quot; wearing of veils in schools . 
The problem of the link between national identity and cultural pluralism is now surfacing in nearly the same way in the United Kingdom , Holland , and Denmark - countries that , contrary to France , long ago chose a policy of multiculturalism . 
In the United States , a country of huge immigration , communities can bring together a strong cultural identity and a deeply engrained patriotism . 
It has been the same in France , which has been built by successive waves of immigrants . 
But , contrary to the US , integration in France is not based on assimilation , but on a desire to promote homogeneity - the nation unified as &quot; one and indivisible . &quot; 
Today , in a world changed by globalization , France must face the difficult challenge posed by its new immigrants : maintaining the principles at the core of French identity while meeting the desire of some of its new citizens to maintain their own identity , which may in fact oppose some of those principles . 
Today &apos;s debate over national identity arises from this tension , so it &apos;s not surprising that it has become a central issue of the presidential campaign . 
But what is at stake in that debate are values that not only built France , but that also have built and will continue to build Europe .
