The Wrong Growth Strategy for Japan 
CAMBRIDGE - Japan &apos;s new government , led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , could be about to shoot itself in the foot . 
Seeking to boost economic growth , the authorities may soon destroy their one great advantage : the low rate of interest on government debt and private borrowing . 
If that happens , Japanese conditions will most likely be worse at the end of Abe &apos;s term than they are today . 
The interest rate on Japan &apos;s ten-year government bonds is now less than 1 % - the lowest in the world , despite a very high level of government debt and annual budget deficits . 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s debt is now roughly 230 % of GDP , higher than that of Greece ( 175 % of GDP ) and nearly twice that of Italy ( 125 % of GDP ) . 
The annual budget deficit is nearly 10 % of GDP , higher than any of the eurozone countries . 
With nominal GDP stagnating , that deficit is causing the debt / GDP ratio to rise by 10 % annually . 
Japan &apos;s government is able to pay such a low rate of interest because domestic prices have been falling for more than a decade , while the yen has been strengthening against other major currencies . 
Domestic deflation means that the real interest rate on Japanese bonds is higher than the nominal rate . 
The yen &apos;s rising value raises the yield on Japanese bonds relative to the yield on bonds denominated in other currencies . 
That may be about to come to an end . 
Abe has demanded that the Bank of Japan pursue a quantitative-easing strategy that will deliver an inflation rate of 2-3 % and weaken the yen . 
He will soon appoint a new BOJ governor and two deputy governors , who will , one presumes , be committed to this goal . 
The financial markets are taking Abe &apos;s strategy seriously . 
The yen &apos;s value against the US dollar has declined by more than 7 % in the last month . 
With the euro rising relative to the dollar , the yen &apos;s fall relative to the euro has been even greater . 
The yen &apos;s weakening will mean higher import costs , and therefore a higher rate of inflation . 
An aggressive BOJ policy of money creation could cause further weakening of the yen &apos;s exchange rate - and a rise in domestic prices that is more rapid than what Abe wants . 
With Japanese prices rising and the yen falling relative to other currencies , investors will be willing to hold Japanese government bonds ( JGBs ) only if their nominal yield is significantly higher than it has been in the past . 
A direct effect of the higher interest rate would be to increase the budget deficit and the rate of growth of government debt . 
With a debt / GDP ratio of 230 % , a four-percentage-point rise in borrowing costs would cause the annual deficit to double , to 20 % of GDP . 
The government might be tempted to rely on rapid inflation to try to reduce the real value of its debt . 
Fear of that strategy could cause investors to demand even higher real interest rates . 
The combination of exploding debt and rising interest rates is a recipe for economic disaster . 
The BOJ &apos;s widely respected governor , Masaaki Shirakawa , whose term expires in April , summarized the situation in his usual restrained way , saying that &quot; long-term interest rates may spike and have a negative effect on the economy . &quot; 
A spike in long-term rates would lower the price of JGBs , destroying household wealth and , in turn , reducing consumer spending . 
The higher interest rates would also apply to corporate bonds and bank loans , weakening business investment . 
Even without the prospect of faster inflation and a declining yen , fundamental conditions in Japan point to higher interest rates . 
The Japanese government has been able to sell its bonds to domestic buyers because of the high rate of domestic saving . 
The excess of saving over investment has given Japan a current-account surplus , allowing the country to finance all of the government borrowing domestically , with enough left over to invest in dollar-denominated bonds and other foreign securities . 
But that is coming to an end . 
The household saving rate has collapsed in recent years , falling to less than 2 % . 
The combination of high corporate saving and low business investment has sustained the current-account surplus , allowing Japan to fund its budget deficit domestically . 
But the surplus has fallen sharply in the past five years , from roughly 6 % of GDP in 2007 to only 1 % now . 
With a falling rate of household saving and the prospect of new fiscal deficits , the current account will soon be negative , forcing Japan to sell its debt to foreign buyers . 
Abe plans to supplement the easy-money strategy with an increase in government spending of some $ 120 billion , or 2 % of GDP . 
It is not clear why Abe and his advisers believe that this will deliver sustained real GDP growth of 2 % a year . 
Although the $ 120 billion is presumably just for the current year ( if the spending can be made to happen that quickly ) , he also spoke during his campaign about a ten-year rise in government spending of Â¥ 200 trillion yen , substantially more than the $ 120 billion annual rate . 
The impact of all of this on the national debt and on Japan &apos;s interest rates could be staggering . 
Abe is right about one thing : Japan needs to get out of its no-growth and deflationary trap . 
But the policies that he favors are not the way to do it .
