Will the TPP Help Latin America ? 
SANTIAGO - With the International Monetary Fund having just cut its forecasts for economic growth in Latin America for the fifth year in a row , the region &apos;s countries are casting about for ways to reignite investment and boost productivity . 
They should look to fast-growing Asia , argue advocates of the Transpacific Trade Partnership ( TPP ) , the proposed mega-regional trade accord that would bind together 12 Pacific Rim countries . 
But should they ? 
If done right , the TPP could help Mexico , Peru , and Chile - the accord &apos;s Latin American members - make the leap to high-productivity exports based on innovation . 
But that would require the TPP to foster , not impede , the flow of knowledge around the Pacific Rim . 
Regrettably , the United States is insisting on a series of intellectual-property provisions that serve the interests of US-based firms , but do little to create a sound environment for innovation elsewhere . 
That needs to change - and soon - so that years of talks can be concluded successfully . 
The growth challenges for the three Latin American TPP countries are very different . 
In the last two decades , Mexico has managed to diversify its export base and is now a major supplier of industrial goods to the US and Canada . 
The bad news is that Mexico &apos;s growth prospects have become inextricably tied to those of its huge neighbor to the north . 
The good news is that the US is growing faster than any other major industrialized economy , so Mexico can look forward - according to the IMF - to a couple of years of accelerating economic expansion . 
Peru and Chile , by contrast , are natural-resource exporters that derived huge benefits from the China-driven commodity boom of the last decade . 
Because it is difficult to become ever-more efficient at producing a ton of copper or a pound of fruit ( and , in Chile &apos;s case , the grade of copper ore is fast declining ) , further growth has to come from diversification : moving capital and labor to new sectors , where productivity is higher . 
That is where Pacific Rim trade and the TPP come in . 
A firm in Thailand , the Philippines , or Vietnam can develop a new product line by plugging into the huge East Asian value chain and producing , for example , a tiny component which , along with myriad other components , will be assembled into a smartphone at a factory in China . 
Firms in Chile or Peru - or Colombia or Uruguay , for that matter - enjoy no such opportunities . 
South America is outside the world &apos;s main value chains . 
The TPP could help change this by easing trade in intermediate inputs and helping build Pacific-wide value chains . 
Particularly valuable would be straightening out the spaghetti bowl of &quot; rules of origin &quot; - the regulations dictating when inputs produced in other countries can be used in products that will qualify for free-trade benefits . 
So far so good . 
Optimists can envision a new generation of trans-Pacific flows of trade , investment , and knowledge , with benefits for all . 
But then the TPP &apos;s boosters have to contend with the obstinacy of Japanese rice farmers ( Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is vowing to address that ) and of US patent and copyright holders . 
Intellectual property has become one of the most contentious issues in the TPP negotiations , and it is not hard to see why . 
The US is pushing for longer copyright protection for published works , music , and films . 
It also wants technical changes that would effectively mean much longer patent terms for pharmaceuticals , make the approval process lengthier for generic drug makers , and extend protections for biologic medicines . 
The list of controversial US demands is long . 
There are also concerns about limits to freedom of expression if materials are taken down for alleged copyright violations . 
Many of these provisions are absent from international agreements currently in force - such as the World Trade Organization &apos;s TRIPS accord - and from the bilateral free-trade agreements that the US itself has negotiated with a host of countries . 
In other cases , protection periods would rise considerably . 
For copyrights , the US is demanding 95 years of protection after publication , or 120 years after creation , whereas TRIPS provides for 50 years and US agreements with Australia , Chile , Korea and Peru specify 70 years . 
No one disagrees with the need for strong intellectual-property protection . 
If inventors cannot expect to be rewarded for their achievements , they will stop inventing or investors will stop funding their ventures . 
But most economists agree that such incentives must be balanced against the need to accelerate knowledge dissemination and absorption , and that the optimum is somewhere in the middle . 
In this sense , the US demand for longer terms of patent and copyright protection is arbitrary , because they are not founded on a clear-cut case for enhanced economic efficiency . 
The politics of the issue is tricky for the TPP &apos;s Latin American members . 
Why should that change now ? 
The conundrum is especially vexing for Chile , a country that already has bilateral trade agreements with every potential member of the TPP . 
If Chile is unlikely to gain substantial new market access , ask critics , why should Chile make trade concessions at all ? 
That is going too far . 
Precisely because of the urgent need to diversify their exports , Chile , Peru , and other middle-income countries could benefit tremendously from agreements like the TPP . 
But that potential will be realized only if more knowledge , not less , flows across member countries &quot; borders . 
The US itself would benefit from having trade partners that can innovate , instead of serving only as passive buyers for American movies and songs . 
The sooner US trade negotiators understand that , the better for everyone .
