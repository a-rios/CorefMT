The G-7 Embraces Decarbonization 
NEW YORK - This week &apos;s G-7 meeting at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps marked a major breakthrough in climate-change policy . 
The seven largest high-income economies ( the United States , Japan , Germany , the United Kingdom , France , Italy , and Canada ) made the revolutionary decision to decarbonize their economies during this century . 
For the first time in history , the major rich economies have agreed on the need to end their dependence on fossil fuels . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , US President Barack Obama , and the other G-7 leaders have risen to the occasion and deserve strong global approbation . 
The historic breakthrough is recorded in the final G-7 communiqué . 
First , the G-7 countries underscored the importance of holding global warming to below 2 ° Celsius ( 3.6 ° Fahrenheit ) . 
This means that the Earth &apos;s average temperature should be kept within 2 ° C of the average temperature that prevailed before the start of the Industrial Revolution ( roughly before 1800 ) . 
Yet the global warming to date is already around 0.9 ° C - nearly half way to the upper limit . 
Then , the G-7 leaders did something unprecedented . 
They acknowledged that in order to hold global warming below the 2 ° C limit , the world &apos;s economies must end their dependence on fossil fuels ( coal , oil , and natural gas ) . 
Currently , around 80 % of worldwide primary energy comes from fossil fuels , the combustion of which emits around 34 billion tons of carbon dioxide . 
This level of emissions , if continued in future decades , would push temperatures far above the 2 ° C upper limit . 
Indeed , with rising worldwide energy use , continued dependence on fossil fuels could raise global temperatures by 4-6 ° C , leading to potentially catastrophic consequences for global food production , higher sea levels , mega-droughts , major floods , devastating heat waves , and extreme storms . 
The science is clearer than many politicians would like . 
For humanity to have a &quot; likely &quot; chance ( at least two-thirds ) of staying below the 2 ° C threshold , a small reduction in CO2 emissions will not be enough . 
In fact , emissions will have to fall to zero later this century to stop any further rise in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 . 
Simply put , the world economy must be &quot; decarbonized . &quot; 
The breakthrough at the G-7 summit was that the seven governments recognized this , declaring that the 2 ° C limit requires &quot; decarbonization of the global economy over the course of this century . &quot; 
The G-7 finally stated clearly what scientists have been urging for years : humanity must not merely reduce , but must end , CO2 emissions from fossil fuels this century . 
Decarbonization is feasible , though by no means easy . 
It depends on taking three key steps . 
First , we must become more energy efficient , for example , through modern building designs that reduce the needs for heating , cooling , and energy-intensive ventilation . 
Second , we must produce electricity with wind , solar , nuclear , hydroelectric , geothermal , and other non-carbon energy sources , or by capturing and storing the CO2 produced by fossil fuels ( a process known as CCS ) . 
Third , we must switch from fossil fuels to electricity ( or hydrogen produced by zero-carbon electricity ) or in some cases ( such as aviation ) to advanced biofuels . 
The hard part is the practical , large-scale implementation of broad concepts in a way that does not disrupt our energy-dependent world economy and does not cost a fortune to achieve . 
But as we tally these costs , we need to keep in mind that runaway climate change would impose the greatest costs of all . 
To succeed , we will need several decades to convert power stations , infrastructure , and building stock to low-carbon technologies , and we will need to upgrade the low-carbon technologies themselves , whether PV solar cells , or batteries for energy storage , or CCS for safely storing CO2 , or nuclear power plants that win the public &apos;s confidence . 
The G-7 , notably , committed to &quot; developing and deploying innovative technologies striving for a transformation of the energy sectors by 2050 &quot; and invited &quot; all countries to join us in this endeavor . &quot; 
This global process of decarbonization will be long and complex , and it will require detailed roadmaps with periodic redesigns as technologies evolve . 
Here , too , the G-7 made a historic breakthrough by declaring its readiness to &quot; develop long-term national low-carbon strategies &quot; to get to a decarbonized future . 
The United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network ( SDSN ) , which I direct on behalf of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , has been working on such low-carbon strategies for the main emitting countries in a project called the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project . 
Of course , the G-7 declaration is only a declaration , and it does not yet include the commitments of many of the world &apos;s largest CO2-emitting countries , including China , India , and Russia . 
Yet it is a crucial step that will greatly encourage other countries to participate in deep decarbonization as well , especially in view of the G-7 &quot; s commitment to speed the development of improved low-carbon technologies . 
The outcome of the G-7 &quot; s meeting augurs well for a strong global agreement on climate change when all 193 UN member states meet in Paris in December to hammer out a truly global climate agreement . 
The G-7 countries have not yet ensured a successful outcome at the Paris meeting , but they have taken a big step toward that goal .
