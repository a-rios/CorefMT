Gays and the New Public Philosophy 
LONDON - With humanity &apos;s millennia-old focus on collective survival no longer a primary concern , a few fortunate societies in the West have become preoccupied with matters of human , or individual , rights . 
In recent decades , we have experienced a second flowering of the individualism associated with such nineteenth-century thinkers as John Stuart Mill . 
The rights of the individual were submerged by the horrors of the first half of the twentieth century . 
Indeed , if the West can be said to have a public philosophy nowadays , it is a philosophy of human rights . 
A small but significant example of this is the United Kingdom &apos;s recent debate in Parliament of a bill recognizing the right to same-sex marriage , which follows a decision taken in France this spring to legalize same-sex marriage . 
Indeed , the UK is something of a latecomer : thirteen countries already allow gay marriage , and the usually conservative current US Supreme Court recently struck down the &quot; Defense of Marriage Act , &quot; adopted in 1996 explicitly to ban gay marriages , and a law prohibiting gay marriage in California . 
Only in 2004 were British gays allowed to form &quot; civil partnerships &quot; - relationships with the same legal status as marriage , but denied the title . 
This did not settle the matter ; the passion for human rights simply moved to the next level . 
Denial of gay couples &quot; legal right to call themselves married is - has become - intolerably discriminatory . 
The parliamentary debate that has preceded the likely passage of this legislation revealed a classic case of an institution ( marriage ) coming into conflict with a cause ( human rights ) . 
Both opponents and supporters of the bill concede that marriage has changed in various ways over time . 
They also agree that a central core has remained constant . 
The chief argument of those opposed to the bill is that marriage has always meant a lifelong union aimed at procreation and child-rearing . 
This is its &quot; normative &quot; meaning - the best that the human race has come up with to secure its survival . 
As such , marriage is inescapably to a member of the opposite sex . 
Against this , supporters of same-sex marriage argue that the one constant that defines the married state is a loving couple &apos;s commitment to &quot; share their journey . &quot; 
Love and commitment are the only relevant criteria . 
It is simply unfair to withhold the status of marriage from those who want to make this public vow . 
Many and ingenious have been the attempts to split the difference . 
In the House of Lords , Lord Mackay of Clashfern , a former Lord Chancellor , moved an amendment requiring the bill to distinguish between marriage ( same sex ) and marriage ( opposite sex ) . 
The common word marriage , he argued , would remove any discrimination , but the brackets would recognize that the two states were different . 
Supporters of the bill allowing same-sex marriage pooh-poohed &quot; marriage in brackets . &quot; 
With the defeat of the Clashfern amendment by 314 votes to 119 , much of the bill &apos;s original form remains intact . 
Churches would not be required to consecrate same-sex unions , or teachers to promote them ( against their conscience ) ; but , as far as the state is concerned , marriage would be gender-blind . 
The arguments on both sides have been of high quality , especially in the House of Lords . 
On the lexicographic point , opponents of same-sex marriage are surely right . 
Historically , marriage has not been , as one peer described it , an &quot; elongated envelope , &quot; into which any expression of love and commitment can be packed . 
It is not so regarded in contemporary Britain ; and even less so in the non-Western world , where unions of men and women are considered the norm . 
But there is a glaring weakness in the arguments of the bill &apos;s opponents : while they hint darkly at the &quot; unintended consequences &quot; of legalizing same-sex marriage , they cannot spell out exactly what these consequences would be . 
It is not obvious that &quot; normal &quot; marriage , procreation , or child-rearing would be threatened by this &quot; add on . &quot; 
In fact , opponents of the bill fail to mention that traditional marriage is in a fairly advanced state of decay in Western societies . 
Fewer and fewer people are bothering to get married , and marriage is regarded less and less as a lifelong union . 
Families are having fewer and fewer children , and more and more children are born out of wedlock . 
So one of the &quot; unintended consequences &quot; of the bill might be to add welcome recruits to the ranks of the married , even if these recruits are of a historically unusual kind . 
After much soul-searching , I voted for the bill , though without any acute sense that I was striking a blow for freedom . 
There is a clear status benefit to the minority ; no obvious harm is being done to the majority ; and the long-term consequences are unfathomable . 
In the end , it seemed a no-brainer . 
Yet it left me uncomfortable . 
Every institution , Mill wrote in On Liberty , had to justify its keep ; if it could not , it deserved to be swept away . 
But what counts as justification ? 
The very institution in which I sit , the House of Lords , has no rational justification in terms of its composition or powers , as reformers have been quick to point out . 
At the least , prudence should give the reformer pause .
