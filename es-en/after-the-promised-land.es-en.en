After the Promised Land 
LONDON - At the height of the Arab uprisings last spring , many Europeans were gripped by nightmare visions of a tsunami of migrants crashing against the continent &apos;s shores . 
The wave never hit , but its specter fed a tenacious anti-immigrant populism that has concealed an important new trend : migration to Europe - and to the United States - has largely stalled . 
In many countries , more immigrants are leaving than are arriving , owing mainly to the economic crisis that has drained jobs in the West . 
That reversal is one of the great under-reported stories of 2011 ( and of the preceding two years ) , and the numbers are startling . 
Consider Spain , which is on track to lose more than a half-million residents by 2020 . 
By contrast , between 2002 and 2008 , Spain &apos;s population grew by 700,000 a year , driven largely by immigration . 
The trends are similar elsewhere in Europe . 
While this fact alone will not quiet opponents of immigration , it does give countries more breathing room to repair and strengthen badly broken systems for receiving and integrating newcomers . 
Although rapidly aging Western countries are unable to attract the immigrants they need , they allow millions who are already there to suffer discrimination and abuse . 
Detentions and deportations take place under sometimes terrible conditions . 
Meanwhile , the international community collectively fails to protect vast populations of vulnerable migrants , such as the millions stranded by the recent conflicts in North Africa . 
Undoubtedly , rising anti-immigrant populism must be confronted . 
While polling suggests that attitudes are influenced more by ethnicity than religion , both help to define identities and mindsets . 
Political parties in France , Switzerland , and the Netherlands ( to name a few ) have run successful campaigns that scapegoat immigrants . 
Moreover , governments from Alabama to Hungary are passing laws that undermine what should be migrants &quot; rights . 
Italy recently adopted harsh &quot; emergency &quot; decrees that target migrants by making undocumented entry and residence a criminal offense . 
Anti-immigrant rhetoric from the political extremes has fed into mainstream political discourse . 
European leaders trip over themselves to declare , one more forcefully than the next , that multiculturalism is dead . 
Dutch politician Geert Wilders , whose Freedom Party is informally part of the governing coalition , did them one better by being charged with incitement to anti-Muslim hatred . 
In the US , alligator-filled moats and electrified border fences have featured in the current presidential campaign . 
Such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political gratification , but their net result is to cleave societies whose cohesion is already seriously challenged by the economic crisis . 
Growing discrimination in employment , housing , and education affects not just immigrants and their children ; it harms our societies as a whole . 
With the lull in net immigration , we now have a window of opportunity to address these shortcomings . 
Debunking the myths about migration - that most immigrants enter unlawfully , for example , or that immigration displaces existing workers - would be a good place to start . 
It would also be useful to explain that immigration is necessary for prosperity and growth in almost all OECD countries . 
If aging societies in the West and elsewhere ( like Japan ) fail to get immigration right , they will be woefully unprepared when they confront the real tidal wave : the retirement of baby boomers in the coming two decades . 
The gaps in these countries &quot; labor markets - from software specialists to physicians to home health aides - will be immense . 
The European Union &apos;s labor force will decline by almost 70 million workers in the next 40 years ; in the absence of significant net immigration ( combined with a much higher retirement age ) , European economies and social safety nets will shrivel . 
The priorities are clear . 
We need to understand better how our economies will evolve in the coming decades , and to redesign our educational systems to produce workers with usable skills . 
And , where it is clear that immigrants will be needed , we must be able to identify , welcome , integrate , and protect them . 
Meanwhile , our most fundamental institutions - schools , police , and the courts - must be re-engineered to reflect and respond to the diversity of our communities , which is now a fact of life . 
Countries must learn to work together to achieve these goals , few of which can be reached by going it alone . 
If our toolbox were empty , our inaction might be understandable . 
But examples of smart migration practices abound . 
Canada and the Philippines , for instance , have a well-functioning accord that protects the rights of temporary workers . 
Sweden has developed legislation that minimizes bureaucracy for companies that need foreign workers . 
And important advances have been made in ensuring that immigrant children receive the education that they need to become full members of society . 
Progress is being made on the global level as well , despite the economic crisis and populist headwinds . 
In June , the International Labor Organization &apos;s member states overwhelmingly approved the Domestic Workers Convention , which will significantly increase protections for a vulnerable group of workers - the majority of whom are migrants . 
Meanwhile , the Global Forum on Migration and Development , established in 2007 , has quickly become an important means of fostering knowledge and partnerships . 
The reason for growing international cooperation is simple : countries everywhere are affected by migration , and , increasingly , they are experiencing immigration and emigration simultaneously . 
Indeed , roughly one-third of migrants nowadays move between developed countries ; one-third move between developing countries ; and only one-third move from the developing to the developed world . 
Highly skilled workers , such as bankers and engineers , are flocking to China . 
Mexico , known primarily as a country of emigration , is home to millions of migrants from Central America . 
Millions of people in Southeast Asia venture to the Middle East to work , but millions more cross borders within the region . 
The list goes on . 
When it comes to migration , we are all in the same boat - and that boat is leaking . 
Starting in 2012 , countries should redouble their efforts to fix it .
