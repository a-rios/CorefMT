Reset Turkey / EU Relations 
MADRID - Just five months ago , Osama bin Laden was alive , Hosni Mubarak was firmly in control in Egypt , and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali ruled Tunisia with an iron hand . 
Today , popular rebellion and political change have spread throughout the region . 
We have witnessed brutal repression of protests in Syria and Yemen , Saudi troops crossing into Bahrain , and an ongoing battle for Libya . 
For Europe , the &quot; Arab Spring &quot; should refocus attention on an issue largely ignored in recent months : the benefits of Turkey &apos;s full membership in the European Union . 
Given the tremendous opportunities present in the current circumstances , the advantages for Europe of Turkey &apos;s accession should be obvious . 
With Recep Tayyip Erdoğan now elected to another term as Turkey &apos;s prime minister , and with Poland , a country well acquainted with the importance of Europe &apos;s strategic position in the world , assuming the EU presidency at the end of the month , now is a time for the Union and Turkey to &quot; reset &quot; their negotiations over Turkish membership . 
The good that Turkey can bring to Europe was visible even before the &quot; Arab Spring . &quot; 
Europe is , by definition , culturally diverse , so diversity is the EU &apos;s destiny . 
Europe today is both larger and different compared to the Europe of 1999 , when Turkey was invited to begin the accession process . 
It is also experiencing a profound economic crisis , which erupted around the same time that the Lisbon Treaty - aimed at accommodating EU enlargement - was finally approved . 
Had the treaty been approved in 2005 as intended , it would have been in place for six years , and the strain placed by the crisis on EU economic governance - so visible in the eurozone &apos;s recent problems - would have been much more manageable . 
But the EU always faces problems , resolves them , and moves on . 
Today , we don &apos;t have a treasury , but we are about to have something similar . 
Similarly , the European Central Bank has capacities today that no one imagined in , say , 1997 . 
A major challenge that Europe must still face is migration , which will only become a bigger problem over time . 
Between now and 2050 , Europe &apos;s workforce will decrease by 70 million . 
Maintaining our economy requires migration and open EU borders - and facing down the populist movements in Europe that would shun &quot; outsiders . &quot; 
Today &apos;s Turkey has also changed dramatically since 1999 , both politically and economically , and this has much to do with the EU accession process . 
Indeed , without the attraction of the EU - its &quot; soft &quot; power - such changes would not have occurred . 
Economically , Turkey is now in the G-20 - and playing an effective role there . 
With just-concluded parliamentary elections , and a new constitution to be approved , Turkey is approaching an epochal moment . 
I was a member of the Spanish Constitutional Commission that wrote the Spanish constitution in 1975 and 1976 , following the death of Franco , so I know what it is to move from dictatorship to democracy - and how important it is that a constitution be framed by consensus . 
The EU-Turkey relationship began with an association agreement signed in 1963 . 
Now the accession negotiations have started , and 35 &quot; chapters &quot; - covering everything from agriculture to energy , competition , environment , employment , social policy , and beyond - must be opened . 
We have already opened 19 chapters - fewer than we would like . 
In fact , in the second half of 2010 , nothing happened . 
I hope that meaningful progress comes in 2011 . 
Turkey and the EU need each other . 
The EU now accounts for 75 % of foreign investment in Turkey and roughly half its exports and inward tourism . 
Likewise , Europe &apos;s energy security depends on cooperation with Turkey on transit of oil and natural gas from Central Asia and the Middle East . 
We need each other politically as well . 
Turkey &apos;s neighborhood is our neighborhood ; its problems are our problems . 
The security benefits and strategic advantages for the EU with Turkey as a member would be many , starting with the relationship between the EU and NATO , of which Turkey has long been a member . 
Likewise , the EU &apos;s involvement in today &apos;s problems in the Mediterranean region would be much easier in concert with Turkey . 
In Bosnia-Herzegovina , EU-Turkey cooperation is fundamental to achieving a durable solution . 
In 1999 , Turkey did not want to become an accession candidate , because its leaders thought that the conditions would be too tough . 
I talked to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit at midnight , then to President Süleyman Demirel . 
And we said : Turkey will be an EU member . 
I supported the signature of that document ; 
In these times , difficult and unpredictable but full of hope , the world needs Turkey and the EU to work together . 
That does not mean meeting every now and then to decide how to handle a certain problem . 
It means something much deeper and well defined . It means Turkey &apos;s admission to the EU . 
That is my dream , and I will continue to fight to make it a reality .
