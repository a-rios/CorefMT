Crouching Tiger or Paper Dragon ? 
When a senior defense expert recently testified before a US Congressional commission on China &apos;s military capability , he detailed the extraordinarily robust weapons program the People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) has been pursuing . 
He pointed particularly to the PLA &apos;s increasing number of short- , intermediate- and even long-range ballistic missiles . 
But the expert concluded that , despite the alarming number of missiles , they did not constitute a &quot; buildup . &quot; 
Baffled by that conclusion , the Congressmen began asking one question relentlessly : if the existing PLA missiles did not constitute a &quot; buildup , &quot; then what number of missiles would ? 
The inability to answer this question clearly exorcised and angered both the senior expert and the committee . 
But this episode illustrates a fundamental and frustrating problem : the more we know about what is going on in China the less we are sure about whether China has actually become a threat . 
We know China has doubled and redoubled its defense budget for , among other things , a massive weapons development program , including modernizing a deterrent and second-strike nuclear capability . 
Yet we cannot decide whether this build-up is menacing . 
The prevailing consensus is not to regard China as a threat . 
But there are several serious conceptual flaws in this reasoning . 
It fails , for example , to take into account the hostile strategic culture against the US - and against US strategic goals in the Asian and Pacific regions -  that has long been ingrained within the PLA . 
Moreover , a cursory glance at the PLA &apos;s readiness training , research and development , weapons acquisition , and indoctrination programs shows that Chinese officials are preparing to fight future wars not only against regional powers , but against a superpower . 
Its preparations focus not on parity with the US &apos;s modern weaponry , but on the development of &quot; asymmetrical warfare &quot; theory and capability . 
As the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the US brutally reminded us , a lethal threat need not come from equivalent military hardware . 
The PLA has spent an inordinate amount of its rapidly growing resources in areas that give it an asymmetrical advantage , such as electronic warfare and human intelligence . 
Such tactics are aimed at confronting an enemy that is armed with the most advanced weapons systems , but is vulnerable to sabotage and asymmetrical attack , even latter-day guerilla warfare . 
Throughout the PLA &apos;s history , a chief tactic has always been to launch asymmetrical attacks on an enemy &apos;s command and communication centers , thus obviating direct confrontations where parity in technological development would determine a clearer definition of victory and defeat . 
The PLA has never been deterred or become less aggressive when confronted with an enemy possessing more advanced hardware . 
This was true of Mao &apos;s guerrilla war against the Japanese occupation , the Civil War against Chiang Kai-shek &apos;s Nationalists , the Korean War against the US , and even the Vietnam War , where China backed the North . 
More recently , PLA officials have been among the most interested observers of the two US-led Gulf Wars . 
They have been impressed by US technology and remote firepower , but they have also been searching for US military weaknesses in such a context . 
While awed by American hardware , some PLA brass are convinced that if Saddam Hussein had been a better commander , the battle for Baghdad could have been , to quote Zhang Zhaozhong of the Chinese National Defense University , &quot; George Bush &apos;s Stalingrad . &quot; 
One aspect often over-looked in foreign assessments of the PLA is its political indoctrination and the level of fanaticism this can create for an actual battlefield scenario . 
Despite all the years of stressing &quot; military modernization , &quot; the system of indoctrination by Political Commissars remains the soul of PLA units . 
We have seen the ferocity of ideologically intoxicated PLA soldiers during the Korean War , and even at Tiananmen Square in 1989 . 
Finally , China is far from being an Iraq or an Afghanistan . 
Despite the obvious imbalance with the US in terms of modern armaments , it would be shortsighted to ignore China &apos;s own formidable military hardware . 
It has a nuclear first- and second-strike capability ; its own satellite communications systems ; increasingly sophisticated and numerous aircraft and war ships ; a rapidly growing economy to sustain high levels of military investment ; as well as its own political and diplomatic points of leverage at places like the UN . 
The supposition that China cannot become a threat in the near future , or in the next twenty years , is simplistic , because it ignores basic aspects of China &apos;s political system . 
The reality is that China has been through a half century of Marxist-Leninist revolutionary indoctrination , which emphasizes the predatory nature of imperialism , colonialism , and capitalism - with America singled out as the leader of oppressive global forces . 
This ideology feeds a deep popular perception of China as a wounded , humiliated third-world victim and instills in the ruling Communist Party a powerful sense of unresolved grievance . 
It was from this mindset that Mao &apos;s theory of guerilla war - the last century &apos;s mother of all asymmetrical strategies of warfare - was born . 
It would be naive to assume that this mindset , which has become more deeply rooted in the PLA than anywhere else in Chinese society , is a thing of the past . 
Whether China will prove to be a paper dragon of little military substance or a crouching tiger with sharp claws remains unresolved . 
But , as the saying goes , &quot; Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom . &quot;
