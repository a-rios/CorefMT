American Wellbeing Since 1979 
BERKELEY - The story goes like this : Since 1979 - the peak of the last business cycle before the inauguration of Ronald Reagan as President - economic growth in the United States has been overwhelmingly a rich-only phenomenon . 
Real ( inflation-adjusted ) wages , incomes , and living standards for America &apos;s poor and middle-class households are at best only trivially higher . 
While annual real GDP per capita has grown 72 % , from $ 29,000 to $ 50,000 ( in 2009 prices ) , almost all of this growth has gone to those who now occupy the highest tier of the US income distribution . 
All of this is true , but there are a few important caveats . 
One is found in the Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes , published by the US Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) last year . 
After-tax real income for the lowest quintile of US households was 49 % higher in 2010 than in 1979 , growing at an average rate of 1.3 % annually . 
After-tax income for the middle three quintiles in 2010 was 40 % higher - equivalent to 1.1 % average annual growth . 
To be sure , households in the 81st to 99th percentiles gained 64 % in after-tax income , with the top 1 % up by 201 % , representing an average annual growth rate of 3.6 % - far ahead of any other income group . 
And , by now , with the recovery concentrated among the rich as well , the top 1 % of Americans are highly likely to be approaching a cumulative 300 % gain since 1979 . 
But real income gains of 1.3 % per year for the middle quintiles and 1.1 % for the bottom are not exactly chopped liver , are they ? 
The gap with 1.6 % average annual growth rate for per capita GDP is small , isn &apos;t it ? 
Well , yes and no . 
An optimist ( or an apologist ) could argue that , though market income has indeed become grossly more unequal since 1979 , with the slots in the bottom half of the income distribution losing absolute ground in real income , and with taxation becoming less progressive , welfare-state growth substantially moderated this increase in inequality . 
But when one looks at the 1.3 % annual growth rate of after-tax real income that the CBO calculates for the bottom quintile , 0.9 percentage points comes from the growth of the health-care financing programs Medicare , Medicaid , and the State Children &apos;s Health Insurance Program . 
The CBO counts all of that growth as an increase in poor US households &quot; after-tax real income . 
Moreover , only half of those expenditures show up as more health care received by program beneficiaries ; the other half flow into the general US health-care financing system and cover care that was previously uncompensated . 
And America &apos;s health-care financing system is uniquely inefficient : other OECD countries get more in terms of health and healthcare services from every dollar they spend than America gets from every $ 2 it spends . 
As a result , a better estimate of the contribution of expanded US public health-care programs to the material wellbeing of America &apos;s poor is just 0.2 percentage points per year . 
Hence the necessity of something like the individual health-insurance mandate of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( &quot; Obamacare &quot; ) , or of biting the bullet and adopting a single-payer system for financing health care . 
Either way , America needs to gets something comparable to other OECD countries &quot; value out of its enormous health-care expenditures . 
Frankly , I am of two minds on the relationship between growing government health-care financing programs and inequality . 
On odd days , my bottom line is that material wellbeing since 1979 has grown at 0.5 % per year for America &apos;s poor , compared to 4 % per year for America &apos;s rich ( and 6 % per year for its super-rich ) . 
This is because most of the expansion is not the equivalent of a greater income for America &apos;s poor in any reasonable sense , and because America gets relatively little value for its health-care financing . 
On even days , however , my bottom line is very different . 
America &apos;s poor in 1979 lagged so far behind normal OECD social democracies in terms of health and health care that even though each extra dollar produced only $ 0.25 of real health-care services , that $ 0.25 was worth about one dollar to the poor in terms of material wellbeing . 
On this reading , the expansion of America &apos;s health-care programs has kept the properly measured material wellbeing of its poor on an upward path since 1979 at a rate not much less than that of real per capita GDP . 
But the health-care coverage and financing gaps that existed in America in 1979 made it a much more unequal place than the income-distribution data showed .
