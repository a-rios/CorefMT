Europe &apos;s High Court Confronts Racism 
The European Court of Human Rights is hearing oral arguments in two of the most important cases in its history . 
As in Brown v. Board of Education , the case that ultimately broke the back of racial segregation in America half a century ago , the European Court is being asked to give meaning to the fundamental principle of equality . 
The resulting decisions could establish clear ground rules to guide future policy toward Europe &apos;s increasingly numerous ethnic and religious minorities . 
The plaintiffs are members of Europe &apos;s poorest and largest minority group - the Roma , or Gypsies , whose ancestors are believed to have migrated from India centuries ago . 
One case concerns 18 Roma children from the northeastern city of Ostrava in the Czech Republic who were placed in &quot; special &quot; schools for those deemed mentally deficient , where they receive a markedly inferior education . 
The children argue that such schools are a barrier to social and economic progress . 
Many Roma are sent to special schools even though they show no sign of mental disability . 
Few go on to finish high school or attend university . 
As a result , Roma unemployment rates in the Czech Republic , as in much of Europe , far exceed those for the rest of the population . 
Evidence before the Court indicates that , in some Czech communities , Roma children are 27 times more likely to be sent to special schools than non-Roma children . 
The plaintiffs suggest that this amounts to racial segregation . 
The Court &apos;s hearing is set for March 1 . 
The second case comes from Bulgaria . 
In 1996 , military police shot and killed two Roma conscripts . 
The victims , who had recently absconded from a military construction crew , were known to be unarmed and not dangerous . 
The shooting , by automatic weapon fire , took place in broad daylight in a largely Roma neighborhood , where the grandmother of one of the victims lived . 
Immediately after the killing , a military police officer allegedly yelled at one of the town residents , &quot; You damned Gypsies ! &quot; while pointing a gun at him . 
Last year , one panel of the Court found that both the shootings and a subsequent investigation that upheld their lawfulness were tainted by racial animus . 
At the request of the Bulgarian government , the Court &apos;s Grand Chamber agreed to review the matter before the end of February . 
Though the facts of both cases are heart wrenching , their importance extends beyond the courtroom . 
At a time of rising concern about immigration , religious extremism , and ethnic violence , what must government do to secure the promise of equal opportunity for all ? 
Over the past decade , the European Union has grown more ethnically diverse . 
Immigration to Spain , Italy , and Greece has surged , adding to longstanding immigrant populations in northern Europe and to the number of so-called &quot; guest workers &quot; in Austria , Germany , and Luxembourg . 
The most recent stage of EU enlargement last May added millions of Roma from the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe . 
Just as Europe &apos;s ethnic makeup has been changing , so have its laws . 
In 2000 , the EU &apos;s executive arm - responding in part to the growing popularity of anti-immigrant and neo-Nazi political parties - enacted the most far-reaching anti-discrimination legislation in the world . 
To date , however , this legislation has lain dormant . 
In many countries , lawyers and judges lack familiarity with legal concepts of discrimination . 
Perhaps not surprisingly , acts of exclusion , segregation , and violence often go unpunished . 
The two cases soon to be heard in Strasbourg provide an opportunity to change this . 
A finding of discrimination would establish a landmark legal precedent , putting core values of non-discrimination and equal justice beyond dispute at a time when Europe &apos;s politicians consider how best to absorb millions of new immigrants and minority members . 
Just as importantly , such a ruling would send a powerful signal that racism and xenophobia have no place in the new Europe . 
But perhaps the greatest significance of these cases lies in their very presence on the docket of Europe &apos;s highest rights tribunal . 
A decade ago , few minority victims would have been inclined or able to seek legal remedies for discrimination . 
The success of some in having their claims heard is testimony to the growing power of law as a force for positive change in Europe .
