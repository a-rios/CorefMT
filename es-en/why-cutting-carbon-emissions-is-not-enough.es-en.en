Why Cutting Carbon Emissions is not Enough 
Twenty years ago , governments adopted the Montreal Protocol , a treaty to protect the Earth &apos;s ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals . 
Few could have foreseen how far-reaching that decision would prove to be . 
The Protocol explicitly aimed at phasing-out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) - found in products such as refrigerators , foams , and hairsprays - in order to repair the thin gassy-shield that filters out the sun &apos;s harmful , ultra-violet rays . 
By 2010 , close to 100 ozone-depleting substances , including CFCs , will have been phased-out globally . 
Without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting substances would have increased ten-fold by 2050 . 
This could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife , and agriculture . 
But this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer ( September 16 ) . 
Over the past two years , it has been established that the Montreal Protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases that it prohibits also contribute to global warming . 
Indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135 billion tons of CO2 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of 7-12 years . 
So the lessons learned from the Montreal Protocol may have wider significance . 
Scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than CO2 , including nitrogen compounds , low-level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon . 
Of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants &quot; precise contribution to warming remains . 
But they certainly play a significant role . 
Meanwhile , many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture , and the planet &apos;s multi-trillion dollar ecosystems , including forests . 
Consider black carbon , a component of the soot emissions from diesel engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking stoves that is linked to 1.6 million to 1.8 million premature deaths annually as a result of indoor exposure and 800,000 as a result of outdoor exposure . 
Black carbon , which absorbs heat from the sun , also accounts for anywhere from 10 % to more than 45 % of the contribution to global warming , and is also linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in Asia , because the soot deposits darken , ice making it more vulnerable to melting . 
One study estimates that 26 % of black carbon emissions are from stoves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop residues , and 10 % from dung . 
Some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows , better insulation , and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % . 
Mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green-economy benefits . 
While CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively periods - days , weeks , months , or years - so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits . 
The international community &apos;s over-arching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December to curtail C02 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt . 
If the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed .
