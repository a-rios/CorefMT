A Human Rights Crime In Gaza 
Atlanta  -  
The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza , where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea , air , or land . An entire population is being brutally punished . 
This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel , with United States backing , after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006 . 
The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers . 
Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now , after internal strife , Hamas alone controls Gaza . Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel , plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet . 
Regardless of one &apos;s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine , we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water , food , electricity , and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza , about one million of whom are refugees . 
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area , causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children . 
Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week , this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B &apos;Tselem , the leading Israeli human rights organization : 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3 . 
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn &apos;t take part in the fighting , and 25 were under 18 years of age . 
On a recent trip through the Middle East , I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis . 
One of my visits was to Sderot , a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza . 
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism , since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants . 
Subsequently , I met with leaders of Hamas , both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus , Syria . 
I made the same condemnation to them , and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period . 
They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated , and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank , which Israel had refused . 
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza , which the Israelis considered and also rejected . 
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land . 
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank , which is approximately one-fourth ( 28.5 % ) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community . 
Some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River , and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for &quot; security . &quot; 
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions . 
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people . 
This holds promise of progress , but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis , Maryland , a retrogression has occurred in the process . 
Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine , the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased , and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened . 
It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations , but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly . 
It is time for strong voices in Europe , the US , Israel , and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people .
