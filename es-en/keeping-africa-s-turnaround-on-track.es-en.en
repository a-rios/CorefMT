Keeping Africa \ u0027s Turnaround on Track 
MONROVIA - For more than a decade , much of Africa has been moving forward . 
Economic growth is rising , poverty is falling and democratic governance is spreading . 
But the global financial crisis threatens to undo this progress by reducing investment , exports and aid just as they should be expanding to build on these successes . 
While international attention has been understandably focused on events in Darfur , Somalia and Zimbabwe , countries across the continent including Ghana , Tanzania , Mozambique and Liberia have been quietly turning their economies around . 
Economic growth rates regularly exceed 5 % in many nations . The key to this progress is stronger African leadership and more accountable governance . 
Today , more than 20 African countries are democracies , up from just three in the 1980 &quot; s . 
They have competitive elections and improved human rights , and a much freer media . 
These efforts have been supported by increasingly effective development assistance . 
Consider what has happened in my country , Liberia . 
After 14 years of devastating war , we faced enormous challenges . 
Our democratically elected government has worked with international partners and a growing number of private investors to turn things around . 
In the past three years , we have doubled primary school enrollment nationwide , refurbished hundreds of health facilities , begun rebuilding roads and restoring electricity . 
We have taken steps to root out corruption and remove unscrupulous officials . 
Growth has exceeded several percent per year . 
And , most critical , we are at peace . 
We are restoring our once-vibrant nation , and the crucial component  -  hope  -  has already been revived . 
Without international support , we would not have made this progress and would be at much greater risk of returning to war . 
The global economic crisis threatens the progress in my country and elsewhere on our continent . 
Declining remittances from overseas workers , shrinking trade flows and investment could undermine new businesses , throw thousands out of work , and increase tensions and instability . The crisis  -  which Africa did nothing to cause  -  demands a strong response . 
African nations must do their part by continuing to address corruption , eliminate red tape and reduce obstacles to private-sector growth . 
But just as industrialized countries need a stimulus , African economies need a boost to keep their progress on track . 
The G8 nations meeting in Italy this week have a useful role to play . Among other measures , they must keep their promises to increase aid and make it more effective by reducing bureaucratic delays , speeding disbursements and better aligning programs with African priorities . Effective aid is certainly not the only answer , but it has an increasingly vital role to play as other sources of finance dry up . 
It is needed to lay the foundations to help stimulate private sector growth . 
It would be a cruel irony if , just as Africa begins to succeed , its prospects are cut short by a crisis beyond its control . 
Strong action by African governments and robust support from the international community can keep Africa &apos;s recovery on track . 
Both must continue to do their part .
