The Twilight of France &apos;s Republican Aristocracy 
PARIS - No tumbrils have appeared in Paris &apos;s Place de la Concorde , but a revolution may be underway in France nonetheless . 
Recent weeks have seen the trial of former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and the conviction of former Defense Minister Charles Pasqua . 
Now even former President Jacques Chirac has learned that he is not immune from prosecution . 
Is France &apos;s &quot; Republican Monarchy , &quot; to borrow a phrase from Jean-François Revel , about to be overthrown ? 
The French Revolution never actually ended the privileges of France &apos;s ruling elites . 
True enough , some aristocratic heads rolled , but the nobility eventually returned to France . 
When the Republic replaced the monarchy for good , in 1875 , ballots replaced birthright , but the new governing elite believed that it possessed the same rights and perks as the former aristocrats . 
But the concept of the &quot; Republican monarchy , &quot; which is mostly concerned with the mores of French presidents and their entourages , did not really take hold until the Fifth Republic . 
Once elected , the French president and his court gain access to financial privileges that are not always legal . 
Moreover , they live behind a shroud of secrecy : how they use official airplanes , the civil servants they employ for personal service , not to mention the mistresses , has always been more or less considered private territory . 
Journalists avoided commenting on these matters . 
The public either was unaware of any excesses , or deemed the ruling elite corrupt by definition . 
The apex of the aristocratic Republic was reached under the Socialist President François Mitterrand , who ruled from 1981 to 1995 . 
Unknown to the public , a government jet would ferry him to Egypt to spend weekends with his mistress and his illegitimate daughter . 
Only the media elite knew , and they never mentioned it . 
Chirac , who succeeded Mitterrand as president , was only slightly more cautious . 
All this has changed . 
In less than a week , Pasqua was sentenced to three years in jail for illegal arms trading with Angola . 
Villepin , a former Prime Minister for Chirac , awaits judgment on charges of having organized a smear campaign against his rival for the presidency , Nicolas Sarkozy . 
Chirac &apos;s indictment is remarkable for the very modesty of his supposed crime : he is suspected of having asked city bureaucrats to work for his political party and run his electoral campaigns when he was mayor of Paris . 
On a lighter note , Sarkozy &apos;s Minister of Culture Frédéric Mitterrand , the nephew of the former president , is being excoriated by the media for supporting Roman Polanski against efforts by the United States to extradite him to face punishment for the rape of a minor three decades ago . 
It turns out that this Mitterrand shared with Polanski a taste for teenagers ( of the same sex in Mitterrand &apos;s case ) . 
So , something of a democratic revolution may be underway in France . 
The ancien regime &apos;s supporters call it a &quot; populist &quot; revolution . 
French judges have become more independent than they traditionally were . 
Inspired by Italy &apos;s investigating magistrates who took aim at the mafia bosses , and those Spanish judges who act as social redeemers , some French judges are determined to democratize the French Republic and eradicate corruption . 
The Internet is a seminal lever in this process . 
Today , President Mitterrand &apos;s mistress and daughter could not benefit from the media &apos;s complicity : no state secrets , and no aristocratic excess , can escape today &apos;s bloggers . 
Is the private life of France &apos;s elite also now to be exposed ? 
This right to a private life , including extramarital affairs , has always been a sacred cow of French politics . 
The journalists who knew about Mitterrand &apos;s second wife argued that it was a private matter . 
And so it would have been had he not used state funds to provide his other family with lodgings , chauffeurs , and jets for their Egyptian weekends . 
Today , many French journalists still resist the temptation to expose the private lives of the political elite . 
But this is a lost battle : the bloggers do not share the journalists &quot; ethics . 
Sarkozy understands the new rules of the game . 
As soon it was known that he had an intimate relationship with a former fashion model , he decided to marry her , avoiding any further embarrassment . 
But aristocratic habits do not die easily , even in Sarkozy &apos;s overexposed regime . 
Sarkozy &apos;s son , Jean , has already been elected to a major local government office at the tender age of 22 . 
Being as ambitious as the father , Jean Sarkozy recently tried to have himself appointed as chairman of a powerful public company . 
Bloggers , followed by traditional journalists , went up in arms against such blatant nepotism . 
Young Sarkozy withdrew . 
France , it seems , does not yet share the real democratic culture of , say , Scandinavia . 
French ministers have yet to be seen taking the bus or the subway to their offices . 
French ministries still occupy the former eighteenth-century palaces of the King and his nobility . 
As long as the governing elite works in this splendor , one cannot expect that they will ever behave like common mortals . 
As Bossuet , Louis XIV &apos;s confessor , declared to the Sun King : &quot; You &apos;ll die , but you are immortal . &quot; 
French Presidents and their elected nobility still bask in this decadent aura . 
But , like French hauteur in international affairs , the end of an era may be at hand .
