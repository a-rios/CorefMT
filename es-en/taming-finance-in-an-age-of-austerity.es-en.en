Taming Finance in an Age of Austerity 
NEW YORK - It was not long ago that we could say , &quot; We are all Keynesians now . &quot; 
The financial sector and its free-market ideology had brought the world to the brink of ruin . 
Markets clearly were not self-correcting . 
Deregulation had proven to be a dismal failure . 
The &quot; innovations &quot; unleashed by modern finance did not lead to higher long-term efficiency , faster growth , or more prosperity for all . 
Instead , they were designed to circumvent accounting standards and to evade and avoid taxes that are required to finance the public investments in infrastructure and technology - like the Internet - that underlie real growth , not the phantom growth promoted by the financial sector . 
The financial sector pontificated not only about how to create a dynamic economy , but also about what to do in the event of a recession ( which , according to their ideology , could be caused only by a failure of government , not of markets ) . 
Whenever an economy enters recession , revenues fall , and expenditures - say , for unemployment benefits - increase . 
So deficits grow . 
Financial-sector deficit hawks said that governments should focus on eliminating deficits , preferably by cutting back on expenditures . 
The reduced deficits would restore confidence , which would restore investment - and thus growth . 
But , as plausible as this line of reasoning may sound , the historical evidence repeatedly refutes it . 
When US President Herbert Hoover tried that recipe , it helped transform the 1929 stock-market crash into the Great Depression . 
When the International Monetary Fund tried the same formula in East Asia in 1997 , downturns became recessions , and recessions became depressions . 
The reasoning behind such episodes is based on a flawed analogy . 
A household that owes more money than it can easily repay needs to cut back on spending . 
But when a government does that , output and incomes decline , unemployment increases , and the ability to repay may actually decrease . 
What is true for a family is not true for a country . 
More sophisticated advocates warn that government spending will drive up interest rates , thus &quot; crowding out &quot; private investment . 
When the economy is at full employment , this is a legitimate concern . 
But not now : given extraordinarily low long-term interest rates , no serious economist raises the &quot; crowding out &quot; issue nowadays . 
In Europe , especially Germany , and in some quarters in the US , as government deficits and debt grow , so , too , do calls for increased austerity . 
If heeded , as appears to be the case in many countries , the results will be disastrous , especially given the fragility of the recovery . 
Growth will slow , with Europe and / or America possibly even slipping back into recession . 
Stimulus spending , the deficit hawks &quot; favorite bogeyman , did not cause most of the increased deficits and debt , which are the result of &quot; automatic stabilizers &quot; - the tax cuts and spending increases that automatically accompany economic fluctuations . 
So , as austerity undermines growth , debt reduction will be marginal at best . 
Keynesian economics worked : if not for stimulus measures and automatic stabilizers , the recession would have been far deeper and longer , and unemployment much higher . 
This does not mean that we should ignore the level of debt . 
But what matters is long-term debt . 
There is a simple Keynesian recipe : First , shift spending away from unproductive uses - such as wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , or unconditional bank bailouts that do not revive lending - toward high-return investments . 
Second , encourage spending and promote equity and efficiency by raising taxes on corporations that don &apos;t reinvest , for example , and lowering them on those that do , or by raising taxes on speculative capital gains ( say , in real estate ) and on carbon- and pollution-intensive energy , while cutting taxes for lower-income payers . 
There are other measures that might help . 
For example , governments should help banks that lend to small- and medium-size enterprises , which are the main source of job creation - or establish new financial institutions that would do so - rather than supporting big banks that make their money from derivatives and abusive credit card practices . 
Financial markets have worked hard to create a system that enforces their views : with free and open capital markets , a small country can be flooded with funds one moment , only to be charged high interest rates - or cut off completely - soon thereafter . 
In such circumstances , small countries seemingly have no choice : financial markets &quot; Diktat on austerity , lest they be punished by withdrawal of financing . 
But financial markets are a harsh and fickle taskmaster . 
The day after Spain announced its austerity package , its bonds were downgraded . 
The problem was not a lack of confidence that the Spanish government would fulfill its promises , but too much confidence that it would , and that this would reduce growth and increase unemployment from its already intolerable level of 20 % . 
In short , having gotten the world into its current economic mess , financial markets are now saying to countries like Greece and Spain : damned if you don &apos;t cut back on spending , but damned if you do as well . 
Finance is a means to an end , not an end in itself . 
It is supposed to serve the interests of the rest of society , not the other way around . 
Taming financial markets will not be easy , but it can and must be done , through a combination of taxation and regulation - and , if necessary , government stepping in to fill some of the breaches ( as it already does in the case of lending to small- and medium-size enterprises . ) 
Unsurprisingly , financial markets do not want to be tamed . 
They like the way things have been working , and why shouldn &apos;t they ? 
In countries with corrupt and imperfect democracies , they have the wherewithal to resist change . 
Fortunately , citizens in Europe and America have lost patience . 
The process of tempering and taming has begun . 
But there is far more yet to do .
