New and True Europeans 
The fiasco of the European Union &apos;s summit in Brussels has brought into sharp relief differences in attitudes between most new member countries from East Central Europe and the &quot; old &quot; members . 
Perhaps surprisingly for many , such differences were not played out according to the expected script , in which the new members would be ruthlessly pragmatic , and demanding as much EU money as they could get , while most Western countries would in the end tone down their national egoism in favor of the decades-old ideals of European integration . 
In the end , it was the EU &apos;s eastern flank - the supposedly money-hungry and immature democracies - that called most loudly for a compromise in the name of salvaging political integration , while most of the old European democracies ruthlessly fought for their own &quot; national interests . &quot; 
In view of some big countries &quot; intense national egoism , the failure to agree on the EU &apos;s 2007-2013 budget could have ominous political consequences for Europe . 
Statements by new EU members &quot; leaders at the summit indicated that they were aware of such a possibility . 
They were worried about the EU &apos;s future - certainly more so than their Western counterparts . 
Some warned that the rejection of the European Constitution in the French and the Dutch referendums , combined with the summit &apos;s decision effectively to suspend the ratification process and its failure to agree on EU finances , could trigger a serious political crisis in the EU . 
This is why most new members were ultimately willing to support Luxembourg &apos;s proposed compromise , under which the budget would be only 1.06 % of the EU &apos;s overall GDP and Great Britain &apos;s annual rebate would be frozen at â‚¬ 4.6 billion . 
Indeed , just before the ultimate collapse of the talks , five new members , including the Czech Republic and Slovakia , agreed to an even more radical plan , under which the budget would be only 1 % of the EU &apos;s GDP . 
Cynics may argue that the new member countries could afford to make such concessions because they would end up with hefty EU subsidies anyway . 
The net contributors to the EU budget were the ones who stood to lose the most . 
Viewed in strictly economic terms , it is not surprising that Great Britain would not give up its rebate , while France would reject attempts to cut farm subsidies . 
But what is surprising is that it was the old , experienced European democracies that so blithely ignored the political dangers stemming from the potential revival of intense nationalism on the European continent , while it was the new , inexperienced democracies from Europe &apos;s east that called for caution . 
Perhaps this was because the eastern countries &quot; attitudes are more driven by recent historical memories and experiences . 
In a mere 15 years , all of these countries have endured economic and political changes unprecedented in their scope and speed in the history of Europe . 
For most of these countries , EU membership was not merely a ticket to economic prosperity , paid for by rich EU old-timers . 
On the contrary , they knew that they would have to do most of the work themselves - albeit under EU guidance and with the help of EU know-how . 
Perhaps this is one reason why many in East Central Europe believe that EU funds , while helpful , are less important than being part of a united Europe , with the expanded opportunities that its common rules imply . 
Moreover , the EU offers the small countries sandwiched between Germany and Russia a degree of political stability and security that they never had in modern history . 
The rest they can manage on their own . 
In contrast , West European states do no longer seem so concerned with the political dimension of European integration . 
They take it for granted and are more concerned with their domestic constituencies . 
Perhaps understandably , most citizens of West European states - accustomed to the political stability and economic prosperity of the last several decades - do not want to give up the benefits that the European integration process has brought to them . 
The French , for example , do not want to lose farm subsidies , just as they are not eager to give more money to the new members , whose reformed economies are taking away French jobs . 
British leeriness about giving up the EU rebate in the face of what is perceived as French egoism is equally understandable - despite the fact that this stance harms the enlargement process , which Great Britain otherwise supports . 
Even so , East Central Europeans , who are still recovering from the terrible political calamities caused by Europe &apos;s historical demons , find the intensity of their Western counterparts &quot; national egoism a bit frightening . 
Europe &apos;s history is full of catastrophes that were produced by the shortsightedness of national political elites . 
How many times have European leaders thought they had things under control , only to unleash the demons again ? 
This is not to suggest , of course , that just because the EU cannot agree on a budget or a constitution Europe is approaching yet another historical calamity . 
Although the collapse of the common currency area owing to political squabbles seems unlikely at this point , it cannot be ruled out entirely . 
Obviously , we also cannot completely rule out the possibility of a subsequent weakening or disintegration of Europe &apos;s common political structures . 
For the small , economically still-fragile states of East Central Europe , a Europe of national states , once again fighting ruthlessly for their own interests , is a nightmare . 
But it should be a nightmare scenario for all European states . 
Perhaps those in the West should listen more to their new partners .
