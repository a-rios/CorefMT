Can Terrorism Be Cured ? 
Terrorism is likely to define the year 2006 as much as it has ever year since 2001 . 
Years from now , historians will likely label the opening years of the twenty-first century the &quot; Age of Terrorism . &quot; 
As with any new era , we do not yet fully understand what is happening and why . 
While most of the world recognizes the problem , there are very different views on its causes and cures . 
This much we know : terrorism is fueled by anger and frustration . 
Radicals use the inability to attain political objectives peacefully to inspire fanatical action and to justify forms of violence normally considered unacceptable . 
Beyond this basic point , however , there is less agreement on why frustration and anger lead to terrorism in some cases but not in others . 
Moreover , there are two broad schools of thought as to the appropriate response when they do fuel extremist violence . 
One school believes that modern terrorism cannot be eradicated , or that the costs of doing so are unacceptably high . 
For this group , the only logical policy is to &quot; ride out the storm &quot; by ending policies which increase anger and frustration , and improving intelligence and defenses . 
The second school of thought contends that terrorism can be eradicated by addressing its root causes . 
Ironically , its adherents include both George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden . 
For bin Laden and those who share his ideas , anger and frustration in the Islamic world stem from outside repression and exploitation of Muslims . 
If the repression ends , so , too , will terrorism . 
Until then , all means are legitimate when fighting a powerful and wicked enemy . 
Terrorism , for bin Laden and his allies , is the only method available to strike at the West effectively . 
&quot; It is permissible , &quot; according to bin Laden &apos;s ally in Iraq , Abu Musab Zarqawi , &quot; to spill infidel blood . &quot; 
Bush , in contrast , believes that terrorism is rooted in the absence of political and economic opportunity . 
Rather than grappling with this , radicals like bin Laden blame outsiders , particularly the United States and Europe . 
Extremists might still exist , but they would be marginalized , finding few recruits or supporters . 
Unfortunately , every approach has shortcomings . 
The belief that terrorism cannot be eradicated assumes that the ability to tolerate terrorist attacks - to &quot; ride out the storm &quot; - is greater than the willingness of terrorists to persist , or even escalate the attacks . 
By taking an essentially passive position , this approach might merely prolong the Age of Terrorism needlessly . 
Moreover , appeasement is based on the dangerous assumption that the extremists &quot; objectives are limited - that once they attain their stated goals by using violence , they will become responsible members of the world community . 
Bin Laden &apos;s position - that terrorism will end when the Islamic world expels outside influence - is ethically and analytically flawed . 
On the one hand , it would condemn hundreds of millions to live in repressive Iranian- or Taliban-style theocracies . 
On the other hand , the idea that poverty and repression in the Islamic world are engineered from outside simply does not stand up to scrutiny . 
Finally , the belief that democracy and economic reform will undercut terrorism is based on a series of assumptions that may or may not prove accurate . 
For instance , it assumes that terrorists and their supporters do not understand their own anger . 
Closed political systems and stagnant economies in the Muslim world , they contend , are symptoms , not causes . 
The Bush position also assumes that fundamental political and economic change is feasible and affordable - that open political and economic systems can be sustained with only modest effort - because the desire for freedom and prosperity is universal . 
While true , it is not clear that a willingness to tolerate the freedom of others , which democracy requires , is equally widespread . 
In some societies , democracy is simply a way for the majority to repress the minority . 
In others , stability or justice is more important than political freedom . 
Finally , this perspective assumes that democracies will be willing or able to control radicalism and crack down on extremists . 
The horrible truth is that failure to eradicate the root causes of terrorism is almost certain to extend the Age of Terrorism , it is not clear that they really can be eradicated . 
To appease the extremists might be easy but may not work . 
To allow them to win would be to accept the supremacy of evil . 
To promote democracy and open government might be the ultimate solution , but it stands on a shaky conceptual foundation of untested assumptions about the nature of the world and diverse cultures . 
Unfortunately , the world is at a point where it can see the danger from terrorism but not the cure . 
Worse still , a cure may not exist .
