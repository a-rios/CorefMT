Statesmanship and the Greek Crisis 
NEW YORK - Sovereign-debt crises such as the one in Greece can be resolved only through bold steps by both debtor and creditor . 
The debtor needs a fresh start through a debt write-off ; the creditor must find a way to provide one without rewarding bad behavior . 
For a deal to be struck , both sides must have their needs addressed . 
Thus , serious reforms and deep debt relief need to go hand in hand . 
It is for this reason that Greece and Germany , its largest creditor , need a new modus vivendi in order to resume negotiations . 
To begin with , the Greek government must be clear about the need for urgent economic reforms . 
The country &apos;s economy has not just collapsed ; it is structurally moribund . 
The roots of Greece &apos;s problems stretch far deeper than the austerity of recent years . 
In 2013 , for example , resident inventors in Germany filed some 917 patent applications for every million inhabitants . 
Resident inventors in Greece , by contrast , filed just 69 patent applications for every million . 
If Greece wants the prosperity associated with a technologically advanced , twenty-first-century economy , it will have to earn it , by producing innovative products that are competitive on world markets , just as Germany does . 
Doing so is likely to be a generational challenge . 
For its part , Germany must acknowledge the enormity of Greece &apos;s collapse . 
The Greek economy has shrunk by around 25 % since 2009 ; unemployment stands at 27 % , with youth unemployment at nearly 50 % . 
When Germany faced comparable conditions in the early 1930s , its creditors shrugged , and the resulting instability allowed for the rise of Adolf Hitler . 
After World War II , however , Germany &apos;s debt was slashed , enabling it to rebuild . 
Given this experience , it should understand the importance of cutting a country &apos;s debt when the burden of servicing it becomes unsustainable . 
The case for offering a country a fresh financial start is both economic and moral . 
Politicians , too , tend to have their moral compasses calibrated to the relentless hunt for votes . 
Finding effective and moral solutions requires genuine statesmanship - something that has been all too rare during the euro crisis . 
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and German Chancellor Angela Merkel now have the opportunity to rise to the occasion as European statesmen . 
Since Tsipras &apos;s election in January , German officials have barely been able to contain their fury that a left-wing upstart government of a tiny , bankrupt country would dare to challenge one of the world &apos;s great economies . 
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble , for example , has repeatedly sought to provoke Greece into leaving the eurozone . 
Tsipras &apos;s response to these provocations has been clear and consistent : Greece should stay in the eurozone , and it needs a fresh financial start to do so . 
On July 5 , the Greek people backed their young , charismatic leader with a decisive &quot; No &quot; vote on the unreasonable demands of their country &apos;s creditors . 
Their decision will one day be recognized as a victory for Europe over those who preferred to carve up the eurozone , rather than give Greece the chance to start anew within it . 
At the likely meeting between Tsipras and Merkel this week in Brussels , the stakes could not be higher . 
The economic costs of the impasse have been catastrophic for Greece , and pose a grave threat to Europe . 
The breakdown of negotiations last week sparked a bank panic , leaving Greece &apos;s economy paralyzed and its banks on the verge of insolvency . 
If the banks are to be revived at all , they must be saved within days . 
If Tsipras and Merkel meet as mere politicians , the results will be catastrophic . 
Greece &apos;s banks will be pushed to the point of failure , making the costs of saving Greece and the eurozone prohibitively high . 
If the two leaders meet as statesmen , however , they will save Greece , the eurozone , and the faltering European spirit . 
With the promise of deep debt relief for Greece and a rapprochement between Greece and Germany , economic confidence will return . 
Deposits will flow back into Greek banks . 
The economy will come back to life . 
Tsipras needs to assure Merkel that Greece will live within its means , not as a chronic ward of Europe . 
To ensure such an outcome , debt relief and tough reforms should be phased in over time , according to an agreed schedule , with each party following through on its commitments , as long as the other does , as well . 
Fortunately , Greece is a country of exceptional talents , capable of building new competitive sectors from the ground up , if given the chance . 
Merkel must now take a stance that is the opposite of the one her finance minister has pursued to date . 
Schäuble is undoubtedly one of Europe &apos;s towering political figures , but his strategy for saving the eurozone by pushing Greece out was misguided . 
Merkel now must step in to save Greece as part of the eurozone - and that means easing the country &apos;s debt burden . 
To do otherwise at this stage would create an irreparable split between Europe &apos;s rich and poor , and powerful and weak . 
Some - in particular , the ever-cynical bankers - argue that it is too late for Europe to save itself . 
It is not . 
In Europe , many influential leaders and citizens still view the marketplace as constrained by moral considerations , such as the need to alleviate economic suffering . 
This is an invaluable asset . 
It makes it possible for Merkel to offer Greece a fresh start , because it is the right thing to do and because it accords with Germany &apos;s own experience and history . 
That idea of an ethical approach to the Greek crisis might sound absurd to readers of the financial press , and many politicians will undoubtedly consider it naive . 
Yet most European citizens could embrace it as a sensible solution . 
Europe rose from the rubble of World War II because of the vision of statesmen ; now it has been brought to the verge of collapse by the everyday vanities , corruption , and cynicism of bankers and politicians . 
It is time for statesmanship to return - for the sake of current and future generations in Europe and the world .
