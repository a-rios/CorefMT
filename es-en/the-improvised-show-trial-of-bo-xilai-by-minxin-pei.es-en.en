Why Bo Stole the Show 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - As show trials go , the drama featuring Bo Xilai , the once-swaggering , media-savvy former Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) chief of Chongqing , veered anomalously into improvisation . 
Before the proceedings began , the conventional wisdom was that Bo &apos;s trial had been carefully scripted and rehearsed to portray a forlorn and penitent sinner confessing his crimes and apologizing to the Party . 
But the historic five-day trial dispelled any notion that Bo would go quietly to his cell in Beijing &apos;s infamous Qincheng Prison , where China &apos;s fallen top leaders are incarcerated . 
He challenged the prosecution vigorously , defending himself with a feistiness that surprised nearly all who read the transcripts released by the court in real time on the trial &apos;s first day . 
Bo dismissed one of his accusers as having &quot; sold his soul . &quot; 
He characterized testimony given by his wife , Gu Kailai , now serving a suspended death sentence for murdering the British businessman Neil Heywood in 2011 , as &quot; comical &quot; and &quot; fictional , &quot; and he called her &quot; crazy . &quot; 
Throughout the trial , Bo flatly denied most of the corruption charges , often professed ignorance of the facts , and claimed to be unable to recall any details of the matters in question . 
He even retracted his confession to the CCP &apos;s anti-graft agency , blaming mental stress for his admission that he accepted bribes from a man he called &quot; soulless &quot; in court . 
In his closing statement , he dropped a bombshell : he claimed that Wang Lijun , his former police chief and henchman ( and a &quot; vile character &quot; ) , was secretly in love with his wife . 
The trial transcripts create an impression of a man who , had he not gone into politics , would have excelled as a trial lawyer . 
Bo made the prosecution look sloppy and incompetent . 
However , anyone who believes that the courtroom drama in the provincial capital of Jinan will determine the trial &apos;s outcome ( the verdict and sentence will be announced in September ) is seriously mistaken . 
The CCP &apos;s leaders have already decided that Bo is guilty and must spend years in jail ( the scale of Bo &apos;s alleged bribe-taking ensures a sentence of 15-20 years ) . 
A logical question to ask , then , is why the Party allowed an unprecedented degree of openness at the trial . 
The two most recently purged Politburo members were tried in secret , as were Bo &apos;s wife , and his former police chief . 
The optimistic view is that China &apos;s new leadership wants to demonstrate its commitment to the rule of law and fairness . 
But that is a naive interpretation . 
While the trial proceedings on the first day were refreshingly open by Chinese standards , that quickly changed . 
Transcripts were not released in real time on subsequent days , and they omitted some crucial details ( for example , Bo claimed that the Party &apos;s representatives threatened to execute his wife and prosecute his son if he refused to cooperate ) . 
Perhaps worried that Bo &apos;s defiant behavior was winning the public-relations battle , the official media also launched a media blitz savaging Bo &apos;s character and all but pronouncing him guilty . 
Even more disturbing , on the second day of the trial , the Chinese police formally arrested Xu Zhiyong , a human-rights lawyer who was leading a campaign to force mandatory disclosure of the wealth of senior officials and their family members . 
The Chinese government has also begun a ferocious crackdown on social media , arresting prominent activists on dubious charges . 
So there must be a different - and more political - interpretation of the Chinese government &apos;s handling of Bo &apos;s trial . 
It is worth recalling that purging him was a deeply divisive affair at the CCP &apos;s highest levels . 
His patrons and allies could not save him , but they were well positioned to demand that his trial be conducted as openly as possible . 
Given Bo &apos;s gift for dazzling an audience , his allies must have felt confident that a spirited defense would serve him well , both legally and politically . 
Bo certainly did not disappoint . 
He could have groveled his way through the trial , like other senior Party officials brought down by corruption scandals , and as most defendants have done in the long grim history of communist show trials beginning with Stalin . 
But Bo apparently is not accepting his political demise as a final act - in his closing statement , he told the court that he wanted to keep his Party membership ( he was expelled anyway ) - and a comeback calculus may well have motivated his spirited performance . 
Bo understands that he should not be perceived as a pitiful loser who gutlessly besmirches his honor . 
By appearing dignified , defiant , and forceful , Bo evidently sought to preserve his image among his allies and supporters as a strong leader . 
Denouncing himself in order to gain leniency - in a case that he portrayed as a grievous miscarriage of justice - would have made him look like a coward . 
Bo may be heading to jail , but he retains some chance of political rehabilitation should things change dramatically in China . 
His botched - but riveting - trial may be over , but the Bo Xilai show will go on .
