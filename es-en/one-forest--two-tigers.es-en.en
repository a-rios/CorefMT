One Forest , Two Tigers 
When Japan &apos;s government recently decided to ignore Chinese protests and allow Taiwan &apos;s former president , Lee Teng-hui , to visit Japan , China lashed out at its Asian neighbor , even threatening retaliation . 
That August , construction workers in Qiqihar mistakenly ruptured mustard gas canisters left from the wartime Japanese occupation , injuring dozens and killing at least one . 
The reaction by China &apos;s public to the gory photos of the injured was furious . 
One million signatures were rapidly gathered on an Internet petition demanding that the Japanese government thoroughly resolve the chemical weapons issue , while Internet chat rooms filled with anti-Japanese invective . 
Two weeks later , 400 Japanese businessmen hired as many as 500 local Chinese prostitutes for a weekend sex party in a Zhu Hai hotel . 
Racy reports in China &apos;s press sparked another round of righteous fury , drawing on the trope of China as a raped woman , an image long suppressed under Mao . 
Occurring on the 72nd anniversary of the 1931 Mukden Incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria , 90 % of Chinese respondents to an Internet poll said they believed that the Japanese businessmen intended to humiliate China . 
The following month , at a party thrown by Northwestern University in Xian , three Japanese students and one of their Japanese teachers performed a skit , during which they pranced around the stage with red bras over their t-shirts . 
In Japan , such skits are apparently regarded as humorous ; in China , the skit was seen as lewd and insulting . 
The Japanese students received death threats . 
Thousands of Chinese demonstrated on campus and through the city , shouting &quot; Boycott Japanese goods ! &quot; and &quot; Japanese dogs , get out ! &quot; 
A Japanese flag was burned outside the foreign students &quot; dorm . 
Even though the Japanese students apologized , they were expelled . 
Then , last August , during the Asian Cup soccer tournament , Chinese fans in Chongqing , Jinan , and Beijing hurled insults at the Japanese team - and bottles at their team bus . 
During the Cup final between China and Japan in Beijing , which Japan won , Chinese fans reportedly chanted &quot; Kill ! 
Kill ! 
Kill ! &quot; and &quot; May a big sword decapitate the Japanese ! &quot; 
Sino-Japanese amity was hardly enhanced in mid-November , when a Chinese nuclear sub encroached into Japanese waters . 
Nor did it help when Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao snubbed Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi &apos;s invitation to visit his country . 
Why has this popular nationalism emerged ? 
And why is it directed at Japan ? 
The short answer is that after a quarter-century of economic reform , Chinese today are much freer to express themselves . 
Under Mao , when the Chinese Communist Party sought accommodation , diplomatic recognition , and overseas development aid from Japan , Chinese were not allowed to confront their past victimization at the hands of Western and Japanese imperialism . 
Today , however , Chinese are facing past atrocities from the &quot; Century of Humiliation &quot; that ended with the Communist takeover in 1948 , and a long suppressed anger has resurfaced . 
To most Chinese , the Japanese are paradigmatic &quot; devils , &quot; not only because of the brutality of Japanese imperialism and the sheer number of Chinese killed by Japanese troops . 
Anti-Japanese anger has an ethical justification rooted in the perceived injustice of &quot; little brother &quot; Japan &apos;s impertinent behavior towards &quot; big brother &quot; China , from China &apos;s loss in the Sino-Japanese Jiawu War and the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895 to the insulting &quot; 21 Demands &quot; of 1915 and on to WWII atrocities like the Rape of Nanking . 
The complexity and depth of these anti-Japanese sentiments helps sustain them and sets them apart from other , more fleeting and contradictory anti-foreign sentiments , such as those Chinese sometimes harbor towards Americans . 
The emergence of a deep-rooted and popular anti-Japanese enmity in China does not bode well . 
As the Party uses nationalist sentiment to keep China unified , these sentiments have become fiercer , and the political leadership is increasingly held hostage to nationalist opinion in formulating China &apos;s foreign policy towards Japan . 
As a result , Japanese increasingly fear China &apos;s rise and possible future retribution for their country &apos;s wartime aggressions . 
Indeed , Japanese public-opinion surveys also reveal a marked decline in favorable views of China . 
Meanwhile , an emergent Japanese nationalism argues that Japan should revise its pacifist constitution and develop its military capability - possibly including nuclear weapons to balance threats like that from North Korea . 
The possibility of a Sino-Japanese arms race is becoming increasingly real . 
Indeed , the Japan Defense Agency recently outlined three scenarios for a Chinese attack against Japan , and announced that it is planning to redeploy its troops from the north ( where they were originally stationed to defend Japan against the former Soviet Union ) to the south , facing China . 
Pessimists now fret that Asia is not big enough for both China and Japan : you &quot; can &apos;t have two tigers in one forest . &quot; 
Optimists counter that China and Japan can cooperate , acting as the &quot; dual engines &quot; of Asian development . 
Japan expert Feng Zhaokui takes the middle ground , arguing that Sino-Japanese relations will be marked by the coexistence of both cooperation and conflict . 
Recent developments suggest that a purely cooperative bilateral relationship is unlikely , to say the least . 
If we are lucky , Feng may be right .
