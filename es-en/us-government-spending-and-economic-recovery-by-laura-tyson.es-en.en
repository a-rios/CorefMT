America &apos;s Sequestered Recovery 
BERKELEY - The United States is confronting another round of cuts in federal government spending , this time threatening to trim at least 0.5 percentage points from GDP growth and to precipitate a loss of at least one million jobs . 
Automatic across-the-board spending cuts , the so-called &quot; sequester , &quot; would reduce spending by $ 85 billion , with defense programs cut by about 8 % and domestic programs by about 5 % this year - and with additional cuts of comparable dollar amounts every year until 2021 . 
All major government functions - national security , foreign aid , basic research , emergency relief , and education , to name a few salient examples - would experience an immediate and sizeable funding hit . 
These cuts , along with the tax increases agreed to in January , would knock about 1.25 percentage points off 2013 GDP growth , consigning the economy to another year of tepid recovery and disappointing job gains . 
The real aim of the sequester &apos;s advocates is a smaller federal government - a goal that often is cloaked in the argument that excessive government spending is choking economic growth . 
Although this is a politically compelling argument , because it stokes public fears about an out-of-control deficit , it flies in the face of the facts . 
Anemic government spending , not profligacy , has been a major factor behind the economy &apos;s lackluster recovery . 
According to a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office , large spending cuts by state and local governments - and , more recently , a significant reduction in federal spending - have contributed to the unusual and prolonged weakness of aggregate demand . 
In recent speeches , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chair Janet Yellen have described fiscal policy at the local , state , and federal levels as a powerful headwind slowing the economy &apos;s return to full employment . 
In the year after the recession ended , discretionary spending at the federal , state , and local levels boosted growth at about the same pace as in previous recoveries . 
But , since then - and in sharp contrast to previous recoveries - fiscal policy has become contractionary , reducing aggregate demand and restraining growth . 
State and local governments have cut spending and payrolls significantly . 
And federal purchases of goods and services have been declining since 2010 , when the temporary additional spending in the 2009 stimulus package came to an end . 
Even without the sequester , real per capita government spending ( including both purchases and transfer payments ) has declined under President Barack Obama , while it increased under every preceding president since Richard Nixon . 
( Indeed , per capita spending growth was much faster under the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush than it was under Democratic Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton . ) 
And , even without the sequester , the federal budget deficit is set to fall at a faster pace during the next two years than in any two-year period since demobilization after World War II . 
As a result of a deep and persistent deficiency in aggregate demand , the US economy has been operating far below its potential output level . 
Real GDP fell by 8 % relative to its noninflationary potential in 2008-2009 , and has remained about 8 % below its previous growth path ever since . 
This translates into about $ 900 billion of foregone goods and services this year alone - a tremendous waste reflected in an unemployment rate of 7.9 % and a poverty rate of 15 % , significantly higher than the average of the past 30 years . 
And the waste accumulates over time : the longer the economy operates far below its capacity , the slower the growth in its future capacity as a result of diminished risk-taking , foregone investment , and erosion of the skills base . 
The significant loss of current and future potential output is all the more remarkable , because it has occurred despite a sustained and unprecedented effort by the Fed to boost demand and hasten the recovery . 
Fed officials have repeatedly expressed concern that the prolonged weak recovery will inflict future pain in the form of slower long-run growth . 
Motivated by this concern , the Fed has held the nominal short-term interest rate near zero - its effective lower bound - for more than five years , with a promise to keep it there until 2015 , and has been purchasing about $ 1 trillion of long-term government bonds each year . 
As a result , the nominal yield on the ten-year Treasury bond , a widely used measure of the federal government &apos;s borrowing costs , hovers around 2 % . 
That is higher than the record low of 1.4 % hit in 2012 , but less than half the pre-2008 level and less than a third of its 40-year average . 
In real terms , both short-term and long-term interest rates remain in negative territory . 
Recent research has found that the multiplier for discretionary fiscal policy - the change in output caused by a change in discretionary government spending - is larger when nominal interest rates are low and there is a significant amount of underutilized resources . 
These conditions describe the US economy as it faces yet another round of government spending cuts that would have negative multiplier effects on GDP and job growth . 
Indeed , these effects are likely to be larger than expected compared to conventional multiplier estimates , which rest on two assumptions : the economy is close to full employment ; and the contraction in demand caused by a cut in government spending will be offset by a drop in interest rates . 
Neither assumption applies today . 
Even worse , the sequester &apos;s across-the-board spending cuts make no distinction between effective and essential programs and programs that represent special interests or have outlived their original purpose . 
Such arbitrary cuts are likely to inflict more damage on the economy than sensibly targeted cuts of the same magnitude . 
The sequester is the product of ideology and political stalemate . 
It has no economic justification . 
In the long run , additional targeted spending cuts will be necessary as part of a balanced package to stabilize the debt / GDP ratio . 
But they are not necessary now . 
Indeed , by endangering the economy &apos;s halting recovery , they would be counterproductive .
