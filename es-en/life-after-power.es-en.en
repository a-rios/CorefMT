Life After Power 
Next week &apos;s Commonwealth heads of government summit in Nigeria is a make or break moment for the New Partnership for Africa &apos;s Development ( NEPAD ) , the initiative designed by Africans to modernize Africa &apos;s governments and economies . 
Zimbabwe &apos;s ongoing economic decline under the misrule of President Robert Mugabe has raised doubts about NEPAD &apos;s key innovation , its self-monitoring instrument , the African Peer Review Mechanism . 
The question is a legitimate one , because when African initiatives fail , they usually fail because of a lack of political will to follow through on commitments and declarations . 
The stark inability of Africa &apos;s leaders to constructively criticize their peers contributes mightily to this . 
One cause often proposed for this damaging phenomenon is the emphasis that many African cultures place on mutual respect . 
Africa &apos;s great hope is that its &quot; new generation &quot; leaders - most prominently President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , who helped spearhead NEPAD &apos;s peer review process in the first place - acknowledge this fact . 
So far , 16 countries have voluntarily acceded to the peer review process : Algeria , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , Gabon , Ghana , Kenya , Mali , Mauritius , Mozambique , Nigeria , Rwanda , Senegal , South Africa , and Uganda have declared their readiness to submit to scrutiny by their peers in what now constitutes the African Peer Review ( APR ) Forum . 
The first two countries to be reviewed will be Ghana and South Africa . 
A Panel of Eminent Persons and a Secretariat to oversee the process is now in place . 
Review work , it is hoped , will begin early in the new year . 
But given the lack of criticism of Mugabe &apos;s misrule , some critics wonder , justifiably , whether the review process will ever tackle Africa &apos;s most egregious blights - misbegotten leadership and corruption . 
Arguably , one of the most encouraging features of NEPAD is its recognition and public admission that without proper governance institutions in place , Africa will remain , poor , marginalized , and conflict ridden . 
The question now , however , is whether NEPAD will address the greatest cause of conflict and corruption in Africa : one-man rule . 
Will NEPAD insist on mechanisms for the periodic and peaceful change of political leadership in member countries ? 
Will it block leaders from changing their countries &apos; constitutions to allow them to seek re-election after their term limits are over ? 
NEPAD &apos;s credibility and ultimate success rests on the answers to these questions . 
A cursory glance at most of the conflict-ridden countries in Africa shows that monopolization of political power over extended periods of time has not only helped institutionalize corruption , as leaders surround themselves with trusted relatives and cronies , but has also been a major cause of coups and conflict . 
Notable examples include Mobutu in Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of Congo ) , Siaka Stevens in Sierra Leone , Samuel Doe in Liberia , Siad Barre in Somalia , and Haile Selassie and Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia . 
Indeed , there is no shortage of potentially explosive situations . 
In Togo , President Gnassingbe Eyadema has been in power for 38 years and , just last December , amended the constitution to allow him to seek further re-election . 
In Guinea , an ailing Lansana Conteh - in power since 1984 - did the same thing last year . 
In Zimbabwe , Mugabe hangs tenaciously to power after 23 years . 
All these states are in peril of sliding into violent conflict . 
So are countries like Gabon and Cameroon - both members of the APR Forum - where Omar Bongo and Paul Biya , respectively , have been in power for decades . 
Helping leaders to imagine a life after power is one of the surest ways of ridding Africa of conflict and a great deal of corruption , and putting the continent firmly on the path to sustainable peace and development . 
If leaders and their close associates and cronies in high places know that there will be life after power - a period in which questions of accountability will inevitably be raised - they will act more carefully and responsibly while in office . 
The realization that leaders are likely to step down some day may also make potentially militant groups more patient . 
The few African countries that already have such institutions in place - among them South Africa , Kenya , Nigeria , Ghana , Zambia , and Senegal - are clearly moving in the right direction . 
The improving quality of life in all those countries shows that such reforms work .
