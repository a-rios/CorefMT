No Time for Nostalgia 
France and Germany have every reason to celebrate the miracle of their friendship , sealed forty years ago by the Elysée Treaty . 
But they have no reason to be satisfied with its current condition . 
Neither has Europe . 
For most of modern history , the Franco-German antagonism-the two countries &apos; so-called &quot; hereditary enmity &quot; -haunted Europe and the world . 
In his famous University of Zurich speech in 1946 , Winston Churchill urged that &quot; The first step in the re-creation of the European Family must be a partnership between France and Germany . &quot; 
Franco-German reconciliation , guided by the leadership of men like General Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer , made post-war Europe &apos;s amazing successes possible . 
The last landmark in the Franco-German partnership was the Treaty of Maastricht , concluded in 1991 . 
Reunited Germany surrendered its beloved currency , the Deutsche Mark , to boost European integration , but also to calm French fears that Germany was poised to establish monetary hegemony over the continent . 
However , the legendary tandems of the past-de Gaulle and Adenauer , Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing and Helmut Schmidt , François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl-have not been succeeded by a comparable duo . 
This is not only a problem of personal chemistry between Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder . 
The deeper cause of recent estrangement and national rivalry has been German reunification , which disturbed the bilateral balance . 
Until 1990 , France-or , rather , much of its political class-tacitly agreed with Nobel laureate François Mauriac &apos;s famous confession : &quot; I love Germany so much that I prefer it to be split into two parts . &quot; 
Germany &apos;s division created a rough demographic parity between French and West Germans . 
By contrast , reunited Germany has some 80 million people , France only 60 million . 
Moreover , a &quot; balance of imbalance &quot; promoted a sense of equality . 
While West Germany &apos;s economy was stronger , France was a nuclear power and a permanent , veto-wielding , member of the UN Security Council . 
Germany long ago renounced possession of nuclear weapons , and it is unlikely to become a permanent member of the Security Council soon . 
Yet , from a French perspective , eastward enlargement of the EU augments Germany &apos;s weight . 
The future &quot; Europe of 27 &quot; ( or 28 , with Turkey , but not counting the post-Yugoslav republics and Albania ) will be very different from the &quot; Europe of Six &quot; that de Gaulle and Adenauer oversaw . 
Berlin &apos;s geographical position in the EU of tomorrow now seems more central , with Paris on the fringe . 
Moreover , whereas German Chancellors &apos; tone towards the French government had always been moderate , Schröder &apos;s behavior has been assertive , with the EU &apos;s Nice summit in December 2000 driving Franco-German relations to a forty-year low point . 
Chirac insisted on absolute parity of votes between France and Germany in the EU Council of Ministers , ignoring their demographic disparity . 
Schröder did not seem to grasp the enormous symbolic relevance his partner attached to the issue . 
More importantly , the Nice meeting showed how far French and German ideas about European integration had drifted apart . 
While France prefers an intergovernmental approach , Germany remains prepared to transfer more national sovereignty to the Brussels . 
Now , like a squabbling old couple , France and Germany are using the their wedding anniversary as an opportunity to revive their partnership . 
Chirac and Schröder gave a foretaste of what that means in practice when they made a joint proposal that the EU be led by a twin-presidency : a European Council president ( chosen by the heads of government ) , and a Commission president ( elected by the European parliament ) . 
This compromise attempts to square the circle by combining the intergovernmental and unionist approaches . 
Both governments seem convinced that more Franco-German summitry ( now including joint sessions of their cabinets ) will remedy their marital crisis . 
Likewise , the extravagance of the jubilee celebrations in Versailles-far more pompous than the modest ceremony in the Elysée 40 years ago-will be inversely proportional to their political relevance . 
The real problem is that revitalizing the Franco-German alliance must be based on a pro-European agenda , rather than each simply sticking to bad national habits . 
Unfortunately , there are worrying signs that this is happening . 
For example , France remains unwilling to accept a fundamental reform of the EU &apos;s Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) , of which it is the chief beneficiary . 
Last fall , Germany , the largest contributor to the EU budget , accepted a compromise prolonging the present CAP for a decade . 
As a result , farmers in future member countries will only receive 25 % of West European levels of direct payments when they join in 2004 , reaching parity only in 2013 . 
Germany , for its part , is better at signing agreements on enhanced defense cooperation among Europeans than it is at honoring them . 
It recently refused to purchase the full number of Airbus troop transport planes that it had promised to buy . 
Most importantly , the political determination needed to begin long overdue social-welfare and labor-market reforms is weak in both countries . 
This is not only a domestic issue . 
As the most important Euro countries , France and Germany have a special responsibility for the health of Europe &apos;s economy and the credibility of its currency . 
So let France and Germany enjoy their celebration in Versailles . 
When the party is over , hard choices must be made . 
No more time for nostalgia .
