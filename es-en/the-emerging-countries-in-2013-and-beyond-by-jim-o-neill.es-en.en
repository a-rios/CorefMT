Emerging World Rising 
LONDON - Now that the leadership issues in the United States and China have been settled , we can finally frame the economic outlook for 2013 with the knowledge of who will be pulling the policy levers in the world &apos;s two biggest economies . 
So , what will they do - and , perhaps more important , what will economic forces do to them ? 
For starters , the US will face recurring challenges with the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; until financial markets pressure policymakers into more radical deficit reduction . 
But , despite this and associated growth disappointments , 2013 will be a stronger year for the global economy than many people expect . 
In 2011 , China contributed $ 1.3 trillion in additional GDP to the world , the equivalent of creating another Greece every 12.5 weeks , or close to another Spain every year . 
Together , the four BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) contributed around $ 2.2 trillion in 2012 , equivalent to another Italy every year . 
( Despite its problems , Italy is still the world &apos;s eighth-largest economy , and will be for at least the next couple of years , until Russia and India possibly overtake it ) . 
The eight growth market economies - the BRICs plus South Korea , Indonesia , Mexico , and Turkey - created close to $ 3 trillion in 2011 , more than the United Kingdom in one year . 
These economies &quot; combined size is now approximately that of the US economy , with total annual output reaching $ 15-16 trillion , or roughly 25 % of global GDP . 
Unless their growth rates slow sharply , their contribution to world output will rise dramatically , and global growth will be stronger than worried Western analysts might appreciate . 
If the &quot; Growth Eight &quot; economies expanded by 10 % on average in US dollar terms , they would add $ 1.5 trillion to global GDP next year . 
For the decade that began in 2011 , we at Goldman Sachs Asset Management have assumed that China , which accounts for about half of total Growth Eight output ( probably $ 8.3 trillion by the end of 2012 ) , will grow at a 7-8 % annual rate in real terms , with inflation around 3 % . 
Unless the renminbi falls in value , this translates into an average nominal increase of at least 10-11 % in dollar terms . 
China will grow by 7-8 % partly because that is what policymakers have decided they want . 
In late 2009 , within a year of their massive policy stimulus in response to the global credit crisis , the Chinese leadership , I believe , decided that 10 % annual real growth had outlived its usefulness . 
Income inequality was rising dramatically , environmental damage was worsening rapidly , and inflation was leading to weak real-income growth for poor households . 
Indeed , a key reason for China &apos;s slowdown in 2011-2012 is that officials wanted it . 
While the real GDP growth rate stated in the 12th Five-Year Plan should not be viewed as a fait accompli , the fact that the Plan &apos;s growth rate was lowered to 7 % is a powerful signal of official intent . 
Looking ahead , while China &apos;s leadership change is important , the country &apos;s leaders cannot decide things with the freedom that one might think . 
They become leaders partly through commitment to the agreed plan . 
A potential leader who deviates too much does not stay in the leadership , as we saw in 2012 with the purge of Bo Xilai . 
China &apos;s 7 % growth target , while subject to a number of challenges , is based on maintaining private consumption growth of around 8 % ( while recognizing that exports and investment will not grow as strongly as before ) , thereby allowing the consumption share of GDP to rise . 
More focus on innovation and creativity will be accompanied by strong real wage growth , provision of greater rights for urban migrants , and expansion of health care and pensions . 
If China grows by 7-8 % again in 2013 , it will be more balanced growth than in 2012 . 
Beyond China , the other BRICs - Brazil , Russia , and India - all face challenges that their policymakers need to meet to spur stronger growth . 
But there are plenty of exciting developments elsewhere , including Indonesia , the Philippines , Bangladesh , Nigeria , and Mexico - all part of what I call the &quot; Next 11 . &quot; 
South Korea and Turkey , which continue to grow reasonably well , albeit not with the others &quot; momentum , are two of this group &apos;s other big members . 
The 15 countries that comprise the BRICs and the Next 11 contain more than four billion people , close to two-thirds of the world &apos;s population . 
As they continue to grow , their share of the world economy will continue to rise , boosting global growth beyond what it otherwise would be . 
But the global economy could be weaker in 2013 than it was in 2012 if the worst continues to prevail in Europe and the US , particularly if the new US Congress cannot work with a re-elected President Barack Obama to find a budget deal that improves the medium-term credibility of the US fiscal position while avoiding excessive deficit cutting . 
This is a difficult balance to achieve , and , without pressure from the markets , I am unsure how it will play out . 
I should add , however , that if the US government does not cause problems , two private-sector developments seem likely to be helpful . 
One is growing evidence of a housing recovery ; the other is the prospect of steadily declining energy-import costs as domestic production , particularly of natural gas , continues to rise . 
As for Europe , many investors still assume that a moment will arrive when we can definitively conclude that European Monetary Union is finished or saved . 
Unfortunately , it is much more likely that , at least ahead of Germany &apos;s autumn 2013 elections , key decisions will be postponed or avoided . 
This means that Europe probably faces another challenging year . 
But , again , the BRICs &quot; output growth amounts to creating the equivalent of another Italy every 12 months . 
Unless the European environment deteriorates sharply , Europe &apos;s travails will not be the main story for the global economy in 2013 .
