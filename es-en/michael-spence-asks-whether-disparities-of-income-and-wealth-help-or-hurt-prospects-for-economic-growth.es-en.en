Good and Bad Inequality 
MILAN - Rising income and wealth inequality in many countries around the world has been a long-term trend for three decades or more . 
The &quot; old &quot; theory about inequality was that redistribution via the tax system weakened incentives and undermined economic growth . 
But the relationship between inequality and growth is far more complex and multi-dimensional than this simple trade-off suggests . 
Multiple channels of influence and feedback mechanisms make definitive conclusions difficult . 
For example , the United States and China are the fastest-growing major economies today . 
Both have similarly high and rising levels of income inequality . 
Though one should not conclude from this that growth and inequality are either unrelated or positively correlated , the unqualified statement that inequality is bad for growth does not really accord with the facts . 
Moreover , in global terms , inequality has been falling as developing countries prosper - even though it is increasing within many developed and developing countries . 
This may seem counterintuitive , but it makes sense . 
The dominant trend in the global economy is the convergence process that began after World War II . 
A substantial share of the 85 % of the world &apos;s population living in developing countries experienced sustained rapid real growth for the first time . 
This global trend overwhelms that of rising domestic inequality . 
Nonetheless , experience in a wide range of countries suggests that high and rising levels of inequality , especially inequality of opportunity , can indeed be detrimental to growth . 
One reason is that inequality undercuts the political and social consensus around growth-oriented strategies and policies . 
It can lead to gridlock , conflict , or poor policy choices . 
The evidence supports the view that the systematic exclusion of subgroups on any arbitrary basis ( for example , ethnicity , race , or religion ) is particularly damaging in this respect . 
Intergenerational mobility is a key indicator of equality of opportunity . 
Rising inequality of outcomes need not lead to reduced intergenerational mobility . 
Whether it does depends heavily on whether important instruments that support equality of opportunity , principally education and health care , are universally accessible . 
For example , if public education systems start to fail , they are often replaced at the upper end of the income distribution by a private system , with adverse consequences for intergenerational mobility . 
There are other links between inequality and growth . 
High levels of income and wealth inequality ( as in much of South America and parts of Africa ) often lead to and reinforce unequal political influence . 
Rather than seeking to generate inclusive patterns of growth , policymakers seek to protect the wealth and rent-capturing advantage of the rich . 
Generally , this has meant less openness to trade and investment flows , because they lead to unwanted external competition . 
This suggests that all inequality ( of outcomes ) should not be viewed in the same way . 
Inequality based on successful rent seeking and privileged access to resources and market opportunities is highly toxic with respect to social cohesion and stability - and hence growth-oriented policies . 
In a generally meritocratic environment , outcomes based on creativity , innovation , or extraordinary talent are usually viewed benignly and believed to have far less damaging effects . 
That is partly why China &apos;s current &quot; anti-corruption &quot; campaign , for example , is so important . 
It is not so much China &apos;s relatively high income inequality , but the social tensions created by insiders &quot; privileged access to markets and transactions , that threatens the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s legitimacy and the effectiveness of its governance . 
In the US , how much of the increase in income inequality over the past three decades reflects technological change and globalization ( both favoring those with higher levels of education and skills ) , and how much reflects privileged access to the policymaking process , is a complex and unsettled question . 
First , the policy responses are different ; second , the effects on social cohesion and the social contract &apos;s credibility are also different . 
Rapid growth helps . 
In a high-growth environment , with rising incomes for almost everyone , people will accept rising inequality up to a point , particularly if it occurs in a context that is substantially meritocratic . 
The consequences of rising income inequality can tempt policymakers down a dangerous path : the use of debt , sometimes combined with an asset bubble , to sustain consumption . 
This arguably occurred in the 1920s , prior to the Great Depression ; it certainly occurred in the US ( and Spain and the United Kingdom ) in the decade prior to the 2008 crisis . 
A variant , seen in Europe , is the use of government borrowing to fill a demand and employment gap created by deficient private domestic and external demand . 
To the extent that the latter is associated with productivity and competitiveness problems , and exacerbated by the common currency , this is an inappropriate policy response . 
Similar concerns have been raised about the rapid increase in debt ratios in China . 
Perhaps debt seems like the path of least resistance in dealing with the effects of inequality or slow growth . 
Leverage is one of the worst . 
So where does that leave us ? 
For me , the high-priority items are fairly clear . 
In the short run , the top priority is income support for the poor and the unemployed , who are the immediate victims of crises and the underlying imbalances and structural problems , which take time to remove . 
Second , especially with rising income inequality , universal access to high-quality public services , particularly education , is crucial . 
Inclusion sustains social and political cohesion - and hence the very growth needed to help mitigate the effects of rising inequality . 
There are many ways for economies to fall short of their growth potential , but underinvestment , especially within the public sector , is one of the most potent and common .
