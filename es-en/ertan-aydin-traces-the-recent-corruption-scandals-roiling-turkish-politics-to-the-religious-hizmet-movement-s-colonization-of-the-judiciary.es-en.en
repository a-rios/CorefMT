Turkey &apos;s Failed Bureaucratic Coup 
ANKARA - Last week , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan intensified his government &apos;s response to the corruption investigations that have been roiling the country since December , restructuring the leadership of the judiciary and police . 
But it would be a mistake to view this as a fight between the executive and the judiciary , or as an attempt to cover up charges that have led to the resignation of three ministers . 
What is at issue is the law-enforcement authorities &quot; independence and impartiality . 
Indeed , amid charges of fabricated evidence , Erdoğan now says that he is not opposed to retrials for senior military officers convicted of plotting to overthrow his government . 
The recent developments reflect the widening rift between Erdoğan &apos;s government and the Gülen movement , led by Fethullah Gülen , a self-exiled Islamic preacher currently residing near Philadelphia . 
The Gülen movement was an important backer of the governing Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) and its efforts to establish civilian control over the military during the AKP &apos;s first two terms in office . 
Now , however , the movement appears to have been plotting a coup of its own . 
Many members of the judiciary and the police force associated with the wave of corruption charges brought against government officials , businessmen , and politicians &quot; family members are connected with the Gülen movement . 
What started out as an investigation into alleged graft soon became an opposition-supported smear campaign . 
Turkey &apos;s current struggles raise important questions about the appropriate relationship between bureaucrats and elected officials in a pluralist democracy . 
Answering them will require a debate that transcends issues like the separation of powers and judicial independence and elucidates the appropriate relationship between politics and religion . 
For that , understanding the historical context of the current crisis is crucial . 
When Turkey became a democracy in 1950 , the previous system &apos;s secular Kemalist elites attempted to harness the power of the military and the bureaucracy to control the elected government . 
In fact , the Turkish military , with the judiciary &apos;s support , explicitly intervened in the civilian government &apos;s functioning in 1960 , 1971 , 1980 , and 1997 , each time in the name of protecting secularism . 
In response , various religious groups , including the Gülen movement , encouraged their followers to take positions in the bureaucracy and the military . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , military-backed secularist governments struck back , attempting to purge religious bureaucrats and military leaders : those who did not consume alcohol , or whose family members wore headscarves , were immediately suspected . 
With the normalization of Turkish democracy following the AKP &apos;s victory in 2002 , restrictions on the recruitment , employment , and promotion of religious citizens in the upper echelons of the bureaucracy were eliminated - a process that especially benefited members of the Gülen movement , with its extensive education , media , and business networks . 
Gülen followers - who claimed to support liberal democracy and the tolerant , modern form of Islam embraced by the AKP - seemed like natural allies of Erdoğan &apos;s government . 
For a decade , Gülen-connected companies played a widely acknowledged - and appreciated - role in Turkey &apos;s economic growth and development , while Gülen-movement schools trained students to pursue public-service jobs . 
As long as bureaucrats were recruited and promoted based on merit , the AKP had no problem accepting the over-representation of Gülen followers in certain branches of government . 
This acceptance was rooted in the belief that Gülen members would adhere to the fundamental requirement in a pluralist democracy that bureaucrats - whether Muslims in Turkey , Mormons in the United States , or Buddhists in Japan - do not allow their religious convictions to trump their commitment to public service and the rule of law . 
What the government did not imagine was that a new vision of bureaucratic tutelage over the civilian government would emerge . 
Although Gülen followers have disagreed with several of the government &apos;s policies , they largely backed the AKP in the last three elections . 
What drove them to reject the party completely was a policy debate on restructuring &quot; cram schools &quot; - expensive private institutions that prepare high-school seniors for their university entrance examinations . 
The Gülen movement operates at least one-quarter of these schools , which form a key component of the movement &apos;s multi-billion-dollar education network and help it recruit new members . 
The movement &apos;s members thus viewed the debate over cram schools as a direct challenge to their influence . 
But their reaction was disproportionate - not least because the government &apos;s plans were not finalized . 
Moreover , the proposal had nothing to do with the Gülen movement ; the government was responding to citizens &quot; complaints about having to pay extravagant fees to prepare their children for free public universities . 
And the Gülen movement was not exactly caught off-guard ; cram-school representatives had been engaged in a dialogue with education-ministry officials for some time . 
As in any democracy , public criticism of Turkey &apos;s government policies is normal and healthy . 
But attempts by Gülen-aligned members of the judiciary and the police force to blackmail , threaten , and illegally bargain with the government are unacceptable . 
Now , it is up to the courts to discern the truth about corruption among Turkey &apos;s so-called &quot; public servants . &quot; 
But all of the signs point to a coordinated political crusade by Gülen followers , including the chief prosecutors involved in the recent corruption cases and the pro-Gülen media that have steadfastly defended the prosecutors &quot; impartiality ( despite the many irregularities - such as extensive unauthorized wiretaps - that have come to light ) . 
Moreover , a coordinated group within the judiciary is suspected of planting evidence - allegations that have led to the calls for military personnel to be retried . 
To be sure , this does not mean that there were no coup attempts by members of the military in the past or cases of corruption by politicians and bureaucrats . 
The point is that Turkey needs judicial reforms that eliminate the possibility of organized cliques manipulating their constitutional powers to advance their own narrow goals . 
This is a red line for any pluralist democracy . 
Individual citizens should be free to live according to their beliefs ; but an unaccountable theological vision must not be allowed to shape their behavior as civil servants and bureaucrats . 
More generally , the debate about the Gülen movement should serve as an opportunity to clarify the relationship between religion and politics , while reminding the Turkish public - and Muslim-majority countries throughout the region - of the core democratic values that have enabled Turkey to develop and thrive .
