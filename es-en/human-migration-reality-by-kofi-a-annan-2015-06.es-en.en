Migration Realism 
GENEVA - The scenes of death and misery that are occurring with increasing frequency in the waters of the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia have focused renewed attention on one of mankind &apos;s oldest activities : migration . 
It is time to accept the reality that , like the waves on the seas that many of the migrants traverse , the ebb and flow of human movement cannot be stopped . 
That is why the international community must manage migration with understanding and compassion . 
Today , some 250 million migrants live and work around the world , and in the coming months and years many more will certainly join them . 
We must put in place policies to manage the flows of people in ways that benefit migrants &quot; countries of origin , transit , and destination . 
And of course , we must ensure the wellbeing of the migrants themselves . 
This calls for action on four fronts . 
For starters , leaders of destination countries - whether in Europe , Africa , the Americas , Asia , or Oceania - should not turn their back on the desperate and wretched . 
For many elected officials , migration poses a complex political dilemma : how to reconcile their citizens &quot; demands with the interests of migrants . 
They must find the courage to make the case for a humane migration policy . 
But , all too often , migrants are used as scapegoats . 
To be sure , immigrants must agree to adapt to the cultures and customs of the countries in which they settle . 
But the public in destination countries , for their part , must acknowledge the critical role that the new arrivals can play in the economy . 
Migrants fill critical skill gaps , perform jobs that others cannot or will not do , and replace a country &apos;s workforce as it grows older or shrinks . 
According to the Munich-based Institute for Economic Research , Germany alone will need an estimated 32 million immigrants by 2035 to maintain an adequate balance between its working-age and non-working-age population . 
Second , we need to ensure that migrants who choose to send money back to their countries of origin can do so as easily and inexpensively as possible . 
In 2014 , remittances by migrants to developing countries amounted to an estimated $ 436 billion - a sum that dwarfs the annual total that the international community spends on official development aid . 
Unfortunately , however , financial intermediaries take an average of 9 % of the precious earnings that migrants send home . 
Reducing the intermediaries &quot; share would boost the income of migrants &quot; families back home , increase economic opportunity in these countries , help reduce poverty , and , by extension , contribute to global stability . 
Third , we must provide immigration systems with the resources needed to process asylum claims quickly , fairly , and openly , so that refugees are protected and safely resettled . 
European countries , for example , need to devise mechanisms to share the flow of incoming migrants . 
The developed world sometimes wrongly feels that it is being asked to care for a disproportionate number of people seeking a better life . 
In reality , 70 % of refugees seek protection in developing countries . 
Lebanon , for example , has a total population of 4.5 million people . 
By the end of this year , it will likely harbor close to two million refugees , driven from their homes by violent conflict in neighboring Syria and elsewhere . 
Those migrating today are doing so for the same reasons that once spurred millions of Europeans to leave their countries . 
They are fleeing poverty , war , or oppression , or are searching for a better life in a new land . 
Moreover , many of today &apos;s migrants , like those flooding into Lebanon ( and Jordan ) have legal claims to asylum under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the subsequent 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees . 
When potential refugees are blocked by offshore barriers , detained for excessive periods in unsatisfactory conditions , or refused entry because of restrictive legal interpretations , the protection of international law is lost . 
Finally , interdiction efforts should focus on traffickers , not on those whom they exploit . 
We must be careful not to drive migration further underground or offer additional opportunities to the criminal gangs that prey on the desperation of migrants to make obscene profits . 
This is not a call for unrestrained migration . 
But it is important that we accept the fact that efforts to block migration are bound to fail , with disastrous consequences for human lives - whether they are lost on sinking boats in the Mediterranean and the Andaman Sea or threatened by xenophobic violence in South Africa , India , or elsewhere . 
Building higher fences cannot be the answer . 
Migration will continue until we lift the poorest and most vulnerable out of the conditions they are currently fleeing . 
In the early 1980s , I worked at the United Nations Refugee Agency , and I recall how Europe &apos;s political leaders , intellectuals , and academics rallied to the cause of the boat people fleeing Vietnam . 
The world has a moral duty to come together in the same way today .
