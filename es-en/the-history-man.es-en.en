The History Man 
President George W. Bush is not generally known for his firm grasp of history . 
In a recent speech to American war veterans in Kansas City , he defended his aim to &quot; stay the course &quot; in Iraq by pointing out the consequences of the American withdrawal from the war in Vietnam . 
He also mentioned the post-1945 occupation of Japan and the Korean War as success stories in America &apos;s efforts to bring freedom to Asia , and by extension , the world . 
Historians , Democrats , and other Bush critics were quick to denounce his speech , particularly his reference to Vietnam , as self-serving , dishonest , and inaccurate . 
Yet , for once , Bush actually hit upon a historical analogy that was true . 
Of course , the Vietnam War was different in almost every respect from the war in Iraq . 
Ho Chi Minh was not Saddam Hussein . 
In Vietnam , the United States was not invading a country , but defending a corrupt authoritarian ally against an aggressive Communist regime . 
But what Bush actually said was that the US withdrawal from Indochina was followed by a bloodbath in Cambodia , and brutal oppression in Vietnam . 
A withdrawal from Iraq , he implied , would result in similar bloodshed , or worse . 
That is almost certainly true . 
However , what Bush did not say is that neither the mass murders in Southeast Asia , nor the potential mass murders in Iraq , would have occurred without the chaos caused by US intervention . 
But what about the Asian success stories , in Japan , Korea , and other places under American protection ? 
Was Bush right to boast of America &apos;s role in giving these countries their freedom ? 
As he put it to the Kansas City veterans : &quot; Will today &apos;s generation of Americans resist the allure of retreat , and will we do in the Middle East what the veterans in this room did in Asia ? &quot; 
What exactly did the US do in Asia ? 
The first few years of the occupation of Japan were indeed a remarkable success for democracy . 
Instead of helping Japanese of the old school restore an authoritarian system , General Douglas MacArthur &apos;s administration helped Japanese liberals restore and improve their prewar democratic institutions . 
Trade unions were given more clout . 
Civil liberties were boosted . 
And the semi-divine Japanese Emperor was brought down to earth . 
Much of the credit for this goes to the Japanese themselves and to the idealistic , left-leaning New Dealers in MacArthur &apos;s government who supported them . 
When China fell to Mao &apos;s Communists , however , and North Korea got Chinese and Soviet backing for an invasion of the south , democratic idealism was stopped in its tracks . 
In Japan , former war criminals were released from prison , &quot; reds &quot; were purged , and right-wing governments led by some of those same former war criminals got enthusiastic American backing . 
Democracy , instead of being nurtured , was distorted , with active American encouragement , to make sure the right stayed in power and the left was kept at bay . 
South Koreans certainly have much to thank the Americans for . 
Without UN intervention in the Korean War , led by the US , the South would have been taken over by Kim Il Sung , the Great Leader , and their current freedom and prosperity would never have been possible . 
But South Korean democracy was not something the US gave to the Koreans , or even always encouraged . 
From the late 1940 &quot; s to the late 1980 &quot; s , the US played along with , and sometimes actively backed , anti-Communist authoritarian rulers , who grabbed and consolidated their powers through violent coups and the suppression of dissent . 
The same was true in the Philippines , Taiwan , Indonesia , and Thailand , and , indeed , in the Middle East , where democracy is yet to take root . 
As long as the Cold War lasted , US administrations consistently favored military strongmen and civilian dictators in the name of fighting Communism - anything to keep the left down , even the kind of left that would have been regarded as simply liberal in the democratic West . 
True , for most people , life under right-wing Asian strongmen was , on the whole , preferable to life under Mao , Pol Pot , Kim Il Sung , or even Ho Chi Minh . 
But to call the citizens under Park Chung Hee , Ferdinand Marcos , or General Suharto &quot; free &quot; is an abomination . 
The happy fact that Koreans , Filipinos , Thais and Taiwanese did eventually become free , or at least freer , is not so much to the credit of the US as it is to the people who fought for their freedoms themselves . 
It was only in the late 1980 &quot; s , when the Communist empire was crumbling , that US governments actively backed democratic politicians and demonstrators in Seoul , Taipei , or Manila . 
But the heroes of democracy were Asian , not American . 
Bush is right to claim that people in the Middle East would like to be as prosperous and free as the South Koreans , but his notion that the war in Iraq is simply a continuation of US policies in Asia could not be more mistaken . 
In Asia , as in the Middle East , US strategy was to prop up dictators against Communism until their own people toppled them . 
In the Middle East today , it is reckless and radical : invading a country , wrecking its institutions , and expecting that freedom will grow in the ensuing state of anarchy . 
To confuse these different enterprises and pretend that they are the same is not only wrong , but dangerous , and deeply disappointing to those of us who still regard the US as a force for good .
