The Party is Over 
MUNICH - With the United States teetering into recession , the global economic boom has ended . 
The boom was unusually long and persistent , with four years of roughly 5 % growth - a period of sustained economic dynamism not seen since around 1970 . 
The clearest sign that the boom is ending is the IMF &apos;s forecast of 1.5 % growth for the US in 2008 . 
That may not sound like a recession , but the Fund &apos;s marginally positive projection primarily reflects the growth overhang from 2007 , with hardly any new contribution in 2008 . 
It is compatible with three consecutive quarters of zero growth in 2008 . 
Many argue that a US recession will no longer affect the world because China has supplanted America as an engine of the global economy . 
Wrong . 
Although China is growing fast , its economic power remains tiny . 
While the US contributes 28 % to world GDP , China accounts for only 5 % . 
The whole of Asia , from Turkey to China , contributes 24 % , less than the US alone . 
At some stage , the world may no longer catch a cold when the US sneezes , but that is far from being true now . 
Twenty-one percent of China &apos;s exports and 23 % of the EU &apos;s exports to non-member countries go to the US . 
Thus , the world cannot help but be pulled down by a US slump . 
The most recent CESifo World Economic Survey ( WES ) from 90 countries confirms this . 
Assessments of the current economic situation and expectations for the next six months have worsened everywhere . 
In both western and eastern Europe , the index sank more than in Asia or Latin America . 
The decline in the WES indicator during the last two quarters was the sharpest since 2001 , when the stock market bubble burst . 
In the US , the WES indicator is now below the level of September 11 , 2001 and so is the Michigan index of consumer confidence . 
For many years , the US has lived beyond its means : a household saving rate close to zero and investment financed solely with foreign funds . 
The US current account deficit , which is identical to net capital imports , grew steadily to an annual $ 811 billion in 2006 , or 6 % of GDP - by far the largest since the Great Depression . 
Year after year , the US managed to sell its assets abroad and enjoy the high life at home . 
No longer . 
The world has caught on . 
Banks everywhere are learning the hard way that the debt with which the US financed its consumption boom will not necessarily be repaid . 
The mortgage-backed securities that US banks succeeded in selling to the world are not comparable to European assets with similar names . 
In Europe , particularly Germany , a mortgage-backed security ( Pfandbrief ) is an ultra-safe asset , as normally banks finance no more than 60 % of a house &apos;s value . 
By contrast , such US securities are like a lottery ticket . 
US banks finance up to 100 % of a house &apos;s value , sometimes even more , and the sub-prime market even includes loans to people without jobs and income . 
Many European banks may not have understood this , yet they still shied away from revealing these dubious investments on their balance sheets . 
Instead , they placed them in conduits based in low-tax countries . 
Those conduits are now showing gigantic losses that have to be covered by the parent banks , some of which are being driven to the brink of bankruptcy . 
This spring will show the necessary write-offs in the annual balance sheets , but the full truth will not become known before the 2008 balance sheets are published in the spring of 2009 . 
As American assets have lost their attractiveness , their prices have dropped . 
This has meant either a decline in asset prices quoted in dollars or in dollars quoted in other currencies . 
Indeed , adjusted for inflation , the dollar is now nearly as low against the euro as it was against the deutschmark in 1992 , when German unification resulted in the breakdown of the European currency system . 
The prices of US homes are also declining at an accelerating rate , in many areas by more than 10 % per year . 
The prices of traded mortgage-backed securities have followed house prices down . 
Only US stock market prices have remained relatively stable . 
But it is only a matter of time until they fall , too . 
After all , the Standard ampamp ; 
Poor &apos;s US price-earnings ratio is still above its long-term average - 26.84 in 2007 , compared to its long-term average since 1881 of 16.31 . 
This asset meltdown is the reason for the likely recession . 
First , consumers , faced with tighter credit and falling house values , will need to cut spending , slowing the US economy and affecting all countries via world trade . 
Second , with banks losing substantial amounts of equity capital - estimates now reach $ 300 billion and more - the need to maintain minimum equity-debt ratios will force them to curtail business lending , hindering investment demand . 
True , the US Federal Reserve has tried to prevent a recession by cutting its interest rates . 
But the Fed cannot endow the banks with new equity capital and prevent a credit crunch . 
More promising is the $ 150 billion tax cut that the US Congress recently enacted . 
Equivalent to 1 % of US GDP , it is large by all accounts . 
Whether it is enough to compensate homeowners for the wealth losses resulting from declining house prices and to prevent the impending recession remains to be seen . 
But , whatever happens , the party is over .
