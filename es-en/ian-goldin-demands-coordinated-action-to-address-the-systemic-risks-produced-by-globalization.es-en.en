Getting Globalization Right 
OXFORD - Recent evidence suggests that much of the world has entered a period of low financial-market volatility . 
But this is no time for complacency ; more turbulent times are likely to lie ahead . 
Over the last quarter-century , rapid technology-driven globalization - characterized by the physical and virtual integration of the global economy , including the opening of world markets - has contributed to the fastest increase in incomes and population in history . 
But , while globalization has created unprecedented opportunity , it has also unleashed a new form of systemic risk - one that threatens to devastate political institutions and national economies . 
Systemic risk is intrinsic to globalization . 
Greater openness and integration necessarily increase the potential for cascading crises and amplification of shocks . 
As individuals and societies become richer , they come into closer contact with one another - virtually , through communication technologies , and physically , through population growth , urbanization , and travel . 
Meanwhile , rising consumption of products like food , energy , and medicine enhances the externalities , or spillover effects , of individual choices , with the connectivity of global systems increasing these effects &quot; range and impact . 
For example , taking an antibiotic may be a rational individual decision . 
But when billions of people take antibiotics , and livestock producers use them to boost efficiency , they often become ineffective . 
The same paradox applies to energy use , owing to the destructive impact of large-scale carbon emissions . 
Even the consumption of basic necessities like food ( production of which can have major environmental consequences ) and water ( given limited supplies ) is not exempt . 
Furthermore , increased openness and market integration , driven by rapid technological change , is exacerbating divisions within and among societies . 
Those who miss the globalization train at the start often are unable to catch up later . 
Nowadays , the world &apos;s most pressing challenges - from climate change to cyber-crime - increasingly transcend national borders , making them extremely difficult to address effectively . 
Worse , they can have a cascading effect , with , say , a pandemic or cyber-attack provoking a financial or political crisis and imposing costs disproportionately on those who can least afford them . 
The vectors of connectivity - such as the Internet , financial markets , airport hubs , or logistics centers - facilitate &quot; super-spreading &quot; of globalization &apos;s effects , both positive and negative . 
Though the systemic risks brought about by globalization cannot be eliminated , they can be mitigated , if world leaders work together and learn from past mistakes . 
Unfortunately , neither appears likely . 
For starters , national politics in key countries is largely moving away from cooperation , with rising inequality and social fragmentation making it difficult for governments , especially in democracies , to make tough decisions . 
At the same time , populations are rejecting regional and global institutions . 
Europe , for example , is witnessing an upsurge in support for nationalist parties , like Britain &apos;s UK Independence Party , and increasingly loud calls for self-determination , such as in Scotland and Catalonia . 
Equally problematic , the world has largely failed to learn from globalization &apos;s most obvious and far-reaching consequence yet : the 2008 financial crisis . 
While it is impossible to safeguard the system fully , sound regulation and effective oversight could have prevented the crisis , or at least reduced its impact on millions of people &apos;s livelihoods . 
The problem was that central banks , finance ministries , and multilateral organizations like the International Monetary Fund - the pillars of the global economy &apos;s institutional framework - failed to grasp globalization &apos;s emerging characteristics and effects , owing partly to the difficulty of discerning structural shifts in the huge mass of data now available . 
In this sense , the crisis should have served as a wake-up call , spurring the financial sector , policymakers , and multilateral organizations to take action to enhance systemic stability . 
But , despite employing tens of thousands of highly educated economists whose primary job is to determine how best to protect the financial system from globalization &apos;s destabilizing effects , these institutions seem to be even less willing to act now than they were before the crisis . 
This is particularly true in the advanced economies , where depleted financial reserves and political paralysis are preventing constructive investments in areas like infrastructure and education , which can enable citizens to take advantage of globalization &apos;s benefits . 
Making matters worse , some of these countries have reduced their contributions and commitment to the reform of regional and global institutions , which are essential to managing systemic risks . 
In this context , it is not surprising that ordinary citizens feel uncertain about the future and frustrated with their governments , which have so far failed to protect them from globalization &apos;s fallout . 
But wresting power back from regional and international institutions - however shadowy and distant they may seem - would only compound the problem , for it would reduce the ability to guide the supranational trends that are shaping the world &apos;s future . 
More , not less , cooperation is necessary to manage growing complexity and integration . 
It is time for our leaders to recognize new systemic risks and work together to mitigate them . 
Otherwise , the recent past will be prologue , with those risks likely to get the better of the global economy .
