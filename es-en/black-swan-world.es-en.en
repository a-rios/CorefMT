Black Swan World 
BERLIN - In today &apos;s global financial crisis , the image of a black swan has become a symbol for the seemingly impossible that somehow occurs , turning the world upside down . 
This year will afford us ample opportunity to examine the black swans that are already among us , and to prepare for the arrival of even more . 
November , for example , marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
The night of November 9 , 1989 , marked the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union and its empire , and thus also of the bipolar world that had , for five decades , divided Germany and Europe . 
A year before , few people considered this world-shaking event even a remote possibility . 
After the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the bipolar world order , victorious Western capitalism , under the leadership of the only world power , the United States , reigned supreme in global politics , and even more so in the global economy . 
Nothing and no one , it seemed , could stem the global triumph of the market , with its transcendence of all previous limits on wealth - that is , until September 15 , 2008 , the fateful date when Lehman Brothers went bust and the meltdown of the global financial system began . 
While a distraught world is still trying to fathom the consequences of this global crash and to mitigate its impact , the call of the next black swan can already be heard : the global climate disaster . 
It seems to be part of human nature willfully to deny the possibility of great crises , or at least to downplay them . 
&quot; Impossible &quot; or &quot; It won &apos;t be all that bad &quot; are the two magic formulae on which we tend to rely . 
And we refuse to learn the lesson of the black swan even when the next one is already visible for all to see ! 
Although the generations alive today have witnessed two completely unexpected crises of epic proportions within the last 20 years , we indulge in a shocking collective repression of a climate disaster with far more serious - and foreseeable - consequences . 
But , in fact , by linking the answers to the global climate and economic crises , we can find a way out of both . 
The solutions to the climate crisis are already well known , the money is available , and so are the technologies , or where they aren &apos;t , they could be developed . 
What is lacking is the strategic vision and determined action of the major political players . 
As for the economic crisis , bailouts and stimulus packages on the order of billions of dollars , euros , yen , or yuan have been planned or implemented to stem the further slide of the global economy . 
The real economic recovery - and this is the bad news - came only with WWII and the long Cold War that followed . 
Rather than relying on war as an economic mega-project to end today &apos;s recession , the international community should bet on the fight against the climate crisis , because globalization will continue , rapidly increasing the threats to the world &apos;s climate . 
In 1929 , there were slightly more than two billion people living on the planet ; today , there are 6.7 billion , and in 2050 there will be nine billion . 
All of them , thanks to globalization and new communication technologies , will strive for the same standard of living , give or take , which will necessarily lead to an overstretched global ecosystem . 
The question of whether to use coal or nuclear power is simply no longer apposite : without a breakthrough in renewable energies , global energy demand cannot be met , not to mention the dangers of a new Chernobyl . 
Where this will lead the world can be seen even today : China already has the world &apos;s most ambitious scheme for expanding nuclear energy , and every year it builds coal-fired power plants whose electricity output is roughly equivalent to the capacity of the entire British power grid ! 
So the black swan of the climate crisis is already preparing to land . 
To fight the climate crisis effectively demands nothing less than a green revolution of the global economy , the mega-project of the twenty-first century . 
Only the rich industrial nations of Europe , America , and Japan can afford to pay for the necessary investments in emerging countries . 
This year , a new global climate agreement will be negotiated in Copenhagen to replace the Kyoto Protocol . 
This is effectively the last chance to prevent the next black swan from landing . 
All of the relevant powers of the twenty-first century are represented in the G-20 , and they should see the success of Copenhagen as part of their direct responsibility . 
This time , unlike at the London G-20 meeting , they should do the job properly - both to protect our climate and to reboot the global economy .
