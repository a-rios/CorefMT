Vietnam &apos;s Chinese Lessons 
TOKYO - For 30 years after World War II &apos;s end , Vietnam claimed the global spotlight . 
Its victories over France and the United States were the defining wars of independence of the post-colonial era . 
No longer . 
Vietnam &apos;s strategic position - as a neighbor of China , situated parallel to the great sea trade routes of Asia - always made the country tremendously important , which may be one reason why its anti-colonial wars lasted so long . 
In recent years , however , Vietnam &apos;s strategic significance has increased dramatically , owing to huge - and not always widely recognized - transformations in its economic performance and foreign-policy orientation . 
Reinvigorated by two decades of rapid economic growth and a broad-based opening to the outside world , Vietnam is now an emerging player in regional economic and security affairs . 
Indeed , in recent months the country has played a pivotal role in helping to establish Asia &apos;s emerging security order . 
In late October , Hanoi hosted the East Asian Summit , a meeting at which the US and Russia were recognized as Asian powers with vital national interests in the region . 
Earlier in October , at the inaugural summit of ASEAN defense ministers in Hanoi , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates declared the US a &quot; resident power &quot; in Asia . 
And earlier this summer , while hosting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Vietnam encouraged her to intervene in the growing maritime disputes between China and Malaysia , the Philippines , Japan , and Vietnam itself . 
Vietnam &apos;s emergence as a central player in Asian affairs should not be surprising , for the country was the catalyst of perhaps the key turning point in modern Asian history . 
In February 1979 , China &apos;s leader , Deng Xiaoping , ordered the People &apos;s Liberation Army to invade Vietnam . 
Deng wanted to punish the Vietnamese for their own invasion of Cambodia , which ended the genocidal rule of China &apos;s allies , the Khmer Rouge . 
So vital was this decision to Deng that he assigned overall command of the invasion to his fellow Long March veteran , General Hsu Shih Yun ( who had given Deng shelter when , in 1976 , he was purged for the second time by the dying Mao Zedong ) . 
The British military analyst Major General Shelford Bidwell has dubbed this form of Chinese military strategy &quot; teach a lesson &quot; warfare . 
The first example of it was the brief Sino-Indian War of 1962 . 
That Chinese invasion was intended to teach India a lesson for its support of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan resistance . 
An existing border dispute was used as a pretext to launch a swift invasion ( one that caught Nehru &apos;s India by surprise ) , inflict a humiliating defeat , and then stage a seemingly magnanimous unilateral withdrawal designed to highlight India &apos;s impotence . 
Deng &apos;s invasion of Vietnam in 1979 was supposed to be another &quot; teach a lesson &quot; war . 
In a war that lasted barely a month , 250,000 Chinese front-line soldiers were thrashed by 100,000 Vietnamese border-militia troops . 
The Chinese lost more soldiers ( perhaps 20,000 ) in those four weeks than the US lost in any single year of the Vietnam War . 
The scale of China &apos;s defeat stunned Deng , and historians often credit the PLA &apos;s miserable performance with forcing him to take a hard look at China &apos;s moribund Maoist system . 
Within months of the war &apos;s end , indeed , Deng initiated the reforms that have since transformed his country . 
Ten years later , Vietnam &apos;s Communist rulers also concluded that Marxism-Leninism was an economic dead end , and decided to start down the same path of market reform that Deng had taken . 
As in China , it took time for the benefits to appear , but over the past few years Vietnam has seen the same rapid , poverty-reducing growth that China has experienced . 
An agricultural miracle has transformed a country of nearly 90 million people who were once barely able to feed themselves into a global food-exporting powerhouse . 
Vietnam has also become a major exporter of clothes , shoes , and furniture . 
These are soon to be joined by microchips , given the $ 1 billion factory that chipmaker Intel built outside Ho Chi Minh City . 
Vietnam &apos;s total trade turnover now equals 160 % of GDP , making it one of the world &apos;s most open economies . 
With Vietnam &apos;s emergence as a pivotal player in Asia , we are able to view the Vietnam War in the context of the US strategy of global containment , which led it to defend not only South Vietnam , but also South Korea and Taiwan - &quot; the three fronts , &quot; as Mao Zedong put it . 
Then and now , Vietnam was the locus of a struggle between the vision of a monolithic Asia and that of an Asia that is open internally and to the world . 
Today , that choice must be made anew . 
By acting to invigorate an Asian order that rejects hegemonic dominance , even to the extent of improving its military ties with the US , Vietnam has shown that it has learned its own lessons from the blood and treasure that it lost in its long wars of independence .
