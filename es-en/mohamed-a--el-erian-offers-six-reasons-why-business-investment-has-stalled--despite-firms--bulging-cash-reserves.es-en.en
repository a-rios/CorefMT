Wallets Wide Shut 
NEWPORT BEACH , CALIFORNIA - Some economists , like Larry Summers , call it &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
Others refer to it as &quot; Japanization . &quot; 
Those looking for ways to reduce the risks of inadequate growth agree that , of all possible solutions , increased business investment can make the biggest difference . 
Indeed , with profitability at or near record levels , cash holdings by the corporate sector in the United States have piled up quarter after quarter , reaching all-time highs - and earning very little at today &apos;s near-zero interest rates . 
Moreover , because companies have significantly improved their operating efficiency and lengthened the maturities on their debt , they need a lot less precautionary savings than they did in the past . 
However one looks at it , the corporate sector in advanced economies in general , and in the US in particular , is as strong as it has been in many years . 
Non-financial firms have achieved a mix of resilience and agility that contrasts sharply with prevailing conditions for some households and governments around the world that have yet to confront adequately a legacy of over-leverage . 
But , rather than deploy their abundant cash in new investments to expand capacity and tap new markets - which they have been very hesitant to do since the global financial crisis erupted - many companies have so far preferred ( or have been pressured by activist investors ) to give it back to shareholders . 
Last year alone , US companies authorized more than $ 600 billion of share buybacks - an impressive amount by any measure , and a record high . 
Moreover , many companies boosted their quarterly dividend payouts to shareholders . 
Such activity continued in the first two months of 2014 . 
But , while shareholders have clearly benefited from companies &quot; unwillingness to invest their ample cash , the bulk of the injected money has been circulating only in the financial sector . 
Little of it has directly benefited economies that are struggling to boost their growth rates , expand employment , avoid creating a lost generation of workers , and address excessive income inequality . 
If advanced economies are to prosper , it is necessary ( though not sufficient ) that the corporate sector &apos;s willingness to invest match its considerable wallet . 
Six factors appear to pose particularly important constraints . 
First , companies are concerned about future demand for their products . 
The recent economic recovery , as muted as it has been ( both in absolute terms and relative to most expectations ) , has been driven by the experimental policies that central banks have pursued to sustain consumption . 
Now , with the US Federal Reserve beginning to withdraw monetary stimulus , and with growth in emerging countries slowing , most companies are simply unable to point to massive expansion opportunities . 
Second , with China such an influential driver of global demand ( both directly and indirectly through important network effects ) , the outlook for the world &apos;s second-largest economy has a disproportionate impact on projections of global corporate revenues . 
Third , while companies recognize that innovation is a key comparative advantage in today &apos;s global economy , they are also humbled by its increasingly winner-take-all nature . 
Successful innovation today is a lot less about financing and much more about finding the &quot; killer app . &quot; 
As a result , many companies , less convinced that &quot; normal &quot; innovation yields big payoffs , end up investing less overall than they did before . 
Fourth , the longer-term cost-benefit analysis for would-be investors is clouded by legitimate questions about certain operating environments . 
In the US , many companies expect major budgetary reform ; but they are not yet able to assess the impact on their future operating profits . 
In Europe , politicians are aware of the need for major structural reforms , including those required to solidify regional integration ; but companies lack adequate clarity about the components of such reforms . 
Fifth , the scope for risk mitigation is not as large as financial advances would initially suggest . 
But the ability to manage downside risk comprehensively is still limited by incomplete longer-term markets and public-private partnerships that cannot be sufficiently leveraged . 
Finally , most corporate leaders recognize that they owe a large debt of gratitude to central bankers for the relative tranquility of recent years . 
Through bold policy experiments , central bankers succeeded in avoiding a global multi-year depression and buying time for companies to heal . 
But , working essentially alone , central banks have not been able to revamp properly the advanced economies &quot; growth engines ; nor do they have the tools to do so . 
Though many corporate leaders may still be unable to grasp the precise threats , they seem uneasy about the longer-term collateral damage implied by running modern market economies at artificially repressed interest rates and with bloated central-bank balance sheets . 
The good news is that each of these constraints on investment can - and should - be addressed ; and recent US business investment data suggest some progress . 
The bad news is that it will take a lot more time , effort , and global coordination . 
In the meantime , the corporate sector will only gradually take on more of the heavy lifting . 
That will be enough to keep the advanced economies growing this year ; unfortunately , it will not be enough to attain the faster growth that their citizens &quot; wellbeing - and that of the global economy - urgently requires .
