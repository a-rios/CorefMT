Stocks and the Long Run 
BERKELEY - After the second 40 % decline in America &apos;s Standard 
Poor &apos;s composite index of common stocks in a decade , global investors are shell-shocked . 
Funds invested , and reinvested , in the S P composite from 1998-2008 have yielded a real return of zero : the dividends earned on the portfolio have been just enough to offset inflation . 
Not since 1982 has a decade passed at the end of which investors would have been better off had they placed their money in corporate or United States Treasury bonds rather than in a diversified portfolio of stocks . 
So investors are wondering : will future decades be like the past decade ? 
If so , shouldn &apos;t investments in equities be shunned ? 
The answer is almost surely no . 
At a time horizon of a decade or two , the past performance of stocks and bonds is neither a reliable guarantee nor a good guide to future results . 
Periods like 1998-2008 , in which stocks do relatively badly , are preceded by periods - like 1978-1988 and 1988-1998 - in which they do relatively well , and are in all likelihood followed by similar periods . 
Do the math . 
At the moment , the yield-to-maturity of the ten-year US Treasury bond is 3.76 % . 
Subtract 2.5 % for inflation , and you get a benchmark expected real return of 1.26 % . 
Meanwhile , the earnings yield on the stocks that make up the S P composite is fluctuating around 6 % : that is how much money the corporations that underpin the stocks are making for their shareholders . 
Some of that money will be paid out in dividends . 
Some will be reinvested and used to boost the company &apos;s capital stock . 
You can argue that the corporate executives have expertise and knowledge that allows them to commit the funds they control to higher-return projects than are available in the stock market . 
Or you can argue that they are corrupt empire-builders who dissipate a portion of the shareholders &quot; money that they control . 
The sensible guess is that these two factors cancel each other out . 
Thus , the expected fundamental real return on diversified US stock portfolios right now is in the range of 6 % to 7 % . 
The expected market return is that amount plus or minus expected changes in valuation ratios : will stocks return more as price-earnings ratios rise , or return less as price-earnings ratios fall ? 
Once again , the sensible guess is that these two factors more or less cancel each other out . 
Compare the 6 % to 7 % real return on stocks to a 1.25 % real return on bonds . 
But aren &apos;t stocks risky ? 
Couldn &apos;t earnings collapse ? 
Couldn &apos;t the market undergo another 40 % decline in the near future ? 
Aren &apos;t bonds safer ? 
The answers to these questions are yes , yes , yes , and yes . 
Remember : we already had another 40 % decline in 2000-2003 , and are in another one right now . 
We also had the long slide from 1977-1982 that followed a 40 % collapse from 1973-1975 . 
Before that , we had declines in 1946-1949 , 1937-1942 , and the biggest of them all in 1929-1933 . 
But stock market declines that are not accompanied by steep and persistent collapses in earnings are by their nature temporary : they are provoked by steep rises in perceived risk , and if those risks turn out to be overblown , stocks rebound when the perception of risk falls . 
And how about stock market declines that are accompanied by a steep and persistent collapse in earnings - by depressions ? 
In the pre-World War II era , when governments held fast to the gold standard , depressions were times of deflation . 
But in the post-World War II era , in which social democratic governments maintain welfare spending and Keynesian economic advisers seek to use fiscal policy to boost output , an earnings depression is much more likely to be accompanied by inflation . 
True , a steep and persistent collapse in earnings will erode wealth invested in stocks . 
But the inflation that accompanies it will produce a steeper and larger erosion of real wealth invested in nominal bonds . 
As Edgar L. Smith wrote in The Atlantic Monthly back in 1924 , when the principal risks are macroeconomic , bonds are no safer than diversified portfolios of stocks - in fact , they are riskier . 
All these arguments apply only to long-term investors who can afford to wait out another 40 % decline in values and keep their money invested until perceived risk drops . 
( And if perceived risk never drops than you have worse things to worry about than the performance of your portfolio . ) 
For retirees and other people who need to spend soon , the year-to-year variability of the stock market commands caution . 
But for those who do not need to spend soon , the recent decline in equity values is more an opportunity than a catastrophe . 
We liked the stocks in our portfolio a year ago for their long-term prospects . 
Today &apos;s short-term crisis does not materially alter their long-term prospects . 
And now we have an opportunity to buy more , and cheaply .
