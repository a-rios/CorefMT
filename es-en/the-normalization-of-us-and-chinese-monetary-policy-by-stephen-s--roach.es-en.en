Breaking Bad Habits 
NEW HAVEN - It was never going to be easy , but central banks in the world &apos;s two largest economies - the United States and China - finally appear to be embarking on a path to policy normalization . 
Addicted to an open-ended strain of Ã¼ber monetary accommodation that was established in the depths of the Great Crisis of 2008-2009 , financial markets are now gasping for breath . 
Ironically , because the traction of unconventional policies has always been limited , the fallout on real economies is likely to be muted . 
The Federal Reserve and the People &apos;s Bank of China are on the same path , but for very different reasons . 
For Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues , there seems to be a growing sense that the economic emergency has passed , implying that extraordinary action - namely , a zero-interest-rate policy and a near-quadrupling of its balance sheet - is no longer appropriate . 
Conversely , the PBOC is engaged in a more pre-emptive strike - attempting to ensure stability by reducing the excess leverage that has long underpinned the real side of an increasingly credit-dependent Chinese economy . 
Both actions are correct and long overdue . 
While the Fed &apos;s first round of quantitative easing helped to end the financial-market turmoil that occurred in the depths of the recent crisis , two subsequent rounds - including the current , open-ended QE3 - have done little to alleviate the lingering pressure on over-extended American consumers . 
Indeed , household-sector debt is still in excess of 110 % of disposable personal income and the personal saving rate remains below 3 % , averages that compare unfavorably with the 75 % and 7.9 % norms that prevailed , respectively , in the final three decades of the twentieth century . 
With American consumers responding by hunkering down as never before , inflation-adjusted consumer demand has remained stuck on an anemic 0.9 % annualized growth trajectory since early 2008 , keeping the US economy mired in a decidedly subpar recovery . 
Unable to facilitate balance-sheet repair or stimulate real economic activity , QE has , instead , become a dangerous source of instability in global financial markets . 
With the drip-feed of QE-induced liquidity now at risk , the recent spasms in financial markets leave little doubt about the growing dangers of speculative excesses that had been building . 
Fortunately , the Fed is finally facing up to the downside of its grandiose experiment . 
Recent developments in China tell a different story - but one with equally powerful implications . 
There , credit tightening does not follow from determined action by an independent central bank ; rather , it reflects an important shift in the basic thrust of the state &apos;s economic policies . 
China &apos;s new leadership , headed by President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang , seems determined to end its predecessors &quot; fixation on maintaining a rapid pace of economic growth and to refocus policy on the quality of growth . 
This shift not only elevates the importance of the pro-consumption agenda of China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan ; it also calls into question the longstanding proactive tactics of the country &apos;s fiscal and monetary authorities . 
The policy response - or , more accurately , the policy non-response - to the current slowdown is an important validation of this new approach . 
The absence of a new round of fiscal stimulus indicates that the Chinese government is satisfied with a 7.5-8 % GDP growth rate - a far cry from the earlier addiction to growth rates around 10 % . 
But slower growth in China can continue to sustain development only if the economy &apos;s structure shifts from external toward internal demand , from manufacturing toward services , and from resource-intensive to resource-light growth . 
China &apos;s new leadership has not just lowered its growth target ; it has upped the ante on the economy &apos;s rebalancing imperatives . 
Consistent with this new mindset , the PBOC &apos;s unwillingness to put a quick end to the June liquidity crunch in short-term markets for bank financing sends a strong signal that the days of open-ended credit expansion are over . 
That is a welcome development . 
China &apos;s private-sector debt rose from around 140 % of GDP in 2009 to more than 200 % in early 2013 , according to estimates from Bernstein Research - a surge that may well have exacerbated the imbalances of an already unbalanced Chinese economy . 
There is good reason to believe that China &apos;s new leaders are now determined to wean the economy off ever-mounting ( and destabilizing ) debt - especially in its rapidly expanding &quot; shadow banking &quot; system . 
This stance appears to be closely aligned with Xi &apos;s rather cryptic recent comments about a &quot; mass line &quot; education campaign aimed at addressing problems arising from the &quot; four winds &quot; of formalism , bureaucracy , hedonism , and extravagance . 
Financial markets are having a hard time coming to grips with the new policy mindset in the world &apos;s two largest economies . 
At the same time , investors have raised serious and legitimate questions about Japan &apos;s economic-policy regime under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , which unfortunately relies far more on financial engineering - quantitative easing and yen depreciation - than on a new structural-reform agenda . 
Such doubts are understandable . 
After all , if four years of unconventional monetary easing by the Fed could not end America &apos;s balance-sheet recession , why should anyone believe that the Bank of Japan &apos;s aggressive asset purchases will quickly end that country &apos;s two lost decades of stagnation and deflation ? 
As financial markets come to terms with the normalization of monetary policy in the US and China , while facing up to the shortcomings of the BOJ &apos;s copycat efforts , the real side of the global economy is less at risk than are asset prices . 
In large part , that is because unconventional monetary policies were never the miracle drug that they were supposed to be . 
They added froth to financial markets but did next to nothing to foster vigorous recovery and redress deep-rooted problems in the real economy . 
Breaking bad habits is hardly a painless experience for liquidity-addicted investors . 
But better now than later , when excesses in asset and credit markets would spawn new and dangerous distortions on the real side of the global economy . 
That is exactly what pushed the world to the brink in 2008-2009 , and there is no reason why it could not happen again .
