Tweets of Freedom 
NEW YORK - Google has been widely celebrated for its loud refusal to continue censoring its search results in China . 
It is still unclear whether Google will continue to operate in China , but in any event we are not about to see much change in China &apos;s Internet policy . 
More likely , all this &quot; foreign meddling &quot; will merely cause the Chinese government to dig in its heels . 
Even if Google does ultimately leave China , the game is not over . 
Western companies can promote Internet freedom from the outside , by providing useful technology as well as the keys to access it . 
Call this &quot; Twitter diplomacy . &quot; 
Twitter is largely blocked by China &apos;s &quot; great firewall &quot; ( GFW ) , which prevents Chinese people from accessing certain sites . 
Yet Twitter has an almost religious following among tech-savvy Chinese , whose determination to use the service outstrips authorities &quot; efforts to block access to it . 
These &quot; netizens &quot; surmount the firewall by way of proxy servers or virtual private networks ( VPNs ) that allow them to browse the Web as if they were outside of China . 
Earlier this month , Chinese twitterati helped get the GFW onto the list of Twitter &apos;s top ten &quot; trending topics &quot; ( or most tweeted terms ) - an impressive feat given that Twitter is supposed to be inaccessible in China . 
Twitter , which lets people send bite-size messages to large groups , allows Chinese to quickly disseminate urgent news or even uncomfortable facts . 
&quot; Twitter can create a faster information flow than any official agency , &quot; says Michael Anti , a journalist in Beijing who has long been at the forefront of the Chinese Internet movement . 
&quot; That means people would get information faster than the government . 
That &apos;s a real crisis for Communists . &quot; 
Twitter also helps protect individual citizens . 
Blogger Peter Guo claims that Twitter got him out of jail . 
He says that he was arrested after spreading word about a crime that allegedly involved local officials . 
He tweeted an SOS via his mobile phone after he was arrested last July , and his case quickly attracted both domestic and international attention , which helped secure his release a little over two weeks later . 
So just imagine if Twitter were available to the larger Chinese population . 
The problem is that many Chinese still lack the simple tools that would enable them to get past the GFW . 
When I asked Guo how the outside world could make Twitter more accessible in China , he replied that we could help by &quot; providing affordable VPN service . &quot; 
Foreign companies , he added , could make available more secure browsers that would help &quot; Chinese people to circumvent the GFW . &quot; 
Government can also play a role in empowering Chinese netizens . 
Jonathan Zittrain , Co-Director of Harvard University &apos;s Berkman Center for Internet and Society , has suggested that the United States , for example , could start with some basic funding for the kind of &quot; science and technology innovation that gave us the Internet to begin with . &quot; 
This could include potential &quot; game changers &quot; in China such as ad hoc mesh networking , which allows users to communicate with one another by hopping from one device to the next without an Internet service provider in the middle . 
But , given the political sensitivities of foreign pressure on China , it is unclear how far Western governments will be able to go . 
That is where companies like Twitter come in . 
Even if Twitter &apos;s co-founders did not necessarily develop it to be a tool of democratization , that is precisely what it has become . 
In April 2009 , young people in Moldova used Twitter to organize protests against their government . 
Two months later , Twitter famously helped Iranians assemble and share information during their election protests . 
Now , we are beginning to see a similar phenomenon in China . 
In November , citizen protests against the construction of an incinerator in Guangzhou became a widely Tweeted event . 
Referring to the role that Twitter played in protests in Iran and Moldova , Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey told me , &quot; These are all events and movements that people chose to make happen , and Twitter was a tool that happened to be there to make it more easy . &quot; 
Twitter may now be taking more aggressive steps to promote Internet freedom abroad . 
Co-founder and CEO Evan Williams recently suggested that software developers were working on technology to evade government barriers , though he did not give specific details . 
Google &apos;s adamant stance on Chinese censorship may have been well intentioned . 
The problem is that the standoff has now taken on the tone of a state-to-state confrontation . 
China , apparently still reeling from a &quot; century of humiliation &quot; at the hands of outsiders , will not be pushed around by America . 
This view is not limited to the Chinese government . 
Right now , many netizens are applauding Google &apos;s move . 
But if they begin to perceive Google as a pawn of the US government , this sentiment could turn on a dime . 
Ultimately the Chinese Internet cat-and-mouse game will be won with innovation , not political pressure . 
The world should continue to flood the Chinese market , and those of other countries that restrict freedom of expression , with cutting-edge technology . 
Of course , censors will often be just one step behind , filtering information and shutting down sites . 
But Chinese netizens are remarkably adept at using the limited tools available to them . 
In doing so , they are transforming their country in a slow but irreversible way .
