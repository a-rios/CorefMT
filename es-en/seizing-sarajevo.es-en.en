Seizing Sarajevo 
LONDON - Officially , the European Union has one Balkan policy : admit the region &apos;s six countries . 
At the EU-Western Balkans summit in Thessaloniki in June 2003 , all of the EU &apos;s member states reiterated their &quot; unequivocal support to the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries . &quot; 
Partly as a result of that agreement , the Balkan countries have taken major steps forward . 
In Serbia , from where so much of the region &apos;s destruction was planned , Boris Tadic &apos;s government is seeking tighter links with the EU . 
Alongside Bosnia-Herzegovina , Serbia moved closer to NATO in 2006 . 
In 2009 , both Croatia and Albania joined the Alliance . 
Even the tiny country of Montenegro has had a hopeful few years since it declared independence in 2006 . 
After the EU established explicit criteria for visa liberalization and made clear that it was willing to admit some Balkan countries and not others , three states ( Serbia , Macedonia , and Montenegro ) kick-started reforms and achieved visa-free travel to the EU in 2009 , with another two expected to follow shortly . 
The European Commission has declared that Macedonia is ready to start accession talks , while Montenegro , Albania , and Serbia have submitted membership applications . 
But , as European leaders prepare to meet their Balkan counterparts in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo , things have begun to look a lot less certain . 
Europeans seem increasingly divided about what to do with the Balkans . 
Some policymakers in Brussels and EU capitals increasingly view the prospect of EU enlargement into the Balkans with alarm . 
Apart from Croatia - which is likely to join first - the Balkans countries are the poorest ever to have applied for EU membership . 
All have uncompetitive economies burdened with high unemployment . 
Although they have made progress on governance , many of them remain weak states . 
Most have also experienced bitter conflict and political division . 
At a time when the EU is still struggling to make use of the Lisbon institutions , some member states perceive a risk that admitting the Balkan countries too soon could damage the Union . 
Other policymakers , however , see an even greater risk that postponing EU accession into the indefinite future could undermine the credibility of the declaration made at Thessaloniki . 
This , they believe , could undermine the fragile progress that has been made in the Balkans in the last decade . 
At a time when even a long-standing EU member state like Greece is facing deadly street riots , some European governments worry that withdrawing hope from a region with a recent history of violent conflict could be dangerous . 
Divided between the fear of a hasty enlargement and the fear of a slow one , European governments have begun losing influence across the Balkans , as the region &apos;s leaders have started to doubt the sincerity of the EU &apos;s commitment - and the need to pursue EU-mandated reforms . 
The challenge for the EU is how to get back to the point where it is once again creating incentives for progress , rather than sowing disillusionment and the possibility of regression . 
European leaders should use the Sarajevo summit to announce an intention to boost the EU &apos;s engagement in the region by beginning the so-called &quot; screening &quot; process for Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Serbia , and Montenegro within the next year , and to undertake a similar process for Kosovo . 
The screening process forces applicant countries to take a long , hard look at how close they really are to meeting the accession requirements , thereby introducing a much-needed dose of realism into their debates about what needs to be done in the years ahead . 
It also gives both the candidate countries and the European Commission a detailed map of what must be accomplished in each area , from food safety to rural development . 
It helps in devising strategies for how to use EU financial assistance and technical advice to best effect . 
Furthermore , in order to promote the kind of regional competition that has worked so well to motivate regional reforms in the past , the six countries should begin the process of screening together . 
The competition - and prospect of belonging to a group of frontrunners - would be an added incentive for Balkan leaders to engage with the EU accession process . 
None of them will want the European Commission to note that one country is doing better than another . 
These are difficult times for the Balkans . 
Doubts about the future of the European project in the wake of the euro crisis could push voters away from pro-European reformers and towards nationalist politicians . 
The best way forward is to use tools that the EU already has at its disposal , but to use them more fully and effectively . 
The recent experience with visa liberalization shows that the EU has the power to motivate serious reforms in weak states if it mobilizes the right incentives . 
To do so requires clear and objective criteria , close technical engagement by European Commission experts , a specific timetable of opportunities , and transparent assessments that trigger positive competition between neighboring countries . 
By the summer of 2011 , screening should start for all countries of the region . 
The aim should be that by the close of Poland &apos;s EU presidency at the end of that year , all the countries will have completed screening and achieved candidate status . 
This is not about making concessions ; it is about putting in place a rigorous but fair process that encourages Balkan countries to identify their shortcomings and devise plans to overcome them .
