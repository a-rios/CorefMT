Europe &apos;s Stifled Celebration 
LONDON - This could have been a year of joy for Europe . 
The 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall will be commemorated in November , and it has been five years since the European Union &apos;s &quot; Big Bang &quot; enlargement . 
The Cold War division of Europe is well and truly over . 
But , instead of setting off fireworks , the EU finds itself under fire , as the global economic crisis confronts it with the greatest challenge it has seen since 1989 . 
After years of strong growth and remarkable resilience , the Union &apos;s new member states in the east are being hit hard by the economic turmoil that started in the west . 
Integration into the global economy , a crucial source of capital , stability , and innovation , has become a threat to many of these countries . 
This is true both of the region &apos;s financial sectors and its real economies . 
But the tough question that has to be asked is whether the crisis could lead to the unraveling of European integration . 
There are four key issues that need to be tackled if we are to ensure that Europe emerges from this crisis strengthened . 
The first issue concerns the continuation of enlargement . 
The EU is an indisputable success , constituting the largest integrated economic area in the world and accounting for more than 30 % of world GDP and around 17 % of world trade . 
Even with this year &apos;s marked contraction of some central and eastern European countries &quot; economies , their accession to the EU boosted its overall economic growth , with the European Commission estimating that GDP in the new member states increased by extra 1.75 percentage points in the period 2004-2009 . 
For the pre-Big Bang EU-15 , enlargement significantly contributed to their growth through investment opportunities and increased foreign demand : 7.5 % of the older member states &quot; exports went to the newcomers in 2007 , up from 4.7 % in 1999 . 
Indeed , by 2007 , central and eastern Europe had become the second most important export destination for euro-zone countries . 
But EU membership has always been about more than economic integration and trade flows . 
The prospect of a &quot; return to Europe , &quot; as Václav Havel once put it , provided the backing for essential , if sometimes painful , economic , social , and political reforms . 
Today , EU membership is a more powerful incentive than ever for what the EU calls three &quot; candidate countries &quot; ( Croatia , FYR Macedonia , and Turkey ) and five &quot; potential candidate countries &quot; ( Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 , Montenegro , and Serbia ) . 
These countries are increasing their efforts to prepare for EU admission , and the EU must not shut its doors on them . 
On the contrary , it should finalize further enlargement : the economic crisis has clearly demonstrated that the EU cannot afford black holes on the map of Europe . 
The second key issue concerns the EU &apos;s internal structure . 
The Lisbon Treaty offers a fundamental redesign of how the Union works , but , despite the pressing need to enhance EU institutions &quot; mobility and flexibility , it is still awaiting ratification . 
The economic crisis makes it more important than ever to introduce these reforms . 
Third , there is the euro . 
The 12 new member states that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 committed themselves to its adoption , but with no set date . 
Expansion of the euro zone has therefore been slow , especially in central and eastern Europe , where to date only Slovenia ( 2007 ) and Slovakia ( 2009 ) have become members of the single currency . 
But the financial and economic crisis has demonstrated the benefits of euro membership . 
Ten years after the common currency &apos;s introduction , the 16-member euro zone has the world &apos;s second most important currency , accounting for more than a quarter of all central banks &quot; foreign-exchange reserves and having overtaken the dollar as the currency of choice for international bond issues . 
The euro &apos;s increasingly important role brings stability , something that is never more important than in times of upheaval . 
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development therefore encourages all new EU member states that have not yet started doing so to draft credible and convincing plans for euro-zone admission . 
But there must be no softening of the criteria for joining the euro . 
The final issue concerns European solidarity . 
EU enlargement brought greater prosperity , with living standards improving throughout the Union , particularly in the new member states . 
But many of the older member states also benefitted , and not only in economically measureable ways . 
The growing together of people , regions , and countries underpins the foundations on which Europe rests . 
The EU &apos;s newcomers have adopted growth models that rely to varying degrees on foreign capital to finance domestic investment , and on banking systems that are largely owned by west European banks . 
It is a model that has served new and old member states well . 
Investors from the EU-15 committed € 37.2 billion in central and eastern Europe in 2006 , roughly double the € 19.1 billion spent there in 2004 . 
Over the past five years , foreign direct investment in the new member states topped the € 100 billion mark . 
This process enabled western European companies and banks to expand into new markets with higher growth rates and , thereby satisfying pent-up demand and tapping unrealized potential . 
This has created jobs in central and eastern Europe , while boosting prosperity in the older member states . 
To turn our backs on these countries would have serious economic ramifications . 
The EU drew the right conclusions when it stressed that national bank rescue packages must not be designed in ways that starve subsidiaries , and also by doubling - to € 50 billion - the crisis funds available to EU countries outside the euro zone . 
The EU must not stand aside when solidarity is needed . 
Today &apos;s crisis offers an opportunity to show that the EU can provide stability , support , and solidarity . 
By taking the right steps now , the Union is laying the foundations that will enable it to emerge from today &apos;s difficulties strengthened and more united .
