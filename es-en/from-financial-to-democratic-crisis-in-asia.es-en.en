From Financial to Democratic Crisis in Asia 
JAKARTA : Political crisis has replaced financial crisis in Southeast Asia . 
President Estrada of the Philippines , who never mastered his office , was removed in a bloodless coup aided by mob rule . 
Now Indonesia &apos;s President Wahid faces possible impeachment ; so , too , may Taiwan &apos;s president . 
Thailand &apos;s new prime minister assumed office surrounded by scandal , Malaysia &apos;s politics seem more unsettled than at any time in twenty years . 
Southeast Asia &apos;s boom years are gone , but this is not to say that they have vanished forever , for the causes of this instability are not hidden . 
Today &apos;s political turbulence , indeed , has the same roots as yesterday &apos;s financial storms : inadequate , unsound , and unformed institutions . 
Unless these institutional gaps are addressed , Asian societies will not get back on track . 
Of course , finance and democracy are not twins . 
Yet parallels exist : without the checks and balances of sound domestic institutions , the global winds of political liberalization unsettle former authoritarian regimes , much as economic globalization wrecked havoc on weak financial institutions . 
Indeed , important lessons can be drawn from Asia &apos;s economic crisis of 1997-98 for today &apos;s political tumult . 
The irony of Asia &apos;s economic crisis was that it struck the &quot; miracle &quot; economies that maintained sound macroeconomic policies and carried out far-reaching financial liberalization . 
What went wrong ? 
Some analysts proclaim that liberalization was &quot; inappropriate &quot; or &quot; disorderly . &quot; 
Something similar to this complaint is now made by critics who say that countries like Indonesia and the Philippines are too sprawling and undisciplined to adopt democracy . 
The trouble in the 1990s arose out of an unexpected confluence of vulnerable domestic financial systems and volatile international capital movements brought about by the globalization of financial markets . 
Rapid globalization , however , came about only in part through technological advances . 
Another crucial factor was the notion - proved too simplistic in the event - that free capital movements can just replace capital controls . 
For a country to benefit from free international capital movements , however , it must have , inter alia , sound and strong financial institutions to prevent panic movements of capital and withstand systemic shocks if such movements occur . 
The simplistic equation of financial liberalization with financial deregulation was at the root of Asia &apos;s crisis . 
Thailand , for instance , established the Bangkok International Banking Facilities in the hope of becoming a regional financial center , despite the fact that local financial institutions were ill-prepared to handle massive flows of capital . 
Nor are institutions the same as laws on paper . 
In comparison with Thailand , Indonesia had an adequate provision of prudential rules and regulations . 
The case of Korea is equally instructive . 
By 1997 , Korea had &quot; liberalized &quot; its financial markets by eliminating government credit allocation and management of commercial banks . 
But financial sector reform made it possible for the chaebols , the large conglomerates that dominate Korea &apos;s economy , to increase their control over non-bank financial institutions . 
Reform thus strengthened the chaebols &quot; internal capital market and weakened the banks &quot; role as monitors of corporate behavior . Similarly , in the Philippines , financial liberalization , by and large , benefited large family-owned corporations , increasing their monopoly power by easing access to bank credit . 
Southeast Asian policymakers are not the only people responsible for paying insufficient attention to establishing institutions necessary for a free-market financial system and the neglect of the danger of regulatory capture . 
The West and international institutions also played a pervasive role by promoting the so-called Washington Consensus that defined economic orthodoxy in the decade preceding Asia &apos;s crisis , which has continued ever since . 
&quot; The pictorial symbol &quot; of the Washington Consensus , quipped C. Fred Bergsten , &quot; was the colonial posture assumed by the Managing Director of the IMF as the President of Indonesia .... signed his diktat . &quot; 
Much as the Washington Consensus focused on financial liberalization , deregulation , free capital movements , privatization , and stable macroeconomic policy as the keys to development , today &apos;s political consensus is on free elections and the political empowerment of the hitherto oppressed , without sufficient attention being paid to the institutional underpinnings of democracy , such as a functioning judicial system , an infrastructure of political parties , and other constitutional arrangements . 
The effects may be equally sobering . 
The economic Washington consensus took for granted the presence of institutions necessary for functioning free-markets or assumed that once government intervention was removed such institutions would emerge . 
What actually followed , as countries embarked on financial liberalization , was an institutional vacuum that , when combined with volatile international capital movements , incited crisis . 
Today , liberalization of the political system , without strengthening its ability to absorb the shocks of political struggle , seems to incite instability , too . 
The lessons of Asia &apos;s financial crisis and its current political crisis seem clear : in economics , removing government intervention without establishing needed institutional preconditions may deliver crisis , not growth ; in politics , credible institutions to check and balance each other are as vital to democratic stability as the ballot box . 
Here a hopeful sign in today &apos;s political travails is found in the potent role played by Southeast Asia &apos;s once tame press in reporting corruption scandals . 
For independent media is a vital institutional check far too often absent across the Pacific . 
Other powerful institutions , however , must take root for democracy to function properly .
