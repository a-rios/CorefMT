Whose Sovereignty ? 
MADRID - Despite the huge sums expended to write down Greece &apos;s foreign debt , there has been an outcry ofcensure against &quot; interference &quot; with the country &apos;s national sovereignty . 
True , in exchange for considerable European aid , Greece &apos;s ability to maneuver independently will be limited . 
But are complaints that Greek sovereignty has been severely impaired justified ? 
The idea of a nation-state &apos;s sovereignty is rooted in the seventeenth-century Treaty of Westphalia , which embraced non-interference by external agents in states &quot; domestic affairs as the guiding principle of international relations . 
But , taken to its logical extreme , national sovereignty would require the complete physical and social isolation of states from one another . 
Indeed , an excessive emphasis on national sovereignty leads to serious problems : after all , any international agreement , whether political or economic , entails a certain transfer of sovereignty . 
Europe &apos;s aid to Greece is an example of a cooperative agreement whereby the various parties negotiate with the others &quot; interests in mind . 
Greece asked its fellow European Union members for help , and they have obliged with an enormous amount of aid . 
In addition to € 130 billion in loans ( more than 40 % of Greek GDP , on top of the € 110 billion loaned to Greece in 2010 ) , a 50 % &quot; haircut &quot; has been imposed on Greece &apos;s private creditors , and the European Central Bank has waived expected returns on its holdings of Greek bonds . 
Regardless of whether this is technically and economically the best solution to Greece &apos;s problem , it is logical that the EU participated in designing it . 
Participating in the collective life of the international community of states implies bearing others in mind and , when necessary , giving up certain prerogatives of sovereignty . 
For example , when Spain decided to join the World Trade Organization , it ceded sovereignty by accepting the WTO &apos;s rules and regulations . 
It had to abandon commercially preferential treatment to some countries and treat all WTO members alike . 
Spain accepted this in exchange for being able to trade on equal terms with the rest of the world . 
British sociologist Anthony Giddens rightly describes such examples as cases of integration or union in exchange for global influence . 
States cooperate because it is advantageous for them to do so , but at the same time they lose control over certain internal matters . 
They shift from unilateral to cooperative decision-making . 
Whether this is a violation of sovereignty depends on our conception of sovereignty . 
As with the concept of individual freedom , national sovereignty depends on how its components are defined . 
In his classic On Liberty , John Stuart Mill used the &quot; harm principle &quot; to express the view that a person &apos;s individual liberty could be limited only in order to protect others and avoid harm . 
The debate consists in how we define &quot; harm &quot; to others . 
In the same way , the debate about the meaning of national sovereignty consists in what we consider &quot; domestic &quot; matters . Depending on where we place the emphasis and how wide our focus is , we prioritize either a &quot; global &quot; ( or at least &quot; federal &quot; ) dimension to sovereignty , or a &quot; national &quot; dimension . 
The EU seems to represent a halfway point between these two conceptions of sovereignty . 
But it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine the difference between purely domestic matters and those that require international collective action . 
Globalization has made frontiers more porous . 
We see how one country &apos;s policies , whether pertaining to work , the environment , public health , taxation , or myriad other issues , can have a direct impact on others . 
And we see such interdependence even more clearly in their economic performance : China &apos;s annual GDP growth rate , for example , will slow by two percentage points this year , owing to sluggishness in the United States and the EU . 
Likewise , more countries ( and more varied in their character and historical trajectory ) are emerging strongly on the global scene : Brazil &apos;s GDP recently surpassed that of the United Kingdom . 
Their emergence holds important implications for global governance at a time when the imbalance between existing problems / threats and the means available to states to guarantee their citizens &quot; safety increases . 
On a global scale , this complex and interdependent world needs an organization of states and structures of governance oriented towards responsible dialogue , the aim being to mitigate abuses of power and defend global public assets . 
Without such structures , the world risks a competitive and disorderly race to the bottom among states - as often occurs with taxation - together with a protectionist backlash . 
History has shown that such developments often lead to disastrous conflicts . 
On the European level , legitimacy is essential and - let &apos;s be realistic - won &apos;t be achieved unless and until Europeans overcome certain antiquated ideas about sovereignty . 
Paradoxically , when the crisis struck , the EU was criticized for its lack of integration . 
Now that it seeks to advance in that direction , the Union is accused of crimping national sovereignty . 
Citizens must have the feeling that the institutions that govern them account for their interests and make them part of the decision-making process , which implies a union based on rules rather than power . 
The fact that the EU does not instantly have all of the answers to a problem does not mean that it has no future . 
The EU is a new and marvellous experiment , which , as with all experiments , entails a degree of uncertainty . 
But that should not make us ignore the opportunity cost of a more &quot; national &quot; conception of sovereignty . 
Indeed , the dynamics of interdependence have become well established - so much so that they cannot be reversed . 
To adhere to a narrow Westphalian concept of sovereignty in this world is an unwise anachronism at best , and a dangerous gamble at worst . 
The poet Jose Angel Valente might call this a desire ... &quot; to wait for History to wind the clocks and return us to the time in which we would wish everything could start . &quot; 
But , in the prosaic world of the here and now , the concept of sovereignty has already moved on .
