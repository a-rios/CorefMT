Weak America = Weakened Europe 
America &apos;s power has been so overwhelming for so long that many think it has survived George W. Bush &apos;s presidency unscathed . 
That this is untrue is demonstrated by those , from Russia &apos;s Vladimir Putin and Venezuela &apos;s Hugo Ch√°vez to Iran &apos;s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mugabe , who are exploiting America &apos;s loss of standing and influence . 
This is no cause for schadenfreude . 
On the contrary , it is high time for friends of the United States , particularly in Europe , to realize that America &apos;s weakness undermines their international influence as well . 
The evidence of America &apos;s weakness is clear enough . 
At the height of America &apos;s power , Russia had resigned itself to the apparently unstoppable encroachment of NATO on the Soviet Union &apos;s former sphere of influence . 
President Putin tolerated a US presence in Central Asia to assist in the campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan and raised no serious objections when the US trashed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prohibiting strategic missile defenses . 
America , eager to bring both Ukraine and Georgia into NATO , felt scant need to consider Russian concerns , convinced that the Kremlin would have no choice but to bow to the inevitable . 
That was yesterday . 
Today , Putin seeks to regain the influence Russia lost in previous years . 
He is skillfully playing the anti-America card across Europe while putting pressure on the Baltic states , a clear warning not to extend Nato any further . 
In Ukraine , political forces resisting closer strategic links to the West have gained ground . 
And the Kremlin is aggressively portraying the planned establishment of a modest US missile defense installation in Poland and the Czech Republic as a threat to Russia &apos;s vital security interests . 
Or consider Iran , another power exploiting American weakness . 
Only a few years ago , Iran &apos;s government seemed sufficiently in awe of the US to inch toward an agreement on its nuclear program that would have interrupted , and perhaps even halted , its enrichment activities . 
There was talk of possible bilateral contacts with the US , which , if successful , would have ended almost three decades of hostile relations . 
Today , Iran &apos;s enrichment program is going ahead despite the United Nations Security Council &apos;s warnings of new sanctions , while Iranian officials publicly ridicule threats of US military action . 
These examples reflect the same message : America is losing clout around the world . 
The Bush administration is internationally exposed in both the arrogance of its concepts and the limits of its power . 
It lacks support at home and respect abroad . 
Never since the US became the world &apos;s predominant power during World War II has there been a similar decline in its international influence . 
Even during the Vietnam War and following its humiliating withdrawal from Southeast Asia , there was never any serious doubt about America &apos;s authority and ability to deal with what was then the central strategic challenge , the Cold War . 
In today &apos;s interdependent world , however , it is no longer the number of nuclear warheads that bestows influence , but a country &apos;s ability to get others to go along with policies that it regards as serving its major interests . 
Bush &apos;s America has forfeited that influence- in the Middle East , in Asia and Africa , and in much of Europe . 
Many in the US like to think that this is a temporary state of affairs that will vanish with the election of a new president and Congress in 2008 . 
But they are neither sufficiently aware of the damage done nor realistic enough about the chances of Bush &apos;s potential successors - many of whom initially supported his adventurism - to revive the trust and respect their country once enjoyed . 
To achieve that will take more than a new face in the White House . 
It will require years of hard work to reconcile America &apos;s resources and requirements , and to ensure that its initiatives can once again be seen as designed not to serve narrow US ideologies , but to advance a fair international order . 
The result of protracted US weakness is also a weaker Europe . 
In the heyday of American dominance , European governments profited doubly : they were part of a powerful West and courted as a potential counterweight to US dominance by third countries . 
If they dissented from US positions , this did not seriously impair the West &apos;s strategic efficacy because American power was more than sufficient to compensate . 
That arrangement no longer works . 
If European governments today distance themselves from America , as their citizens frequently demand , they will both antagonize and further weaken the US . 
At the same time , they will undermine their own international influence , allow others to play off Europe against America , destroying as well what chance remains for rebuilding the West with a reformed America . 
European leaders , even when they are unhappy over US positions , therefore need to combine forceful support for the transatlantic community of interests with discrete , if firm lobbying in Washington not to strain it to the breaking point . 
Whether they can successfully perform this difficult act , remains to be seen . 
Fortunately , Angela Merkel , Nicolas Sarkozy , and Gordon Brown understand the challenge , and at least some parts of the Bush government seem aware of the problem . 
In the long period of American weakness , European leaders will have to demonstrate statesmanship for the West as a whole . 
It is a role for which decades of US supremacy have scarcely prepared them .
