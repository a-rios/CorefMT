Russia Between Old Europe and New America 
by Dmitri Trenin 
He also refrained from joining German Chancellor Schroeder &apos;s opposition to any military action against Baghdad . 
In the end , Russia &apos;s president came down against backing the US , yet he has - so far - attracted none of the angry gibes that the French and German leaders have received from America . 
The subtlety and maturity of his diplomacy over Iraq are but another sign that Russia is emerging from its long post-communist funk to find its voice in an American-led world . 
From the start of the crisis , Russia &apos;s president shrewdly saw the difference in the way Americans perceive France and Germany , on the one hand , and Russia , on the other . 
The lingering empathy for France and Germany born of the Cold War alliance stands in stark contrast to the American foreign policy community &apos;s wariness toward post-Soviet Russia . 
Had President Putin joined the Franco-German chorus of doubters at the beginning of the UN debate , he would have squandered the goodwill and reputation for reliability he had painstakingly accumulated since coming to power three years ago . 
The difference between Paris / Berlin and Moscow , however , reaches deeper . 
France is not merely interested in Iraqi oil , nor is Germany &apos;s Chancellor simply taking notice of opinion polls ( on his own government &apos;s performance , not just Iraq ) . 
For both France and Germany , the Iraq issue is a crucible for forging an autonomous foreign / security policy for the European Union . 
That is a serious goal , but also a challenge to America , and President Putin knows it . 
Washington identifies it as such , and welcomed the &quot; new Europe &quot; ( which includes large chunks of the &quot; old &quot; communist Eastern Europe ) helping to tilt the balance on the continent back in America &apos;s favor . 
At this remarkable point in Europe &apos;s history , some in Russia have been tempted to revive the old policy of fuelling transatlantic divisions . 
Defunct and , frankly , bankrupt , that policy is nevertheless remembered fondly by many in Russia &apos;s foreign policy elite . 
Others saw , in siding with France and Germany , a means for Russia to &quot; join Europe &quot; on more equal terms than those that now seem to be on offer . 
Both views are delusions . 
In today &apos;s world , Russia &apos;s business is Russia . 
Its paramount interest is to modernize the country , its economy , political system , and society . 
To achieve that goal , Russia requires not just the absence of confrontation with the US , but a genuinely strong and deep relationship with the world &apos;s sole superpower . 
Until Russia becomes a magnet for US investment and a proper economic foundation is built to support this relationship , it will have to rest on two principal pillars : security cooperation and energy partnership . 
It is in Russia &apos;s direct national interest to craft a special relationship with America , both to underpin its modernization strategy and to deal with the countless security problems facing Eurasia . 
These include proliferation of weapons of mass destruction around Russia &apos;s borders ; international terrorism and drug trafficking which benefit from social and economic dislocations , especially across the Greater Middle East ; and the challenge of Islamic militancy . 
As in Afghanistan and Central Asia , America and Russia could be valuable partners in pursuit of common objectives . 
President Putin has said , rightly , that there are matters in the world more important than Iraq , among them the role and authority of the UN Security Council . 
This is correct . 
Traditionally , Moscow regarded the Council through the prism of it holding one of the five veto-wielding permanent chairs . 
This served as a guarantee of &quot; international political immunity &quot; for Russia . 
Great Power status on the Security Council remains a valuable hedge , but in a world where there is only one superpower , the informal rules of the game have changed . 
To raise the effectiveness of the Council now , one needs to learn to work with ( not against ) the newly-dominant US through UN mechanisms . 
Here , there is much ( besides the special relationship ) that Russians can learn from Britain . 
In addition to the new Europe now coming into being , a new West is taking form , one spanning the Atlantic to the Pacific . 
Russia is of Europe , but its situation and some of its interests are markedly different from those of the EU core ( as West Europeans regularly point out ) . 
Economic integration with the EU plus security partnership with the US is a winning formula for Russian modernization . 
On Iraq , Russia &apos;s national interest is to preserve some of its influence , and the only way to do that is to find some agreement with the US about Iraq &apos;s post-Saddam future .
