Europe &apos;s Doubting Generation 
PARIS - The contrast between the Schuman Declaration of May 9 , 1950 , which launched the European unification project through the Coal and Steel Community , and the fearful bid to save Greece and rescue the euro of May 9 , 2010 , could not be more stark . 
Of course , in 1950 the Cold War was raging and recovery from World War II concentrated European minds . 
It was urgent to be imaginative - and the right people were in the right positions . 
Jean Monnet , who inspired the project , was pragmatic and daring . 
Robert Schuman , who presented the idea of unification to Europe &apos;s leaders , was animated by a deep Christian faith that helped create miracles . 
Different times , different people , different spirit . 
The seat of the College of Europe in Natolin , near Warsaw , is a near perfect barometer to test the morale of Europe . 
If the young European elites being trained there to occupy positions within the European Union &apos;s institutions no longer believe in the EU &apos;s future , something is really wrong . 
For if they don &apos;t believe in Europe , who will ? 
On the Natolin campus , post-graduate students , representing more than thirty nationalities , live in what they themselves often describe as a &quot; golden cage . &quot; 
They interact ( or should ) to become what many may already have been prior to their arrival : &quot; Europeans . &quot; 
At least , this is the way things were and should be . 
But , even in this uniquely protected environment , Europe is no longer the cause that it once was . 
Students tend to group themselves by nationalities more than they did in the past , as if they want familiar reassurances against the uncertainties of the present and the future . 
When I started teaching International Relations in Natolin in 2002 , all the college &apos;s students were infused with the hopes stemming from the EU &apos;s enlargement to Eastern Europe . 
They prepared for inclusion of eight former Communist countries ( as well Cyprus and Malta ) with almost quasi-religious fervor . 
Students from &quot; Old Europe &quot; were energized by the idealism and confidence emanating from their Polish , Czech , Estonian , and other compatriots . 
They all seemed full of optimism about their political and economic future . 
The will to transcend the murderous trauma in the Balkans was also present . 
Watching students from Serbia , Croatia , and Bosnia confront their memories of the Balkan wars , &quot; European students &quot; had first-hand experience of what true &quot; reconciliation &quot; meant and what the rules of the game were in the greatest success the EU had known - transcending the Cold War and nationalist animosities . 
On May 1 , 2004 , I celebrated EU enlargement with my students . 
We embraced each other under the blue flag with its 12 yellow stars . 
Of course , not everyone beyond the College of Europe &apos;s campus shared this enthusiasm , especially not everyone in Old Europe , which often seemed to be accomplishing its &quot; historical duty &quot; with considerable reluctance . 
Today , in fact , as the financial and economic crisis unfolds before our eyes , it is ironic to compare the relative strength of Central Europe , behind a strong Poland , to the extreme vulnerability of Southern Europe , behind Greece . 
Nowadays at the College of Europe , the &quot; culture of doubt &quot; among students from Old Europe seems to prevail over what was once the pragmatic confidence of students from New Europe . 
It is no longer the &quot; good wind &quot; from the East , but the &quot; bad wind &quot; from the EU &apos;s South and parts of its West that carries the day . 
Many students , if not the majority , are no longer on campus because they &quot; believe &quot; in Europe , but because they are full of doubts as to their capacity to find a job in their respective countries . 
They wish to acquire an additional diploma , even though they are already overqualified . 
They hope for an upturn in the economic climate , or to get a comparative advantage in the ferocious competition for first jobs . 
They are , above all , gaining time . 
Asked not about their motivations , but about their identities , the students from the College - with the exception of the Germans - do not naturally and spontaneously perceive themselves as Europeans first . 
They listen with sympathy , and sometimes even emotion , to the testimonies of the generation for whom Europe was synonymous with the ideal of reconciliation and reconstruction . 
The Union &apos;s founding story is not their story , but the story of their parents or grandparents . 
They do not ask themselves what they can do for Europe , but what Europe can do for them in terms of jobs and salaries . 
And they are more dubious than confident .
