What Corporate Tax for Europe ? 
The European Commission is considering a common model of corporate taxation for the European Union that cannot possibly work . 
Instead , it should consider a simpler , and more viable , alternative that already exists . 
Corporate income in the EU is currently taxed under widely divergent national rules , based on separate accounting ( SA ) of income earned in each country . 
Cross-border intra-company transactions are accounted for according to market prices for similar transactions - the so-called &quot; arm &apos;s-length principle &quot; ( ALP ) . 
The system is complex , expensive to administer , and can result in double taxation because members usually do not allow full write-offs for losses and tax liabilities incurred abroad . 
It is also prone to tax evasion , owing to different definitions of corporate income in the member states and the vast opportunities for cheating offered by ALP ( since reference market prices often do not exist ) , not to mention profit-shifting to low-tax jurisdictions . 
The Commission is now proposing that EU companies operating in more than one member state be taxed on a common definition of earned income - the Common Consolidated Base Taxation ( CCBT ) . 
Earned income would be calculated on a consolidated basis for the group and then &quot; apportioned &quot; among the member states according to a formula reflecting each business unit &apos;s contribution to overall group income . 
The formula could include such factors as sales , payroll , and tangible assets , as in Canada and the United States , or value-added , adjusted to exclude imports in order to measure the value-added &quot; produced &quot; in each country . 
Each member state would remain free to decide the tax rate applicable to its portion of group income . 
Under this approach , taxable income would be determined from the consolidated accounts based on international accounting standards ( IAS ) , which since 2005 have become legally binding for EU-listed companies &quot; financial reports . 
This offers full tax write-offs for losses within company groups , and transfer prices would no longer matter . 
Even so , the Commission &apos;s proposal has fatal shortcomings . 
For one thing , the factors included in the apportionment formula would in practice be taxed at the national rates , creating fresh incentives for factor- and profit-shifting . 
But it is two other obstacles that render CCBT hopeless . 
First , the IAS responds to the information needs of financial investors , but it does not provide a reliable definition of income for tax purposes . 
The accrual principle typical of financial accounting is incompatible with tax systems &quot; realization principle . 
Moreover , the IAS leaves the allocation of profit and losses to different fiscal years largely undetermined , with each member state choosing different solutions . 
Second , common legal rules on group consolidation do not exist ; indeed , many EU countries &quot; commercial law contains no legal definition of a group . 
The attribution of companies to a common group would need to be based on legal control , that is , ownership of some defined threshold of equity - 51 % or higher . 
But a much lower share of equity often is sufficient to secure de facto control , thus encouraging groups to adapt their capital structure - moving firms in and out of the group &apos;s boundaries - to minimize tax liabilities . 
Clearly , CCBT is a non-starter . 
But this doesn &apos;t mean that EU companies are condemned to live with 25 different national tax systems . 
The idea of a common tax base must be preserved in order to simplify the system and narrow the scope for profit-shifting . 
However , a radical change in approach is required : the notion of income as a basis for corporate taxation should be scrapped altogether . 
Referring to corporate income made sense when company taxation was seen as a &quot; back stop &quot; within a system of progressive taxation of personal incomes . 
But most countries have now adopted &quot; dual &quot; income taxation that treat the fruits of capital more leniently than other personal income . 
More importantly , the notion of corporate income is inherently arbitrary , for it is based on correct measurement of capital consumption in each tax period , which has become less and less reliable owing to the increased importance of intangibles in the value of companies . 
Moreover , any tax whose proceeds increase in line with company returns is bound to discourage investment . 
This disincentive disappears if the corporate tax base is decoupled from current profits and linked to some broad measure of activity . 
Indeed , this would create an incentive for each company to outperform the average , since above-average profits would go untaxed . 
Another reason to scrap income and move to presumptive taxation of corporate activities stems from the EU &apos;s decentralized nature . 
While taxing the return on capital at the national level could discourage investment , taxing companies in exchange for location advantages might not . 
Countries that offer world-class infrastructure , high-skill staff , and simple business rules may be well entitled to ask companies to pay a commensurate tax in return . 
In sum , the EU &quot; federal &quot; corporate tax should be thought of as a benefit tax , based on a broad measure of activity , applied at a moderate rate , and unrelated to current returns ; nor should it be deductible from other taxes . 
Among the various options under consideration , the value-added tax base - perhaps averaged over a number of years - looks best , since the accounting and tax-assessment infrastructures already exist . 
Of course , value-added includes profits , and to this extent the incentive for companies to manipulate transfer prices may reappear . 
But the incentive would be much weakened , because gross returns typically represent a fairly small share of total value-added . 
This model leaves the assessment and administration of corporate taxes entirely in the hands of member states , and would not require harmonization of legal and accounting rules . 
It would be transparent , simple , and easy to administer . 
The gigantic apparatus for managing transfer prices and tax credit claims with foreign tax authorities could be dismantled . 
Indeed , the only losers would be Europe &apos;s outsized army of tax lawyers and accountants .
