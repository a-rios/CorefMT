Improving Breast Cancer Care Step by Step 
Breast cancer , the most common life-threatening malignancy in the West , is more curable than ever but remains one of the most common causes of cancer death . 
The cost of this disease is high ; so , too , are the costs of treatment because no &quot; magic bullet &quot; cure exists . 
Yet , the death rate from breast cancer is falling in most Western countries even though the number of cases remains relatively unchanged . 
This likely reflects increased attention to the details of care . 
Because progress against breast cancer is incremental - ie , no single treatment is instantly recognized as dramatically superior - big disparities exist in how various treatments are applied in different countries . 
Even though science may clearly point to the best way to fight breast cancer , uneven application of new treatments may cause many women to suffer , or even die , unnecessarily . 
Although the causes of breast cancer remain unknown , early detection , before cancer cells spread , is crucial . 
Large randomized trials from several decades ago showed that mammography added to regular physical examination improves early detection , reducing the risk of death . 
Recent studies focus on the ideal age to begin screening and the ideal frequency of testing . 
Soon debates about the ideal technology - conventional mammography , digital mammography , ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging , or a combination of technologies - are likely . 
Screening with mammography is clearly superior to no screening and our first priority should be to assure that women are screened . 
Arguments about effectiveness here frequently focus on cost-effectiveness . 
But if this is the barrier to widespread use , efforts to lower costs should be pursued , for this is no excuse to deny women the benefits of screening . 
Surgery , although not always curative , is the mainstay of treatment because most tumors left in place will spread . 
The classic surgical option was the mastectomy , where the entire breast and surrounding tissue was removed . 
Appreciating the fact that breast cancer could spread even before it was treated led to clinical trials testing breast-sparing surgery ( &quot; lumpectomy &quot; ) . 
Studies show that the majority of women can be safely treated in this way . 
Within the US , variations in the use of breast conservation are linked to surgical bias , as well as to availability of radiation therapy . 
Individual patients should not be encouraged to have mastectomies because of their surgeons &quot; bias , although there are specific circumstances where this is appropriate . 
To treat cancer cells that might remain in the breast even after an optimal surgical procedure , radiation to the preserved breast is routinely used . 
Even if the breast is removed , radiation is sometimes needed to prevent recurrence of the breast cancer on the skin of the chest . 
In the case of breast conservation , radiation therapy is needed from the beginning , except in unusual circumstances . 
Efforts to assure access to high quality radiation therapy should be made so that breast cancer does not require the loss of a breast . 
Surgeons and pathology laboratories performing breast conservation need to be skilled in determining the adequacy of the procedure to assure patients of the best result . 
Because breast cancer is so invasive and spreads so unpredictably , surgery is not always sufficient . 
But treatment of cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast is possible with systemic therapy , meaning drugs . 
Unfortunately , we cannot know in advance if surgery will succeed because we cannot detect if cancerous cells have spread . 
This is why treatment of breast cancer is ideally multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted , including not only local treatment of the breast but also systemic treatment for the entire body . 
The only way to approach cells that might have spread throughout the body is to give medicines because only drugs circulate throughout the body . 
Systemic treatment given after surgery is called &quot; adjuvant therapy . &quot; 
Here , however , are found the widest variations in treatment , both among and within countries . 
This reflects honest intellectual differences as well as monetary concerns and limits . 
The basic adjuvant options are hormone treatments and chemotherapy . 
Hormone therapy takes advantage of the fact that many ( but not all ) breast cancers have receptors for the female hormones estrogen and progesterone . 
Interaction with these receptors can kill cancer cells . 
Chemotherapy comprises a large variety of drugs that directly kill cancer cells . 
Investigators at Oxford University conduct an overview every five years of the many adjuvant treatments now available , and this report points to some clear conclusions . 
At least 50,000 women have been treated in clinical trials that demonstrate conclusively the impact of tamoxifen , the most widely used anti-estrogen treatment . 
Before the Oxford overview , American oncologists typically did not recommend tamoxifen for young patients while Europeans often recommended it for all patients including those whose tumors lacked the requisite receptors . 
As an outgrowth of the Oxford findings , there is a more consistent approach now and evidence of improving outcomes . 
Several hundred thousand women are now alive because of effective anti-estrogen therapies . 
In contrast to hormone treatments , given only to patients likely to respond by virtue of an analysis of their hormone receptors , chemotherapy is given to all or any eligible patients . 
Hence , the impact of chemotherapy appears to be smaller than that of hormone treatments in some patient groups . 
A predictive test for responsiveness to chemotherapy would be a major step forward in treating breast cancer as it might allow more selective use of these agents . 
Chemotherapy , usually comprising several drugs , is effective at killing cancer cells , increasingly safe , and adds to the effectiveness of hormone therapy . 
Building on this success , current research is exploring new drugs , particularly those that rely on our growing biological insights . 
For example , some aggressive breast cancers were found to have an excess of a protein called HER2 . 
An antibody targeting HER2 appears to be effective both when given alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy , but such therapy in the adjuvant setting will raise the cost and complexity of care . 
Newer targeted treatments entering clinical trials are likely to be even more contentious because of their cost . 
For some new agents , it is fair to ask whether they truly represent an advance over previously available ( less expensive ) alternatives . 
For novel agents , such as the anti-HER2 antibody Herceptin â„¢ , where there is no precedent , this cost must be considered against its novel action , activity , and limited toxicity . 
These challenges and questions are becoming more frequent and societies must ask how much they can afford . 
This requires more than discussion about how health care money is spent because this can force doctors and patients to fight over crumbs when what is needed is bigger loaves ( budgets ) ! 
Discussions over expenditures should not pit pediatricians against oncologists but instead , patients and physicians should discuss with governments overall expenditures for health and non-health needs . 
Because the outlook for women can be improved if everyone conforms to best practice , the best available care must be provided to breast cancer &apos;s victims even as we search for incremental steps forward . 
This requires hard decisions at the societal level as well as dedicated advocates for patients . 
We should resist sacrificing lives simply because of expense .
