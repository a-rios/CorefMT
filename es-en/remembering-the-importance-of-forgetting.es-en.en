Remembering the Importance of Forgetting 
SINGAPORE - &quot; Be careful what you post on Facebook , &quot; US President Barack Obama warned American high school students this past September . 
&quot; Whatever you do , it will be pulled up again later somewhere in your life . &quot; 
In fact , we all are coming to learn that lesson the hard way : digital information almost never goes away , even if we wish that it would . 
The result is the permanency of the past in the present . 
This fact is one of the biggest challenges that society will face as computers and the Internet become more a part of everyday life . 
For millennia , remembering information was costly and time-consuming , and to forget was a natural part of being human . 
In the digital age , the opposite is true : cheap computer storage , powerful processors , and ubiquitous Internet access have made remembering the norm . 
Consider this : we tend to retain our rough drafts , years of e-mail traffic , and thousands of ghastly digital snapshots on our hard drives , not because we have decided that they are worth remembering , but because keeping them is now the default way of doing things . 
By contrast , deciding what to delete is costly . 
It actually requires much more time and effort to shed data than to keep it . 
So we click &quot; save &quot; just in case . 
But it is worth remembering that there is a lot of value in forgetting . 
Forgetting permits us to transcend details and generalize , to see the forest and not just the trees . 
As some information lapses over time , the world becomes more comprehensible because we become free to focus on what is important . 
Forgetting also enables us to forgive others . 
Fading memories of past experiences allow new memories to bloom , much as decaying leaves allow for new growth . 
Forgetting thus affords us a second chance , individually and as a society , to rise above our past mistakes and misdeeds , to accept that humans change over time . 
But , with digital memory , that natural process is halted . 
Instead , the past is always present , ready to be called up with a few clicks on a keyboard or mobile phone . 
Indeed , we are increasingly confronted with outdated information taken out of context , from anachronistic news stories to emotional e-mails and compromising pictures that we had long ago forgotten . 
For example , more and more employers are researching job applicants through Google and social-networking Web sites . 
There are already many cases of people being denied jobs or promotions because of what is unearthed . 
But these are reflections of a person &apos;s past ; they rarely provide accurate information about the present . 
Obama &apos;s admonishment reminds us to be more discriminating about what information we share online . 
His advice is essentially to practice a form of digital abstinence . 
It is an understandable , pragmatic suggestion - but not necessarily a good one . 
We have much to gain individually and as a society from sharing information with each other . 
Too much self-censoring of what we do online would deny us the benefits of the Internet . 
A better approach would be to ensure that digital information , like its offline variants of yesteryear , can disappear over time . 
First , we could give digital files &quot; expiration dates , &quot; so that our digital systems would delete the file when the appropriate time comes . 
Second , we could opt to expose our information to a form of digital &quot; rusting , &quot; so that it slowly erodes ( and we would need to take proactive steps should we ever wish to recover some of it ) . 
Third , we could separate past information , so that it takes a special effort or additional time to retrieve it , thereby reducing the chances that we accidentally stumble upon it . 
The more we steam headlong into the future , the more we amalgamate the data and detritus of the past and place it irrevocably into the present . 
Yet it is not just how information is stored and retrieved that needs to change , but how we think about information as well . 
The onus is on us as much as it is on the computer .
