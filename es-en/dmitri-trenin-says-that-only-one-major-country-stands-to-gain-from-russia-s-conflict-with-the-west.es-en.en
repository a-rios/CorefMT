China &apos;s Victory in Ukraine 
MOSCOW - For a generation , relations between the United States and Russia were essentially about history . 
Since the Cold War &apos;s end , Russia had become increasingly peripheral to the US and much of the rest of the world , its international importance and power seemingly consigned to the past . 
That era has now ended . 
To be sure , the current conflict between the US and Russia over Ukraine is a mismatch , given the disparity in power between the two sides . 
Russia is not , and cannot even pretend to be , a contender for world domination . 
Unlike the Soviet Union , it is not driven by some universal ideology , does not lead a bloc of states ruled by the same ideology , and has few formal allies ( all of which are small ) . 
Yet the US-Russia conflict matters to the rest of the world . 
It obviously matters most to Ukraine , part of which has become a battlefield . 
The future of Europe &apos;s largest country - its shape , political order , and foreign relations - depends very much on how the US-Russian struggle plays out . 
It may well be that Ukraine becomes internally united , genuinely democratic , and firmly tied to European and Atlantic institutions ; that it is generously helped by these institutions and prospers as a result ; and that it evolves into an example for Russians across the border to follow . 
It may also be that at the end of the day , several Ukraines emerge , heading in different directions . 
Ukraine &apos;s fate , in turn , matters to other countries in Eastern Europe , particularly Moldova and Georgia . 
Both , like Ukraine , have signed association agreements with the European Union ; and both will have to walk a fine line to avoid becoming battleground states between Russia and the West . 
Similarly , Russia &apos;s nominal partners in its Eurasian Union project - Armenia , Belarus , Kazakhstan , and Kyrgyzstan - will need to balance carefully between Russia , their nominal &quot; strategic &quot; ally , and the US , which holds the keys to the international political and economic system . 
What happens to Ukraine matters to Western and Central Europe , too . 
Even though an enduring military standoff along NATO &apos;s eastern border with Russia would pale in comparison to the Cold War confrontation with the Warsaw Pact , Europe &apos;s military security can no longer be taken for granted . 
And as security worries on the continent rise , EU-Russia trade will fall . 
As a result of US pressure , the EU will eventually buy less gas and oil from Russia , and the Russians will buy fewer manufactured goods from their neighbors . 
Distrust between Russia and Europe will become pervasive . 
The idea of a common space from Lisbon to Vladivostok will be buried . 
Instead , the EU and the US will be aligned even more closely , both within a reinvigorated NATO and by means of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership . 
Japan has a stake as well : its decision to join the US-led sanctions against Russia means foregoing plans to build a solid relationship with the Kremlin to balance China in Asia . 
The US-Japan alliance will be reaffirmed , as will Japan &apos;s position in that alliance . 
In a somewhat similar way , South Korea will need to bow before US demands to limit its trade with Russia , potentially eliciting a less cooperative Kremlin stance on the divided Korean Peninsula . 
As a result , the US-Russia conflict will probably lead to a strengthening of America &apos;s position vis-Ã -vis its European and Asian allies , and a much less friendly environment for Russia anywhere in Eurasia . 
Even Russia &apos;s nominal allies will have to look over their shoulder to the US , and its forays into Latin America and enclaves of influence in the Middle East will be of little importance . 
There is only one exception to this pattern of heightened US influence : China . 
The sharp reduction of Russia &apos;s economic ties with the advanced countries leaves China as the only major economy outside of the US-led sanctions regime . 
This increases China &apos;s significance to Russia , promising to enable the Chinese to gain wider access to Russian energy , other natural resources , and military technology . 
China will study US strategy toward Russia and draw its own conclusions . 
But China has no interest in Russia succumbing to US pressure , breaking apart , or becoming a global power . 
Its interests are in keeping Russia as its stable strategic hinterland and a natural-resource base . 
Chinese support for Russia to stand up to the US would be a novelty in world affairs . 
Many do not view it as a realistic scenario ; 
Russia , after all , would find an alliance with China too heavy to bear , and , whatever their ideology or whoever their leaders , Russians remain European . 
That may be true . 
Yet it is also true that one of the most revered Russian heroes from medieval history , Prince St. Alexander Nevsky , successfully fought Western invaders while remaining loyal to the Mongol khans . 
There is no question that Russia will pay a price for its actions in Ukraine . 
The question for the US and its allies is whether exacting that price will come with a price of its own .
