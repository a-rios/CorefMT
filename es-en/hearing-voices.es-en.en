Hearing Voices 
You are in a crowd when you hear your name . 
You turn , looking for the speaker . 
No one meets your gaze . 
It dawns on you that the voice you heard must have sprung from your own mind . 
This foray into the uncanny is as close as most people come to experiencing auditory hallucinations or &quot; hearing voices , &quot; a condition that affects 70 % of patients with schizophrenia and 15 % of patients with mood disorders such as mania or depression . 
For these individuals , instead of hearing just one &apos;s name , voices produce a stream of speech , often vulgar or derogatory ( &quot; You are a fat whore , &quot; &quot; Go to hell &quot; ) or a running commentary on one &apos;s most private thoughts . 
The compelling aura of reality about these experiences often produces distress and disrupts thought and behavior . 
The sound of the voice is sometimes that of a family member or someone from one &apos;s past , or is like that of no known person but has distinct and immediately recognizable features ( say , a deep , growling voice ) . 
Often certain actual external sounds , such as fans or running water , become transformed into perceived speech . 
One patient described the recurrence of voices as akin to being &quot; in a constant state of mental rape . &quot; 
In the worst cases , voices command the listener to undertake destructive acts such as suicide or assault . 
But hearing voices is not necessarily a sign of mental illness , so understanding the mechanics of auditory hallucinations is crucial to understanding schizophrenia and related disorders . 
For example , your occasional illusionary perception of your name spoken in a crowd occurs because this utterance is uniquely important . 
Our brains are primed to register such events ; so on rare occasions the brain makes a mistake and reconstructs unrelated sounds ( such as people talking indistinctly ) into a false perception of the spoken name . 
Hallucinated voices are also known to occur during states of religious or creative inspiration . 
Joan of Arc described hearing the voices of saints telling her to free her country from the English . 
Rainer Maria Rilke heard the voice of a &quot; terrible angel &quot; amidst the sound of a crashing sea after living alone in a castle for two months . 
This experience prompted his writing the Duino Elegies . 
How can we understand differences between an inspired voice , an isolated instance of hearing one &apos;s own name , and the voices of the mentally ill ? 
One answer is that &quot; non-pathological &quot; voices occur rarely or perhaps only once . 
Not so for the person with mental illness . 
Without treatment , these experiences recur relentlessly . 
Brain imaging studies have found that parts of the temporal lobe activate during these hallucinations . 
Our research at Yale University , as well as studies conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry in London , also detected activation in an area of the brain known as Broca &apos;s region during production of &quot; inner speech &quot; or verbal thought . 
One theory is that voices arise because Broca &apos;s area &quot; dumps &quot; language outputs into parts of the brain that ordinarily receive speech inputs from the outside . 
To test this theory we are using trans-cranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) to reduce the excitability of portions of the temporal lobe and Broca &apos;s region . 
So far , most patients appear to experience significant improvements from TMS directed to both brain regions , with improvements lasting from two months to over a year . 
These results , although preliminary , suggest an alternative treatment if validated in larger-scale studies . 
What remains unaddressed is the root cause of abnormal brain activations . 
We are pursuing three intertwined ideas . 
The first is based on studies suggesting that schizophrenia patients suffer from reduced brain connectivity . 
As a result , certain groups of neurons , such as those responsible for producing and perceiving language , may begin to function autonomously , beyond the control or influence of other brain systems . 
It is as if the string section of the orchestra suddenly decided to play its own music , disregarding everyone else . 
The second idea is that deprivation of social interaction - namely human conversation - makes the brain more likely to produce hallucinated conversations . 
Often one of the first signs of schizophrenia - occurring well before manifestations such as hearing voices - is social isolation . 
Indeed , sensory deprivation can produce hallucinations in the sense mode that is deprived . 
An example is Charles Bonnet Syndrome , where visual impairments in the elderly can produce visions of human figures . 
Could the absence of actual spoken human conversation - a cornerstone of day-to-day human intellect and creativity - produce hallucinated conversations ? 
Recall the extreme isolation that preceded the appearance of Rilke &apos;s startling voice . 
Third , heightened emotions may play a role in producing voices . 
Indeed , heightened emotionality prompts the brain to produce information consonant with that emotional state . 
For example , a low mood favors generation of thoughts that are themselves depressing . 
It is possible that intense states of emotion could pre-select and perhaps elicit from the brain certain verbal messages having the same emotional charge . 
Verbal messages expressed by voices often are highly emotional . 
Moreover , when schizophrenia begins , these persons are often in states of extreme fear or elation . 
It could be that these powerful emotional states increase the propensity of the brain to produce corresponding verbal &quot; messages . &quot; 
This would account for the fact that voices also emerge during states of extreme , but incidental , emotionality brought on by inspired thought , mania , depression , or ingestion of certain drugs . 
Here the voices disappear when the emotional states return to normal . 
The brains of schizophrenia sufferers may be vulnerable to becoming &quot; stuck &quot; in these hallucinatory states . 
Our hypothesis is that voices arise from different combinations of these three factors - reduced brain integration , social isolation , and high levels of emotionality . 
This view has become the focus of efforts to understand and help patients with mental illness quiet their minds .
