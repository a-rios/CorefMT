A Grand Unified Economic Theory ? 
NEW YORK - Last month &apos;s US government shutdown - the result of a partisan standoff in congressional budget negotiations - epitomizes the polarization that prevails in modern economic-policy debates . 
On one side , John Maynard Keynes &apos;s cohort argues that government intervention can help any economy grow its way out of crisis by spurring aggregate demand and , in turn , raising the employment rate . 
A country &apos;s government , Keynesians contend , has the capacity - and responsibility - to solve many , if not all , of its economic problems . 
On the opposite side , followers of the Austrian School of economic thought , especially the ideas of Friedrich Hayek , assert that limited government and free enterprise form the only viable path to liberty and prosperity . 
The market is the best arbiter of how to allocate scarce resources , and thus should serve as an economy &apos;s main driver . 
In recent years , this long-running debate has become increasingly contentious - and the costs of stalemate are mounting . 
In order to restore growth in developed economies , while sustaining strong GDP growth and reducing poverty in the developing world , a more unified approach to economic policymaking that draws from both traditions is needed . 
Official responses to the global economic crisis highlight the interventionist model &apos;s merits , proving that decisive government action can help to enhance efficiency and clear unbalanced markets , thereby protecting the economy from the demand shortfall caused by falling investment and rising unemployment . 
But the free market also has a crucial role to play , with longer-term , incentive-based policies catalyzing scientific and technological advancement - and thus boosting economies &quot; growth potential . 
In determining how to promote innovation without sacrificing social protection , economists and policymakers should take a lesson from the field of physics . 
For nearly a century , physicists have attempted to merge the competing ideas of the field &apos;s titans , including Wolfgang Pauli , the first physicist to predict the existence of neutrinos ( the smallest particles of matter ) , and Albert Einstein , who explained the curvature of space-time . 
The so-called &quot; theory of everything &quot; would reconcile the inconceivably small with the unimaginably large , providing a comprehensive understanding of the universe &apos;s physical properties . 
Policymakers should be working to unite seemingly disparate theories to align policy decisions with the business cycle and the economy &apos;s level of development . 
Such an approach should seek to protect economies from the destabilizing impacts of politically motivated policy changes , without impeding governments &quot; ability to correct dangerous imbalances . 
Officials must be at least as vigilant about reducing expenditure and withdrawing stimulus measures during periods of growth as they are inclined to introduce such policies during downturns . 
To the extent that this approach reflects the view that policymaking is an art , not a science , that is a good thing : the world needs more flexibility in economic policymaking . 
But some might consider it a cause for concern , especially given growing suspicion of incentive-based economic policies in the wake of the global economic crisis . 
Many blame the crisis on the decades-long ascendancy of a laissez faire approach to economic policymaking , and rightly credit government intervention with facilitating recovery . 
The tremendous economic success of countries like China , where hundreds of millions of people have escaped abject poverty in a single generation , has reinforced support for state-led systems . 
In developed countries , too , many advocate a greater role for the state , in order to ensure that promised social benefits are delivered to rapidly aging populations . 
In fact , in many countries , the government &apos;s capacity is already strained . 
As German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pointed out , though Europe is home to just 7 % of the world &apos;s population and produces 25 % of the world &apos;s wealth , it accounts for 50 % of global welfare payments . 
When the United States is included , 11.5 % of the global population receives 88 % of the world &apos;s welfare payments . 
But relegating free-market principles to the past would simply create a new set of imbalances . 
Rather than allow extremists to continue to hijack economic-policy debates , policymakers must work to bridge competing schools of thought . 
Only then will productive discourse - the kind that does not end in government shutdown - be possible . 
Keynes once wrote that he agreed with &quot; almost all &quot; of Hayek &apos;s ideas . 
And Hayek found it &quot; reassuring &quot; to know that he and Keynes agreed &quot; so completely . &quot; 
This raises the question : What is really preventing economists and policymakers from devising - or even seeking - a unified theory of economics ?
