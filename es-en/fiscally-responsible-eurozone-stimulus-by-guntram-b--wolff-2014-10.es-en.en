Europe &apos;s Fiscal Wormhole 
BRUSSELS - The International Monetary Fund now estimates a 30 % risk of deflation in the eurozone , and growth figures within the monetary union continue to disappoint . 
But policymakers seem trapped in a cat &apos;s cradle of economic , political , and legal constraints that is preventing effective action . 
The fulfillment of policy rules appears to be impossible without growth , but growth appears to be impossible without breaking the rules . 
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble is politically committed to outdoing his country &apos;s tough domestic fiscal framework to secure what he calls a &quot; black zero &quot; budget . 
The French government is working to regain credibility on reform promises made in exchange for delays on fiscal adjustment , and Italy , with one of the highest debt burdens in the eurozone , has little room to use fiscal policy . 
Meanwhile , the European Central Bank is constrained by doubts about the legality of its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) scheme - sovereign-bond purchases that could result in a redistributive fiscal policy . 
With all of the rules pointing toward recession , how can Europe boost recovery ? 
A two-year € 400 billion ( $ 510 billion ) public-investment program , financed with European Investment Bank bonds , would be the best way to overcome Europe &apos;s current impasse . 
Borrowing by the EIB has no implications in terms of European fiscal rules . 
It is recorded neither as new debt nor as a deficit for any of the member states , which means that new government spending could be funded without affecting national fiscal performance . 
Thus , some of the investment spending currently planned at the national level could be financed via European borrowing to relieve national budgets . 
Such an indirect way of dealing with strict rules would also be easier than starting long and wearying negotiations on changes to the fiscal framework . 
The EIB is worried that such a scheme could come at the cost of its triple-A rating . 
In any case , a rating change would hardly affect funding costs in the current low-yield environment , as lower-rated sovereigns have demonstrated . 
In addition , the ECB could purchase EIB bonds on secondary markets , which would help to keep funding costs low - or even reduce them . 
More important , purchases of EIB bonds would enable the ECB to undertake quantitative easing without triggering the degree of controversy implied by intervening in 18 separate sovereign-bond markets , where concerns that ECB purchases would affect the relative pricing of sovereigns are very real . 
Already , € 200 billion of EIB bonds are available . 
Adding € 400 billion would increase the pool substantially . 
Together with asset-backed securities , covered bonds , and corporate bonds , € 1 trillion of assets - the threshold widely thought to make quantitative easing by the ECB credible - would be available for purchase . 
A central question , of course , concerns the type of government spending that should qualify as investment spending , and which European investment projects should be supported . 
It will be impossible to define new and sensible European projects worth € 200 billion per year . 
Common projects such as the European energy union will need more time to be precisely defined . 
As a result , the bulk of investment now will have to come from national policymakers . 
In part , this means that existing infrastructure projects that are supposed to be financed from national budgets could be funded by the EIB . 
By removing some of the burden from national budgets , the current decline in public investment could be reversed . 
Some of the new resources could also be used to allow for budget consolidation in France without pro-cyclical cuts . 
France could get this helping hand in complying with the fiscal rules in exchange for serious and necessary structural reforms , as could Italy , where EIB-funded bonds would provide a much-needed growth stimulus without new government commitments . 
In Germany , the freed-up resources could be used to accelerate existing investment projects while still meeting its black-zero pledge . 
Similar arrangements could be found for the other eurozone countries . 
To prevent the misuse of money , the European Commission should vet all national investment projects . 
More broadly , the program would be an important step toward establishing the eurozone &apos;s missing fiscal union . 
That goal will be reached more quickly once the benefits of achieving it are apparent to all .
