Reforming France 
PARIS - Before this year has ended , the French parliament will have enacted a comprehensive pension overhaul , which is essential not only to putting France &apos;s public finances on a sound and sustainable footing , but also to shoring up confidence in the eurozone in 2014 and beyond . 
Moreover , how the reform was carried out is as important as the measure itself . 
France has more favorable demographics than most other European countries . 
Nonetheless , further effort was needed to strengthen the pay-as-you-go pension system by the equivalent of one percentage point of GDP . 
The contribution period will therefore be increased gradually , reaching 43 years in 2035 . 
This effort has gained broad public acceptance because it was fair : both retirees and working people will contribute , as will companies and households . 
Financing and social needs alike have been taken into account , while the drawbacks of the current system will be addressed , benefiting women , people who have experienced non-continuous careers , those with particularly strenuous occupations , and low-income retirees . 
Most important , for the first time , pension reform has been carried out in France in continuous consultation with employers &quot; associations and trade unions . 
Many people were expecting a showdown . 
Instead , an atmosphere of constructive negotiation prevailed . 
In other words , the key to success has been justice , balance , and social dialogue . 
In September , a leading European Union official said of a proposed measure , &quot; This is a French-style reform ! &quot; 
Regardless of whether it was intended as a criticism , I considered it a compliment . 
Some in Europe think that the only good reform is one that hurts . 
This is not my vision : yes , modernization is needed in the context of a changing world , but it does not have to be divisive . 
The challenge for Europe is to advance without falling apart . 
That means providing Europe &apos;s citizens with a renewed sense of hope and opportunity . 
France has been actively helping to stabilize the eurozone by encouraging structural progress , such as the establishment of a European banking union . 
We also need to strengthen social cohesion on the continent . 
That is the whole purpose of solidarity-based integration , as called for by President Fran√ßois Hollande . 
The European Council &apos;s revision this month of the Posting of Workers Directive , which applies to employees who are sent temporarily to work in another EU member state , is a good start . 
But we have to go further . 
The establishment of an EU-wide minimum wage would send a strong signal to citizens that Europe is a social reality . 
In France , after ten years of decline in export markets , my government has embarked on a bold strategy to restore our country &apos;s competitiveness . 
This year , we implemented a reduction of social-welfare taxes that will amount to around one percentage point of GDP when phased in fully by 2016 . 
France has also undertaken ambitious reforms to reduce job-market dualism and give greater flexibility to employers as well as greater security to employees . 
Moreover , the upcoming pension reform caps 18 months of significant steps toward fiscal consolidation that have improved the effectiveness of public spending while financing our priorities : education , the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy , employment , health care , and security . 
Our efforts have been unprecedented , resulting in deficit reduction amounting to 1.5 % of GDP in 2012 , 1.7 % in 2013 , and an estimated 0.9 % in 2014 . 
By 2015 , deficit reduction will rely entirely on spending cuts . 
While we have responded to emergencies in this period , we have not sacrificed our ability to push through more reforms in the future . 
Indeed , the restoration of social dialogue as a tool with which to forge long-lasting consensus represents a deep cultural shift that augurs well for such efforts . 
Many of these efforts are already underway : comprehensive reform of vocational training , a framework for adopting new sources of energy , and , last but not least , a complete overhaul of our tax system in favor of job creation and growth . 
Ultimately , we will be judged on the basis of our reforms &quot; economic efficiency and social fairness . 
Our task is to demonstrate our ability to reform government , offer high-quality public services - for example , education and health care - for all at a reasonable cost , and control public spending in order to restore our ability to reduce taxes without impeding debt reduction . 
My ambition is the creation of a &quot; new French model &quot; that places sustainable solidarity at its center , with all citizens aware of what they owe everyone else . 
Such a model - in which government empowers private initiatives and is dedicated to smoothing the major economic and environmental transitions of our time - offers opportunity for all , while relying on the power of collective action . 
It is thanks to these values , to the acute consciousness of what individual and collective strengths can achieve in tandem , that France has always found the necessary resources to rebuild and modernize . 
By being true to ourselves , and open to the world , we will make our voice heard in Europe and beyond .
