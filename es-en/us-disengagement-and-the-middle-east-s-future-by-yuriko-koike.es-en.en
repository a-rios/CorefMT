Asia and a Post-American Middle East 
KUWAIT CITY - When the consequences of the United States-led invasion of Iraq ten years ago are fully assessed , the importance of the subsequent rise of political Islam there - and throughout the wider Middle East - may well pale in comparison to that of a geostrategic shift that no one foresaw at the time . 
The Middle East , of course , has experienced the withdrawal of a great power , or powers , many times before : the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire after World War I ; the fraying of the French and British imperial mandates after World War II ; and , most recently , the nearly complete disappearance of Russian influence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . 
Each time , monumental changes in the region &apos;s politics , particularly its alliances , quickly followed . 
If America attempts to wash its hands of the Middle East in the coming years , will a similar rupture be inevitable ? 
Although many believe that the US-Israel alliance is the foundation of America &apos;s Middle East policy , it was dependence on imported oil that motivated the US to establish a dominant military presence in the region after 1945 . 
Indeed , until the Six Day War of June 1967 , the US was not a major supplier of military hardware to Israel . 
America &apos;s military presence was intended , above all , to preserve the Arab status quo , and hence the flow of energy from the Persian Gulf , for the benefit of the US , its allies , and the entire global economy . 
Of course , no one should think that America &apos;s shale-gas revolution ( which has brought it to the brink of energy self-sufficiency ) means that its Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet will lift anchor any time soon . 
But the rationale for America &apos;s commitment of military force to the region is changing fast ; when that happens - as it has in Europe , for example , since the Cold War &apos;s end - the distribution of military assets tends to change as well . 
That change is almost certain to be reflected in America &apos;s relationships with its Arab allies and partners . 
As the US statesman / academic Joseph Nye has argued : &quot; For decades the United States and Saudi Arabia have had a balance of asymmetries in which we depended on them as the swing producer of oil and they depended on us for ultimate military security . &quot; 
Given America &apos;s burgeoning domestic energy supplies , Nye argues , those &quot; bargains will be struck on somewhat better terms , &quot; at least from the US perspective . 
But , whatever new terms are struck , the degree of US disengagement from the Middle East will depend on how two key questions are answered . 
First , would even a partial withdrawal of military force create a security vacuum that could be filled by a rival - say , China or Iran ? 
And , second , would any diminution of America &apos;s commitment to the region incite the kind of instability that breeds failed states and terrorist havens ? 
President Barack Obama &apos;s current security strategy in Afghanistan , Yemen , and elsewhere suggests that the US will seek to mitigate the latter risk by continuing its covert interventions - particularly its use of unmanned aerial vehicles . 
Preventing rivals from gaining overweening influence in the region , however , will require a very different type of response - one that will require the backing of old allies , such as Japan , and new friends , like India . 
The reason for this is clear : China &apos;s dependence on Middle East energy imports means that it is almost certain to seek to fill any regional security vacuum . 
Indeed , China appears to have long anticipated the coming changes in the region &apos;s security structure , and already seems prepared to take advantage of them if permitted to do so . 
Its &quot; string of pearls &quot; across the Indian Ocean - a series of potential naval stations connecting China to the Middle East and Africa - would support a Chinese blue-water navy able to patrol the sea-lanes of the Persian Gulf . 
But , in trying to strike new bargains with Middle East oil producers , China has already been compromised by its strong backing of Iran , which is locked in a power struggle with the region &apos;s leading Sunni states , particularly Saudi Arabia . 
Absent a complete shift in China &apos;s relations with Iran , a strategic partnership with the monarchies of the Persian Gulf may prove impossible to achieve . 
Still , China &apos;s inevitable bid for greater influence in the Middle East means that countries like India , Indonesia , Japan , South Korea , Turkey and others will also need to become proactive in creating a regional security structure that protects their national interests . 
They will need to be clear with themselves about whether they have the means to achieve their national security ends . 
For example , could they provide some of the security that America has long provided to the region &apos;s Arab states ? 
Such a projection of Asian power - and of Asia &apos;s power struggles - into the Middle East may seem a distant prospect today . 
But ten years ago , so did the possibility of an American disengagement from the region .
