How to Resolve the Euro Crisis 
NEW YORK - A comprehensive solution of the euro crisis must have three major components : reform and recapitalization of the banking system , a eurobond regime , and an exit mechanism . 
First , the banking system . 
The European Union &apos;s Maastricht Treaty was designed to deal only with imbalances in the public sector ; but , as it happened , the excesses in the banking sector were far worse . 
The euro &apos;s introduction led to housing booms in countries like Spain and Ireland . 
Eurozone banks became among the world &apos;s most over-leveraged - and the worst-affected by the crash of 2008 . 
They remain badly in need of protection from the threat of insolvency . 
This needs to be followed by other steps . 
The equity capital of banks urgently needs to be substantially increased . 
And if a European agency is to guarantee banks &quot; solvency , that agency must also oversee them . 
A European banking agency would break up the incestuous relationship between banks and regulators that was at the root of the excesses that fueled the current crisis . 
And it would interfere much less with national sovereignty than would the subordination of fiscal policies to an EU or eurozone-wide authority . 
Second , Europe needs eurobonds . 
The introduction of the euro was supposed to reinforce convergence ; in fact , it created divergences , with widely different levels of indebtedness and competitiveness separating the member countries . 
If heavily indebted countries have to pay heavy risk premiums , their debt becomes unsustainable . 
The solution is obvious : deficit countries must be allowed to refinance the bulk of their debt on the same terms as surplus countries . 
This is best accomplished by authorizing the issuance of eurobonds , which would be jointly guaranteed by all of the member countries . 
While the principle is clear , the details will require a lot of work . 
Which supranational agency will be in charge of issuing eurobonds ? 
What rules will it follow in authorizing issuance ? 
How will it enforce the rules ? 
Presumably , the eurobonds would be under the control of the eurozone finance ministers . 
The board would constitute the fiscal counterpart of the European Central Bank ; it would also be the European counterpart of the International Monetary Fund . 
The debate will therefore revolve around voting rights . 
The ECB operates on the principle of one vote per country ; the IMF assigns voting rights according to countries &quot; capital contributions . 
Which system should prevail ? 
The former could give carte blanche to debtor countries to run up their deficits ; the latter might perpetuate a two-speed Europe . 
Some compromise will be necessary . 
Because the fate of Europe depends on Germany , and because the issuance of eurobonds will put Germany &apos;s own credit standing at risk , the compromise will clearly have to put Germany in the driver &apos;s seat . 
Unfortunately , Germany has some unsound ideas about macroeconomic policy : it wants the rest of Europe to follow its example . 
But what works for Germany cannot work for the rest of Europe : no country can run a chronic trade surplus without others running deficits . 
Germany must propose rules that other countries can follow . 
These rules must allow for a gradual reduction in indebtedness . 
They must also allow countries with high unemployment , like Spain , to continue running budget deficits . 
Rules involving targets for cyclically adjusted deficits can accomplish both of these goals . 
Most importantly , the rules must recognize their own imperfection - and thus must remain open to review and improvement . 
Bruegel , the Brussels-based think tank , has proposed that eurobonds should constitute 60 % of eurozone members &quot; outstanding external debt . 
Given the high risk premiums currently prevailing in Europe , this percentage is too low to constitute a level playing field . 
In my view , new issues should be entirely in eurobonds up to a limit set by the Board . 
The higher the volume of eurobonds a country seeks to issue , the more severe the conditions the Board would impose . 
The Board should have no problem imposing its will , because denying the right to issue additional eurobonds would be a powerful deterrent . 
Surveillance must be improved , however , in order to give countries timely notice when they are in violation . 
This leads directly to the third unsolved problem : What happens if a country is unwilling or unable to keep within agreed conditions ? 
Inability to issue eurobonds could result in a disorderly default or devaluation . 
In the absence of an exit mechanism , this would have catastrophic consequences . 
A deterrent that is too dangerous to invoke would lack credibility . 
Greece constitutes a cautionary example . 
Much depends on how the Greek crisis plays out . 
It might be possible to devise an orderly exit for a small country like Greece that could not be applied to a large one like Italy . 
In that case , the eurobond regime would have to carry sanctions from which there is no escape - something like a European finance ministry that has political as well as financial legitimacy which could emerge from the intense debate and soul-searching that is so badly needed ( particularly in Germany ) . 
One thing is certain : these three problem areas - reform and recapitalization of the banking system , a eurobond regime , and an exit mechanism - need to be resolved to make the euro a viable currency . 
But financial markets might not offer the respite necessary to put the new arrangements in place . 
Under continued market pressure , the European Council might have to find a stopgap arrangement to avoid a calamity . 
It could authorize the ECB to lend directly to governments that cannot borrow from the markets on reasonable terms until a eurobond regime is introduced .
