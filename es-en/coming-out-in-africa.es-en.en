Coming Out in Africa 
The lead story in a recent issue of the Daily Graphic , Ghana &apos;s most influential newspaper , was designed to shock : &quot; Four Gay Men Jailed . &quot; 
Homosexual acts are crimes in Ghana - and across much of sub-Saharan Africa . 
Uganda &apos;s leader , Yoweri Museveni , is vehemently opposed to homosexuality . 
Namibia &apos;s President Sam Nujoma complains that the West wants to impose its decadent sexual values on Africa through the guise of gay tolerance . 
Indeed , the global movement to fight discrimination against people living with HIV / AIDS - which first surfaced as a &quot; gay disease &quot; in the United States - has elicited little sympathy for homosexuals in sub-Saharan Africa . 
Only in South Africa have gays and lesbians won significant legal protections . 
The arrests in Ghana , while typical of African bigotry towards gays , were all the more shocking because gays and lesbians actually thrive in Ghana &apos;s capital , Accra . 
A country of 20 million people , Ghana is unusually tolerant . 
Whites , Asians , and Middle Easterners mix well . 
Ghana has never had a civil war - a badge of honor in conflict-prone sub-Saharan Africa - and three years ago staged a peaceful transfer of power from one elected government to another . 
Although homosexuality remains taboo , gays seem safe . 
Physical attacks against them are rare . 
In Accra , a trendy street club named Strawberries is well known as a hangout for gays , and there are a few prominent , if still discreet , clubs where homosexual men and women gather . 
One gay man has his own television show , even though his sexual preferences are no secret . 
Precisely because gays seem so accepted , the arrests sent a disturbing message . 
The paper that reported the story is owned by the government and sells more copies than all other newspapers combined . 
In the day following its original report , the Daily Graphic went further in showing its revulsion over gay activities by publishing a lead editorial that blamed Europeans and Americans for &quot; all the reported cases of homosexuality &quot; in Ghana . 
The paper alleged that the men had been enticed into such practices by a Norwegian , who gave them money and gifts in exchange for photos of them engaged in homosexual acts . 
The Norwegian posted the photos on the Web and supposedly mailed printouts to his Ghanaian friends . 
I am neither gay , nor Ghanaian , but I have spent considerable time in Ghana and I reject the argument - heard in other parts of Africa as well - that Western notions of sexuality have perverted Africans . 
In my experiences , Africans simply have a moral blind spot on the subject of homosexuality . 
Journalists seem especially ignorant . 
Last year I worked in Ghana as country director of Journalists for Human Rights , a Canadian group that helps African journalists give voice to the voiceless in their society while raising awareness of human rights abuses . 
The editor of the Daily Graphic supported my organization , and I held training sessions for his newspaper &apos;s reporters and editors . 
The sessions resulted in stories that highlighted mistreatment of women and children and the failures of government agencies to deliver promised services . 
But when I complained about bias against gays , the editor responded that gays don &apos;t deserve any sort of protection . 
Although this example may suggest that Africans are united against homosexuality , they are not ; gay advocates are simply terrified of speaking out , frightened that their support will be interpreted as an admission that they are gay . 
Two years ago , the silence was broken briefly by Ken Attafuah , who directs Ghana &apos;s truth and reconciliation commission , charged with investigating rights violations during two decades of dictatorships . 
&quot; It should not be left to gays alone to fight for gay rights , because we are talking about fundamental violations of justice , &quot; Attafuah said . 
&quot; You do not have to be a child to defend the rights of children . &quot; 
That point is lost in Ghana . 
After the gay arrests , I spoke at the University of Ghana about media coverage of homosexuals . 
While no one objected to the coverage by the Daily Graphic , no one denounced homosexuality either . 
Instead I received a short dissertation from one of the female students on how older married women often proposition her in nightclubs . 
Two other females said the same thing happens to them and asserted that lesbianism is widely practiced in Accra , if publicly unacknowledged . 
Lesbianism is , of course , a less threatening practice to the men who run Ghana . 
No African man is supposed to be gay , and physical contact between men is presumed to be innocent . 
Yet contradictions abound . 
Once , at a traditional ceremony , in which an infant child receives his tribal name , I watched the proud father and a half dozen male friends dance together before a crowd of well-wishers . 
The movements of these men were sexually suggestive , and at times they touched , even held hands . 
As I watched , a European next to me explained that such dancing is accepted , so long as the contact between the men is left undefined . 
In Ghana and in much of Africa , a culture of silence exists around same-sex love - a culture that many Westerners , raised on a belief in rights and openness - find unacceptable . 
Yet the notion of &quot; coming out &quot; may not be a solution for every African homosexual . 
Notions of what is right and wrong often collapse under the irreconcilable tensions between tradition and modernity , the individual and the community . 
In sub-Saharan Africa , I am reminded of the saying that silence is golden . 
Under the cover of silence , gays refrain from provoking the conflicts that a more vocal advocacy of homosexuality would bring . 
But the recent arrests in Ghana expose this strategy &apos;s true price .
