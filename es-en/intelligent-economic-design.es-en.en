Intelligent Economic Design 
BERKELEY - As Stephen Cohen , with whom I wrote The End of Influence : What Happens When Other Countries Have the Money , likes to say , economies do not evolve ; they are , rather , intelligently designed . 
He also likes to say that , though there is an intelligence behind their design , this does not mean that the design is in any sense wise . 
The first claim is , I think , incontrovertible . 
Since long before Croesus , King of Lydia , came up with the game-changing idea of standardized &quot; coinage , &quot; what governments have done and not done to structure , nudge , and put their thumbs on the scales has been decisively important for economic development . 
Just look around you . 
Notice the hundred-fold divergence across political jurisdictions in relative levels of economic productivity and prosperity ? 
I dare anyone to claim that the overwhelming bulk of that disparity springs from causes other than history and the current state of governance . 
The second claim is also , I think , true . 
To say that economies are the products of intelligent design means only that some human intelligence or intelligences lies behind the design . 
It does not mean that the design is smart or optimal . 
For one thing , the process by which the design decisions are made resembles committee work : most people want a horse , but the push and pull and tug of negotiation produces a camel . 
Moreover , the government officials , lobbyists , and interest groups doing the designing may not have the public interest in mind - or even know what the public interest happens to be . 
Most of the time in America , the process of intelligent design of the economy has gone well : that is why Americans are so relatively and absolutely rich today . 
After all , the Founding Fathers were keen on redesigning the infant American economy . 
Alexander Hamilton was clear on the primacy of commerce and industry . 
In particular , Hamilton was convinced of the importance of a sophisticated banking system to support the growing economy . 
And he and his Federalist colleagues , including John Adams , believed strongly in providing infant industries with room to grow - even using money from the Department of War to fund experiments in high-tech industry . 
When the Democratic-Republicans , led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , replaced the Federalists , they quickly decided that their small-government principles were an out-of-power luxury . 
Wars of conquest , territorial acquisition , continental surveying , and canal and then railroad subsidies were good for voters , immigrants , and pretty much everyone else except the outnumbered and outgunned Native Americans who got in the way . 
Indeed , any government that builds infrastructure and allocates land titles on the scale of the nineteenth-century US government is &quot; Big Government &quot; incarnate . 
Add steep tariffs on imported manufactured goods - rammed through over the angry protests of farmers and southern planters - and you have the policies that intelligently designed much of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century America . 
After World War II , it was again government that led the redesign of the US economy . 
The decisions to build an interstate highway system ( and to spend most of that money on suburban commuter roads ) and to jump-start the long-term mortgage market - reflecting the widespread belief that General Motors &quot; interests were identical with America &apos;s - literally reconfigured the landscape . 
Combine that with the large-scale development of the world &apos;s leading research universities , which then educated tens of millions of people , and with the tradition of using defense money to finance high-tech research and development , and , voil√† , you have the post-war US economy . 
Whenever push has come to economic shove , America &apos;s government has even deliberately devalued the dollar in the interest of economic prosperity . 
Franklin Roosevelt did it during the Great Depression , and Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan did it , too . 
This history is worth reviewing because America is poised for another debate over whether its economy evolves or is designed , with President Barack Obama &apos;s opponents claiming that whatever is good in America &apos;s economy has always evolved with no guidance , and that whatever is bad has been designed by government . 
This claim is , of course , ludicrous . 
American governments will continue to plan and design the development of the economy , as they always have in the past . 
The question is how , and whether the design will be in any sense wise . 
But there are two dangers in America &apos;s forthcoming debate . 
The first concerns the term likely to be used to frame the debate : competitiveness . 
&quot; Productivity &quot; would be much better . 
&quot; Competitiveness &quot; carries the implication of a zero-sum game , in which America can win only if its trading partners lose . 
That is a misleading , and dangerous , implication . 
Instead , all else being equal , richer trading partners benefit America : they make more good stuff for Americans to buy and sell more cheaply , and their stronger demand means that they are willing to pay more for the stuff that America has to sell . 
Win-win . 
The second danger is that &quot; competitiveness &quot; implies that what is good for companies located in America - good , that is , for their investors , executives , and financiers - is good for America as a whole . 
Back when President Dwight D. Eisenhower &apos;s cabinet nominee Charlie Wilson claimed that what was &quot; good for America was good for General Motors - and vice versa , &quot; GM included not just shareholders , executives , and financiers , but also suppliers and members of the United Auto Workers union . 
By contrast , General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt , recently appointed by Obama to lead the President &apos;s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness , runs a company that has long since narrowed to executives , investors , and financiers . 
Let us hope that the looming debate goes well . 
A more prosperous and rapidly growing America - a scenario in which the rest of the world has a vital interest - hangs in the balance .
