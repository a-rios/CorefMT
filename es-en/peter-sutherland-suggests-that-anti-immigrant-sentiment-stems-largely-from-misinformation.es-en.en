Migration &apos;s Hall of Mirrors 
LONDON - On both sides of the Atlantic , anti-immigrant politics are undermining democracies and damaging lives . 
Far-right nationalist parties are gaining traction in Europe , while millions of undocumented migrants suffer in the shadows . 
In the United States , President Barack Obama , concerned about his party &apos;s ability to retain control of the Senate , has decided to put off immigration reform until after the election in November . 
Yet that may be the wrong approach . 
A new public-opinion survey by the German Marshall Fund ( GMF ) reveals that anti-immigrant sentiment stems largely from misinformation , not entrenched animus . 
The most important finding of the GMF &apos;s Transatlantic Trends survey is that concern about immigrants falls sharply when people are given even the most basic facts . 
For example , when asked if there are too many immigrants in their country , 38 % of the Americans surveyed agreed . 
The same was true in country after country . 
In the United Kingdom , 54 % of respondents said that there were too many immigrants ; that number fell to 31 % among those who were given the facts about foreigners . 
In Greece , 58 % became 27 % ; 
Italy went from 44 % to 22 % ; and so on . 
The only countries without such a gap were those with either very little immigration , like Poland , or those with a more open , informed , and progressive political debate about immigration , like Sweden and Germany . 
Other surveys have exposed extraordinary inaccuracies in perceptions of migrants . 
In many developed countries , for example , the public believes that there are three times as many immigrants residing in their country as there really are . 
The average Briton believes that 34 % of UK residents are foreigners ; the true number is just 11 % . 
Such distortions disappear in countries where migration challenges are confronted openly , discussed reasonably , and addressed with conviction . 
The average Swede , for example , believes that 18 % of the country &apos;s population is composed of migrants ; the actual number is close to 13 % . 
As a result , populism in these societies is not on the rise , and mainstream politicians do not vilify minorities and migrants . 
This constitutes strong evidence that reality-based debate and policymaking can fundamentally transform the negative political dynamics generated by migration . 
It also suggests that , by failing to engage voters on the reality of migration , mainstream politicians in Europe are manufacturing support for extremist parties . 
This self-inflicted political wound is extremely dangerous . 
The Transatlantic Trends survey also shows that the American public is not worried about legal migration , while around two-thirds believe that the children of immigrants are being well integrated into their communities . 
These findings should embolden policymakers to be more proactive in designing pathways for legal migration and policies to integrate migrants . 
Even when it comes to illegal immigrants , though US citizens express concern , they are more reasonable than their political leaders about how to solve the problem . 
A plurality of Americans surveyed by the GMF , for example , said that illegal immigrants should be allowed to obtain legal status . 
A deliberative approach to engaging the public on other aspects of migration also could help quell anti-migrant sentiment . 
For example , recent research in several countries shows that immigrants as a whole contribute more economically to their communities than they take from them . 
In Germany , a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation , to be released next month , shows that the net fiscal contribution per migrant amounted to â‚¬ 3,300 ( $ 4,260 ) in 2012 . 
Such data upend the conventional wisdom that migrants are a drain on public services . 
Of course , migration creates real challenges for communities and can lead to job losses and lower wages for native workers . 
Implementing vigorous retraining policies , for example , would be a better way to counter these adverse effects than calling for mass deportations . 
This is one reason why labor unions , which once opposed immigration across the board , are now far more supportive of measures that would legalize undocumented workers and create more pathways for migration . 
Informed public debate is the sine qua non of a democratic polity . 
In its absence , bias and populism prevail . 
The immigration debate will never be an easy one , but it can become less tendentious and more deliberative if its participants consider the facts .
