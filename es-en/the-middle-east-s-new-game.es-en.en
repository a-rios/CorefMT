The Middle East &apos;s New Game 
MADRID - Whether or not the Arab Spring will usher in credible democracies across the Arab world remains uncertain . 
But , while the dust has not yet settled after months of turmoil in Tunis , Cairo , and elsewhere , the Arab revolts have already had a massive impact on the strategic structure of the Middle East . 
Until recently , the region was divided into two camps : an incoherent and weakened moderate Arab alignment , and an &quot; Axis of Resistance , &quot; formed by Iran , Syria , Hamas , and Hezbollah , against American and Israeli designs for the region . 
Driven by a strategy of &quot; zero problems &quot; with its neighbors , &quot; Turkey &apos;s quest for a leading role in Middle East politics brought it closer to Syria and Iran . 
The Arab Spring exposed the fragile foundations upon which the entire Axis of Resistance was built , and has pushed it to the brink of collapse . 
The first to opt out was Hamas . 
Fearful of the consequences of the demise of its patrons in Damascus , Hamas tactically withdrew from the Axis and let Egypt lead it towards reconciliation with the pro-Western Palestinian Authority on terms that it had refused under former Egyptian Hosni Mubarak . 
Turkey is genuinely interested in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and in a regional system of peace and security , whereas Iran and Hezbollah are bent on derailing both in order to deny Israel the kind of peace with the Arab world that would end up isolating Iran . 
Notwithstanding its bitter conflict with Israel , Turkey , unlike Iran , is not an unconditional enemy of the Jewish state , and would not discard an accommodation with Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s government . 
Indeed , talks are now under way between the parties to restore more normal relations . 
Nor do Iran and Turkey share a common vision with regard to the strategically sensitive Gulf region . 
Turkey , whose 2008 treaty with the Gulf Cooperation Council made it a strategic partner of the region &apos;s monarchies , was unequivocally assertive during the Bahrain crisis in warning Iran to cease its subversive intrusion into the region &apos;s affairs . 
The stability and territorial integrity of the Gulf States is a strategic priority for Turkey ; that is clearly not the case for Iran . 
Similarly , when it comes to Lebanon , Turkey certainly does not share Iran &apos;s concern about the possible interruption of Hezbollah &apos;s lifeline should the Syrian regime collapse . 
And Iran and Syria , for their part , have never been too happy with Prime Minister &apos;s Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan &apos;s aspirations to act as a broker in Lebanon , which they consider to be their strategic backyard . 
This explains Hezbollah &apos;s rejection of a Turkish-Qatari initiative to act as mediators after the fall of Saad Hariri &apos;s Lebanese government in January 2011 . 
Turkey &apos;s commitment to peaceful democratic transitions in the Arab world has alienated it from its Syrian ally , Bashar al-Assad - with whose repressive practices both Iran and Hezbollah are fully complicit - and is now driving Iran and Turkey even further apart . 
Iran is working to ensure that free elections open the way to truly Islamic regimes in the Arab world , while Turkey assumes that its own political brand , a synthesis of Islam and democracy with secular values , should ultimately prevail . 
The rift reflects not only ideological differences , but also disagreement about the objective of regime change . 
Iran expects the new regimes to rally behind it in radically changing the region &apos;s strategic equation through a policy of confrontation with the US and Israel , while Turkey expects the new regimes to follow constructive policies of peace and security . 
Instability and confusion in the Arab world serve the agenda of a radically non-status quo power such as Iran . 
Instability has the potential to keep oil prices high , benefiting the Iranian economy . 
Moreover , with the West focused on the formidable challenges posed by the Arab revolts , Iran finds it easier to divert the world &apos;s attention from its nuclear program , and to circumvent the international sanctions regime designed to curtail its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons . 
Turkey &apos;s foreign policy , unlike Iran &apos;s , needs a stable environment to prosper . 
Instability undermines its entire regional vision ; it certainly challenges its idealistic strategy of &quot; zero problems . &quot; 
It also puts at risk Turkey &apos;s robust economic penetration into Arab markets . 
And , with the Kurdish problem as alive as ever , the Turks also know only too well that upheavals in neighboring countries can spill over into Turkey itself . 
It is on the Syrian question that the differences between Turkey and Iran are especially apparent . 
Turkey has practically resigned itself to the inevitable demise of Syria &apos;s repressive Baath regime . 
For Iran and its Hezbollah clients , the fall of Assad would be nothing short of a calamity - one with far-reaching consequences . 
Devoid of its Syrian alliance and estranged from Turkey , Iran would become an isolated revolutionary power whose fanatical brand of Islam is repellent to most Arab societies . 
Turkey was wrong to try to gain wider influence in the Middle East by working with the region &apos;s revolutionary forces.It is far wiser for Turkey to make common cause with the region &apos;s responsible forces . 
A democratic Egypt would certainly be a more reliable partner . 
Egypt has already managed to draw Hamas away from Syria into an inter-Palestinian reconciliation . 
Instead of competing for the role of regional power broker , as was the case under Mubarak , Egypt can join forces with Turkey - whose officials the Egyptians wisely invited to the ceremony that sealed the Palestinian reconciliation - to promote an Israeli-Arab peace and a civilized security system in the Middle East .
