The Inspectors Have Failed Us 
On February 5 th Colin Powell will present America &apos;s case against Iraq to the UN Security Council . 
His appearance will come a week after Hans Blix and Mohammed al-Baradei - the chiefs of the UN inspectors - demonstrated their inability to fulfill their mandate . 
Khidhir Hamza , a former advisor to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Organization and former Director of Iraq &apos;s Nuclear Weapons Program , explains how and why the UN inspections failed . 
Faced with reports of their failure to cooperate with the heads of the two UN inspection teams , the Iraqis have abandoned their description of the inspectors as independent professionals . 
Amir Rashid , the former head of the Iraqi military industry and an adviser to Saddam Hussein , now openly describes the inspectors as spies . 
It was this Iraqi attitude of implacable hostility that , in 1998 , forced UN weapons inspectors to leave the country , leading to today &apos;s confrontation . 
In view of that precedent , and what has happened in Iraq since Blix and al-Baradei have filed reports that contain some troubling surprises . 
The UN &apos;s Resolution 1441 requires Iraqi disarmament in terms of actual weapons of mass destruction and the ability to make them . 
This is where the inspectors have focused so far . 
But Resolution 1441 also empowers the inspectors to gather intelligence about Iraq &apos;s weapons and weapon-making capabilities through in-depth interviews with Iraqi experts , either inside or outside the country , but certainly without Iraqi-government minders present . 
To assure the experts that they could talk without fear , the Resolution gave the inspectors the authority to bring entire families out of the country . 
Control of access to Iraqi experts has always been essential to uncovering the truth about weapons and weapon programs . 
Without independent access , the Iraqi government retains total control of the information supplied to inspectors . 
In fact , after inspections were suspended in 1998 , Iraq worked tirelessly to build an impenetrable wall around the people responsible for its weapons programs . 
The small community of Iraqi experts was put under a harsh security regime . 
Some have been murdered ; others have been imprisoned . 
Security officials keep constant tabs on the whereabouts of family members . 
For the most part , these measures have succeeded . 
The outside world currently knows little about the inner workings of the Iraqi weapons program . 
Since 1998 , there has not been a single defection from the upper levels of the program , despite low pay and substandard living conditions - deteriorating medical care , erratic electricity supplies , and a ban on travel . 
Incredibly , neither Blix nor al-Baradei pressed for any interviews with scientists outside Iraq , although they are fully aware that this is the only safe way to conduct effective inquiries . 
Both men understood disarmament as simply the removal of weapons and equipment , if and when they were found . 
Understanding the system that produces these weapons , and finding the means to disable this system , has not been on their agenda . 
As a result , Iraq &apos;s refusal to cooperate in making the scientists available for interviews - the key to its entire strategy of denial - was mentioned only in passing at the end of the inspectors &apos; reports . 
The fact that this entire exercise has told us nothing about Iraq &apos;s weapons infrastructure has simply been filed away for future reference . 
The inspectors even managed to falter when they stumbled across hard evidence of Iraqi cheating . 
For example , the inspectors found a dozen chemical weapons warheads in mint condition in a relatively new warehouse , but minimized the significance of their discovery by arguing that the warheads were empty . 
Never mind that storing warheads in this way is simply an elementary protocol of proper handling procedures . 
Storing warheads that are filled with chemicals would be dangerous and wasteful . 
Because the chemicals are likely to corrode the warhead over time , extended storage has a high probability of leakage and degradation of the weapon . 
But Blix dismissed this as &quot; not a serious problem , &quot; and did not require Iraq to produce the poisons to be used to arm the warheads . 
Al-Baradei was even more accommodating . 
Relying solely on radiation detection equipment at various sites and some environmental samples - but without interviewing a single scientist in private , he declared that there was no evidence that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program . 
This is a lamentable repeat of the International Atomic Energy Agency &apos;s performance in both 1990 and 1994 , when , under the leadership of Blix , Iraq was given a clean bill of health on nuclear weapons development . 
Only after the defection of Hussein Kamel , Saddam &apos;s son-in-law and head of the Iraqi military industry , did Blix get the clues to uncover the actual workings of Iraq &apos;s ambitious program . 
Most shockingly , the inspector &apos;s reports failed to state clearly and unequivocally that Iraq remains unwilling to disarm . 
Neither Blix nor al-Baradei was willing to suspend the inspections until Iraq provides forthright , open cooperation . 
These gentlemen inspectors fail to understand a fundamental point : to disarm a thuggish , murderous regime you need strict enforcement . 
Any concession will be interpreted as weakness . 
Iraq &apos;s government knows exactly what it needs to do to hide its weapons of mass destruction . 
Unfortunately , the inspectors &apos; reports make one thing clear : they will not take the bold steps that the international community needs to expose Iraqi cheating .
