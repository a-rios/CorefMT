Science and the Meaning of Life 
Most religions embrace and promote certain notions about the meaning of life , offering the faithful reasons why we and all other organisms exist . 
Indeed , perhaps the fundamental definition of religious faith is the believe that life serves a ( divine ) purpose . 
Science , however , has always given a resounding &quot; no &quot; to the question &quot; Does life have a higher meaning ? &quot; 
At least until now . 
In a series of lectures and in a forthcoming book , science writers Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan argue that even from a scientific perspective , life does serve a purpose , and thus does have a meaning that transcends the self . 
They arrived at this conclusion when trying to reconcile a contradiction that has long puzzled those who study both biology and physics . 
Living organisms obviously embody arrangements of matter into complex structures . 
They transform chemicals and , in an orderly fashion , transport and store them in purposeful ways . 
Above the level of individual organisms , they form societies and ecosystems . 
All of us are familiar with these fundamental biological notions , and we are all part of these processes . 
Order seems to be the name of the biological game , and evolution leads to more complex organisms and more organized structures . 
This is , of course , at odds with one of the fundamental principles of physics : the second law of thermodynamics , which holds that entropy - the degradation of all matter and energy in the universe to an ultimate state of inert uniformity - increases as a result of each and every process . 
The more the world develops the more disorder there will be . 
Physics even accepts the idea that entropy defines the direction of time . 
In the end everything will be broken down and randomly distributed . 
How do Schneider and Sagan reconcile the contradiction between what appears true of life - that it organizes matter into increasingly complex creatures and structures - and the notion that disorder should increase and order should be lost ? 
Equally important , how can science see any meaning of life in the reconciliation of that apparent contradiction ? 
The bottom line is that the second law of thermodynamics rules and that the existence of life helps increase entropy . 
In other words , life promotes disorder . 
Some might think that this could be true only if the logical end of evolution and intelligent life were to be a nuclear explosion that pulverized Earth . 
But that is not what Schneider and Sagan mean . 
Instead , they make a distinction between matter and energy and say that matter organized in structures disseminates energy gradients faster than randomly distributed matter . 
As one example , they consider a phenomenon of which beer drinkers have long been aware . 
If you want to empty a bottle of water ( or beer ) and turn it upside down , the water will come out in uneven glugs . 
If you spin the bottle and create an eddy inside it , the water will flow out much faster and more smoothly . 
The eddy in the bottle is a structure in the water . 
Water running down is matter losing its potential energy . 
The structure speeds up the dissemination of the energy gradient . 
Similarly , on a hot day , the air in a forest is cooler than over adjacent bare lands , thanks to evaporation and transpiration in the trees . 
The energy gradient , in this case that of heat , is disseminated more effectively by the structure of the forest and the life within it . 
The more complex the structure the more effective is the energy dissemination . 
Populations are better in this respect than single individuals ; ecosystems even more so , and most effective of all - so far - are human high-tech societies . 
Thus , goes the argument , the second law of thermodynamics is not contrary to the existence of life ; rather , it is the cause of life . 
That law drives evolution to higher levels of complexity and to more sophisticated societies and technologies for the sole purpose of disseminating energy gradients . 
So life , at long last , has a higher meaning in the eyes of science - even if serving the second law of thermodynamics is not exactly what the religiously faithful had in mind .
