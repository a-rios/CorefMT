The Perfect Storm of a Global Recession 
NEW YORK - The probability is growing that the global economy - not just the United States - will experience a serious recession . 
Recent developments suggest that all G7 economies are already in recession or close to tipping into one . 
Other advanced economies or emerging markets ( the rest of the euro zone ; 
When they reach it , there will be a sharp slowdown in the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) and other emerging markets . 
This looming global recession is being fed by several factors : the collapse of housing bubbles in the US , United Kingdom , Spain , Ireland and other euro-zone members ; punctured credit bubbles where money and credit was too easy for too long ; the severe credit and liquidity crunch following the US mortgage crisis ; the negative wealth and investment effects of falling stock markets ( already down by more than 20 % globally ) ; the global effects via trade links of the recession in the US ( which still counts for about 30 % of global GDP ) ; the US dollar &apos;s weakness , which reduces American trading partners &quot; competitiveness ; and the stagflationary effects of high oil and commodity prices , which are forcing central banks to increase interest rates to fight inflation at a time when there are severe downside risks to growth and financial stability . 
Official data suggest that the US economy entered into a recession in the first quarter of this year . 
The economy rebounded - in a double-dip , W-shaped recession - in the second quarter , boosted by the temporary effects on consumption of $ 100 billion in tax rebates . 
But those effects will fade by late summer . 
The UK , Spain , and Ireland are experiencing similar developments , with housing bubbles deflating and excessive consumer debt undercutting retail sales , thus leading to recession . 
Even in Italy , France , Greece , Portugal , Iceland , and the Baltic states , frothy housing markets are starting to slacken . 
Small wonder , then , that production , sales , and consumer and business confidence are falling throughout the euro zone . 
Elsewhere , Japan is contracting , too . 
Japan used to grow modestly for two reasons : strong exports to the US and a weak yen . 
Now , exports to the US are falling while the yen has strengthened . 
Moreover , high oil prices in a country that imports all of its oil needs , together with falling business profitability and confidence , are pushing Japan into a recession . 
The last of the G7 economies , Canada , should have benefited from high energy and commodity prices , but its GDP shrank in the first quarter , owing to the contracting US economy . 
Indeed , three quarters of Canada &apos;s exports go to the US , while foreign demand accounts for a quarter of its GDP . 
So every G7 economy is now headed toward recession . 
Other smaller economies ( mostly the new members of the EU , which all have large current-account deficits ) risk a sudden reversal of capital inflows ; this may already be occurring in Latvia and Estonia , as well as in Iceland and New Zealand . 
This G7 recession will lead to a sharp growth slowdown in emerging markets and likely tip the overall global economy into a recession . 
Those economies that are dependent on exports to the US and Europe and that have large current-account surpluses ( China , most of Asia , and most other emerging markets ) will suffer from the G7 recession . 
Those with large current-account deficits ( India , South Africa , and more than 20 economies in East Europe from the Baltics to Turkey ) may suffer from the global credit crunch . 
Commodity exporters ( Russia , Brazil , and others in the Middle East , Asia , Africa , and Latin America ) will suffer as the G7 recession and global slowdown drive down energy and other commodity prices by as much as 30 % . 
Countries that allowed their currencies to appreciate relative to the dollar will experience a sharp slowdown in export growth . 
Those experiencing rising and now double-digit inflation will have to raise interest rates , while other high-inflation countries will lose export competitiveness . 
Falling oil and commodity prices - already down 15 % from their peaks - will somewhat reduce stagflationary forces in the global economy , yet inflation is becoming more entrenched via a vicious circle of rising prices , wages , and costs . 
This will constrain the ability of central banks to respond to the downside risks to growth . 
In advanced economies , however , inflation will become less of a problem for central banks by the end of this year , as slack in product markets reduces firms &quot; pricing power and higher unemployment constrains wage growth . 
To be sure , all G7 central banks are worried about the temporary rise in headline inflation , and all are threatening to hike interest rates . 
Nevertheless , the risk of a severe recession - and of a serious banking and financial crisis - will ultimately force all G7 central banks to cut rates . 
The problem is that , especially outside the US , this monetary loosening will occur only when the G7 and global recession become entrenched . 
Thus , the policy response will be too little , and will come too late , to prevent it .
