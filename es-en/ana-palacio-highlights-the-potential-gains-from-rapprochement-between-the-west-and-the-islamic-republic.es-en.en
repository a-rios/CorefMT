Bringing Iran in from the Cold 
MADRID - Rapprochement between Iran and the West has long been a &quot; white whale &quot; of global politics . 
But it increasingly appears that the world may be on the verge of a new era , characterized by a wary yet crucial collaboration between countries - particularly Iran and the United States - that had been irreconcilable since Iran &apos;s Islamic Revolution in 1979 . 
The imperative for such cooperation drove last month &apos;s Bergedorf Round Table , organized by the KÃ¶rber Foundation in conjunction with the

With countries across the Middle East crumbling and territorial sovereignty disintegrating - most notably in Iraq - this effort could not be timelier . 
To reverse the region &apos;s slide into chaos , it needs strong stabilizing forces that can underpin coordinated action aimed at curtailing sectarian violence . 
Here , Iran has a key role to play . 
Beyond its historical and cultural depth , which gives it a certain authority in the Middle East , Iran has one of the region &apos;s few functioning governments capable of responding to geopolitical developments . 
The problem is that Iran has consistently squandered its leadership potential , choosing instead to act as a spoiler , especially through the use of proxy armies . 
This disruptive tendency reinforces the need for collaboration , underpinned by strong incentives for Iran to maintain a constructive , moderate foreign policy . 
To this end , the nuclear negotiations between Iran and the E3 + 3 ( France , Germany , and the UK plus China , Russia , and the US ) are an important first step . 
Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions have long posed a major security threat in the Middle East , as they raise the risk of preemptive military action by Israel or the US and , perhaps even more harrowing , of a regional arms race with the Gulf states and Turkey . 
Though fragmentation and sectarian violence have recently become a more urgent danger , the risks associated with Iran &apos;s emergence as a nuclear power should not be underestimated . 
Further underlying the significance of the current talks are Iran &apos;s internal political dynamics . 
If Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is unable to offer citizens concrete economic returns on his engagement with the West - especially loosened international sanctions - by next year &apos;s parliamentary election , hardliners will recapture their dominance over Iran &apos;s foreign policy . 
Given this , the West has finally found in Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif motivated - and ostensibly effective - interlocutors . 
Perhaps the most important motivation for the E3 + 3 negotiations is that resolving Iran &apos;s nuclear status has become a sine qua non for bringing the country back into the fold of the international community . 
Iran cannot play a stabilizing role in the Middle East as a pariah state . 
This is not to say that negotiators should pursue a deal at any cost . 
A weak agreement that lacks adequate verification mechanisms and leaves Iran with sufficient enrichment capacity for short-term weapon development would do more harm than good . 
Beyond stoking Israeli security fears and fueling increased opposition from an already skeptical US Congress , such a pact would strengthen the position of Iran &apos;s most obstructionist elements , all but eliminating the possibility of constructive future engagement . 
Reaching an effective , fair agreement will undoubtedly be difficult ; but there is reason to believe that it is possible . 
The current round of talks has produced some progress on one of the issue &apos;s two major sticking points : the heavy-water reactor at Arak . 
The other key issue , centrifuges , is more problematic . 
But alternative metrics - for example , focusing on overall production volume , instead of the number of centrifuges - together with robust monitoring guarantees , could facilitate an agreement . 
With the nuclear issue resolved , Western leaders could advance cooperation with Iran in other critical areas - beginning with security and stability in the Middle East . 
Of course , Iran &apos;s involvement in this effort , while important , would not be sufficient to stop the current carnage . 
Given the sectarian nature of regional conflicts - for which the Iranian authorities bear a heavy responsibility - engagement with Iran must be conducted within a broader framework of regional cooperation , in particular with the Gulf states . 
Given that the US and Europe have neither the appetite nor the wherewithal to respond effectively to the cataclysmic developments in the Middle East , solutions will need to come , at least partly , from countries with strong influence on the ground . 
But , in pursuing collaboration with countries like Iran , Western leaders must remain vigilant , and avoid allowing a sense of urgency to overwhelm their regard for these regimes &quot; disruptive potential . 
Bearing in mind that caveat , the potential benefits of Western engagement with Iran cannot be overstated . 
Over the coming weeks , the US and the EU will have the opportunity to make important strides toward a more stable , secure Middle East - an outcome that would benefit the entire world .
