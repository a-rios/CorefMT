Europe Is Blocking Russia 
Russia &apos;s political and strategic accommodation with the West continues apace . 
Day by day , relations with NATO grow stronger . 
The new orientation is irrevocable . 
But despite the price that President Putin is paying at home for his pro-Western policies - which are not nearly as popular in Russia as they are in the West - scant economic rewards , particularly from the European Union , have appeared . 
Europe , indeed , seems to be in no hurry to give Russia improved access to its markets . 
European Commission President Romano Prodi confirmed Russia &apos;s status as a &quot; market economy &quot; at last May &apos;s EU-Russia summit , a move that should have improved Russia &apos;s access to European markets . 
But it now seems unlikely that individual EU member states will approve this designation by September 18 th , which they must if it is to enter into force . 
Instead of opening the door , the EU seems determined to find covert ways to close its markets to Russian goods . 
Since May , the EU commission on trade policy has been preparing strict new rules to manage Russia &apos;s exports to the Union . 
These new regulations may turn the promise heralded by Russia being accorded &quot; market economy status &quot; into a mere formality that will not increase Russia &apos;s access to the EU market by a single iota . 
Among the tactics the EU is using to retard Russian trade are numerous antidumping investigations aimed at Russian companies . 
These probes , which have the effect of blocking exports from targeted firms , cost Russian businesses $ 1.3 billion a year in lost exports - a huge loss in an economy that is hurting as much as Russia is . 
The EU &apos;s trade regulators argue that they have the right - and the obligation - to initiate antidumping investigations if they suspect that a state , say , regulates prices for energy carriers in a way that subsidizes domestic firms . 
If they find Russia &quot; guilty &quot; of subsidizing its industry through low-cost energy , they can deem Russian goods as &quot; dumped &quot; and impose trade restrictions . 
This is a blatantly hypocritical stance , given the regulation of energy that goes on within the EU - say , in France . 
For Russia to prove that it does not use regulated energy prices as hidden industrial subsidies , it will have to make its case using international accounting standards . 
Or so the EU demands . 
But Russia &apos;s accounting standards - no surprise - have not yet reached international standards . 
Implementing such standards in Russia is beyond the capacity of most businesses , something that should be self-evident , given how new modern businesses practices are to the country . 
True , these EU requirements were not designed simply to frustrate Russia . 
They are applicable to all market economies that trade with it . 
But the EU is using its rules and investigative procedures in ways specifically aimed at Russian businesses . 
Besides , given the stories of rampant corruption in accounting practices in the West nowadays , the EU should be more understanding . 
The Enron and Worldcom scandals , after all , occurred in countries with long histories as market economies . 
Although it is beginning to wean companies off the practice , Russia does indeed sell energy cheaply to people and industries that became addicted to subsidized energy under socialism . 
Russia has also failed to establish international accounting standards across its economy . 
But Russia has repeatedly discussed the reasons for these problems with EU officials , and has pointed out the reforms now underway . 
Change cannot occur overnight . 
But even when all the reforms are enacted , Russian energy prices will remain cheaper than in Europe . 
This reflects Russia &apos;s natural advantage as an energy producer . 
The EU seems to want to penalize Russia for its natural wealth . 
We have rich reserves of gas and coal . 
We have the great resources of Siberia . 
We have hydroelectric power plants . 
We produce cheap electric energy . 
To force Russia to increase energy prices to EU levels is as ridiculous as making China sell rice to its people at world prices . 
The EU &apos;s emerging anti-Russian trade policy is not an antidumping policy ; it is outright protectionism . 
Moreover , European companies are not weak . 
What , exactly , are they so afraid of ? 
Russia is not strong enough to sink any part of the European market . 
Europe &apos;s national political leaders , who so often proclaim their joy at growing closeness to Russia , must halt the efforts of those in the EU Commission who seek to sabotage EU / Russia trade relations . 
Meanwhile , Russia must mobilize its own diplomats to make the case , publicly and privately in all the EU capitals , for greater access to EU markets . 
Europeans who want to develop relations with Russia and the majority of businessmen - European and Russian - with interests in greater trade must also be induced to lobby in favor of greater openness . 
All of this needs to be done fast , by September 18 th . 
Otherwise , Russians will come to view being accorded &quot; market economy &quot; status as just another broken promise on the part of the West .
