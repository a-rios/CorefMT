The Banality of Abu Ghraib 
As more images of debased Iraqi detainees ricochet around the world , many viewers are as bewildered as they are outraged . 
How could ordinary American soldiers , whether they were following orders or acting on their own , appear so untroubled , even exhilarated by their brutish conduct ? 
To be sure , over-eager military-intelligence interrogators , as well as the Bush Administration &apos;s high-handed attitude toward international law , helped precipitate the crisis . 
But few commentators have focused enough attention on the site of this macabre theatre - not a battlefield , but a prison . 
Prison experts are the least surprised by the grotesque reports filtering out of Abu Ghraib . 
They recognize that prisons , as uniquely divisive and authoritarian institutions , regularly give rise to behaviors that appear depraved to the wider world but come to seem acceptable - even normal - behind bars . 
Indeed , some of the most publicized prison scandals have erupted in the United States , which incarcerates more people in absolute and per capita terms than any other country . 
Compared to Saddam Hussein &apos;s murderous old regime at Abu Ghraib , of course , American prisons are relatively well managed . 
But as mandatory sentencing rules have landed more and more Americans behind bars , incidents that bear a disquieting resemblance to the degenerate cruelties photographed in Iraq have come increasingly to light . 
The connection is no accident . 
Some of the US scandals tie American prison personnel directly to Abu Ghraib . 
In Virginia , for instance , human rights advocates report that inmates at two &quot; supermax &quot; prisons have been hooded and subjected to &quot; excessive and malicious use of force by prison staff , &quot; often involving electric shock devices and rubber bullets . 
John J. Armstrong , now the assistant director of operations for US prisons in Iraq , resigned from his previous post when he was named in two wrongful death lawsuits at one of those prisons . 
Sergeant Ivan Frederick , the man directly in charge of the infamous Abu Ghraib &quot; hard site , &quot; previously worked as a Virginia corrections officer . 
In Pennsylvania , a 1998 inquiry into a supermax prison notorious for racist guards revealed videotapes of routine beatings and elaborate rituals of humiliation . 
Specialist Charles A. Graner , identified as a ringleader in the Abu Ghraib depravity , has worked at that prison since 1996 . 
Some of the worst abuses have surfaced in Texas , America &apos;s death penalty capital and home to more prisoners than Germany , France , Belgium , and the Netherlands combined . 
When George W. Bush was governor , a federal judge ruled that the state &apos;s entire penal system was pervaded by a &quot; culture of sadistic and malicious violence . &quot; 
Texas prison guards regularly rely on excessive force , the judge concluded , officials ignore sexual enslavement , and the state &apos;s isolation units function as &quot; virtual incubators of psychoses . &quot; 
Despite this appalling record , the US occupation authorities in Iraq appointed a former director of the Texas prison system , Lane McCotter , to help set up operations at Abu Ghraib in May 2003 . 
Two months earlier , McCotter &apos;s private prison company was cited by the US Justice Department for lax supervision and mistreatment of inmates at a New Mexico jail . 
Before that , McCotter led Utah &apos;s corrections department , but was forced to resign after the death of a schizophrenic inmate who had been stripped naked and strapped to a restraining chair for 16 hours . 
Of course , malicious imprisonment is by no means uniquely American . 
Even in Western Europe , which boasts the most rehabilitation-oriented penal systems , ghastly scandals periodically erupt . 
In 2000 , the chief physician at Paris &apos;s crumbling La Santé penitentiary , Veronique Vasseur , wrote a scathing exposé of &quot; virtually medieval &quot; conditions , complete with rat infestations , rotten food , extreme temperature variations , desperate self-mutilations , bullying , drug-dealing guards , and widespread sexual assault , often perpetrated by staff . 
According to a 2003 report , conditions have worsened since Dr. Vasseur &apos;s report , and France &apos;s overcrowded prisons are on a &quot; descent to hell . &quot; 
Particularly troubling is France &apos;s protracted incarceration of pre-trial suspects . 
In a country that regards itself as a civilized counterweight to belligerent American hegemony , nearly half of all prisoners have never been convicted of a crime . 
Why do prisons the world over concentrate such suffering and misconduct ? 
Partly by design . 
Prisons herd together angry , unruly people against their will . 
While the best facilities provide programs to help prisoners reintegrate into society , prisons also subject inmates to strict , often arbitrary discipline and depersonalizing rituals like numbering and strip searches - practices that foster more rage than reformation . 
On the other side of the bars , low-paid , often poorly trained corrections officers exercise near-absolute authority over an irascible population . 
In time , even the most well meaning come to regard their wards with cold detachment , if not dehumanizing contempt . 
Not all prisons succumb to these corrosive and polarizing dynamics . 
But penologists recognize that certain factors - including overcrowding , insufficient guard training , detached management , shoddy infrastructure , racial tensions , and lack of public accountability - make disaster almost inevitable . 
Many of these conditions pervade prisons worldwide . 
All of them were present in Iraq - in addition to the strains of combat and officially approved interrogation techniques that senior US officials now admit violated the Geneva Conventions . 
Rather than heeding warnings from the Red Cross and others , however , Pentagon officials let dangerous prison dynamics spin out of control . 
A flurry of investigations will now try to figure out what went disastrously awry at Abu Ghraib . 
But ensuring that &quot; justice is done , &quot; as US Secretary of State Colin Powell promised , means that judgment must not stop at the low-ranking soldiers who were foolish enough to pose for demented snapshots . 
More importantly , the abuses in Iraq demand careful scrutiny of detention practices not only there , but in our own communities as well .
