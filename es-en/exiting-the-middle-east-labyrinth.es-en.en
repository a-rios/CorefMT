Exiting the Middle East Labyrinth 
BERLIN - Two years have passed since Barack Obama was elected President of the United States . 
Much to his credit - and in contrast to his immediate predecessor - Obama tried , from his first day in office , to work towards a resolution of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians . 
Two years on , are good intentions the best that Obama &apos;s new policy has to offer ? 
After all , nothing of value has in fact resulted from them . 
Even worse , given that Obama &apos;s effort to enforce a permanent moratorium on new settlement construction in the West Bank has failed , is that direct negotiations between the conflicting parties have run aground . 
Good intentions count for little in life - and for less in politics . 
What matters , first and foremost , are results . 
President George W. Bush believed that he needed to take account of only one half of America &apos;s dual role in the Middle East , namely the alliance with Israel . 
He had no time for the second US role , that of pivotal peace mediator between Israelis and Palestinians , during his entire eight-year presidency . 
All his initiatives were intended only to pacify the international public . 
We all know where that led . 
From the start , Obama wanted to do things differently , pursuing an active Middle East policy . 
In both cases , standstill triumphed over progress . 
Given this , and both sides &quot; intransigence , many would withdraw and try to forget the conflict altogether . 
Most ominously , the window of opportunity for a two-state solution could close for good , because realities on the ground will no longer allow it . 
For Israelis , this would mean permanent occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank , and thus reckoning with an Arab majority , which would erode the foundations of their state - democracy and the rule of law - and thus its legitimacy . 
Such a development is the greatest threat that Israel faces in the medium term , which makes a two-state solution vital to its own interests . 
Of course , from Israeli leaders &quot; perspective , the status quo , with its absence of terror and missile strikes , is anything but negative . 
Moreover , the country &apos;s strategic situation is deteriorating with each passing year , because the global redistribution of power and influence from the West to the East can only weaken Israel &apos;s position . 
For the Palestinians , the situation is oppressive , and for Gaza it is an outright humanitarian disaster . 
They are internally divided between Fatah and Hamas , under Israeli occupation in East Jerusalem and the West Bank , isolated from the outside world in Gaza , hopeless in the region &apos;s refugee camps , and rebuffed by their Arab neighbors . 
In these circumstances , the loss of a two-state perspective would be a recipe for further indignities and deepening misery . 
But , if Israelis and Palestinians share a vital interest in a two-state solution , they have very different interests , and therefore mean very different things when referring to the same issues . 
For Israel , security is the top priority ; for Palestinians , what matters most is an end to Israeli occupation . 
Israel cannot afford a second Gaza in the West Bank and East Jerusalem ; for the Palestinians , a state with an ongoing Israeli military presence would be worthless . 
Perhaps Obama &apos;s central error was that an important but minor matter - stopping new settlements - was given central significance . 
An indefinite building freeze would lead to the immediate end of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s coalition government in Jerusalem , without giving Israel or Netanyahu anything tangible in return . 
It should have been clear that Netanyahu would not extend the freeze . 
The crucial question that the US must ask both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is whether they would be willing - here and now - to negotiate in earnest about the final status . 
If so , a way out of the seemingly irresolvable conflict between Israeli security and Palestinian statehood would open . 
The formula could run as follows : a comprehensive agreement about the final status now ( taking into account all open questions , including East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine ) ; implementation of the agreement in pre-defined steps over a longer period of time ; and monitoring of the process via a mechanism based on the presence on the ground of a third party ( led by the US ) .This would give Palestinians a guarantee of their state &apos;s borders , its capital , and the Israeli occupation &apos;s pre-defined endpoint . 
They could use the time , with international help , to build up effective state institutions , address economic development , and heal the rift between West Bank and Gaza . 
On this new and permanent basis , they may find a solution for the Palestinian refugees and advance the cause of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas . 
Israel would have a guarantee that its security would not be endangered by a final-status agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state , and that its withdrawal from the Palestinian territories would be gradual , over several years , and monitored on the ground by a third party . 
The country would then have clear , internationally recognized borders , enabling it to end permanently the conflict with its Arab neighbors . 
While the situation in the Middle East currently looks hopeless , a new attempt that focuses on the essential points , not on minor ones , deserves support . 
The alternative is the loss of the two-state solution and the perpetuation of a terrible - and terribly perilous - conflict .
