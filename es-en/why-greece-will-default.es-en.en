Why Greece Will Default 
CAMBRIDGE - Greece will default on its national debt . 
That default will be due in large part to its membership in the European Monetary Union . 
If it were not part of the euro system , Greece might not have gotten into its current predicament and , even if it had gotten into its current predicament , it could have avoided the need to default . 
Greece &apos;s default on its national debt need not mean an explicit refusal to make principal and interest payments when they come due . 
More likely would be an IMF-organized restructuring of the existing debt , swapping new bonds with lower principal and interest for existing bonds . 
The only way that Greece could avoid a default would be by cutting its future annual budget deficits to a level that foreign and domestic investors would be willing to finance on a voluntary basis . 
At a minimum , that would mean reducing the deficit to a level that stops the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio . 
To achieve that , the current deficit of 14 % of GDP would have to fall to 5 % of GDP or less . 
Reducing the budget deficit by 10 % of GDP would mean an enormous cut in government spending or a dramatic rise in tax revenue - or , more likely , both . 
Quite apart from the political difficulty of achieving this would be the very serious adverse effect on aggregate domestic demand , and therefore on production and employment . 
Greece &apos;s unemployment rate already is 10 % , and its GDP is already expected to fall at an annual rate of more than 4 % , pushing joblessness even higher . 
Depressing economic activity further through higher taxes and reduced government spending would cause offsetting reductions in tax revenue and offsetting increases in transfer payments to the unemployed . 
So every planned euro of deficit reduction delivers less than a euro of actual deficit reduction . 
There simply is no way around the arithmetic implied by the scale of deficit reduction and the accompanying economic decline : Greece &apos;s default on its debt is inevitable . 
Greece might have been able to avoid that outcome if it were not in the eurozone . 
If Greece still had its own currency , the authorities could devalue it while tightening fiscal policy . 
A devalued currency would increase exports and would cause Greek households and firms to substitute domestic products for imported goods . 
The increased demand for Greek goods and services would raise Greece &apos;s GDP , increasing tax revenue and reducing transfer payments . 
In short , fiscal consolidation would be both easier and less painful if Greece had its own monetary policy . 
Greece &apos;s membership in the eurozone was also a principal cause of its current large budget deficit . 
Because Greece has not had its own currency for more than a decade , there has been no market signal to warn Greece that its debt was growing unacceptably large . 
If Greece had remained outside the eurozone and retained the drachma , the large increased supply of Greek bonds would cause the drachma to decline and the interest rate on the bonds to rise . 
The substantial surge in the interest rate on Greek bonds relative to German bonds in the past few weeks shows that the market now regards such a default as increasingly likely . 
The combination of credits from the other eurozone countries and lending by the IMF may provide enough liquidity to stave off default for a while . 
In exchange for this liquidity support , Greece will be forced to accept painful fiscal tightening and falling GDP . 
In the end , Greece , the eurozone &apos;s other members , and Greece &apos;s creditors will have to accept that the country is insolvent and cannot service its existing debt . 
At that point , Greece will default .
