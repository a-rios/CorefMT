South Korea &apos;s Budding Femocracy 
TOKYO - This is a year of presidential elections worldwide , and the last to take place - on December 19 - will be in South Korea . 
That ballot , however , is already having an international impact , in part because South Korea &apos;s failure to ratify an important new intelligence-sharing treaty with Japan is widely seen as a result of campaign politics . 
But the election may well have a more positive impact on the region as a whole . 
On July 10 , the frontrunner , Park Geun-hye of the ruling Saenuri ( New Frontier ) Party , became the first to announce her candidacy . 
In addition to other opposition candidates , much attention has focused on Ahn Cheol-soo , Dean of the Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at Seoul National University , who is a successful entrepreneur and a charismatic figure for South Korea &apos;s young and independent voters . 
But it is Park who has so far stimulated the greatest interest . 
There is great anticipation among conservative voters , in particular , concerning her policy toward North Korea , a country that continues to be as unpredictable as ever . 
( Witness Kim Jong-un &apos;s sudden dismissal of senior military officer Ri Yong-ho , anointment of himself as a marshal , and revelation that he had married a woman first glimpsed when she accompanied him to a concert featuring appearances by Disney &apos;s Mickey and Minnie Mouse . ) 
So far , Park , sensing that the electorate trusts her foreign-policy instincts , has kept her North Korea cards close to her chest . 
For many South Koreans , Park is a tragic heroine . 
Both her mother and her father , President Park Chung-hee , were assassinated , in 1974 and 1979 , respectively . 
Indeed , her father was murdered by his own intelligence chief , KCIA Director Kim Jaegyu . 
Park avoided active politics for many years after her parents &quot; death , but later won a parliamentary seat . 
She has also served as a leader of the Saenuri Party ( formerly known as the Grand National Party ) . 
In 2006 , an assailant slashed her face as she was campaigning on behalf of the GNP &apos;s candidate in Seoul &apos;s mayoral election . 
But now the real battle begins . 
If elected , Park will become South Korea &apos;s first female president . 
Like Japan and other Asian countries , Korean society , which is underpinned by Confucian thought , has experienced little political participation by women , though that appears to be changing rapidly . 
In 2000 , only 5.9 % of the National Assembly &apos;s 299 members were women . 
In 2004 , however , women more than doubled their share , to 13 % , when 39 were elected from single-seat constituencies and through party-list proportional representation . 
According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) , that election pushed South Korea from 101st to 62nd place worldwide in terms of the proportion of female MPs , well ahead of 121st-ranked Japan . 
The increase in women MPs led not only to an increase in female cabinet members , but also to a variety of policies and institutional improvements aimed specifically at women . 
And , although South Korea has slipped to 80th place in the IPU &apos;s most recent rankings , the fall reflects subsequent growth in the proportion of female legislators in other countries . 
The main reason for the increase in the number of women MPs was the introduction of a quota system , according to which South Korea &apos;s political parties should ensure that 30 % of their candidates are women . 
The campaign-finance law was revised to provide additional government funding to parties that meet the quota , and to reduce the amount for parties that do not . 
As a result , more than half of the 56 members elected through proportional representation in 2004 were women . 
Moreover , 10 % of government funding to political parties is now used for the advancement of women in politics , with each party establishing institutions for training women MPs and candidates . 
Although the quota system is still a matter of constitutional debate in South Korea , years of effort by women &apos;s groups have made a significant contribution to boosting women &apos;s role in policymaking . 
The triumph of a female president would be an important symbolic and practical victory for all who have sought to establish a political environment that is hospitable to women . 
And it would provide a powerful example to other Asian countries - including my own - in which women have struggled to gain an electoral foothold .
