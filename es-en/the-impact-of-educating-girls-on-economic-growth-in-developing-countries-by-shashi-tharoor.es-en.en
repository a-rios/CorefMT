A World of Schoolgirls 
NEW DELHI - One of the more difficult questions I found myself being asked when I was a United Nations under-secretary-general , especially when addressing a general audience , was : &quot; What is the single most important thing that can be done to improve the world ? &quot; 
It &apos;s the kind of question that tends to bring out the bureaucrat in even the most direct of communicators , as one feels obliged to explain the complexity of the challenges confronting humanity : how no imperative can be singled out over other goals ; how the struggle for peace , the fight against poverty , and the battle to eradicate disease must all be waged side by side ; and so on - mind-numbingly . 
Then I learned to cast caution to the wind and venture an answer to this most impossible of questions . 
If I had to pick the one thing that we must do above all else , I now offer a two-word mantra : &quot; educate girls . &quot; 
It really is that simple . 
No action has been proven to do more for the human race than the education of female children . 
Scholarly studies and research projects have established what common sense might already have told us : if you educate a boy , you educate a person ; but if you educate a girl , you educate a family and benefit an entire community . 
The evidence is striking . 
Children of educated mothers consistently out-perform children with educated fathers and illiterate mothers . 
Given that , in general , children spend most of their time with their mothers , this is hardly surprising . 
A girl who has had more than six years of education is better equipped to seek and use medical advice , to immunize her children , and to be aware of the importance of sanitary practices , from boiling water to washing hands . 
A World Health Organization study established that &quot; in Africa , children of mothers who have received five years of education are 40 % more likely to live beyond the age of 5 . &quot; 
Moreover , a Yale University study showed that the heights and weights for newborn children of women with a basic education were consistently higher than those of babies born to uneducated women . 
A UNESCO project demonstrated that &quot; each additional year of a mother &apos;s schooling reduces the probability of the infant mortality rate by 5 % to 10 % &quot; 
The health advantages of education extend beyond childbirth and infant health . 
AIDS spreads twice as fast , a Zambian study shows , among uneducated girls than among those who have been to school . 
Educated girls marry later , and are less susceptible to abuse by older men . 
And educated women tend to have fewer children and space them more wisely , facilitating a higher level of care ; women with seven years &quot; education , according to one study , had 2-3 fewer children than women with no schooling . 
The World Bank , with its typical mathematical precision , has estimated that for every four years of education , fertility is reduced by about one birth per mother . 
The reason why the Indian state of Kerala &apos;s fertility rate is 1.7 per couple , whereas Bihar &apos;s is more than four , is that Kerala &apos;s women are educated and half of Bihar &apos;s are not . 
The greater the number of girls who go to secondary school , the Bank adds , the higher the country &apos;s per capita income growth . 
Moreover , women learn from other women , so uneducated women often emulate educated women &apos;s success . 
And women spend more of their income on their families , which men do not necessarily do ( rural toddy shops in India , after all , thrive on men &apos;s self-indulgent spending habits ) . 
And , when educated girls work in the fields , as so many in the developing world must , their schooling translates directly into increased agricultural productivity and to a decline in malnutrition . 
Educate a girl , and you benefit a community . 
I learned many of these details from my former colleague Catherine Bertini , a 2003 World Food Prize laureate for her tireless and effective work as head of the UN World Food Program . 
As she put it in her acceptance speech : &quot; If someone told you that , with just 12 years of investment of about $ 1 billion a year , you could , across the developing world , increase economic growth , decrease infant mortality , increase agricultural yields , improve maternal health , improve children &apos;s health and nutrition , increase the numbers of children - girls and boys - in school , slow down population growth , increase the number of men and women who can read and write , decrease the spread of AIDS , add new people to the work force , and be able to improve their wages without pushing others out of the work force , what would you say ? 
Such a deal ! 
What is it ? 
How can I sign up ? &quot; 
Sadly , the world is not yet rushing to &quot; sign up &quot; to the challenge of educating girls , who consistently lag behind boys in access to schooling throughout the developing world . 
An estimated 65 million girls around the world never see the inside of a classroom . 
Yet not educating them costs the world more than putting them through school . 
Certainly , there is no better answer . 
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan put it simply : &quot; No other policy is as likely to raise economic productivity , lower infant and maternal mortality , improve nutrition , promote health , including the prevention of HIV / AIDS , and increase the chances of education for the next generation . 
Let us invest in women and girls . &quot;
