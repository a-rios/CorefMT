Should Adult Sibling Incest Be a Crime ? 
PRINCETON - Last month , the German Ethics Council , a statutory body that reports to the Bundestag , recommended that sexual intercourse between adult siblings should cease to be a crime . 
The recommendation follows a 2012 decision by the European Court of Human Rights upholding the conviction of a Leipzig man for having a sexual relationship with his sister . 
The man has served several years in prison , owing to his refusal to abandon the relationship . 
( His sister was judged to be less responsible and was not jailed . ) 
Incest between adults is not a crime in all jurisdictions . 
In France , the offense was abolished when Napoleon introduced his new penal code in 1810 . 
Consensual adult incest is also not a crime in Belgium , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , Russia , China , Japan , South Korea , Turkey , CÃ´te d &apos;Ivoire , Brazil , Argentina , and several other Latin American countries . 
The Ethics Council took its investigation seriously . 
Its report ( currently available only in German ) begins with testimony from those in a forbidden relationship , particularly half-brothers and sisters who came to know each other only as adults . 
These couples describe the difficulties created by the criminalization of their relationship , including extortion demands and the threat of loss of custody of a child from a previous relationship . 
The report does not attempt to provide a definitive assessment of the ethics of consensual sexual relationships between siblings . 
Instead , it asks whether there is an adequate basis for the criminal law to prohibit such relationships . 
It points out that in no other situation are voluntary sexual relationships between people capable of self-determination prohibited . 
There is , the report argues , a need for a clear and convincing justification for intruding into this core area of private life . 
The report examines the grounds on which it might be claimed that this burden of justification has been met . 
The risk of genetically abnormal children is one such reason ; but , even if it were sufficient , it would justify only a prohibition that was both narrower and wider than the current prohibition on incest . 
The prohibition would be narrower , because it would apply only when children are possible : The Leipzig man whose case brought the issue to attention had a vasectomy in 2004 , but that did not affect his criminal liability . 
And the goal of avoiding genetic abnormalities would justify widening the prohibition to sexual relationships between all couples who are at high risk of having abnormal offspring . 
Given Germany &apos;s Nazi past , it is difficult for Germans today to treat the desirability of that goal as anything but permitting the state to determine who may reproduce . 
The Council also considered the need to protect family relationships . 
The report notes that incest between siblings is rare , not because it is a crime , but because being brought up together in a family or family-like environment ( including Israeli kibbutzim that rear unrelated children collectively ) tends to negate sexual attraction . 
The report does recognize the legitimacy of the objective of protecting the family , however , and makes use of it to limit the scope of its recommendation to sexual relations between adult siblings . 
Sexual relations between other close relatives , such as parents and their adult children are , the report argues , in a different category because of the different power relations between generations , and the greater potential for damage to other family relationships . 
The taboo against incest runs deep , as the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt demonstrated when he told experimental subjects about Julie and Mark , adult siblings who take a holiday together and decide to have sex , just to see what it would be like . 
In the story , Julie is already on the Pill , but Mark uses a condom , just to be safe . 
They both enjoy the experience , but decide not to do it again . 
It remains a secret that brings them even closer . 
Haidt then asked his subjects whether it was okay for Julie and Mark to have sex . 
Most said that it was not , but when Haidt asked them why , they offered reasons that were already excluded by the story - for example , the dangers of inbreeding , or the risk that their relationship would suffer . 
Perhaps not coincidentally , when a spokesperson for German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Christian Democrats was asked to comment on the Ethics Council &apos;s recommendation , she also said something completely beside the point , referring to the need to protect children . 
The report , however , made no recommendations about incest involving children , and some of those caught by the criminal law did not even know each other as children . 
When Haidt pointed out to his subjects that the reasons they had offered did not apply to the case , they often responded : &quot; I can &apos;t explain it , I just know it &apos;s wrong . &quot; 
Haidt refers to this as &quot; moral dumbfounding . &quot; 
In the case of the incest taboo , our response has an obvious evolutionary explanation . 
Even discussing that question has proved controversial . 
In Poland , a comment presenting the views of the German Ethics Council was posted online by Jan Hartman , a philosophy professor at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow . 
The university authorities described Hartman &apos;s statement as &quot; undermining the dignity of the profession of a university teacher &quot; and referred the matter to a disciplinary commission . 
In so quickly forgetting that the profession &apos;s dignity requires freedom of expression , a renowned university appears to have succumbed to instinct .
