Inconvenient Truths for Al Gore 
Cinemas everywhere will soon be showing former US Vice President Al Gore &apos;s film on global warming . 
&quot; An Inconvenient Truth &quot; has received rave reviews in America and Europe , and it will most likely gain a large worldwide audience . 
But , while the film is full of emotion and provocative images , it is short on rational arguments . 
&quot; An Inconvenient Truth &quot; makes three points : global warming is real ; it will be catastrophic ; and addressing it should be our top priority . 
Inconveniently for the film &apos;s producers , however , only the first statement is correct . 
While it &apos;s nice to see Gore bucking the trend in a nation where many influential people deny that global warming even exists , many of his apocalyptic claims are highly misleading . 
But his biggest error lies in suggesting that humanity has a moral imperative to act on climate change because we realize there is a problem . 
This seems na√Øve , even disingenuous . 
Preventable diseases like HIV , diarrhea , and malaria take 15 million lives each year . 
Malnutrition afflicts more than half the world &apos;s population . 
Eight hundred million people lack basic education . 
A billion don &apos;t have clean drinking water . 
In the face of these challenges , why should stopping climate change be our top priority ? 
Gore &apos;s attempt at an answer doesn &apos;t stand up to scrutiny . 
Gore shows that glaciers have receded for 50 years . 
Likewise , he considers Antarctica the canary in the coalmine , but again doesn &apos;t tell the full story . 
He presents pictures from the 2 % of Antarctica that is dramatically warming , while ignoring the 98 % that has largely cooled over the past 35 years . 
The UN climate panel estimates that Antarctica &apos;s snow mass will actually increase during this century . 
And , whereas Gore points to shrinking sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere , he fails to mention that ice in the Southern Hemisphere is increasing . 
The movie shows scary pictures of the consequences of the sea level rising 20 feet ( seven meters ) , flooding large parts of Florida , San Francisco , New York , Holland , Calcutta , Beijing , and Shanghai . 
Were realistic levels not dramatic enough ? 
The United Nations panel on climate change suggests a rise of only 1-2 feet during this century , compared to almost one foot in the last century . 
Similarly , Europe &apos;s deadly heat waves in 2003 lead Gore to conclude that climate change will mean more fatalities . 
But global warming would mean fewer deaths caused by cold temperatures , which in most of the developed world vastly outweigh deaths caused by heat . 
In the UK alone , it is estimated that the temperature increase would cause 2,000 extra heat deaths by 2050 , but result in 20,000 fewer cold deaths . 
Financial losses from weather events have increased dramatically over the past 45 years , which Gore attributes to global warming . 
But all or almost all of this increase comes from more people with more possessions living closer to harm &apos;s way . 
If all hurricanes had hit the US with today &apos;s demographics , the biggest damage would have been caused not by Katrina , but by a hurricane in 1926 . 
Allowing for changes in the number of people and their wealth , flood losses have actually decreased slightly . 
The movie invites viewers to conclude that global warming caused Hurricane Katrina , with Gore claiming that the warm Caribbean waters made the storm stronger . 
But when Katrina made landfall , it was not a catastrophic Category 5 hurricane ; it was a milder Category 3 . 
In fact , there is no scientific consensus that global warming makes hurricanes more destructive , as he claims . 
The author that Gore himself relies on says that it would be &quot; absurd to attribute the Katrina disaster to global warming . &quot; 
After presenting the case for the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change , Gore unveils his solution : the world should embrace the Kyoto Protocol , which aims to cut carbon emissions in the developed countries by 30 % by 2010 . 
But even if every nation signed up to Kyoto , it would merely postpone warming by six years in 2100 , at an annual cost of $ 150 billion . 
Kyoto would not have saved New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina . 
But improved levees and maintenance could have . 
While Gore was campaigning for Kyoto in the 1990 &quot; s , a better use of resources would have been to bolster hurricane defenses . 
Indeed , the real issue is using resources wisely . 
Kyoto won &apos;t stop developing countries from being hardest hit by climate change , for the simple reason that they have warmer climates and fewer resources . 
But these nations have pressing problems that we could readily solve . 
According to UN estimates , for $ 75 billion a year - half the cost of implementing the Kyoto Protocol - we could provide clean drinking water , sanitation , basic health care , and education to every single human being on Earth . 
Shouldn &apos;t that be a higher priority ? 
Recent hurricanes killed thousands in Haiti , and not in Florida , because Haiti is poor and cannot afford even basic preventive measures . 
Combating disease , hunger , and polluted water would bring immediate benefits to millions and allow poorer countries to increase productivity and break the cycle of poverty . 
At the climax of his movie , Gore argues that future generations will chastise us for not having committed ourselves to the Kyoto Protocol . 
More likely , they will wonder why , in a world overflowing with &quot; inconvenient truths , &quot; Gore focused on the one where we could achieve the least good for the highest cost .
