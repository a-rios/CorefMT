The Visible Hand of Economic Prosperity 
FRANKFURT - Germany has weathered the financial crisis much better than most of its neighbors . 
Regarded as the sick man of Europe as recently as 1999 , today the country boasts the continent &apos;s strongest economy , accounting for roughly a quarter of its exports . 
Its unemployment rate , at just below 5 % , is half the European average . 
The federal budget is balanced for the first time in a decade . 
But it would be a mistake to assume that Germany &apos;s economic performance vindicates its policymaking . 
In fact , Germany &apos;s current economic dominance has been built on a policy framework that stands in direct opposition to that championed by former Chancellor Ludwig Erhard , the father of its post-World War II &quot; economic miracle . &quot; 
In lieu of Erhard &apos;s so-called ordoliberalism - in which the state lays the groundwork for a functioning market economy by actively managing the legal environment - the economic strategy pursued by Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s government has been haphazard , driven more by political expediency than by any underlying philosophy . 
Germany would be wise not to take its economic success for granted . 
In a time of increasing economic and political uncertainty , Erhard &apos;s guiding principles are more important than ever . 
Indeed , Germany &apos;s policymakers seem to be stumbling from decision to decision . 
Instead of steering the economy , they are being driven by it , reacting with no clear sense of direction to the demands of the moment . 
The country &apos;s celebrated de-carbonization is putting its industry at risk . 
Collective bargaining , once left to economic actors , is becoming increasingly politicized . 
Changes in pension policy are boosting public spending and contributing to rising levels of debt . 
At the heart of Germany &apos;s troubles is the stubborn - and internationally widespread - idea that the economy is a large , clock-like mechanism into which the state can intervene without consequences . 
The increasing mathematization of economics in recent decades has abetted this development . 
The central weakness of democratic systems also contributes to the problem : The quest for votes favors the extension of social benefits and discourages unpopular measures that would put the economy on a more sustainable footing . 
As the German economist Herbert Giersch once put it , what is politically expedient is rarely economically beneficial . 
It is for this reason that a return to ordoliberalism is more important than ever . 
Erhard &apos;s objective was to counter political pragmatism and activism with an orderly vision of economic and social policy . 
The need to take a holistic view of the economy was self-evident . 
For today &apos;s social engineers and economists , this is no longer the case . 
Erhard &apos;s vision of a social market economy was a third way , an alternative to both large-scale state intervention and the risks of laissez-faire liberalism . 
Germany &apos;s historical experience had demonstrated that freedom without order led to chaos , and order without freedom resulted in coercion and the renunciation of democracy . 
Unguided capitalism undermined itself , according to Erhard , as monopolists cornered markets and captured the state . 
Human society simply does not follow the rules of a termite colony ; order must accommodate freedom and individuality . 
The continuing relevance of Erhard &apos;s ideas can be seen in the growing number of protest movements - strengthened by social networks - challenging the market economy and neoliberalism . 
Any increase in the market &apos;s perceived legitimacy brought about by the failure of communism was temporary at best . 
Market-oriented policies today are seen as cold and anti-social , especially in Western industrialized countries . 
The paternalistic welfare state is viewed as more humane , despite the loss of freedom and the financial distortions associated with it . 
Erhard was well aware of the tension between economic freedom and the democratic state . 
He and his followers never envisaged ordoliberalism as an unchangeable dogma , but rather as a model that could be adapted to new challenges . 
Erhard even attempted to adjust it to the sociopolitical changes of the 1960s , developing the concept of a &quot; formed society , &quot; whereby factionalism would be minimized and the state governed by consensus . 
But , given rising inequality and growing disenchantment with politics and political parties , it addresses questions that remain relevant for representative democracy today . 
But there can be no question that in today &apos;s globalized world , the economy - and perhaps politics as well - would benefit from the imposition of order . 
No political system capable of overcoming hardship and misery can be built without first realizing improvements in the economy &apos;s potential . 
Erhard &apos;s guiding principle was simple : there must be guiding principles . 
It is an idea that remains as important as ever - in Germany and beyond .
