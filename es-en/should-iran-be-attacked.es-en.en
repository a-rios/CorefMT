Should Iran Be Attacked ? 
President George W. Bush has said that Iran &apos;s development of nuclear weapons is unacceptable , and recent press accounts suggest that his administration is exploring preventive military options . 
In Iran , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has defied the diplomatic efforts of the European Union and others , using the nuclear issue to stir rally domestic support . 
Is it too late to prevent a showdown ? 
Iran claims that its nuclear program is aimed solely at peaceful uses , and that it has the right to develop uranium enrichment and other technologies as a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) . 
But it spent 18 years deceiving inspectors from the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency , leading some countries to argue that Iran destroyed its credibility and forfeited its rights to enrichment on its own soil . 
Russia has offered to provide nuclear enrichment and reprocessing services for the civilian reactor it is building in Iran . 
If Iran were interested solely in peaceful uses , the Russian offer or some other plan ( such as placing stocks of low enriched uranium in Iran ) could meet their needs . 
Iran &apos;s insistence on enrichment inside the country is widely attributed to its desire to produce highly enriched uranium for a bomb . 
Would an Iranian bomb really be so bad ? 
Some argue that it could become the basis of stable nuclear deterrence in the region , analogous to the nuclear standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War . 
But statements by Iranian leaders denying the Holocaust and urging the destruction of Israel have not only cost Iran support in Europe , but are unlikely to make Israel willing to gamble its existence on the prospect of stable deterrence . 
Nor is it likely that Saudi Arabia , Egypt , and others will sit passively while the Persian Shia gain the bomb . 
They will likely follow suit , and the more weapons proliferate in the volatile Middle East , the more likely it is that accidents and miscalculations could lead to their use . 
Moreover , there are genuine fears that rogue elements in a divided Iranian government might leak weapons technology to terrorist groups . 
These are the dangers that lead some to contemplate air strikes to destroy Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities before they can make weapons . 
At first glance , a &quot; surgical &quot; strike may look tempting . 
But military options are less attractive when carefully analyzed . 
Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities are dispersed ; some are underground . 
If one adds suppression of air defenses , such a strike might involve roughly 600 targets - far from surgical . 
Moreover , while an air strike might set back Iran &apos;s program by a few years , it would solidify nationalist support for the government and the nuclear program , particularly because one attack would not be enough . 
The process of protracted strikes could thwart positive political changes among the younger generation , thus reducing the chances of a more democratic and benign Iran emerging in the future . 
At the same time , Iran has effective means of retaliation . 
It might not be able to close the Strait of Hormuz , but threats to refineries , storage facilities , and tankers would send oil prices even higher . 
Moreover , Iran &apos;s support of terrorist organizations , such as Hezbollah , could bring violence to other countries . 
With the outcome of Bush &apos;s ill-advised war in Iraq uncertain and his legacy depending heavily upon finding a political solution , Iran &apos;s support for Iraqi Shiite radicals could give it considerable leverage . 
When Bush administration officials say that &quot; all options are on the table , &quot; they are warning the Iranians that the use of force is possible . 
But one is tempted to believe them when they add that they are now focused on diplomacy . 
As Theodore Roosevelt once said , negotiations may go better when you talk softly but carry a big stick . 
At the same time , however , Iran knows how costly it would be for the Americans ( and perhaps the Israelis ) to use force , which reduces the effect of the threat . 
At present , a diplomatic solution does not look promising . 
Iran has threatened to leave the NPT if sanctions are imposed , and Russia and China worry that even modest targeted sanctions could escalate and ultimately legitimize an American use of force that they wish to avoid . 
China wants to preserve its access to Iranian oil , and Russia seeks to preserve a valuable commercial market . 
But both realize that a failure to resolve the issue in the context of the UN ( in which they are major stakeholders as permanent members of the Security Council ) could severely damage the future of that institution . 
Today , the diplomatic package consists mostly of penalties , albeit the small ones of targeted sanctions . 
Their main effect will be psychological if widespread support for them creates a sense in Iran that it has isolated itself . 
Unlike North Korea , Iran is more likely to care about its international standing . 
The diplomatic package could be made more attractive if the US would add more positive incentives . 
Through a credible intermediary , the US could offer to consider security guarantees and relief from existing sanctions if Iran agrees to forego domestic enrichment and accept the Russian offer , perhaps garbed as an IAEA-backed international consortium in which Iran could participate . 
This would mean abandoning the temptations of coercive regime change that hamstrung American diplomacy in Bush &apos;s first term . 
By increasing economic and cultural ties , diplomacy might unleash the soft power that could contribute to more gradual regime transformation over the longer term . 
Meanwhile , such an approach might avoid the costly use of force and buy time for a more benign outcome than what lies at the end of the current path of events .
