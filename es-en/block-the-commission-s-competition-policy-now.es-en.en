Block the Commission \ u0027s Competition Policy Now 
Last December , the European Commission published a Green Paper that contains proposals to reform the EU &apos;s rules on mergers . 
Reactions and comments on these proposals by interested parties are due in Brussels by March 31 st . 
Afterwards , the Commission will draft new merger control rules to replace the current ones which date back to 1990 . 
Since the new rules on controlling mergers will come in the form of a regulation , not a directive , they will take effect immediately , most likely before this summer , and will not need to be ratified by national parliaments . 
As of the end of February , barely a handful of comments on the Green Paper had been received : it would be a crime if business and public opinion , both in Europe and in the United States , overlooked the March 31 st deadline and let this opportunity to speak up go by . 
In the absence of strong criticism , the Commission will feel it legitimate to go ahead with a set of proposals that is deeply unsatisfactory . 
If this happens , another ten years may pass before the regulation is modified . 
The new merger control rules go some way toward fixing a number of quirks in the Commission &apos;s current procedure for evaluating mergers . 
The possibility of stopping the clock on the proceedings for a couple of weeks gives a company some time to negotiate remedies with the Commission , while preserving certainty in the timetable , which constitutes the main advantage of Europe &apos;s competition rules . 
The proposals also clarify Brussels &apos; jurisdiction in relation to national competition authorities : mergers requiring a review by three or more national authorities will go automatically to Brussels . 
This currently only happens if a company meets complex turnover thresholds . 
Here , on the technical side , one important issue remains unresolved : contrary to what happens in the US , the European regulator lacks the authority to impose the break-up of a company as a remedy against its dominant market power . 
For example , when UPS complained to Brussels about Deutsche Post cross-subsidizing its courier services the Commission limited the remedy to imposing an accounting separation between the market and non-market activities of the German Post Office , something very different from a break-up . 
It did so because , in the absence of a change in regulations dating to 1962 ( a change that has been proposed by the Commission but not yet approved by the European Council ) , Brussels lacks the authority to force break-ups . 
Without this authority , it is natural for the European regulator to be unusually suspicious of mergers : if a new company created by a merger were , sometime in the future , to rise to a dominant position , the regulator may lack the power to intervene . 
So it is deemed better to kill a potentially dangerous baby before it is born . 
But all of this is , in the end , small beer . 
The new rules fall short of addressing the main drawback of European competition policy , which is institutional , not technical : the Commission remains simultaneously prosecutor , judge , and jury of all merger cases . &quot; In-house hearing officers , &quot; the Commission &apos;s internal review process , are a joke , and a company &apos;s right to appeal to the European Court of Justice is a mockery in merger cases ( though less so in the case of an action for market abuse ) , given the timing of the Court &apos;s rulings . 
In America , an independent judge rules from the first stage of the process , which guarantees that decisions are both timely and fair . 
The Commission claims that the institutional structure for competition rulemaking is enshrined in the EU &apos;s core Treaties and could be changed through regulation . 
Fair enough , but we are not idiots . 
Last summer the Commission issued a White Paper on European Governance , a background document for the Constitutional Convention chaired by Valery Giscard d &apos;Estaing now underway in Brussels , a body expected to review the &quot; governance of Europe , &quot; that is the powers of the Union and the way it uses them . 
That White Paper , while proposing that some powers be transferred from the Commission to independent authorities , explicitly rules out any change in the governance of mergers : &quot; Creation of autonomous EU regulatory agencies will improve the way rules are applied and enforced across the Union . 
&#91; Such agencies , however &#93; cannot be given responsibilities for which the Treaty has conferred a direct power of decision on the Commission , for example in the area of competition policy . &quot; 
But isn &apos;t it the Convention &apos;s task to draft a new Treaty ? 
One is under the impression that the Commission did not choose its timing by chance . 
By moving fast on a few technical improvements of the merger control rules , and introducing them ahead of the Convention , the Commission acted as if it were hoping that the institutional structure of competition policy would not become an item on the agenda of the Convention : we just fixed it , let &apos;s wait and see how the new rules work out , it seems to be saying . 
The Commission should not be allowed to get away with this ingenious plan . 
It is offering small beer , certainly not enough to buy the silence of business and public opinion . 
The new regulation should be blocked , at least until the Commission commits to put forward a serious proposal for the overhaul of the institutional setting of European competition policy . 
The fact that competition policy is the only tooth that bites in Brussels should not be an excuse for preserving a system that defies democracy and seriously lacks transparency .
