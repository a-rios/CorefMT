The EU &apos;s Kosovo Catalyst 
Kosovo &apos;s declaration of independence has put stability in the Western Balkans back on Europe &apos;s agenda . 
Unless the European Union acts quickly , the whole region could slide backwards , with dire social , economic , and security consequences . 
The EU needs a comprehensive regional approach , focusing on the remaining steps that would lead each country towards membership . 
The Western Balkans − a term used only since 1999 − comprises Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia ( FYROM ) , Montenegro , Serbia , and Kosovo , with a combined population of roughly 22 million . 
Economic developments in the region are promising , with almost all its economies posting high growth , fueled by increasing industrial output and exports . 
Inward investment is steadily rising , as business seems to believe that the remaining political and security challenges - the possible negative effects of post-independence Kosovo and Bosnia &apos;s malaise - will be overcome sooner rather than later . 
Much work has already been done to re-establish and improve regional relations . 
The EU-led Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe has since 1999 successfully stimulated regional cross-border cooperation , for the first time since the breakdown of Yugoslavia . 
Energy , transport infrastructure - roads , railways , and waterways - and crime prevention have all benefited . 
The Stability Pact has now been transferred to local control , re-emerging as the Sarajevo-based Regional Cooperation Council , ready to develop regional and multilateral standards for its members . 
The recently revived Central European Free Trade Agreement ( CEFTA ) is meant to be the main regional engine for trade and business generally , and will adhere both to WTO rules and the parties &quot; obligations towards the EU . 
Similarly , the South-East European Cooperation Process is one of the relatively new regional organizations that contribute to candidate and potential candidate countries &quot; preparations for EU membership , providing the first genuine region-wide policy forum where both EU members and candidates participate . 
But these bodies must not be seen as substitutes for the far more comprehensive accession process , which only the EU itself can initiate . 
And yet , despite the region &apos;s favorable prospects and relatively small size , the Union has been slow in doing so . 
Certainly , the pace of candidate countries &quot; approach to the Union depends on the speed of their reforms . 
And Europe , with the vital support of the United States , worked hard to stop the carnage of the 1990 &quot; s and subsequently to help rebuild the Balkan countries . 
But the EU has so far failed to prepare the Western Balkans for accession , in line with its leaders &quot; promise at their Thessaloniki summit in 2003 to admit the Western Balkan states when they meet the Union &apos;s standards . 
That promise was not a matter of charity ; the Balkans would add value to the EU . 
To be sure , the EU &apos;s lengthy internal crisis over the proposed constitution was a major distraction , and damaged the Union &apos;s reputation in the Balkans . 
Let us hope that the new Reform Treaty will help to reassure the critics and pave the way for a new - and more robust - phase of integration . 
If not , one would have to ask what had happened to the European spirit of the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , when countries such as Greece , Portugal , and Spain , which had just emerged from dictatorship and civil unrest , were welcomed into the European community of democratic states . 
Political decisions taken then were far more risky than those at hand in the Balkans , and the Greek and Iberian success stories demonstrate the wisdom of the courageous decisions taken at that time . 
What about today ? 
The most recent EU members , Bulgaria and Romania , are both in the Balkans and both are examples of countries with special needs . 
While the EU at first took their accession negotiations a bit too casually , it subsequently decided to continue monitoring the two countries even after accession in order to ensure that they develop the effective administrative and judicial systems that are an obligation of membership . 
The EU must learn from this experience to develop an accession strategy for the Western Balkans , whose development has been delayed by a complex post-conflict transition process . 
Their special needs should be taken into account in any new EU approach , giving them hope while mitigating the fallout from Kosovo . 
It is in Europe &apos;s interest as much as it is in the interest of the region to accelerate the integration process . 
A reinvigorated accession process would contribute to the EU &apos;s consolidation , both territorially and politically , while strengthening its role in its wider neighborhood - the Mediterranean , the Middle East , and around the Black Sea .
