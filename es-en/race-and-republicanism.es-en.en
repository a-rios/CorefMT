Race and Republicanism 
Race has always been a provocative subject when the needs of science and statistics intersect with politics . 
Now that debate is once again heating up in France , as the planned introduction of &quot; ethnic statistics &quot; has caused a fierce dispute that touches the very heart of French republicanism . 
According to a law that dates back to the French Revolution , and reconfirmed in 1978 , French government officials are forbidden to collect information about a citizen &apos;s ethnic or racial origins , whether real or alleged , when conducting a census or other efforts to gathering statistical information on the population . 
There are two main reasons for this . 
The first is the republican principle , enshrined in the Constitution , that recognizes only citizens and does not accept any distinction among them due to origin , race , or religion . 
The second reason is historic : the painful and still vivid memories of the Vichy regime of WWII , when citizens &quot; &quot; racial &quot; and religious origin was stamped on national identification documents and was used as a key tool in rounding up French Jews for delivery to the death camps . 
Today , the issue has returned to the forefront because of a new fight against racial discrimination , which appears to require more accurate measures of social inequality . 
Existing public statistics , it is believed , do not provide enough relevant information to analyze the possibility of discrimination in employment or housing . 
After all , without appropriate statistics , it is difficult to prove discrimination . 
Indeed , many argue that by refusing to take into account distinctions linked to ethnic and religious origin , these distinctions are legitimized . 
One British social critic , quoted by the sociologist Dominique Schnapper , compares the behavior of the French , unwilling to mention ethnic discrimination , with English people of the Victorian era , who refused to talk about sex . 
Supporters of gathering statistics on race and religion also look to the experiences of the United States , Britain , or the Netherlands , where census takers are free to inquire about ethnic origins and a citizen &apos;s sense of belonging . 
Since 1990 , the US has collected data on ethnic origins . 
Although the First Amendment of the US Constitution bans any religious test for citizenship or political office , ruling out questions on religious beliefs , it is possible to gather information on ethnicity , even in certain cases of multiple ethnic origins , such as &quot; White , &quot; &quot; Black , &quot; &quot; Asian , &quot; and &quot; native American . &quot; 
In Britain , the concern about social promotion of minorities led to the introduction in 1991 of statistics that indicate ethnic status . 
As for the Netherlands , companies were obliged to report the ethnic composition of their workforces until the law was repealed in 2003 . 
But today &apos;s French legislation is less rigorous than it seems . 
It distinguishes between anonymous files from random samples and established for scientific purposes , which may contain data about a person &apos;s origins , and files that are not anonymous , which have direct consequences for the people concerned - and for which it is strictly forbidden to register any information about ethnic origins . 
The 1978 law allows government statisticians to ask &quot; delicate &quot; questions only if these questions are relevant for the survey and with the consent of the person polled . 
But government statisticians have long been studying the national origins of immigrants , and are permitted to indicate the previous nationality of people who have acquired French citizenship . 
Thus , there is a distinction between mentioning the original nationality , which is allowed , and mentioning ethnic and racial origins , which is not . 
Is it necessary to go further just because the indicators linked to national origin are not enough to identify discrimination - especially indirect discrimination - based on ethnic grounds ? 
Some surveys show that the groups involved are doubtful about this . 
Statistics are not only a reflection of reality : they help to shape it . 
Statistical categories often tend to become social categories . 
Not only are racial indications ( White , Black , Arabic , Asian ) very inaccurate in a world where racial mixing is now common , but , as François Héran , the head of France &apos;s National Institute of Demographic Studies , argues , it is also necessary to prove that difference means inequality and that inequality necessarily means discrimination . 
Indeed , ethnic counting could merely reinforce the logic of community separation . 
Given the desire to penalize ethnic discrimination , the push for government to gain this knowledge is understandable . 
In view of the risk of inciting fresh antagonism , gathering racial , religious , and ethnic statistics may not be worth it . 
The ban against ethnic and racial data is a taboo that should not be overthrown easily , and not without carefully weighing the risk to social peace .
