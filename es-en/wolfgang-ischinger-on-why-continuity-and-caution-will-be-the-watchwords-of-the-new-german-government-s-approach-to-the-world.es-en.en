Germany &apos;s Same Old Foreign Policy 
MUNICH - More than ten weeks after its general election , Germany continues to be without a new government . 
Indeed , when Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) finally presented their coalition agreement on November 27 , the working group on foreign and security policy had been finished with its job for two weeks . 
Except for a few tweaks that generally resonate more at home than with Germany &apos;s European and international partners ( such as requiring the government to be more transparent concerning arms exports to autocratic regimes ) , continuity and caution will remain the watchwords of German foreign and security policy . 
Observers may disagree about whether German leaders &quot; stance provides a welcome sign of reliability or reflects a lamentable lack of diplomatic ambition . 
Those who hope for more active German leadership may well be disappointed by the new government . 
Big ideas , or even big questions , are notably absent from the coalition agreement . 
This is very much a reflection of many Germans &quot; views about themselves and their future : they are comfortable with the status quo , see no need for further reform proposals , are not interested in grand strategy , and would largely prefer to be left alone . 
Consider NATO policy . 
Successive German governments have maintained that the alliance should be , or even is , the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges . 
And when it comes to provision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls &quot; our geographic neighborhood , &quot; the incoming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job . 
Or consider the question of Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union . Continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not permit a proactive German role . 
Instead , the compromise solution will be no solution : neither yes nor no . 
At the same time , some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement . 
For starters , the United States &quot; strategic &quot; pivot &quot; to the Asia-Pacific region is described as an opportunity for Europe to assert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region . 
Moreover , to encourage this outcome , the coalition agreement promises that the government will &quot; adopt new initiatives to strengthen and deepen the Common Foreign and Security Policy &quot; after the EU summit in December 2013 . 
It includes a call for an annual European Council session on security and defense , as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of EU foreign relations . 
In addition , the German government will support European defense integration and maintain the establishment of a European army as a long-term goal . 
This may not amount to much in practice , but the language in this section is much less tepid than elsewhere . 
Finally , the coalition agreement responds to concerns about Germany &apos;s ability to be a reliable partner in NATO and EU military missions in a potentially more integrated EU defense organization . 
According to a 1994 ruling by Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court , the German parliament has the final say when it comes to deploying soldiers . 
However , Germany &apos;s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the German parliament were to retain a veto over their deployment . 
The coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue . 
Nonetheless , they have agreed that , within a year , a commission will provide different options and models to protect the German parliament &apos;s rights while providing assurances to Germany &apos;s European partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments . 
Should the SPD , which will vote on the coalition agreement in early December , block the formation of the new government ( an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question ) , disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit . 
Aside from a few minor particulars , consensus prevails . 
For some , that is a cause for ambivalence . 
&quot; I do not like the idea that Germany plays itself up to impose its will on others , &quot; German President Joachim Gauck said recently . 
&quot; Yet neither do I like the idea that Germany plays itself down to eschew risks or solidarity . &quot; 
Whether German foreign policy can and should do more is a reasonable question . To some degree , the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessity to assume more responsibility for international leadership . 
The bottom line is this : Expect no surprises from Germany . 
Considering how difficult it has been for some , if not most , other EU countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years , that is actually rather good news .
