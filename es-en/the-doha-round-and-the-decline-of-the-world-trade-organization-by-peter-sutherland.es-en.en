The Bilateral Threat to Free Trade 
ISTANBUL - The Doha Round of global trade talks appears to have died this year , almost without a whimper . 
While a small portion of the project may be saved , the essential reality is that this is a unique failure in the history of multilateral trade negotiations , which have transformed the global economy since World War II . 
Many of the seven previous rounds of negotiations - including the Uruguay Round , which resulted in the establishment of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) in 1995 as the successor to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs ( GATT ) - took years to complete , but none died of neglect or disinterest . 
Today &apos;s indifference is particularly , though not exclusively , evident in the United States . 
President Barack Obama was silent on the issue in his re-election campaign , and breathed scarcely a word about it in his first campaign , too . 
One wonders whether what is at stake is even fully understood in some capitals . 
Successful multilateral trade negotiations have significantly shaped the world in which we live and have dramatically enhanced the lives of millions of people . 
Between 1960 and 1990 , only one person in five lived in an economically open society ; today , nine in ten do . 
The rule-based trading system developed by the GATT and the WTO has been embraced by virtually the entire global community . 
Initially , &quot; globalization &quot; was a dirty word to some . 
While much more needs to be done for Africa and parts of Latin America , the Doha Round was intended to assist in providing market access ( and therefore opportunity ) to many more in the developing world . 
The essence of the multilateral system consists in two principles : non-discrimination and national treatment . 
The former is described in the trade negotiators &quot; lexicon as the &quot; most favored nation &quot; principle , which essentially seeks to ensure that trade benefits provided to one country are provided to all . 
The latter requires member states to provide the same treatment to trading partners within national borders as that provided to nationals . 
The non-discrimination principle ensured that global trade did not become a &quot; spaghetti bowl &quot; of preferential bilateral trade agreements . 
Moreover , a multilateral framework for trade negotiations gave weaker states far more balanced conditions than they would face were they forced to negotiate bilaterally with the likes of China , the United States , or the European Union . 
In fact , what we have seen in recent years is an increasing rush to bilateral agreements by the major trading countries and blocs . 
The WTO has been marginalized , and even what has already been achieved in the incomplete Doha Round appears unlikely to be delivered in a final agreement in the foreseeable future . 
The damage to the credibility of the WTO - once lauded as the greatest advance in global governance since the inspired institution-building of the immediate postwar period - may yet prove lasting . 
Worse , it could have a serious impact not merely on trade , but on political relationships more generally . 
One of the WTO &apos;s great achievements has been the adjudication system that it provides - the so-called Dispute Settlement Mechanism . 
This independent body has been a resounding success , giving the world an effective quasi-judicial system to resolve disputes between trading partners . 
Indeed , the current rush to bilateral trade agreements has been accompanied by a rise in protectionism . 
For example , there have been 424 new measures of this kind in the EU since 2008 . 
Furthermore , the EU &apos;s non-discriminatory tariffs are fully applicable to only nine trading partners . 
Everyone else has &quot; exceptional &quot; treatment . 
Next , no doubt , we will have the prospect of a bilateral free-trade agreement between the EU and the US . 
An EU-Japan treaty is already in the wind , as is a &quot; Trans-Pacific Partnership &quot; to liberalize trade among the US and major Asian and Latin American economies . 
If either ever comes to pass , which I doubt , a huge share of world trade would be conducted within a discriminatory framework . 
Some recognize the risks . 
In May 2011 , Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University and I co-chaired a High Level Group convened by the prime ministers of the United Kingdom , Germany , Turkey , and Indonesia to attempt to move the multilateral process ahead . 
Our sponsors welcomed our recommendations , but that and similar efforts have gained little traction , leaving all countries rushing headlong toward a world full of uncertainty and risk . 
It is not too late to reverse the apparently inexorable tide of bilateralism . 
Even if the Doha Round cannot be concluded , there may be other routes , such as implementing what has already been agreed . 
Another alternative might be to advance multilateral negotiations among willing countries in specific areas , such as services , with other WTO members joining later . 
But if we are to move forward rather than revert to earlier , more dangerous times , the US , in particular , must reassert a constructive role in multilateralism . 
The US must lead again , as it did in the past .
