Asia &apos;s Historical Furies 
TOKYO - A country &apos;s foreign policy is supposed to be aimed , first and foremost , at advancing its national interest . 
As US Vice President Joe Biden just discovered on his tour of Japan , China , and South Korea , the American novelist William Faulkner &apos;s observation - &quot; The past is never dead . 
One commonly cited example of this is the relationship between India and Pakistan . 
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif recognize the vast economic potential of enhanced bilateral trade ties , and the progress that they have sought in this area is clearly in both countries &quot; national interest . 
But Asia &apos;s history problem is not confined to its democracies , where public opinion directly influences the government &apos;s actions . 
China and Vietnam , too , remain in thrall of their long and bitter shared history . 
The late General Vo Nguyen Giap , who led Vietnam through wars with France and the United States to independence , spent his final years protesting against Chinese investment in his country . 
Perhaps Asia &apos;s most dangerous case of historical obsession is to be found in the relationship between China and Japan . 
The current dispute in the East China Sea over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands ( the Diaoyu Islands in China ) would likely be less tense if the atrocities of the Sino-Japanese War were not rehashed so often in contemporary Chinese life . 
In fact , Japan has attempted to atone for its past actions , including by offering enthusiastic support to Deng Xiaoping &apos;s efforts to open up the Chinese economy . 
The trillions of yen that Japanese businesses have invested in China since the 1990 &quot; s - not to mention the transfer of critical technologies - could not have been about profit alone ( and , in any case , Japanese investment has benefited both economies ) . 
But , while these efforts have helped to deepen Japan &apos;s economic ties with China , they have not had the transformative impact on bilateral relations that one might have expected . 
Indeed , their relationship is now characterized by what the Japanese call seirei keinetsu ( cold politics , hot economics ) . 
Bad history also stalks the relationship between Japan and South Korea - a particularly revealing case , given how closely their strategic interests align . 
Here are two democracies , both among America &apos;s closest allies , unable to overcome the burden of the past . 
For South Koreans , it is a heavy burden , rooted in Japanese colonization and the myriad horrors of World War II . 
In fact , serei keinetsu defines the Asian status quo : countries that cannot seem to overcome their historical animosities when it comes to foreign policy readily acknowledge that better relations means better economies . 
East Asia , in particular , has experienced an unprecedented surge in intra-regional trade , investment , and even tourism over the last two decades . 
Yet there is reason for hope - and it is coming from an unexpected source . 
With China &apos;s efforts to assert itself as a regional hegemon stoking fears across Asia , its neighbors seem to be increasingly willing to vacate old grudges in favor of stronger alliances . 
For example , Japan &apos;s relations with Vietnam and Myanmar , both of which border China , have been warming rapidly in recent years - a trend that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has sought to cultivate . 
Likewise , the Philippines - locked in a stand-off with China over the disputed Scarborough shoal - has set aside its resentment over Japan &apos;s wartime occupation and accepted increased aid and naval assistance , including ten patrol vessels , worth $ 11 million each , to help with maritime surveillance . 
Filipino Foreign Minister Albert del Rosario has even declared publicly that the country would welcome a more muscular Japanese defense policy to offset China &apos;s military buildup . 
One reason for this turnaround is that many in the Philippines have felt somewhat abandoned by the US in their confrontation with China . 
With China increasingly asserting claims to territories in the South and East China Seas , other Asian countries may also find the burden of history to be too great an impediment to their future prospects . 
Japan could go a long way toward helping its neighbors overcome the poisoned past that it shares with so many of them as a result of its old imperial ambitions . 
Just as US President Richard Nixon &apos;s unyielding anti-communism uniquely suited him to establish diplomatic relations with China , Abe , an affirmed nationalist , may be the Japanese politician best able to blend contrition for the past with forthrightness about the present . 
The good news is that Abe has shown signs of this kind of courage . 
At a 2006 summit with Chinese leaders during his first stint as Japan &apos;s prime minister , he agreed to establish a joint commission , involving historians from Japan , China , and elsewhere , to study twentieth-century history . 
The idea was that the commission could make unbiased recommendations about contentious issues like the contents of history textbooks and even the Yasukuni shrine , a nationalist pilgrimage site where the remains of Japanese war criminals , among others , are interred . 
If Abe revived this initiative today , he could help to dampen the regional antagonism he faces in trying to make Japan a &quot; normal &quot; country , with a military capable of participating in collective regional defense . 
Such an initiative may not work with China , where the government still uses the war with Japan to rouse nationalist sentiment . 
That alone should be reason enough for Abe to act .
