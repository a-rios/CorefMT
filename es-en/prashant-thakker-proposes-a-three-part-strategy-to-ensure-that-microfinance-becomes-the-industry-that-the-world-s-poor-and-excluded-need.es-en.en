Microfinance &apos;s Macro Potential 
LONDON - Microfinance is , at its heart , an effort to provide financial services to people who are not served - or are under-served - by the formal banking system . 
With appropriate , accessible , and fairly priced financial services , people can build their savings , cover the costs of unexpected emergencies , and invest in their families &quot; health , housing , and education . 
The International Finance Corporation estimates that microfinance has reached some 130 million people worldwide in the last 15 years . 
Over this period , microfinance has been lauded for its potential to advance financial inclusion and enable people to escape poverty . 
But it has also faced harsh criticism , with some lenders being accused of profiteering . 
Despite the industry &apos;s widely publicized pitfalls , its potential to improve the lives of the poor cannot be ignored . 
The question now is how to ensure that microfinance becomes the industry that the world needs . 
To this end , three important steps must be taken . 
The first step is better regulation . 
Microfinance institutions ( MFIs ) come in many forms - mainstream banks , specially licensed banks , non-financial companies , finance and leasing companies , non-governmental organizations , cooperatives , and trusts - and follow a variety of business models . 
All of these intermediaries must be recognized and regulated according to the needs of the economies in which they operate . 
Inadequate regulation is most damaging to those who need microfinance services the most . 
Nowhere was this more apparent than in the 2010 microfinance crisis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh - a hub of MFI activity - when a decade of explosive growth , fueled by aggressive and reckless lending practices , came to a head . 
Over-indebtedness , together with coercive recovery practices , led to a series of widely publicized suicides , spurring local officials to implement new restrictions on MFIs and discourage borrowers from repaying their debts . 
As repayment rates plummeted , micro-lending ground to a halt . 
In order to prevent such outcomes , governments must design regulations that foster a sustainable financial-inclusion model , one that enables MFIs to offer long-term support to borrowers . 
At the same time , regulation must deter MFIs from behaving recklessly with a vulnerable client segment . 
And regulation should be based not on past experience , as it is now , but on future possibilities ; in other words , the regulatory framework must be flexible enough to accommodate new innovations . 
The second step , to be taken by the microfinance industry itself , is to create effective mechanisms for assessing the industry &apos;s impact . 
As it stands , some governments and academics are uncomfortable with the fact that MFIs , which are supposed to be providing a public good by advancing financial inclusiveness , are pursuing profits . 
But the failure of some MFIs to differentiate between profit-seeking and profiteering does not mean that sustainable microfinance should not yield returns above costs . 
The business of providing financial services to the poor requires commitment . 
Without profits , MFIs are unable to invest in the talent and product development needed to serve people for the long term . 
Many governments have now implemented interest-rate ceilings and margin caps to curtail excessive profits for MFIs , while ignoring the margins of the market &apos;s non-organized alternatives , like pawnbrokers . 
In order to provide a more balanced perspective on the microfinance industry compared to other kinds of financial-services providers , MFIs need to do more to measure and explain their social and economic value . 
The good news is that industry bodies , investors , and governments have already introduced metrics for factors ranging from pricing to conduct . 
While this has resulted in a rather disparate set of indicators , which must be standardized , such efforts are an encouraging sign of the microfinance industry &apos;s commitment to securing its role in the financial-services ecosystem . 
The third step concerns technology . 
Mobile connectivity is transforming the global financial system by enabling remote , rural populations to access financial services for the first time . 
Mobile-payment systems like M-Pesa are changing how people transfer , receive , and save money in many developing countries , including Kenya , Pakistan , and the Philippines . 
For the microfinance industry , such systems represent an important opportunity , as they enable borrowers to apply for , receive , and repay loans on their mobile phones , using a network of local agents to deposit and withdraw cash . 
But , without robust regulation , MFIs cannot make the most of these developments . 
Moreover , the mobile-payments revolution has so far been led largely by telecom providers . 
If it is to deliver real benefits to the financially excluded , the financial-services industry will need to play a much more active role . 
Of course , microfinance alone will not eliminate poverty , or even financial exclusion , regardless of how well it functions . 
To have a truly transformative impact , MFIs &quot; operations must be supported by government-led efforts to improve access to education , training , and employment . 
Although microfinance has already helped countless people worldwide , the World Bank estimates that some 2.5 billion adults still lack access to financial services . 
It is the responsibility of all stakeholders - including governments , regulators , banks , and civil society - to ensure that microfinance continues to be part of the solution .
