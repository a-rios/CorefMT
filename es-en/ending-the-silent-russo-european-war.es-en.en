Ending the Silent Russo-European War 
There has been little mutual trust lately between the governments of Russia and the European Union . 
European politicians viewed Russia &apos;s recent parliamentary and presidential elections skeptically . 
Diplomatic relations between Britain and the Kremlin are at a low since Alexander Litvenenko , a critic of the Russian government , was murdered - allegedly by a Russian agent - in London in 2006 . 
Such mistrust poses an obvious threat to trade and investment between Russia and the EU . 
Russia &apos;s trade with the EU between January and August 2007 reached $ 173.3 billion , or 51.6 % of its foreign trade turnover . 
More than a half of Russia &apos;s goods are sold in Europe , and two of its top three trade partners are European : Germany , with turnover of $ 31.9 billion , and the Netherlands , $ 28.3 billion . 
Similarly , European countries account for 75 % of direct investment in Russia . 
Britain ranks first , pouring in more than $ 15 billion in the first half of 2007 , despite the Litvinenko case and the tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats during this period . 
Nevertheless , the volume of foreign investment falls short of what Russia needs , for its economy is unbalanced . 
More than half of its exports are oil and gas , with the rest mainly chemicals and agricultural products . 
Petrodollars are Russia &apos;s main resource for the development of an information-based society . 
EU countries will continue to demand energy , and Siberian deposits are far from exhausted . 
As a result , diversification of Russia &apos;s economy seems a distant prospect - all the more so because Russia &apos;s bureaucracy , together with the state &apos;s interest in &quot; strategic &quot; areas of the economy , repels foreign business . 
Indeed , Europeans constantly reproach Russia for the increasing level of state interference . 
Russia &apos;s relations with the EU are governed by an agreement signed in June 1994 concerning trade , business and investment , competition issues , protection of intellectual , industrial , and business property , and financial cooperation . 
Over time , economic cooperation between the two sides has grown more complex , and a new legal framework is needed . 
But the European Commission is unable to start working on a new agreement until it has a mandate from the 27 EU member states . 
Such a mandate has not yet been secured . 
At the same time , conditions for Russian investment in the EU are far from perfect . 
Investors face political discrimination and administrative and technical barriers , especially concerning the power industry . 
Some EU &quot; open &quot; tenders have turned out to be closed to Russian companies . 
Economic nationalism is growing . 
Foreign investment is limited in sectors that the EU considers to be strategically and politically important . 
Russian companies have had to face anti-dumping claims . 
European branches of Russian banks face over-regulation and expensive certification procedures . 
In September 2007 , a move by the European Commission to prevent foreign companies from controlling European energy transport networks was an example of a skirmish in this &quot; silent war . &quot; 
The commission &apos;s order to &quot; unbundle &quot; energy companies into transport and distribution units is hardly likely to encourage foreign energy companies working in the EU to seek structural reforms in the Russian economy . 
Business leaders in Europe and Russia are beginning to seek a bold way out of this impasse : a common economic space between Russia and the EU . 
But free trade and closer integration can be achieved only if supported by national governments . 
Russia &apos;s new Minister for Economic Development and Commerce , Elvira Nabiullina , said recently that European business &quot; is Russia &apos;s main partner on international markets , &quot; and that cooperation &quot; is one of the cornerstones of Russian foreign economic policy . &quot; 
She points to the government &apos;s promise to create a comfortable environment for business by continuing institutional reforms and assisting in the development of financial markets . 
Such statements are encouraging . 
But Russian business needs a comprehensive action plan , which should include cutting bureaucracy , implementing real administrative reform , freeing the economy from excessive state control , and radical measures to combat corruption . 
Russia also has to become integrated into the international economic system , accepting the rules applied by the rest of the world . 
Russia &apos;s eventual accession to the World Trade Organization will be crucial to this development , and its accession needs to be promoted more actively by Europe as well as by Russia . 
The long-delayed new trade and investment agreement will be less relevant once Russia is in the WTO , whose rules take precedence over those of regional economic organizations . 
The legitimacy of European laws limiting the scope of Russian business activity in Europe and contradicting WTO regulations would immediately be questioned . 
Russia &apos;s business leaders are ready to work for the creation of a common economic space between Russia and the EU . 
For Russia , such integration would provide a real spark for economic and social modernization . 
Russia &apos;s government will , of course , have the final word in this matter .
