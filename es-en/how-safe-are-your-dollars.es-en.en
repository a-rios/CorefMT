How Safe Are Your Dollars ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Chinese officials and private investors around the world have been worrying aloud about whether their dollar investments are safe . 
Since the Chinese government holds a large part of its $ 2 trillion of foreign exchange in dollars , they have good reason to focus on the future value of the greenback . 
And investors with smaller dollar holdings , who can shift to other currencies much more easily than the Chinese , are right to ask themselves whether they should be diversifying into non-dollar assets - or even shunning the dollar completely . 
The fear about the dollar &apos;s future is driven by several different but related concerns . 
Will the value of the dollar continue its long-term downward trend relative to other currencies ? 
Will the enormous rise of United States government debt that is projected for the coming decade and beyond lead to inflation or even to default ? 
Will the explosive growth of commercial banks &quot; excess reserves cause rapid inflation as the economy recovers ? 
But , while there is much to worry about , the bottom line is that these fears are exaggerated . 
Let &apos;s start with the most likely of the negative developments : a falling exchange rate relative to other currencies . 
Even after the dollar &apos;s recent rally relative to the euro , the trade-weighted value of the dollar is now 15 % lower against a broad basket of major currencies than it was a decade ago , and 30 % lower than it was 25 years ago . 
Although occasional bouts of nervousness in global financial markets cause the dollar to rise , I expect that the dollar will continue to fall relative to the euro , the Japanese yen , and even the Chinese yuan . 
That decline in the dollar exchange rate is necessary to shrink the very large trade deficit that the US has with the rest of the world . 
Consider what a decline of the dollar relative to the yuan would mean for the Chinese . 
If the Chinese now hold $ 1 trillion in their official portfolios , a 10 % rise in the yuan-dollar exchange rate would lower the yuan value of those holdings by 10 % . 
That is a big accounting loss , but it doesn &apos;t change the value of the American goods or property investments in the US that the Chinese could buy with their trillion dollars . 
The Chinese ( or Saudis or Indians or others outside the euro zone ) should , of course , be concerned about the dollar &apos;s decline relative to the euro . 
After all , when that decline resumes , their dollar holdings will buy less in European markets . 
While it is hard to say how much the decline might be , it would not be surprising to see a fall of 20 % over the next several years from the current level of about 1.4 dollars per euro . 
But the big risk to any investor is the possibility that inflation will virtually annihilate a currency &apos;s value . 
That happened in a number of countries in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s . 
In Mexico , for example , it took 150 pesos in 1990 to buy what one peso could buy in 1980 . 
That is not going to happen in the US . 
Large budget deficits have led to high inflation in countries that are forced to create money to finance those deficits because they cannot sell longer-term government bonds . 
That is not a risk for the US . 
The rate of inflation actually fell in the US during the early 1980 &quot; s , when the US last experienced large fiscal deficits . 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues are determined to keep inflation low as the economy recovers . 
The Fed has explained that it will sell the large volume of mortgage securities that it now holds on its balance sheet , absorbing liquidity in the process . 
It will also use its new authority to pay interest on the reserves held by commercial banks at the Fed in order to prevent excessive lending . 
This is , of course , a formidable task that may have to be accomplished at a time when Congress opposes monetary tightening . 
Looking forward , investors can protect themselves against inflation in the US by buying Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities ( TIPS ) , which index interest and principal payments to offset the rise in the consumer price level . 
The current small difference between the real interest rate on such bonds ( 2.1 % for 30-year bonds ) and the nominal interest rate on conventional 30-year Treasury bonds ( now 4.6 % ) implies that the market expects only about 2.5 % inflation over the next three decades . 
So the good news is that dollar investments are safe . 
But safe doesn &apos;t mean the investment with the highest safe return . 
If the dollar is likely to fall against the euro over the next several years , investments in euro-denominated bonds issued by the German or French governments may provide higher safe returns . 
Even if the dollar is perfectly safe , investors are well advised to diversify their portfolios .
