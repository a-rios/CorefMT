Humanizing the Human Genome Project 
COLD SPRING HARBOR - Since the human genome was first sequenced in 2000 , genome science has accelerated at a remarkable rate . 
Rapid advances in DNA-sequencing technology mean that affordable decoding of the human genome is not far away . 
In fact , human genomes could be sequenced for as little as $ 1,000 in the next few years . 
Unfortunately , the current biomedical research establishment is entirely unprepared for such a scenario . 
Researchers often believe that their mission is to uncover new biology and genetics , and that someone else will translate them to the clinical arena . 
Accordingly , many geneticists have worked on &quot; big-science &quot; genomics , including genome-wide association studies focused on common genetic variation in the human species . 
But it is widely known that certain mutations can run in families , increasing dramatically the risks of certain diseases - for example , breast cancer , sickle-cell anemia , and cystic fibrosis . 
Unfortunately , many human molecular geneticists have abdicated any responsibility for trying to decrease the overall burden of such diseases . 
While this trend has many causes - most of which have been debated extensively - one very important factor is rarely discussed . 
Scientific research - and biomedical research in particular - largely resembles a race . 
Human geneticists , like big-game hunters , specialize in finding disease genes - the &quot; prize . &quot; 
Once they succeed , they usually do not continue to develop their findings ; instead , they move on to their next target . 
Today , scientists are rewarded for how many papers they publish , and in which journals . 
In the United States , several major genome-sequencing centers exist primarily to conduct research - including the Centers for Mendelian Genomics , which seek to find the genetic basis of &quot; simple &quot; Mendelian disorders ( diseases caused by a single mutation in the structure of DNA ) . 
Many other countries are undertaking similar programs . 
But the discoveries and published papers rarely benefit the people who enable this research by donating their blood and other tissue samples . 
As Michael Nielsen discusses in his recent book Reinventing Discovery , the &quot; publish or perish &quot; mentality that dominates the field means that many substandard or incomplete papers are published , while those people who are supposed to benefit from the research are often little more than an afterthought . 
Indeed , research volunteers rarely receive their genomic data , which betrays the trust that participants place in researchers to use their findings not only to increase the stock of scientific knowledge , but also to deliver actionable results . 
The personal genomics and biotechnology company 23andMe has created a useful interface for returning results , which could easily be built upon to deliver complete genome data to participants - as long as the sample collection and sequencing are performed to a sufficiently high clinical standard . 
The company &apos;s model laudably calls for research participants to help in the analysis of their own genomes , thereby relieving researchers of the burden of returning all results at once . 
With expanding knowledge , analyzing genomes becomes easier . 
The hope is that , as technology develops , more researchers will recognize the importance of returning results - especially those that could have a significant medical impact - to participants . 
Because there is no regulation requiring that initial sequencing of human genomes be performed to clinical standards , most sequencing does not meet laboratory-test criteria . 
Indeed , results are often not reproducible - badly conceived , poorly conducted , or outright fraudulent . 
Criteria must therefore be established to ensure that sequencing is performed in an appropriate clinical environment , with rigorous standards in place , including for sample collection . 
Researchers today face the wrong incentives , which results in the failure to translate findings into meaningful action for research participants . 
Only by improving clinical standards and returning results to participants can human genome sequencing truly serve its purpose - to help humanity .
