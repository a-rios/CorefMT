Whither North Korea ? 
SEOUL - According to North Korean state television , the heart attack that killed Kim Jong-il on December 17 was &quot; due to severe mental and physical stress from overwork . &quot; 
That report instantly raised a question in my mind : if we accept the regime &apos;s diagnosis , why did Kim need to work so hard , despite his frail health ? 
In some sense , his sudden death seems to symbolize the helplessness of a desperate leader confronting overwhelming challenges . 
Seen in this light , the more important question is whether or not Kim &apos;s inexperienced son , the twenty-something &quot; Great Successor &quot; Kim Jong-un , will be able to consolidate power and somehow steer the country out of its deep malaise . 
So far , the succession in Pyongyang seems to be proceeding in an orderly fashion . 
But , despite appearances , few totalitarian regimes , save those of Hitler , Stalin , and Mao , have ever maintained a monolithic inner circle of power . 
North Korea is unlikely to be an exception to this rule . 
The legitimacy of Kim Jong-un &apos;s claim to power is weak , despite his blood tie to his father and grandfather , the dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its inception . 
The &quot; Great Successor &quot; has had barely two years of on-the-job training , compared to the 14 years his father spent studying directly under Kim Il-sung . 
Of course , Kim Jong-il &apos;s sister , Kim Kyung-hee , and his sister-in-law , Jang Seong-taek , will assume something of a regency role , acting both as patron to the Great Successor and as a force to mobilize the military to close ranks behind the Kim dynasty . 
But it is not clear how faithfully , and for how long , Kim Kyung-hee and Jang will remain supportive of Kim Jong-un . 
They might even try to supplant Kim by claiming power for themselves . 
Another challenge may come from the country &apos;s senior leaders , especially among the military . 
Will they remain faithful to Kim , who is 40-50 years their junior ? 
It is known that some senior military officers were quietly critical of Kim Jong-il &apos;s failure in managing the country &apos;s relationship with the United States and Japan . 
Their expectation might have been that North Korea could improve relations with the US while retaining its nuclear weapons , in exchange for not developing long-range missiles . 
After all , if Pakistan did it , why not North Korea ? 
Had that happened , economic assistance from the US and Japan would have flowed into North Korea , enabling the regime to manage the country &apos;s moribund economy much better without initiating reforms , which the military appears to regard as dangerous . 
Instead , with the economy , particularly food production , continuing to falter , perhaps one-third of the country is living at or below starvation levels . 
Will Kim Jong-un leader be able to do better ? 
In the early stages of this precarious succession , China has behaved as expected , trying to prop up the regime in order to ensure stability in its nuclear-armed neighbor . 
China &apos;s foreign ministry sent a strong message of support for Kim Jong-un , and encouraged North Koreans to unite under the new leader . 
But the key external factor in ensuring a peaceful succession will be the policies of South Korea and the US , which must decide whether they can work with the North in the post-Kim Jong-il era . 
Will they wait to see what happens to the new leader , and thus continue their policy of &quot; strategic patience , &quot; which focuses mainly on denuclearization , and not move on to other areas until the North moves first ? 
In that case , North Korea will gradually become more unstable , despite China &apos;s support , as economic collapse undermines its quasi-legitimate leadership . 
Or will South Korea and the US try to take advantage of Kim Jong-il &apos;s passing with new policy initiatives ? 
If they can develop a two-track policy framework aimed at facilitating economic reform inside North Korea while continuing international pressure for denuclearization , constructive engagement may be possible . 
Alas , next year is an election year in South Korea and the US . 
In the feverish atmosphere of political high season , it will not be easy for incumbent administrations to pursue bold but risky policies . 
This is the agony of democracy , and it is why the next year may prove to be the most unstable , and even dangerous , period in decades for the Korean peninsula and the region . 
What happens if things go the wrong way ? 
What if , for example , Kim Jong-un fails to consolidate power , perceives the domestic political situation as worsening , owing to elite power struggles or popular discontent , and deems the external environment , especially South Korea and the US ever more hostile ? 
In that case , Kim III may grasp at provocation in one form or another , as his father did with intermittent attacks on South Korea in recent years . 
If things do worsen even more , the world , like it or not , must be prepared to manage - and even confront - a scenario in which the Kim dynasty , and with it the North Korean state , collapses . 
Unfortunately , considering the current state of ill-preparedness in terms of international coordination , there will be confusion , misunderstanding , and overreaction among South Korea , the US , and China to other actors &quot; behavior . 
So it is past time for all three powers , together with Japan and Russia , to start talking and planning ahead , jointly . 
A chaotic , imploding North Korea is in no one &apos;s interest .
