Daring Europe to Innovate 
LUDWIGSHAFEN , GERMANY - Innovation plays a crucial role in creating sustainable economic growth . 
Yet we continue to see , particularly in the European Union , obstacles being placed in the way of those best positioned to invent new products , services , or ways of doing business . 
At the heart of the issue appears to be the fear of risk . 
But investors , managers , and entrepreneurs must take risks if their ideas stand any chance of achieving commercial success . 
Nowhere are these concerns more discussed , and less understood , than in Europe . 
Innovation has been placed at the heart of Europe 2020 , the European Commission &apos;s growth strategy for the EU . 
But , despite the fact that European scientific research is among the most advanced in the world , Europe lags behind its global competitors in its ability to bring these innovations to the market . 
Regardless of how one chooses to measure innovation , three conditions must be in place for it to flourish : a skilled , educated workforce ; excellent information and communications technology infrastructure ; and a supportive business environment . 
In other words , successful innovation requires a stable and growing economy , fresh ideas , and an absence of unnecessary and burdensome regulation . 
The role of government is crucial . 
The EU has long-established institutions and processes for evaluating risk and ensuring that unacceptable risks are avoided . 
When policy is required but the science is unclear , regulatory decisions are increasingly based on the &quot; precautionary principle , &quot; which is designed to prevent situations in which serious harm could occur . 
However , there is no universally accepted interpretation of the precautionary principle . 
North America , for example , has established a good balance between precaution and proportion . 
In Europe , by contrast , greater weight is placed on the avoidance of risk , which is undermining private-sector confidence in investing in innovation . 
The EU &apos;s goal - to protect human health and the environment - is laudable . 
But it is impossible to mitigate all risk , so aiming for this is not feasible . 
Rather , the precautionary principle should be used judiciously and rationally , balancing potential risks with the benefits that innovation and new technology might offer . 
This notion of risk underpins economic interactions . 
A risk-free approach to innovation makes it hard to solve vital issues like ensuring food , water , and energy security for a growing population , or even ensuring that Europe remains technologically competitive . 
World-changing innovations - in transport , telecommunications , medicine , and much else - are almost always the result of taking calculated risks and balancing these with the benefits that new technologies can provide . 
Risk management , after all , is not simply a matter of accepting more or less risk . 
When its nature is properly analyzed and tested , it can be effectively managed and even minimized . 
Unfortunately , this does not always appear to be the EU &apos;s approach . 
In its regulatory processes , science-based arguments are increasingly losing out to public opinion , while possible opportunities are undervalued . 
We have seen this in the European Commission &apos;s reluctance to decide how products based on green biotechnology may be used . 
But there are many similar examples of legal uncertainty threatening to undermine innovation and investment across a range of technologies and industries , including chemicals , consumer products , crop protection , electronics , nutrition , and pharmaceuticals . 
Given this regulatory environment , chief executives of 12 companies ( including BASF ) , with a combined annual research-and-development budget of â‚¬ 21 billion ( $ 28 billion ) , recently proposed the formal adoption of an &quot; innovation principle &quot; in European risk management and regulatory practice . 
The idea , conceived and developed by members of the European Risk Forum , is simple : Whenever precautionary legislation is under consideration , the impact on innovation should be fully taken into account in the policymaking process . 
The innovation principle does not set out to support innovation regardless of its impact on health or the environment . 
But the principle does seek to support an evidence-based approach , relying on sound science . 
By embracing it , Europe can dare to innovate .
