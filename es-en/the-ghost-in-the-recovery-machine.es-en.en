The Ghost in the Recovery Machine 
NEW HAVEN - The International Monetary Fund &apos;s October World Economic Outlook proclaimed that , &quot; Strong public policies have fostered a rebound of industrial production , world trade , and retail sales . &quot; 
The IMF , along with many national leaders , seem ready to give full credit to these policies for engineering what might be the end of the global economic recession . 
National leaders and international organizations do deserve substantial credit for what has been done to bring about signs of recovery since the spring . 
The international coordination of world economic policies , as formalized in the recent G-20 statement , is unprecedented in history . 
But one also suspects that world leaders have been too quick to claim so much credit for their policies . 
After all , recessions generally tend to come to an end on their own , even before there were government stabilization policies . 
For example , in the United States , the recessions of 1857-8 , 1860-61 , 1865-7 , 1882-85 , 1887-88 , 1890-91 , 1893-94 , 1895-97 , 1899-1900 , 1902-04 , 1907-8 , and 1910-12 all ended without help from the Federal Reserve , which opened its doors only in 1914 . 
Economic theorists long ago developed models that describe how recessions end on their own . 
In his 1959 book The Business Cycle , in a chapter entitled &quot; The Lower Turning Point , &quot; Cambridge University economist R. C. O. Matthews summarized a host of factors that business-cycle theorists of his day argued tend to bring on recovery automatically . 
For example , demand for investment goods may rebound , especially in certain hard-hit sectors , after a recession has caused physical capital to become technologically obsolete . 
Moreover , interest rates tend to decline in a recession , even if there is no central bank , stimulating investment demand further . 
Similarly , manufacturing can expand to restore inventories depleted by over-contraction of output , while random shocks such as major innovations or harvest variations may have an asymmetric effect in a recession , with upward shocks in some sectors having a greater impact than the downward shocks in others . 
On the financial front , the failure of weaker banks in a recession leaves survivors that benefit from greater public confidence and are therefore able to resume profitable business . 
Some of these factors , rather than just the actions taken by governments and multilateral organizations , plausibly played a role in the current economic improvement . 
Unpredictable human psychology also plays a role . 
Such factors , indeed , matter very much for the economic outlook , and for judging the success of the recovery program . 
One can start with the stock-market turnaround since March of this year , which has been stunning . 
Using monthly Sampamp ; P Composite data , the 38 % increase from March to September was the second-largest six-month increase since 1871 , surpassed only by a 71 % increase from February to August 1933 , during the Great Depression . 
This rebound is all the more remarkable given that it followed the second-largest six-month decrease ever , as stock prices fell 38 % from September 2008 to March 2009 . 
( The largest six-month decrease was , you guessed it , during the Great Depression , when the index fell 47 % from November 1931 to May 1932 . ) 
Moreover , this same sharp turnaround occurred in many countries - and for many assets , including oil prices , gold , and , in some countries , residential real estate . 
Any solid understanding of the causes of this turnaround is likely to prove elusive . 
People are still puzzling over the reasons for other major market upturns ( 1933 , 1982 , etc . ) . 
A market boom , once started , can continue for a while as a sort of social epidemic , and can foster inspiring &quot; new era &quot; stories that are spread by news media and word of mouth . 
The agreements reached at recent G-20 meetings stand as one of these stories , for they suggest a new era of international cooperation and economic professionalism - a narrative that has probably been exaggerated in the psychology of recovery . 
The G-20 story is particularly salient in the developing world , for the international recognition that the G-20 &quot; s expanded role has given to developing countries is highly resonant psychologically . 
Beyond that , stories of highly profitable banks paying huge bonuses to their executives have also inspired people to think that things are not so bad in the business world . 
Anger at these profits and bonuses only tends to increase the contagion of the story . 
But any such speculative boom is inherently unstable , as the stories evolve in time and with new shocks , whose effect on markets is most uncertain . 
It was , in fact , an excessive speculative boom in the stock market and the housing market that got us into this financial mess in the first place . 
To be sure , governments and multilateral institutions made some reasonable attempts to restore confidence . 
But they did not &quot; engineer &quot; a recovery . 
They got lucky , and the G-20 , as well as the governments that instituted stimulus packages , are currently in a honeymoon period of apparent success . 
Where our still-ailing world economy goes from here is as uncertain as the speculative markets that played such an important role in both the financial crisis and the recovery . 
We can only wish that formulating economic policy were as clear-cut as , say , mechanical engineering . 
It is not : a host of poorly understood natural cyclical factors play a role , and so do the vagaries of human psychology .
