The Battle for Russia 
PARIS - When I heard the news about the assassination of the Russian politician Boris Nemtsov in Moscow , I was reminded of a conversation I once had with a Soviet dignitary before the fall of the Berlin Wall . 
We were walking alone in the park at Versailles , talking in general terms about the twentieth century and its tragedies when my Soviet guest suddenly uttered something that has stayed with me ever since . 
&quot; Russians have suffered more in this century than any other people , &quot; he said . 
&quot; During the First and Second World Wars , no other country suffered as many deaths as we did . 
The tragedy of Russia is that it poses as great a threat to itself as it does to its neighbors . 
As Europe faces off with Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine , a larger and ultimately more important battle is taking place within Russia itself , one that pits the country &apos;s rich culture against the cruel mendacity of its politics . 
Given the nature of Putin &apos;s regime , we will likely never know the truth behind Nemtsov &apos;s murder . 
Putin has expertly used an endless and highly professional barrage of propaganda to widen the gulf between the beliefs of most Russians and those of most Westerners . 
Indeed , official propaganda - playing off deep strains of nationalism - is the key that allows the Kremlin to foment a climate of jingoism and intolerance . 
The power of Putin &apos;s propaganda can be seen in the way it resonates far beyond Russia &apos;s borders . 
During Soviet times , it was easy to understand how the communist ideal could seduce those of generous spirit , even if its promise of a just and free society ultimately turned out to be a lie . 
What is harder to explain - beyond the crass financial and commercial interests of some - is why so many in Western Europe demonstrate such an affinity for Russia today . 
For some , it may be the allure of anti-Americanism , mixed with the defense of conservative values and the rejection of liberal &quot; decadence &quot; ( for which Exhibit A is the West &apos;s growing social acceptance of same-sex marriage ) . 
Others may be searching for an ally in the face of a greater threat . 
Just as some in the West advocated cooperation with Nazi Germany against what they saw as the far more menacing Soviet threat , so today some support Putin as a partner against the danger of fundamentalist Islam . 
Russia &apos;s Western allies do not necessarily like the regime - just as many of Germany &apos;s supporters abhorred the Nazis - but there seems to be no alternative . 
In tough times , according to this view , one cannot choose one &apos;s allies . 
The result can be seen in the perfectly logical alliance between Europe &apos;s populist parties - for many of which the greater threat seems to be the European Union - and Putin &apos;s kitschy imperialism . 
For now , in the struggle for the Russian soul , its venal politics seems to have the upper hand . 
In the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union , I was lucky enough to meet young idealistic Russians like Nemtsov . 
They believed in democracy and the rule of law and did not consider these values to be incompatible with Russian history and culture . 
In their enthusiasm and audacity , they reminded me of the young generals of the French Revolution . 
These young idealists may have lost many battles , but the war is far from finished . 
Their banners rose again , shortly after Nemtsov &apos;s assassination , when tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets in protest . 
The forest of Russian flags provided a powerful symbol , a promise that another Russia was possible - and may yet still be .
