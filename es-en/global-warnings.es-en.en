Global Warnings 
You know how you are told to give your kids organic food because pesticides will give them cancer ? 
Well , it &apos;s technically true that there is a link between the chemicals and illness , but the risk is miniscule in any well-regulated country . 
There is another threat that you haven &apos;t been told much about . 
One of the best ways to avoid cancer is to eat lots of fruit and vegetables . 
Organic items are 10 % or 20 % more expensive than regular produce , so most of us naturally buy less when we &quot; go organic . &quot; 
If you reduce your child &apos;s intake of fruits and vegetables by just 0.03 grams a day ( that &apos;s the equivalent of half a grain of rice ) when you opt for more expensive organic produce , the total risk of cancer goes up , not down . 
Omit buying just one apple every 20 years because you have gone organic , and your child is worse off . 
My intention isn &apos;t to scare people away from organic food . 
Consider a tale that has made the covers of some of the world &apos;s biggest magazines and newspapers : the plight of the polar bear . 
We are told that global warming will wipe out this majestic creature . 
We are not told , however , that over the past 40 years - while temperatures have risen - the global polar bear population has increased from 5,000 to 25,000 . 
Campaigners and the media claim that we should cut our CO2 emissions to save the polar bear . 
Well , then , let &apos;s do the math . 
Let &apos;s imagine that every country in the world - including the United States and Australia - were to sign the Kyoto Protocol and cut its CO2 emissions for the rest of this century . 
Looking at the best-studied polar bear population of 1,000 bears , in the West Hudson Bay , how many polar bears would we save in a year ? 
Ten ? 
Twenty ? 
A hundred ? 
Actually , we would save less than one-tenth of a polar bear . 
If we really do care about saving polar bears , we could do something much simpler and more effective : ban hunting them . 
Each year , 49 bears are shot in the West Hudson Bay alone . 
So why don &apos;t we stop killing 49 bears a year before we commit trillions of dollars to do hundreds of times less good ? 
From the promotion of organic food to declarations of the polar bear &apos;s imminent demise , the media pelt us with a constant barrage of one-sided warnings . 
The list of urgent concerns is topped by global warming , but also includes terrorism , pesticides , and the loss of biodiversity - and seems to have virtually no end . 
All the while , we know of the terrible conditions that still face the majority of the world &apos;s population , with more than a billion poor , two billion without electricity , and three billion without clean drinking water and sanitation . 
Much of my work is to make sense of all these global warnings . 
I try to put them in perspective and figure out which ones really should concern us , and when we should act on them . 
Perhaps surprisingly , not everything of concern should be dealt with immediately . 
If we don &apos;t have a good way to fix a problem , it might be better to focus on something else first . 
After all , when you don &apos;t know where your next meal is coming from , it &apos;s hard to worry about what global temperatures will be 100 years from now . 
Things have improved immensely in both the developing and developed worlds . 
In the last 100 years , scientists have won many of the most important battles against infectious diseases , to the extent that poverty is now the main reason for a lack of treatment . 
Global average life expectancy in 1900 was 30 years ; today , it is 68 years . 
Food has become more plentiful and affordable , especially in the developing world , where calorie availability has increased by 40 % per person over the past 40 years , while food prices have more than halved . 
Consequently , the proportion of hungry in the Third World has dropped from 50 % in 1950 to less than 17 % today , while worldwide incomes have increased more than three-fold . 
Perhaps most importantly , all of these positive trends are expected to continue . 
The United Nations estimates that average life expectancy will reach 75 years by the middle of the century , and that the proportion of those going hungry will drop below 4 % . 
By the close of the century , incomes will have increased six-fold in industrialized countries and 12-fold in developing countries , making the average person in the developing world richer in 2100 than the average American or European is today . 
The number of poor will drop from a billion to less than five million . 
None of this means we should stop worrying about the future . 
Global alarm bells might cause pangs of guilt for wealthy Westerners , but they don &apos;t give us an adequate understanding of what &apos;s going on . 
We all need to hear both sides of the story .
