The Bush Bust ? 
CAMBRIDGE : America &apos;s long boom is at risk . 
Signs abound of an impending slowdown , even of recession . 
These dark clouds are gathering as transition from the Clinton to Bush Administrations gets belatedly underway . 
The quality of economic management in the new Administration &apos;s first year will set the course for many years to come . 
When President-elect Bush talks about using huge tax cuts to keep the economy humming , it is time to start worrying . 
Large tax cuts are a short-term &quot; solution &quot; that could do serious long-term damage . 
Rapid growth and huge increases in stock market wealth are nowadays almost taken as a matter of fundamental right by many Americans . 
They can &apos;t imagine the US economy slowing , or share prices falling and staying down . 
They have read too many phony analyses of the New Economy promising unbounded riches and full employment forever . 
The problem with these New Economy prophecies is that a bit of truth is mixed with huge exaggerations . 
Yes , the New Economy is delivering big increases in US productivity ; no , the New Economy has not ended economic slowdowns or recessions . 
Still , less does it guarantee that companies should have stock market prices set at several hundred times their annual earnings . 
America looks set to enter into a slowdown driven by a slowdown in business investment . 
Undoubted advances in information technology led to an incredible restructuring of the American business sector , which re-wired itself to take advantage of electronic commerce and improved computer-based management , logistics , and communications systems . 
The result was an astounding surge in business fixed investment in computers and other information technology hardware . 
Investments in information processing equipment and software rose by about 19 % per year between 1993 and 1999 , and in 1999 constituted about half of all US business equipment investment . 
This surge in business spending boosted overall demand . 
Indeed , it so greatly fueled American demand that total spending ( consumption plus investment ) actually grew much faster than production . 
The result is a trade deficit now standing at over $ 400 billion per year . 
That trade deficit is financed by foreign investments in America , as savers the world over increase their holdings of US stocks and bonds . 
The IT boom also led to visions of a long-term growth miracle in America , which in turn led to unrealistic expectations about future profitability . 
High profit expectations , in turn , contributed to the unprecedented boom in the stock market between 1996 and 1999 . 
In short , real gains in productivity due to the New Economy became exaggerated in the public &apos;s mind . 
Rapid growth is expected ; a booming stock market taken for granted . 
Now the economy reflects the fact that these expectations are out of line with reality . 
Business investment spending is slowing down , since firms have already stocked up on information technology systems and don &apos;t need to replace or upgrade them for the moment . 
Profit expectations are falling to earth , as company after company announces disappointing sales and profits . 
The stock market has fallen big , by around half since March in the high-technology NASDAQ market . 
Everybody counts on Alan Greenspan &apos;s Federal Reserve Board to save the day , and there is little doubt that an interest rate cut would help maintain strength in consumer demand and housing construction . 
But there are reasons to doubt that such a cut will affect business investment , the part of demand likely to swing sharply in the coming years . 
Moreover , the Federal Reserve will be cautious in cutting interest rates when the dollar is falling , the economy is near full employment , and higher energy prices are working their way through the economy . 
The Fed &apos;s ability to control the business cycle at this moment is modest , at best . 
In steps the Bush Administration , facing a divided Congress and a cloud over its legitimacy . 
President-elect Bush talks about his $ 1.3 trillion tax cut proposal as an &quot; insurance policy &quot; against recession . 
What was portrayed during the election campaign as a long-term measure , however dubious , is now portrayed as the medicine needed to keep America &apos;s economy growing in the short run . 
Several things are wrong with this . 
First , prolonged debate over the tax cut proposal , virtually inevitable if the new President insists on it , will create huge uncertainties in financial markets and at the Federal Reserve Board . 
If America spends the spring debating an enormous tax cut , you can bet that business and investor confidence will continue to weaken . 
Second , a large tax cut hampers the ability of the Fed to ease interest rates . 
Third , and most importantly , large tax cuts will undermine the solid fiscal conditions so crucial to America &apos;s boom . 
A return to fiscal deficits , which could result from the combination of large tax breaks and a much slower-growing economy , would make the economy more vulnerable to shocks in coming years . 
We have learned repeatedly that , in the face of a weakening economy , prudence works best . 
Desperate actions such as huge tax cuts , or huge cuts in interest rates , almost always fail . 
With prudent management , a slowdown will likely be short and mild . 
Countries who try to keep their economies growing too fast for too long , using drastic steps such as large tax cuts or highly expansionary monetary policies , frequently end up in a financial mess that takes years to clean up . 
President-elect Bush &apos;s pronouncements display an unhealthy bias towards short-run macroeconomic meddling , rather than sound emphasis on the long term .
