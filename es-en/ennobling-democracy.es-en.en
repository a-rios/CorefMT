Ennobling Democracy 
Ever since democracy appeared in ancient Athens , it has generated suspicion among those who believe that humanity &apos;s highest purpose is virtue , not freedom . 
In the Eighth Book of The Republic , Plato rather unceremoniously defines political leaders in a democracy as &quot; those who deprive the rich of their estates to distribute them among the people , at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves . &quot; 
Of course , Plato &apos;s disdain for democracy is never far from the surface of his prose , yet he has a legitimate point : how , after all , can high ethical standards be ensured when democratic elections tend to reward self-interest and the lowest common denominator ? 
The citizens of today &apos;s free societies are ( almost always ) democrats out of conviction , custom , and habit . 
Only a small minority exhibit populist tendencies that , if they gained power , could lead a society from democracy to dictatorship . 
Nevertheless , today &apos;s democratic citizens mostly lack confidence in the public sphere , and are suspicious of their own economic and political elites . 
Among the youngest voters , indeed , this impulse is very strong , with their participation in elections falling sharply . 
In Europe , this apathy is often seen as a reaction to the slowdown of what once looked like an unending postwar economic boom . 
But this is really only part of the story . 
Of course , if we could guarantee rapid and universal economic growth , democracy &apos;s other weaknesses would probably be forgotten . 
But we can &apos;t , instead what is offered is a hollow vision of the common good that consists merely in successive rounds of cuts in state expenditures . 
It is little wonder , then , that democratic citizens nowadays focus increasingly on the low ethical standards of their national elites . 
Subconsciously , citizens expect their leaders to display the ancient leadership virtues of disinterestedness , courage , and devotion to service . 
But what they see is small-mindedness and the pursuit of narrow self-interest . 
Moreover , the dramatic democratization of mores in the last 20 years has resulted in a tremendous increase in ordinary human curiosity about people in the limelight : who our leaders are , how they live , and what they really believe . 
Former French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand was probably the last European statesman who was treated by his nation like a monarch of old . 
His numerous personal failings and indiscretions were never publicly judged . 
Today , tabloid media show us everything , and subject everything to public judgment . 
So the heads of our democracies are treated like a famous person living next door . 
The door is open , and we don &apos;t like what we see . 
During a recent hearing before a Polish parliamentary investigative committee , a state functionary responded to the simplest questions of fact by repeating the phrase , &quot; I don &apos;t remember . &quot; 
When pressed about his failing memory , he impatiently responded , &quot; Why am I expected to remember things in a country in which the president does not remember whether he graduated from university ? &quot; 
The former Polish president , Aleksander Kwasniewski , had , it seemed , provided a perverse lesson in virtue when , having been caught lying about his educational credentials , protested that he did not remember whether he had actually defended his master &apos;s thesis as required to receive his degree . 
In such an environment , can public ethics be revived ? 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , as one of his first initiatives , proposed a ban on &quot; golden parachutes &quot; for departing managers of firms traded on the stock exchange , in order to halt the practice of taking huge severance payments without the consent of shareholders . 
Sarkozy correctly assumed that managers of publicly-traded firms , much like politicians , are public figures who should be held to a minimum ethical standard of behavior . 
In Switzerland , Thomas Minder , the head of the cosmetics company Trybol , is fighting the same battle , and demanding a national referendum . 
In Germany , the Federal Constitutional Court has ordered parliamentarians to reveal their outside income - often from lobbying activities on behalf of big business - on the Internet . 
In Poland , where for many years such practices have been considered criminal , a proposed law would require full financial transparency for politicians and high state functionaries . 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , for his part , has proposed lifting the immunity that past prime ministers enjoyed in connection with the sale of peerages . 
Even if these initiatives are motivated by party rivalry , they nevertheless pose an essential question : do we know how to ennoble our democracy ? 
Can we impose on ourselves a corset of higher ethical standards , thereby refuting Plato &apos;s objections to democracy , which are no less our own ? 
Europe can take the lead in writing ethics back into politics . 
The reform treaty that is to be adopted in 2009 is aimed at overcoming the EU &apos;s supposed &quot; democratic deficit . &quot; 
But rendering Europe &apos;s political institutions accountable to citizens is only half the battle . 
Preserving the democratic life of the EU and its member states implies a duty - which should be enshrined in the treaty - to uphold standards of official behavior that today &apos;s citizens demand .
