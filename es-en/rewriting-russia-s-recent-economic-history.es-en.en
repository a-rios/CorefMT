Rewriting Russia \ u0027s Recent Economic History 
Ten years ago this month , Russia &apos;s parliament , the Duma , was seeking to impeach then President Boris Yeltsin , initiating a time of stalemate and struggle that ended seven months later when Yeltsin ordered tanks to fire on the Duma &apos;s headquarters . 
Yeltsin &apos;s victory settled who ruled Russia and who would determine economic policy . 
But were Yeltsin &apos;s economic policy choices the right ones for Russia ? 
The move from communism to capitalism in Russia after 1991 was supposed to bring unprecedented prosperity . 
It did not . 
By the time of the ruble crisis of August 1998 , output had fallen by almost half and poverty had increased from 2 % of the population to over 40 % . 
Russia &apos;s performance since then has been impressive , yet its GDP remains almost 30 % below what it was in 1990 . 
At 4 % growth per annum , it will take Russia &apos;s economy another decade to get back to where it was when communism collapsed . 
A transition that lasts two decades , during which poverty and inequality increase enormously as a few become wealthy , cannot be called a victory for capitalism or democracy . 
Moreover , the longer-run prospects are far from rosy : with investment a mere 10 % of what it was in 1990 , even if that investment is better allocated , how can growth be sustained ? 
IMF-style neo-liberals are now trotting out an interpretation that amounts to a belated declaration of victory . 
The pre-1998 period of economic decline , on their view , reflected a stalled transition process , whereas the ruble crisis finally jolted the authorities into action , with recovery following implementation of far-reaching reforms . 
But the real explanation lies elsewhere - and is much simpler . 
Until 1998 , the ruble was overvalued , making it impossible for domestic producers to compete with imports . 
The IMF did not want Russia to devalue , and it provided billions of dollars to prop up the exchange rate . 
The IMF and the US Treasury worried that any change would restart inflation , because there was little or no excess productive capacity . 
This was a remarkable confession : these officials evidently believed that their policies had wrecked nearly half of Russia &apos;s economic capacity in the space of just a few years - a level of destruction not even Hitler &apos;s Nazi armies had achieved . 
They shunted aside micro-level data that showed that there was in fact excess capacity , just as they ignored a World Bank analysis showing that fresh IMF loans would not restore economic growth , but would only leave the country deeper in debt . 
The results were predictable : the 1998 bailout did not work , but devaluation did . 
It turned out that there was enormous excess capacity , and import substitution soon began , even in the midst of financial turmoil . 
Imports plummeted by nearly 50 % in the year after devaluation , as consumers were forced to buy Russian-made food , clothes , and other goods . 
Later , higher world oil prices provided a further boost to the economy , generating funds for investment and expansion . 
Capital controls - another neo-liberal bugbear - were imposed , and domestic investors looked for opportunities at home instead of in New York or Cyprus or the Cote d &apos;Azur . 
Yes , the market economy can provide incentives for wealth creation . 
Unfortunately , under the preceding years of IMF programs , the market economy with high interest rates , illegitimate privatization , poor corporate governance , and capital-market liberalization provided only incentives for asset stripping . 
Growth was caused by the change in the economic environment , a change that Russia made for itself . 
The reformist parliament elected in December 1999 in tandem with President Vladimir Putin &apos;s reformist administration lowered tax rates , overhauled the judicial system , legislated private ownership of land , and adopted new banking laws . 
These are positive reforms , but they do not explain the burst of post-crisis growth , which began before any of them were passed , let alone put in place . 
Indeed , even with the turmoil of default and devaluation , and despite the usual 12-18-month lag in the impact of devaluation , Russia was growing at 5.4 % annually by the end of 1999 . 
In the long run , we should be concerned not just with the pace of economic growth but with the type of society that is created . 
To Russia &apos;s so-called reformers , the enormous concentration of ownership in Russia that emerged in the 1990 &apos;s is of no concern , so long as it generates growth . 
But there is another vision of a market economy , one based on greater equality , and which uses the power of markets to bring prosperity not just to the few but to all of society . 
That Russia &apos;s transition did not achieve this is no a surprise . 
That goal was not a part of the reformers &apos; vision . 
The great paradox is that their view of economics was so stilted , so ideologically driven , that they failed even in their narrower objective of bringing about economic growth . 
What they achieved was undiluted decline . 
No rewriting of history will change this .
