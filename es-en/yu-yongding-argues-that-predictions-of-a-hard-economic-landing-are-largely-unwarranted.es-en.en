Taming the China Bears 
BEIJING - The market is always in search of a story , and investors , it seems , think they have found a new one this year in China . 
The country &apos;s growth slowdown and mounting financial risks have spurred a growing wave of pessimism , with economists worldwide warning of an impending crash . 
But dire predictions for China have abounded for the last 30 years , and not one has materialized . 
Are today &apos;s really so different ? 
The short answer is no . 
Like the predictions of the past , today &apos;s warnings are based on historical precedents and universal indicators against which China , with its unique economic features , simply cannot be judged accurately . 
The bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China &apos;s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail-oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible . 
Predictions are largely pointless , given that the assumptions underpinning them will invariably change . 
Consider China &apos;s high leverage ratio , which many argue will be a key factor in causing a crisis . 
After all , they contend , developing countries that have experienced a large-scale credit boom have all ended up facing a credit crisis and a hard economic landing . 
But several specific factors must be accounted for in assessing whether this is China &apos;s fate . 
While China &apos;s debt / GDP ratio is very high , the same is true in many successful East Asian economies , such as Taiwan , Singapore , South Korea , Thailand , and Malaysia . 
And China &apos;s saving rate is much higher . 
Ceteris paribus , the higher the saving rate , the less likely it is that a high debt / GDP ratio will trigger a financial crisis . 
In fact , China &apos;s high debt / GDP ratio is , to a large extent , a result of its simultaneously high saving and investment rates . 
And , while the inability to repay loans can contribute to a high debt burden , the nonperforming-loan ( NPL ) ratio for China &apos;s major banks stands at less than 1 % . 
If , based on these considerations , one concludes that China &apos;s debt / GDP ratio does constitute a substantial threat to its financial stability , there remains the question of whether a crisis is likely to occur . 
Only when all of the specific linkages between a high debt burden and the onset of a financial crisis have been identified can one draw even a tentative conclusion about that . 
China &apos;s real-estate price bubble is often named as a likely catalyst for a crisis . 
But how such a downturn would unfold is far from certain . 
Let us assume that the real-estate bubble has burst . 
In China , there are no subprime mortgages , and the down payment on the purchase price required to qualify for financing can exceed 50 % . 
Given that property prices are unlikely to fall by such a large margin , the bubble &apos;s collapse would not bring down China &apos;s banks . 
Even if real-estate prices fell by more than 50 % , commercial banks could survive - not least because mortgages account for only about 20 % of banks &quot; total assets . 
At the same time , plummeting prices would attract new homebuyers in major cities , causing the market to stabilize . 
And China &apos;s recently announced urbanization strategy should ensure that cities &quot; demographic structure supports intrinsic demand . 
If that were not enough to ward off disaster , the government could purchase unsold properties and use them for social housing . 
Moreover , if necessary , banks could recover funds by selling collateral . 
As a last resort , the government could step in , as it did in the late 1990 &quot; s and early 2000 &quot; s , to remove NPLs from banks &quot; balance sheets . 
Indeed , China has a massive war chest of foreign-exchange reserves that it would not hesitate to use to inject capital into commercial banks . 
That remains a highly unlikely scenario . 
China &apos;s banking system does face risks stemming from a maturity mismatch between loans and deposits . 
But the mismatch is less severe than some observers believe . 
In fact , the average term of deposits in China &apos;s banks is about nine months , while medium- and long-term loans account for just over half of total outstanding credit . 
A more salient threat would arise if the government pursued too much capital-account liberalization too fast . 
If China eases restrictions on cross-border capital flows , an unexpected shock could trigger large-scale capital flight , bringing down the entire financial system . 
Given this , it is vital that China maintains controls over short-term cross-border capital flows in the foreseeable future . 
Likewise , the Chinese government must address a fundamental contradiction . 
Monetary interest rates have increased steadily , owing to rampant regulatory arbitrage ( whereby banks find loopholes that enable them to avoid unfavorable rules ) and the fragmentation of the credit market , while return on capital has fallen rapidly because of overcapacity . 
If the Chinese government fails to reverse this trend , a financial crisis - in one form or another - will become inevitable . 
But , given the authorities &quot; broad scope for policy intervention , the crash will not come anytime soon - if it comes at all .
