War Without End on Congo &apos;s Women 
NEW YORK - The violence in Congo is unspeakable . 
But , if the horror of Congo &apos;s recent wars - which have killed more people than any war since World War II - is to end , the unspeakable must be spoken . 
Across the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo , government soldiers , members of renegade government military units , and myriad militias are gang raping untold thousands of women . 
They are making sex slaves of some women , branding some victims like cattle , and maiming and mutilating women and girls , some as young as three years old , by destroying their vaginas and other internal organs . 
Sometimes , the gunmen force their victims &quot; fathers , brothers , and husbands to rape them , or the women to eat the flesh of their murdered relatives . 
Afterward , many of the women find themselves utterly alone as they suffer the physical and psychological effects of trauma and cope with destitution , unwanted pregnancies and children , HIV / AIDS , and ostracism by their loved ones who shun them as &quot; diseased &quot; or &quot; tainted . &quot; 
Who are these killers and rapists , these men who have committed appalling crimes for more than a decade with complete impunity ? 
Many are the so-called &quot; genocidaires &quot; who fled from Rwanda into Congo after participating in the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis in 1994 . 
Others are Rwandan rebels and members of Congo &apos;s army . 
Still others are men and boys recruited and press-ganged into militia units . 
Violence has displaced more than 350,000 people in eastern Congo since the beginning of 2007 . 
Recently , thousands more fled fresh outbreaks of fighting between local militias and supporters of Laurent Nkunda , a renegade general of Congo &apos;s army , who has rejected a call to begin disarming his troops . 
A United Nations peacekeeping force deployed in eastern Congo was supposed to have protected the region &apos;s civilians ; the peacekeeping force &apos;s failure to safeguard the women has gone unremarked , in part , because a veil of silence surrounds what is occurring . 
Women in the eastern Congo have no say in the decision-making that drives the conflict consuming so many of their lives . 
They have no access to political and economic power in a society that considers them of scant value . 
Congo &apos;s government has undertaken no significant effort to bring those responsible for these gender atrocities to justice ; new laws have paid lip service to sexual violence , but no one has been prosecuted . 
The international community , too , has failed . 
The International Criminal Court in The Hague , which is investigating the crimes in eastern Congo , has only this week indicted the first Congolese militia commander for gender-based crimes . 
It is Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon &apos;s duty to speak up , to take a leadership role , to bring this situation before the Security Council , call for it to meet in a special session , and urge it to take effective action immediately . 
Thousand more peacekeepers - let many of them be women - must be deployed in the affected provinces . 
The Chief Prosecutor of the ICC , Luis Moreno Ocampo , should be urged to accelerate his investigations and , once the evidence is sufficient , bring charges against those who have committed these crimes or failed to discipline or prosecute the perpetrators . 
The local authorities should be assisted in efforts to pursue , arrest , and prosecute accused perpetrators before new local tribunals that enjoy significant prosecutorial and police powers . 
Support should be given to courageous local women &apos;s groups that are providing care to the victims . 
Medical and other assistance is needed to treat the overwhelming numbers of victims . 
If the people with the power to end the violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo maintain their silence and continue to do nothing , the perpetrators will grow only bolder in their destruction of women &apos;s lives . 
When impunity for unspeakable acts goes unchallenged , those acts become even more unspeakable .
