The Global March Toward Peace 
CANBERRA - If we were hoping for peace in our time , 2012 did not deliver it . 
Conflict grew ever bloodier in Syria , continued to grind on in Afghanistan , and flared up periodically in West , Central , and East Africa . 
There were multiple episodes of ethnic , sectarian , and politically motivated violence in Myanmar ( Burma ) , South Asia , and around the Middle East . 
Tensions between China and its neighbors have escalated in the South China Sea , and between China and Japan in the East China Sea . 
Concerns about North Korea &apos;s and Iran &apos;s nuclear programs remain unresolved . 
And yet , many feared eruptions within and between states did not occur . 
Strong international pressure helped to contain the Second Gaza War quickly . 
A long-sought peace agreement was secured for the southern Philippine island of Mindanao . 
Major strides were taken toward sustainable peace and reconciliation in Myanmar . 
There was no major new genocidal catastrophe . 
And , despite the United Nations Security Council &apos;s paralysis over Syria , UN General Assembly member states made clear their continuing overwhelming acceptance of the responsibility to protect those at risk of mass-atrocity crimes . 
The bigger story has been concealed , as ever , by the media &apos;s daily preoccupation with current bloodshed : Over the last two decades , major wars and episodes of mass violence worldwide have become much less frequent and deadly . 
After a high point in the late 1980 &quot; s and very early 1990 &quot; s , there has been a decline of well over 50 % in the number of major conflicts both between and within states ; in the number of genocidal and other mass atrocities ; and in the number of people killed as a result of them . 
This &quot; New Peace &quot; phenomenon was first publicized by Andrew Mack &apos;s Human Security Report Project , supported by the superb database of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program . 
Harvard &apos;s Steven Pinker , in his seminal book The Better Angels of our Nature , put it in a larger historical context - not just the &quot; Long Peace &quot; between the major powers since 1945 , but , more important , a centuries-old pattern of steady decline in the human appetite for violence . 
The many efforts that have been made to debunk this analysis ( for example , by John Arquilla in Foreign Policy recently ) have not been persuasive . 
True , there has been a resurgence since 2004 of what statisticians ( if not humanists ) would call &quot; minor armed conflicts . &quot; 
But , in the case of &quot; high-intensity &quot; conflicts or wars ( defined as entailing 1,000 or more battle deaths in a year ) , the trend-line has been sloping unequivocally downward . 
And that goes for war-related civilian deaths as well . 
Explanations of this phenomenon vary . 
In the case of the post-Cold War New Peace , the best is simply the huge upsurge in conflict prevention , conflict management , negotiated peacemaking , and post-conflict peace-building activity that has occurred over the last decade and a half - most of it spearheaded by the much-maligned UN . 
For the Long Peace , the most intriguing explanation - and , I think , the most persuasive , though many may disagree - is that since the end of World War II , a fundamental normative shift has occurred among the major powers &quot; policymakers . 
Having witnessed the ravages of the last century , they simply no longer see any virtue , nobility , or utility in waging war , and certainly not aggressive nuclear war . 
That doesn &apos;t mean that we cannot stumble into a war - or a nuclear exchange - through accident , miscalculation , system error , or sabotage ; but , it hugely reduces the risk . 
The greatest test for this thesis in the years ahead will be how China and the United States react to the dramatic shift now occurring in their relative economic , and eventually military , power . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s re-election offers reasonable hope that the US will give some strategic space to China through a policy of mutually accommodating cooperation , rather than insisting on dominance or primacy . 
But how will China behave under its new leadership ? 
In a deeply thoughtful recent speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington , DC , Kevin Rudd , Australia &apos;s Mandarin-speaking former prime minister , described possible external scenarios for China over the next decade . 
They ranged from actively pursuing zero-sum power politics aimed at dominating the hemisphere and beyond , to engaging strategically with the US and other partners in Asia to sustain and enhance the existing rules-based international order . 
While suggesting that it would be prudent for countries to hedge against the worst-case scenario , Rudd made clear that he is an optimist : provided the rest of the world maintains a policy of cooperative engagement with China , incoming President Xi Jinping and his team will choose a non-confrontational path . 
Optimism is a good call in this context , and also more generally . 
There are strong historical grounds for believing that waging aggressive war has simply run its course as an instrument of state policy . 
Having exhausted most of the alternatives over the years , national leaders have begun to internalize the virtues of cooperation . 
Moreover , in foreign policy , as in life itself , outlooks can be self-reinforcing , and self-fulfilling . 
Pessimists see conflict of one kind or another as more or less inevitable , and adopt a highly wary and competitive approach to the conduct of international relations . 
For optimists , what matters is believing in and nurturing the instinct of cooperation in the hope , and expectation , that decent human values will ultimately prevail . 
If we want to change the world for the better , we must start by believing that it is possible .
