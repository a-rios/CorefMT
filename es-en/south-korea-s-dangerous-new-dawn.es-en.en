South Korea \ u0027s Dangerous New Dawn 
North Korea &apos;s decision to expel UN atomic energy inspectors is but another reason to view Roh Moo Hyun &apos;s election as South Korea &apos;s president two weeks ago as an historical watershed . 
The beginning of his term not only coincides with one of the most dangerous episodes on the Korean peninsula in decades , but his presidency will also test South Korea &apos;s relations with the US to a degree that has not been seen for many years . 
Roh &apos;s victory over Lee Hoi Chang signifies a generational shift in Korean politics , with the young determined to gain a freer hand in Korea &apos;s relations with the US . 
Indeed , generational differences were the deciding factor in the race , replacing the regional sentiments that dominated every presidential race before this one . 
According to one report , over 60 % of people in their twenties and thirties voted for Roh to produce a margin of 2.3 % in this first two-man , head-to-head presidential race in 31 years . 
Roh &apos;s populist and nationalist stance will be swiftly and sorely tested by reality when he assumes power in February . 
But couple the generational changeover thaty put him in office with a strong popular desire for continued engagement with North Korea - notwithstanding North Korea &apos;s growing nuclear brinkmanship - and the recipe is complete for disputes with the US . 
Roh , a self-made man who passed a bar examination without going to college and law school , succeeded in convincing voters that he would usher in a new brand of politics reflecting South Korea &apos;s growing wealth and middle class sentiments , thereby sweeping away insider-dominated politics , regional bickering , and factional struggles . 
His style and rhetoric projected the fresh ( for Korea ! ) image of a common man committed to eliminating the ossified networks of cronyism and corruption . 
For the first time in modern Korean history , the presidential campaign actually debated the central issues facing the country , rather than focussing on parties and personalities . 
Candidate Roh called for a new relationship between South Korea and the US , one based on the principle of independence and equality . 
For example , he said that he would not kow-tow to the US or visit Washington just for the sake of a photo opportunity He also promised to continue President Kim Dae Jung &apos;s &quot; Sunshine policy &quot; of engagement with the North . 
Remarkably , Roh won the election despite North Korea &apos;s decision to reactivate nuclear reactors that had been frozen since 1994 . 
A few years ago this would have doomed Roh &apos;s candidacy . 
That he overcame this obstacle without changing his stance on engaging North Korea means that times have radically changed . 
A popular yearning for change , not the security situation , is now the overriding concern of ordinary Koreans . 
Roh &apos;s campaign also took advantage of a rising tide of anti-Americanism . 
The acquittal by a US military court of two American soldiers who accidentally killed two Korean schoolgirls with their armored car last June triggered street demonstrations across the country . 
Although President George W. Bush apologized twice for the deaths of the girls , demands continue to escalate for changing the Status of Force Agreement ( SOFA ) that governs the legal treatment of American troops stationed in South Korea . 
Ordinary Koreans insist that US soldiers who commit crimes should be tried in Korean courts . 
This expression of wounded national pride was enabled by South Korea &apos;s tremendous performance in the World Cup football tournament last summer , which helped convince ordinary Koreans that their country was fully grown up - and thus might be able to stand on its own without the presence of 37,000 US troops . 
Indeed , many ordinary people now view the US presence , and not North Korea &apos;s communist regime , as the biggest obstacle to unification . 
According to a recent poll , only 54.8 % of Koreans now support the stationing of American troops in the country , while 31.7 % oppose it . 
These sentiments will form part of the diplomatic test shaping Roh &apos;s presidency from the start , for he must re-engineer relations with America at the same time that the Bush administration is fretting about North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions and its role in spreading weapons of mass destruction to rogue states . 
For now , Korean voters - apparently impervious to the threat that North Korea &apos;s nuclear weapons poses - support Roh &apos;s policy of maintaining dialogue and economic exchange with the North . 
Under President Roh , South Korea &apos;s domestic politics and relations with the US and North Korea will require an almost total overhaul . 
Can he walk the tightrope of maintaining security on the peninsula , keeping America engaged , and retaining the support of the voters who elected him ? 
Reconciling those goals would test even the most experienced and cynical of politicians , so it is anyone &apos;s guess as to whether President Roh can succeed . 
Failure , however , offers such a horrific prospect that no one can possibly hope for it .
