Europe and Its Discontents 
LONDON : Waves of street protests by French farmers , fishermen and truck drivers against surging fuel prices dominate television and newspapers . 
If Europe is moving into an autumn and winter of discontent , however , it is not so much because French truckers are blockading oil refineries in France , as because some key political issues on the European agenda seem to be getting out of hand and out of control , especially in Germany and Britain . 
In one sense , indeed , the French protests are reassuringly familiar . 
Street demonstrations ( or , as the French say : Amanif &quot; ) are a traditional part of the political vocabulary in France , and these seem to be evolving along customary lines . 
On this occasion , the socialist government of Lionel Jospin belatedly tried to summon a bit more firmness than usual , but otherwise it &apos;s a familiar story : alarming to foreigners , but not very surprising or disturbing to the French . 
Recent events in Germany , by contrast , are less traditional and more worrying . 
First , there is the spate of neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners , which hit the headlines again recently when three young skinheads were convicted and sentenced for killing a black Mozambican man . 
In one sense , this is not a new phenomenon . 
Over the past decade 90 people died in anti-immigrant attacks in Germany ; and these attacks appear to be directly related , first to the collapse of the East German economy after re-unification , and second to a huge wave of refugees , especially from the Balkans . 
Yet the government is obviously worried by the upsurge of xenophobia and neo-Nazi violence . 
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has been actively campaigning for tougher measures by police and the courts , and has called on the German people to have the courage to stand up against anti-foreigner racism . 
The second worrying development in Germany - intimately linked to the first - is the latest twist in the debate on the planned enlargement of the European Union to bring in ten or more countries from Central and Eastern Europe . 
It has long been clear that there is a substantial difference of opinion on this issue between the German people and their leaders : the political élite sees enlargement as a moral and strategic imperative ; voters fear a flood of immigrants and job-seekers from the East . 
The spat between Austria , Germany and the Czech Republic over the opening of a Soviet-designed nuclear plant near the Austrian border complicates Germany &apos;s response even more . 
With the passage of time , enlargement has become more unpopular , not less : at last count , only 20 % of Germans are keen on the idea , and 68 % are unenthusiastic . 
Unfortunately , there is an analogous picture elsewhere in the EU . 
In France only 21 % are keen , and 71 % are unenthusiastic ; the EU average is only 27 % pro , 60 % anti . 
Support for enlargement , however , is lowest in Germany , especially in East Germany , where voting has been decisive in determining the outcomes of all recent German elections . 
What really stirred things up are recent suggestions by Günther Verheugen , the German member of the European Commission who ( as it happens ) holds the portfolio for eastward expansion , that eastward enlargement should be put to the German people in a referendum . 
As things stand , this is impossible , because Germany &apos;s constitution does not provide for holding referenda ; so the first step would have to be a revision of the Constitution . 
Still , some German politicians , especially in the ruling SPD , are in principle in favour of giving the people their say in referenda . 
Mr Verheugen argued that a referendum would force Germany &apos;s political élite to take more account of the concerns of the people , which they failed to do when taking Germany into the single European currency . 
Indeed , German public opinion remains deeply ambivalent about the euro , and increasingly disillusioned its continual decline against the dollar ( and the pound ) . 
Chancellor Schröder shrugged off the euro &apos;s recent weakness by saying it was good for exports - which immediately triggered a further decline , and prompted the newspaper Bild to headline &quot; The Curse of the Euro . &quot; 
Chancellor Schröder &apos;s response to Verheugen &apos;s suggestion was merely to reiterate that his government remains firmly committed to early enlargement of the EU . 
But it is only too easy to imagine what would be the consequence of holding a referendum : enlargement would almost certainly be rejected in practice and in principle by a large majority . 
In Britain , by contrast , we are now seeing a steep intensification of political controversy , not about enlargement ( even though it is unpopular ) , but about the question of membership of the single currency . 
The ever-active anti-Euro lobby has now spawned a new grouping called &quot; NO , &quot; led by Lord David Owen , the former foreign secretary , to oppose not just membership of the euro , but even the holding of a referendum on the issue . 
They claim that the government intends to &quot; bounce &quot; Britain into the euro in the next year or so , against the wishes of the people . 
The irony is that it was the Euro-sceptics who originally secured the commitment to a referendum on the euro . 
It is that commitment by which the government is now bound . 
&quot; Bouncing &quot; Britain in is simply impossible . 
British public opinion is now so hostile , to the EU in general and to the euro in particular , that a referendum could not be won without a massive government campaign of persuasion . 
Denmark &apos;s government has done just this and seems to be bringing the Danish public around to the idea of joining the euro . 
Prime Minister Tony Blair is apparently convinced of the strategic desirability of joining the euro , but because a Yes vote in a referendum now looks so implausible he is unlikely to try . 
This means that Britain will stay on the outside , not just for a long time , but for good . 
So much for the virtues of referenda .
