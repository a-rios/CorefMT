Economists &quot; New World Order 
Most academic economics rely on concepts laid down at the beginning of the twentieth century by the British economist Alfred Marshall , who said that &quot; nature does not make leaps . &quot; 
Yet we economists find ourselves increasingly disturbed by the apparent inadequacy of the neo-Marshallian toolkit that we have built to explain our world . 
The central bias of this toolkit is that we should trust the market to solve the problems we set it , and that we should not expect small ( or even large ) changes to have huge effects . 
A technological leap that raises the wages of the skilled and educated will induce others to become skilled and educated , restoring balance so that inequality does not grow too much . 
So a country where labor productivity is low will become an attractive location for foreign direct investment , and the resulting increase in the capital-labor ratio will raise productivity . 
Wherever one looks , using Marshall &apos;s toolkit , one sees economic equilibrium pulling things back to normal , compensating for and attenuating the effects of shocks and disturbances . 
Marshall &apos;s economics has had a marvelous run , and has helped economists make sense of the world . 
Yet there is a sense that progress and understanding will require something new - an economics of virtuous circles , thresholds , and butterfly effects , in which small changes have very large effects . 
Perhaps this has always been so . 
By the standards of centuries ago , we live in a world of unbelievable wealth . 
Within two generations human literacy will be nearly universal . 
Yet three centuries ago there was also technological progress , from the mechanical clock and the watermill to the cannon and the caravel , and on to strains of rice that can be cropped three times a year in Guangzhou and the breeding of merino sheep that can flourish in the hills of Spain . 
But these innovations served only to increase the human population , not raise median standards of living . 
Today , if we divided up equally what we produce worldwide , would it give us a standard of living ten times that of our pre-industrial ancestors ? 
Twenty times ? 
A hundred times ? 
Does the question even have meaning ? 
David Landes likes to tell the story of Nathan Meyer Rothschild , the richest man in the world in the first half of the nineteenth century , dead in his fifties of an infected abscess . 
If you gave him the choice of the life he led as the finance-prince of Europe or a life today low-down in the income distribution but with thirty extra years to see his great-grandchildren , which would he choose ? 
No doubt , we live today in an extraordinarily unequal world . 
There are families today near Xian , in what was the heartland of the Tang Dynasty Empire , with two-acre dry wheat farms and a single goat . 
There are other families throughout the world that could buy that wheat farm with one day &apos;s wages . 
Marshall &apos;s economics - the equilibrium economics of comparative statics , of shifts in supply and demand curves , and of accommodating responses - is of almost no help in accounting for this . 
Why , worldwide , did median standards of living stagnate for so long ? 
Why has the rate of growth undergone an acceleration that is extraordinarily rapid over so short a period ? 
Where is the economics of invention , innovation , adaptation , and diffusion ? 
Not in Marshall . 
And why is today &apos;s world so unequal that it is hard to find any measures of global distribution that do not show divergence at least up until the 1980 &quot; s ? 
It has been generations since economists Robert Solow and Moses Abramovitz pointed out that Marshall &apos;s toolkit is a poor aid for understanding modern economic growth . 
The real sources of growth are not to be found in supplies and demands and the allocation of scarce resources to alternative uses , but in technological and organizational change - about which economists have too little to say . 
Economic historians like Ken Pomeranz rightly point out that before the Industrial Revolution , differences in median standards of living across the high civilizations of Eurasia were relatively small . 
A peasant in the Yangtze Valley in the late seventeenth century had a different style of life than his or her contemporary peasant in the Thames Valley , but not one that was clearly better or worse . 
Two centuries later that was no longer the case : by the end of the nineteenth century , median living standards in Britain and other countries to which the Industrial Revolution had spread were , for the first time in recorded history , light-years above any neo-Malthusian benchmark of subsistence . 
The early industrial-era economic accomplishments occurred despite the loss of a substantial proportion of national income to support a corrupt , decadent , and profligate aristocracy . 
They occurred despite a tripling of the population , which put extraordinary Malthusian pressure on the economy underlying natural resource base , and despite the mobilization of an unprecedented proportion of national income for nearly a century of intensive war against France , a power with three times Britain &apos;s population . 
How , exactly , did these accomplishments occur ? 
What were the small differences that turned out to matter so much ? 
Economists are now awakening to the realization that the most interesting questions they face were always beyond the reach of Marshall &apos;s toolkit . 
Clearly , economics - if it is to succeed and progress - must be very different in a generation from what it is today .
