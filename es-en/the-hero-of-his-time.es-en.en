The Hero of His Time 
Boris Yeltsin was utterly unique . 
Russia &apos;s first democratically elected leader , he was also the first Russian leader to give up power voluntarily , and constitutionally , to a successor . 
Using various mixtures of charisma , statecraft , and terror , Peter the Great , Catherine the Great , Alexander II , Peter Stolypin ( the last tsar &apos;s prime minister ) , Lenin , and Stalin all sought to make Russia not only a great military power , but also an economic and cultural equal of the West . 
Yeltsin aimed for the same goal . 
At the height of Yeltsin &apos;s career , many Russians identified with his bluntness , impulsiveness , sensitivity to personal slight , even with his weakness for alcohol . 
Only in the last few months of his second presidential term , after he launched the second war in Chechnya in September 1999 , did he and his lieutenants regain some legitimacy in the eyes of the Russian public , while causing revulsion among any remaining Western admirers . 
Despite his caprices , however , Yeltsin kept Russia on a course of broad strategic co-operation with America and its allies . 
Although he opposed America &apos;s use of force against Iraq and Serbia in the 1990 &quot; s , his government never formally abandoned the sanctions regime against either country . 
Moreover , no nuclear weapons were unleashed , deliberately or accidentally , and no full-scale war of the kind that ravaged post-communist Yugoslavia broke out between Russia and any of its neighbors , although several of them were locked in internal or regional conflict in which Russia &apos;s hand was visible . 
The tasks that faced Yeltsin when he attained power in 1991 were monumental . 
At several crucial moments , he established himself as the only person who could rise to the challenges of transforming Russia from a dictatorship into a democracy , from a planned economy into a free market , and from an empire into a medium-ranked power . 
In 1992 , as the emerging Russian Federation teetered on the brink of economic and monetary collapse , he opted for radical reform , prompting a backlash from vested interest groups . 
In the years that followed , he would tilt toward liberal economics whenever he felt powerful enough to do so . 
Yeltsin was quintessentially a product of the Soviet system , which makes his turn to democracy and the free market , though imperfect , even more miraculous . 
The son of a poor building worker , he had a meteoric rise through communist ranks to become party boss in the industrial city of Sverdlovsk ( now Yekaterinburg ) in the Urals . 
Unlike most other party leaders , he was good at talking to ordinary people , a skill that helped him win support and then power later , but he also showed no sign of questioning the Marxist-Leninist gobbledygook that he was required to recite at public events . 
It was only after Mikhail Gorbachev summoned Yeltsin to Moscow in 1985 that he began to differentiate himself from dozens of other senior party apparatchiks . 
Sensing the bitter frustration of Moscow &apos;s middle class-in-waiting , Yeltsin quickly gained a reputation as a harsh , if not always coherent , critic of the party &apos;s old guard . 
Campaigners for democracy admired Yeltsin &apos;s struggle against the conservatives in the politburo - especially after he was forced out of the party &apos;s inner circle in November 1987 . 
Determined to outbid Gorbachev as a reformer , he persuaded liberals to overcome their distrust of his provincial manners . 
They gave him lessons in democratic theory , while he gave them tactical advice . 
As the Soviet Union steadily disintegrated , with virtually all of its 15 republics straining at the leash , Yeltsin gained the leadership of the largest - the Russian Federation - which placed him in a tactical alliance with independence campaigners in Ukraine , the Baltic states , and Georgia . 
By June 1991 , after quashing a series of challenges to his leadership , he became the first elected president of Russia ; two months later , real power fell into his hands , after the failed putsch against Gorbachev of August 1991 by conservatives seeking to prevent the Soviet Union &apos;s disintegration . 
For most Westerners and many Russians , his finest hour came on August 19th that year , when he stood on a tank outside the Russian parliament and defied the hardliners who had seized power . 
But Yeltsin himself never succeeded in fully throwing off the intellectual shackles of the past . 
As president , he talked of economic performance as if it could be improved by decree . 
Like most Russians , he wanted the material advantages of capitalism , but had little respect or understanding for the rule of law and dispersion of power , which makes capitalist institutions work . 
Nevertheless , for most of his presidency , Yeltsin kept alive - albeit with many tactical retreats - the goal of economic reform . 
At some level , he sensed that Russia &apos;s potential could be unleashed only if the government either faced down , or bought off , the special interests - military , industrial , and agricultural - that stood in the way . 
The economic orthodoxy pursued after the collapse of 1998 laid the groundwork for today &apos;s sustained Russian boom . 
Yeltsin &apos;s tragedy , and Russia &apos;s , was that , when the country needed a leader with vision and determination , it found an agile political operator instead . 
By not permitting Russia to disintegrate into anarchy or leading it back to authoritarianism , Yeltsin kept the way open for such a leader to one day emerge . 
Unfortunately , that man is not his handpicked successor , Vladimir Putin , who has only perpetuated the vicious cycles of Russian history .
