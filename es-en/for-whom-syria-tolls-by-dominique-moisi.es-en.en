For Whom Syria Tolls 
PARIS - With every passing week , the Syrian conflict increasingly resembles the Spanish Civil War . 
The images of warplanes bombing civilians and destroying cities have turned Aleppo into a latter-day version of Guernica , immortalized in Picasso &apos;s masterpiece . 
But the real similarities between the two conflicts are to be found in the behavior of the international community &apos;s main actors , which have again taken opposite sides . 
On one side stand Russia and Iran , cynically determined to buttress President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
On the other side stand the established democracies , hesitant and ambivalent in their support of the rebels . 
In 1930 &quot; s Spain , of course , Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy fully supported General Francisco Franco &apos;s rebellion , while the democracies reluctantly offered scant help to the Spanish Republic . 
There are even deeper similarities . 
Many argued at the time that support for republican Spain meant helping the far more dangerous anarchists and Communists at a time when the Soviet threat in Europe was growing . 
In that sense , yesterday &apos;s Reds have become today &apos;s &quot; fundamentalist Muslims . &quot; 
Indeed , for many nowadays , helping the Syrian rebels is too risky , and might even jeopardize the Middle East &apos;s Christian minorities . 
Of course , Western vacillation reflects deeper strategic and diplomatic factors as well . 
Syria is not Libya , and the political context has changed significantly , with America &apos;s presidential election approaching and a deepening economic crisis in Europe . 
Rightly or wrongly , Russia and China believe that the time has come to take their revenge over an arrogant West that deceived them about the true purpose of &quot; humanitarian intervention &quot; in Libya . 
This time , they hold the better cards . 
At a time when US President Barack Obama is basing his campaign partly on his withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and his plan to do the same in Afghanistan , he cannot take the risk of intervening in Syria . 
Meanwhile , the European Union is fighting for its survival , and cannot devote its energies to an uncertain battle . 
For the West , the timing of the Syrian rebels &quot; uprising could not have been worse . 
But , despite deep divisions among the rebels , the cost of Western indifference is probably higher than the risk of intervention . 
The international community can no longer hide behind the pretense of ignorance . 
When faced with the slaughter of civilians , it can no longer pretend that it does not know . 
But , beyond ethics , there are geopolitical considerations . 
With the Arab world in the midst of upheaval , what message does the West want to send ? 
And , with global power in flux , what message is the West sending to the authoritarian regimes that are backing Assad ? 
These regimes can only read the West &apos;s dithering as a green light for their cynical agendas . 
The less determination the West demonstrates in Syria , the more the Iranians become convinced that they can play with the international community &apos;s nerves and patience indefinitely . 
As Russia and Iran continue to send money and weapons , if not military advisers , to Syria , it is impossible to persist with hypocritical language that can be interpreted only as a formula for inaction . 
Threatening the Syrian regime with &quot; terrible consequences &quot; if it were to use chemical weapons means only one thing : &quot; Bomb your civilians at will , but use only conventional munitions . &quot; 
The time has come to supply the rebels with what they desperately need : anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles . 
Of course , such a choice carries risks . 
After all , such weapons could be turned against the West one day , as they have been in Afghanistan . 
And , by involving ourselves militarily in the conflict , even if only by supplying the rebels , we might give a propaganda boost to terrorist groups that are already willing to strike in the West . 
Nevertheless , the risks of passivity , indecision , and incoherence are even greater . 
The more the West waits , the more radicalized the rebels will become , weakening the standing and influence of moderate forces . 
The logic of intervention goes through cycles . 
In the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide and the subsequent refugee crisis and war in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa in the 1990 &quot; s , a combination of guilt , economic prosperity , and America &apos;s unique international status led to interventions in Kosovo , Afghanistan , and , unfortunately , Iraq . 
Today , we are in a completely different cycle , dominated by the ghosts of Iraq , the global economic crisis , and the ( relative ) decline of the West . 
When it comes to intervention nowadays , respect for legality has overcome the concern for legitimacy that prevailed a decade ago . 
We have gone from one extreme to the other , whereas a middle road would be wiser . 
But , above all , let us not forget the lessons of the Spanish Civil War . 
It is always dangerous to give the impression of being the first to blink when facing authoritarian regimes .
