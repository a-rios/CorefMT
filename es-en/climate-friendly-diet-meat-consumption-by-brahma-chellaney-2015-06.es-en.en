A Healthy , Climate-Friendly Diet 
BERLIN - This December , world leaders will meet in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , where they will hammer out a comprehensive agreement to reduce carbon emissions and stem global warming . 
In the run-up to that meeting , governments worldwide should note one critical , but often overlooked , fact : the single biggest driver of environmental degradation and resource stress today is our changing diet - a diet that is not particularly conducive to a healthy life , either . 
In recent decades , rising incomes have catalyzed a major shift in people &apos;s eating habits , with meat , in particular , becoming an increasingly important feature of people &apos;s diets . 
Given that livestock require much more food , land , water , and energy to raise and transport than plants , increased demand for meat depletes natural resources , places pressure on food-production systems , damages ecosystems , and fuels climate change . 
Meat production is about ten times more water-intensive than plant-based calories and proteins , with one kilogram of beef , for example , requiring 15,415 liters of water . 
It is also an inefficient way of generating food ; up to 30 crop calories are needed to produce one meat calorie . 
At any given time , the global livestock population amounts to more than 150 billion , compared to just 7.2 billion humans - meaning that livestock have a larger direct ecological footprint than we do . 
Livestock production causes almost 14.5 % of global greenhouse-gas emissions and contributes significantly to water pollution . 
Moreover , livestock production consumes one-third of the total water resources used in agriculture ( which accounts for 71 % of the world &apos;s water consumption ) , as well as more than 40 % of the global output of wheat , rye , oats , and corn . 
And livestock production uses 30 % of the earth &apos;s land surface that once was home to wildlife , thereby playing a critical role in biodiversity loss and species extinction . 
It took more than a century for the European diet to reach the point at which meat is consumed at every meal , including breakfast . 
But , in large parts of Asia , a similar shift has occurred in just one generation . 
Meaty diets have created a global obesity problem , including , of all places , in China , whose expanding international clout is accompanied by expanding waistlines at home . 
Americans consume the most meat per capita , after Luxembourgers . 
Given the size of the US population , this is already a problem . 
If the rest of the world caught up to the United States - where meat consumption averages 125.4 kilograms per person annually , compared with a measly 3.2 kilograms in India - the environmental consequences would be catastrophic . 
Already , the signs are worrying . 
The demand for meat is projected to increase by 50 % from 2013 to 2025 , with overall consumption still rising in the West and soaring in the developing world , especially Asia . 
In order to meet this demand , meat producers have had to adopt an extremely problematic approach to raising livestock . 
In order to ensure that their animals gain weight rapidly , meat producers feed them grain , rather than the grass that they would naturally consume - an approach that is a major source of pressure on grain production , natural resources , and the environment . 
Making matters worse , the livestock are injected with large amounts of hormones and antibiotics . 
In the US , 80 % of all antibiotics sold are administered prophylactically to livestock . 
Yet this has been inadequate to stem the spread of disease ; in fact , with many of the new and emerging infectious diseases affecting humans originating in animals , veterinarians , microbiologists , and epidemiologists have been trying to understand the &quot; ecology of disease &quot; ( how nature , and humanity &apos;s impact on it , spreads disease ) . 
Though the environmental and health costs of our changing diets have been widely documented , the message has gone largely unheard . 
With the world facing a serious water crisis , rapidly increasing global temperatures , staggering population growth , and growing health problems like coronary disease , this must change - and fast . 
For starters , to ease some of the resource pressure , livestock producers should switch to water-saving technologies , including drip irrigation . 
At the same time , governments and civil-society groups should promote healthier diets that rely more on plant-based proteins and calories . 
According to recent research , if the world stopped producing crops for animal feed or diverting them to biofuels , it could not only end global hunger , but also feed four billion extra people - more than the number of projected arrivals before the global population stabilizes . 
Meat consumption actually leads to more greenhouse-gas emissions annually than the use of cars does . 
This is not to say that everyone must become vegetarian . 
But even a partial shift in meat-consumption habits - with consumers choosing options like chicken and seafood , instead of beef - could have a far-reaching impact . 
Indeed , beef production requires , on average , 28 times more land and 11 times more water than the other livestock categories , while producing five times more greenhouse-gas emissions and six times more reactive nitrogen . 
Adopting a balanced , largely plant-based diet , with minimal consumption of red and processed meat , would help conserve natural resources , contribute to the fight against human-induced global warming , and reduce people &apos;s risk of diet-related chronic diseases and even cancer mortality . 
Just as governments have used laws , regulations , and other tools with great success to discourage smoking , so must they encourage citizens to eat a balanced diet - for the sake of their health and that of our planet .
