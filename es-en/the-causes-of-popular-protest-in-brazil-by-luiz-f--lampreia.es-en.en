Exhausted Brazil 
RIO DE JANIERO - The demonstrations that are shaking Brazil &apos;s normally laid-back society are channeling a widespread sentiment : enough is enough ! 
But , with the exception of professional agitators , there is no hatred in the street protests . 
Instead , there is a kind of impatient fatigue . 
Brazilians are tired of being brutalized by public transport in the country &apos;s metropolitan areas ; tired of ghastly hospitals ; tired of corruption scandals ; and tired , especially , of inflation , which has returned like a dreaded disease , once again eroding people &apos;s purchasing power and threatening to return millions to the poverty from which they only recently escaped . 
It is difficult to disagree with the protesters . 
Nevertheless , there are many economic reasons to worry about the effect of the demonstrations . 
Since the Plano Real was put in place in 1994 , which brought inflation down to manageable levels , Brazil has achieved remarkable economic and social progress . 
Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , both serving eight years in office , managed to ensure rapid economic growth while maintaining price stability and a sound fiscal position . 
Their success lifted a significant share of poor Brazilians into the middle class and made Brazil an attractive destination for foreign investors . 
Yet the current situation is shifting expectations into reverse . 
To dampen the protests , President Dilma Rousseff &apos;s government has launched various ruses - subsidizing fuel prices and reducing taxes on electric power , automobiles , and household appliances - and has attempted to conceal them in ways that allow the authorities to claim that inflation remains under control . 
Yet all of Brazil is feeling the impact on prices . 
If the official inflation target loses credibility , price growth will accelerate further . 
The underlying problem is that Brazil &apos;s growth model , which allowed 35 million people to enter the middle class in the last decade , is itself at the brink of exhaustion . 
The maximum benefit from reducing unemployment , increasing the real minimum wage , and expanding credit - creating a strong rise in consumption , owing to rapid gains in real ( inflation-adjusted ) income for much of the population - has already been reaped . 
Indeed , consumption is now decreasing , with a recent poll by the Brazilian Confederation of Trade and Business Associations indicating a 6.2 % annual decline this year . 
In March , household-debt levels reached a record high of 44 % of income . 
Slower growth and more modest real wage increases are likely , which will reverse households &quot; optimistic expectations . 
Meanwhile , for Brazil &apos;s new middle class , higher incomes have meant higher tax payments - and thus a growing sense of entitlement to improvements in living standards . 
Many are especially resolved to fight for more and better public goods in view of the government &apos;s misplaced spending priorities , which include soccer stadiums and other pharaonic construction projects . 
In fact , Brazilians &quot; purchasing power could shrink further , owing to the depreciation of the real against the dollar . 
If Brazil &apos;s government does not tighten fiscal policy , the exchange rate will generate more inflationary pressure from the rise in prices of imported goods . 
The alternative - an increase in interest rates - would undermine both consumption and productive investment . 
What went wrong ? 
Until recently , Brazilians enjoyed rapid GDP growth , full employment , rising incomes , a range of social-welfare benefits , and international praise . 
The government swore that the global crisis would not reach the country . 
Now GDP growth is slowing , investment is falling , the budget deficit is widening , and the external accounts are weakening . 
One problem is that the inadequacy of Brazil &apos;s infrastructure , which largely reflects poor official decision-making in the last ten years , directly impedes further growth in production and trade . 
For example , the authorities placed a high priority on a high-speed rail project that has already surpassed several cost estimates and has not yet left the planning stage . 
Meanwhile , the existing rail system is so precarious that it is impossible to travel by train from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo or Belo Horizonte or Brasília . 
The public health-care system is a horror show . 
With rare exceptions , primary and secondary schools leave students badly prepared for university . 
Rousseff &apos;s administration faces a dismal outlook . 
Slow growth has been accompanied by a loss of competitiveness , leading to massive imports of Chinese goods , for example - and to a self-defeating protectionist reaction . 
Ambitious public-investment projects are advancing slowly , if at all - or are the wrong projects . 
And now Brazilians are in the streets demanding change . 
As the economist and former president of the Brazilian Central Bank Afonso Celso Pastore put it , &quot; Rousseff and her ministers simply do not believe in orthodox prescriptions . &quot; 
The trouble is that they do not seem to have a viable alternative .
