Russia and the Silk Road Approach 
MADRID - The unraveling of Ukraine has brought to the fore three major foreign policy challenges for the West : the danger of isolating Russia , the conundrum of China &apos;s aloofness , and the pervasive lack of fresh ideas . 
Surmounting them will require a concerted drive to enhance cooperation and build trust among countries with disparate political systems and national interests . 
Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s Silk Road economic belt could contribute to such an effort . 
Europe and the United States &quot; response to the crisis in Ukraine has failed in two respects . 
First and foremost , it has been anemic , projecting an image of weakness that undermines its ability to reverse Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea , which has been tacitly accepted , or counter its aggressive behavior toward eastern Ukraine . 
At the same time , the use of targeted sanctions and diplomatic snubs has contributed to Russia &apos;s international isolation , undercutting the long-term goal of building a functional relationship . 
While it is critical for the West to stand by its principles , including by imposing biting sanctions , pragmatism is equally important . 
After all , a weak , isolated Russia is far more dangerous than a strong , internationally integrated one . 
And yet there can be no denying that the relationship with Russia is now broken , with mutual trust having reached its lowest point since the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
In this context , bringing Russia back into the international fold will require the involvement of China . 
But , for China , the Ukraine issue is complex , owing to its interest in fostering closer ties with Russia and , to some degree , the parallels with its own actions in places like Tibet . 
Given this - and China &apos;s general reticence to assume a global leadership position - direct Chinese engagement is likely to come only through targeted initiatives with concrete goals . 
That is precisely what the Silk Road economic belt offers , as I had the opportunity to witness during a recent trip to Beijing . 
The initiative , launched last September , aims to improve the linkages between the Asian and European markets , with concrete benefits for all 18 Central Asian and European countries along the route , including Russia . 
The project - which aims to foster shared prosperity through people-to-people exchanges , improved trade flows , and increased currency circulation - is precisely what the world needs if it is to avoid a return to the Cold War divide or the Balkanization of Eastern Europe . 
After all , the best way to generate cooperation and trust is to ensure that it offers clear benefits to all parties involved . 
Though Chinese officials have spoken broadly of enhancing exchanges of people , easing restrictions on the use of foreign currency , and reducing trade barriers , reviving and modernizing the ancient Silk Road also requires functioning infrastructure focused on interoperability and multimodal connectivity . 
Consolidating a strong transport network of road , inner waterways , air , and sea would produce a cascading effect while offering significant - and immediate - economic gains by helping to optimize supply chains . 
Rail is critical to this effort , as it can ease stress on overextended and uncertain sea-lanes and provide faster connections , with fewer environmental repercussions . 
Today , freight transport from China to Europe via rail takes less than half as long as shipping . 
There is a danger , however , that China will pursue a bilateral approach , using the project to serve narrow foreign-policy interests . 
Though China may have the means to finance the large-scale infrastructure projects that the initiative demands , such a fragmented strategy would inhibit integration , while reinforcing the view that a rising China poses a threat to the international order . 
China &apos;s leaders should recognize that , if the Silk Road economic belt is to reach its potential , it must be based on a broader vision that includes diversity of financing , multiplicity of ownership , and effective organization involving a range of actors . 
The World Bank has recently endorsed just such a broad-based approach through its Global Infrastructure Facility , which will connect multilateral , regional , and national public actors , as well as the private sector , in financing infrastructure development . 
The G-20 , the de facto international agenda-setter , has already expressed support for the project . 
Applying this comprehensive model to the Silk Road project - particularly by incorporating Europe , China , Russia , and multilateral institutions - would reinforce existing initiatives . 
But , beyond joint financing , effective coordination is crucial to such a project &apos;s success . 
This is where Europe &apos;s experience in compromise and harmonization is essential . 
To improve its fragmented transport system , the European Union designed a core corridors approach - corresponding to major trans-national traffic flows and addressing missing links and blockages - to form the basis for integration , interoperability , and coordinated infrastructure development and management . 
In doing so , it serves as a catalyst for dialogue among disparate stakeholders . 
The European Rail Traffic Management System , which has overcome divergent safety and security standards among member states to create a unified system , is but one of the many successes that this innovative strategy has facilitated . 
Europe has demonstrated that a sense of common ownership , combined with concrete solutions , can encourage productive dialogue , opening the door to mutually beneficial cooperation . 
The Silk Road offers more than economic opportunity ; it serves participants &quot; long-term security interests . 
At a time when so many connections have been broken , this is an opportunity that Europe cannot afford to pass up .
