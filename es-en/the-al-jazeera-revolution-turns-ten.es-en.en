The Al Jazeera Revolution Turns Ten 
When it first appeared , the new satellite channel broadcast from Qatar reflected its own name . 
Al Jazeera - Arabic for &quot; the island &quot; - represented a haven of professional , independent , current affairs programming in a sea of one-sided , government-controlled Arab media . 
Until Al Jazeera &apos;s mostly BBC-trained journalists arrived on the scene , the average Arab citizen &apos;s news television diet was nothing more than protocol news , wire service video reflecting the latest in the Palestinian conflict , and dramatic photos of earthquakes or wild fires . 
Al Jazeera not only provided live interviews and broadcasts from the field ; it introduced live debate to the Arab world . 
Its program Al Itijah al Mu &apos;akess ( &quot; the opposite direction &quot; ) brought the sort of verbal jousts that most of the world takes for granted but Arabs had never seen televised . 
The guests that Faisal Qassem brought to the Doha studios ( or via satellite ) included people from the same Arab country or region but representing completely opposing points of view . 
While hard-hitting professional news and programs like Al Itijah al Mu &apos;akess provided viewers with unique television , it took major world conflicts to bring Al Jazeera acclaim . 
The Palestinian intifada , the terrorist attacks against New York and Washington in September 2001 , and the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq propelled Al Jazeera to global influence . 
In its first years , Al Jazeera was simultaneously hailed as a pioneering media outlet for reform in the Arab world and as an instigator of internal conflict and strife . 
Almost every Arab ruler at one time or another attempted to silence the station by closing its local bureau and pressing the Qatari rulers to muzzle its freewheeling journalists . 
Neither worked . 
In fact , the pressures only added to the station &apos;s popularity among Arab viewers . 
The United States initially seemed favorable to Al Jazeera . 
The station &apos;s encouragement of democratic reform and coverage of different points of view were compatible with the proclamations of US foreign policy . 
But this changed dramatically after 9 / 11 , when it became clear that Iraqi and Afghan civilian victims of US bombs ( as well as prisoners of war ) would receive more coverage than was being provided by the embedded western media machine ( Al Jazeera &apos;s one embedded journalist did not remain so very long ) . 
When Al Jazeera reporters interviewed Osama bin Laden and the station broadcast his videos , America &apos;s gloves came off . 
Senior US officials publicly vilified the station . 
But the more the US and authoritarian Arab regimes attacked the station , the more the station became a reflector of some of the radical Islamic trends . 
In the Danish cartoon case and the recent controversy over the Pope &apos;s statements , the station was clearly seen as making the news rather than just covering it . 
Despite its popularity , however , Al Jazeera has not succeeded financially . 
The enmity of the Saudis to the station and its Qatari owners resulted in boycotts . 
Multi-national advertisers who covet the huge Saudi market were informed in no uncertain terms that they would lose hefty contracts if they advertised on Al Jazeera . 
Nevertheless , the station , whose owners have deep pockets , expanded to add a direct satellite broadcast , a children &apos;s station , two sports stations , and soon an international , English-language station . 
Although no one has yet caught up to Al Jazeera &apos;s news and current affairs popularity , the Saudi-owned Middle East Broadcasting Center has introduced a successful 24-hour station , Al Arrabiyeh , which is challenging Al Jazeera &apos;s lead . 
The Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation and Egypt &apos;s Dream have also won large segments of the general Arab public with entertainment programs . 
Al Jazeera has made Qatar famous and the Arab world better informed . 
Despite its inadequacies and biases , Al Jazeera has changed the Arab world for the better . 
While no state-run TV station had live current affairs programs ten years ago , now even stations from some of the most dictatorial regimes are forced to raise their level and allow live interviews . 
As it celebrates its tenth anniversary , Al Jazeera is no longer new , but it remains a trendsetter . 
It has broken new ground in politics and culture , but its impact on social and economic life has been minimal . 
So , as Al Jazeera moves into media adolescence , it must begin to think about how it can become a social pioneer in the Arab and Islamic world . 
God knows , change is still needed on that front .
