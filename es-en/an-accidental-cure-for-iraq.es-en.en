An Accidental Cure for Iraq 
Doctors use the word &quot; crisis &quot; to describe the point at which a patient either starts to recover or dies . 
President George W. Bush &apos;s Iraqi patient now seems to have reached that point . 
Most commentators appear to think that Bush &apos;s latest prescription - a surge of 20,000 additional troops to suppress the militias in Baghdad - will , at best , merely postpone the inevitable death of his dream of a democratic Iraq . 
Yet as &quot; Battle of Baghdad &quot; begins , factors beyond Bush &apos;s control and not of his making ( at least not intentionally ) may just save Iraq from its doom . 
One key factor is that , for the first time since the United States and Britain invaded Iraq , Arab Sunni leaders are backing a US military plan for that country . 
These Sunni leaders live in abject fear of the geopolitical earthquake that any disintegration of political authority in Baghdad would bring , believing that all-out civil war would invariably follow - a war that would not respect international borders . 
Of course , America has been encouraging Sunni leaders in this belief . 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice &apos;s recent tour of Middle East capitals helped spread the word to Egypt , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and the Gulf states that any US failure and sudden withdrawal would be certain to destabilize them . 
Given the fragile grip that these leaders have over their societies , America &apos;s warnings have been taken to heart . 
But the truly curious factor that might bring success to Bush is that those who have opposed or resented America &apos;s presence in Iraq , such as the Iranian-backed Shi &apos;a parties now also appear to want Bush &apos;s new strategy to succeed . 
They are for it because they believe it will defang Moqtada al-Sadr , the rogue Shi &apos;a cleric whose power has mushroomed over the past three years - to the point that he now dominates much of Baghdad and holds the allegiance of countless angry young Shi &apos;a men . 
Of course , attacking Moqtada al-Sadr &apos;s Mahdi Army in the name of fighting militia death squads has the potential to draw American military forces into a level of urban warfare unseen since the Falluja assaults of 2004 and 2005 . 
Al-Sadr is seen as the protector of the Shi &apos;a of Iraq and has are an estimated 60,000 fighters in his militia . 
But he is deeply mistrusted by other Shi &apos;a leaders , who fear that they may one day have to take him on by themselves . 
Better to let the Americans do it , though of course these Shi &apos;a leaders prefer a slow strangulation of al-Sadr to a direct and bloody assault . 
But make no mistake : how al-Sadr is handled is the big test of Bush &apos;s new strategy . 
Should the US choose to face al-Sadr and his forces head on , they risk alienating Iraq &apos;s largest sectarian community , the Shi &apos;a , adding fuel to the anti-occupation resistance and thus probably dooming Bush to failure . 
Iran and Syria , which have played a spoiler role in Iraq up to now , may also now be anxious to find a way to pull the country back from the brink . 
Bush still refuses to talk to either of them , and has lately been having US troops arrest Iranian agents in Iraq . 
Yet Iran may already see itself as victorious , with the current Iraqi government friendlier than any the Iranians have ever known . 
So maintaining that government in office has now become a strategic priority for Iran , particularly as it is now clear that any US hopes of using Iraq as a permanent military base are dead . 
The &quot; surge &quot; also opens , perhaps for the first time , a serious possibility of pouring water on the insurgent fires in Anbar province , the heartland of the Sunni insurgency . 
The US has achieved relative successes in the province through alliances with Sunni tribes . 
The hope is that such realistic and pragmatic accommodations will be extended to Iraqis who are fighting under the banner of a nationalist and anti-occupation agenda . 
So some of the stars have come into alignment for Bush . 
But to keep them there in the long term , the Iraqi government will need to amend the constitution in a way that appeases the Sunni community . 
Reassuring Iraq &apos;s Sunnis that they have a place in the new Iraq will also reassure neighboring Sunni governments , which have mostly turned a blind eye to the support for the insurgency that has come from their lands . 
Of course , should the US see failure ahead , it could seek to broaden the war beyond Iraq &apos;s borders by attacking Iran , a policy reminiscent of &quot; Operation Sideshow , &quot; when US failure in Vietnam in the late 1960 &quot; s enticed President Nixon into attacking Cambodia and Laos . 
But Iran has resources that Cambodia and Laos could never muster ; indeed , its ability to retaliate could set the entire region ablaze . 
Whereas America &apos;s war in Indochina was a tragic mistake , the cost of a wider war precipitated by the crisis in Iraq would be incomparably greater - for both the patient and the doctor .
