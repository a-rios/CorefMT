The Kennedy Temptation 
NEW YORK - Fifty years ago this month , President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas , Texas . 
Many Americans believe that this tragic event marked the loss of national innocence . 
This is nonsense , of course . 
But , seen from today &apos;s perspective , Kennedy &apos;s presidency seems like a high point of American prestige . 
Less than five months before his violent death , Kennedy roused a huge gathering of Germans in the center of Berlin , the frontier of the Cold War , to almost hysterical enthusiasm with his famous words , &quot; Ich bin ein Berliner . &quot; 
For many millions of people , Kennedy &apos;s America stood for freedom and hope . 
Like the country he represented , Kennedy and his wife , Jacqueline , looked so young , glamorous , rich , and full of benevolent energy . 
The US was a place to look up to , a model , a force for good in a world full of evil . 
This image would soon be battered badly by the murders of Kennedy , his brother Bobby , and Martin Luther King , Jr . , and by the war in Vietnam that Kennedy had initiated . 
If Kennedy had completed his presidency , his legacy almost certainly would not have lived up to the expectations that he inspired . 
For a brief moment , when Americans voted for their first black president , another young and hopeful figure , it looked as if the US had regained some of the prestige that it enjoyed in the early 1960 &quot; s . 
Like Kennedy , Barack Obama delivered a speech in Berlin - to an adoring crowd of at least 200,000 people , even before he was elected . 
That early promise was never fulfilled . 
In fact , US prestige has suffered much since 2008 . 
America &apos;s national politics is so poisoned by provincial partisanship - especially among Republicans , who have hated Obama from the beginning - that democracy itself looks damaged . 
Economic inequality is deeper than ever . 
And highways , bridges , hospitals , and schools are falling apart . 
Compared to major airports in China , those around New York City now look primitive . 
In foreign policy , the US is seen as either a swaggering bully or a dithering coward . 
America &apos;s closest allies , such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel , are furious about being spied upon . 
Others , notably in Israel and Saudi Arabia , are disgusted by what they see as American weakness . 
Even Russian President Vladimir Putin , the autocratic leader of a crumbling second-rate power , manages to put on a good show compared to America &apos;s tarnished president . 
It is easy to blame Obama , or the reckless Republicans , for this sorry state of affairs . 
But that would miss the most important point about America &apos;s role in the world : The same idealism that made Kennedy so popular is also driving the decline in America &apos;s international prestige . 
Some of Kennedy &apos;s most ardent admirers still like to believe that he would have prevented the escalation of the Vietnam War had he lived longer . 
But there is no evidence for that at all . 
Kennedy was a hardened Cold Warrior . 
And his anti-Communism was couched in terms of American idealism . 
As he said in his inaugural speech : &quot; &#91; W &#93; e shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe , to assure the survival and the success of liberty . &quot; 
Enthusiasm for America &apos;s self-proclaimed mission to fight for freedom around the world was dented , not least in the US itself , by the bloody catastrophe of Vietnam . 
An estimated two million Vietnamese died in a war that did not free them . 
It took another , far more limited disaster to revive lofty rhetoric about the liberating effects of US military power . 
The reasons why President George W. Bush chose to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq were no doubt complex . 
But the language used by those wars &quot; neo-conservative promoters came straight from the Kennedy era : the spread of democracy , the cause of liberty , and the universal authority of &quot; American values . &quot; 
One reason why Americans elected Obama in 2008 was that the rhetoric of US idealism had once again led to the death and displacement of millions . 
Now when US politicians talk about &quot; freedom , &quot; people see bombing campaigns , torture chambers , and the constant threat of lethal drones . 
The problem with Obama &apos;s America is rooted in the contradictory nature of his leadership . 
Obama has distanced himself from the US mission to liberate the world by force . 
To those who look to the US to fix all of the world &apos;s ills , Obama looks weak and indecisive . 
At the same time , however , he has failed to close the grotesque US prison at Guant√°namo Bay . 
Even as open warfare is reduced , stealth warfare intensifies and spreads . 
And America &apos;s image sinks further every day . 
But the main problem is not Obama ; it is the hubris of Americans &quot; belief in their &quot; exceptional &quot; role in the world - a belief that has been abused too many times to promote unnecessary wars . 
Not only has Americans &quot; idealism led them to expect too much of themselves , but the rest of the world has often expected too much of America . 
And such expectations can only end in disappointment .
