Protectionism Made in the USA 
America &apos;s imposition of tariffs on imported steel has been greeted with a howl of protest around the world . 
But harsh words have not been followed by a strong counter-attack . 
Now is the time to confront America &apos;s hypocrisy , not to bluster . 
The global financial crisis of 1997 / 1998 - mismanaged by the IMF , largely at the direction of the US Treasury - led to an increased flow of steel imports . 
But that is part of the market adjustment process the US trumpets so loudly at other times . 
The argument put forward by the US , that it was entitled to safeguard against a surge of imports - utilizing safeguard measures that are part of the WTO - is unlikely to past muster with a WTO panel when one is eventually convened , but the argument itself is disingenuous . 
Europe pushed to restructure its steel industry in the 1980s and early 1990s , and succeeded mostly . 
In America , many efficient new firms ( mini-mills ) were indeed created , but yesterday &apos;s lumbering giants stood still . 
They cannot compete with efficient steel mills elsewhere - including ( perish the thought ) Korea &apos;s state-owned steel company . 
Many of America &apos;s problems are made in the USA . 
America &apos;s deteriorating fiscal position is leading to a strong dollar , just as the deteriorating fiscal position of the US after Reagan &apos;s irresponsible tax cut of two decades ago did . 
While countries may pride themselves on a strong currency , a strong dollar is bad for exports and good for imports . 
In a dynamic economy , if jobs are lost in one sector , new jobs are being created in another . 
Government &apos;s role is to facilitate the movement of labor from one to the other . 
It is a primary responsibility of government to maintain full employment . 
Both in assisting shifts in employment and in maintaining full employment , the Bush Administration has failed . 
President Bush recognized that a fiscal stimulus was needed when he arrived in office , but rather than pushing for genuine stimulus , it pushed for regressive tax changes under the name of a fiscal stimulus . 
Aid to old economy firms that spent more on avoiding taxes than in restructuring took the form of a repeal of the alternative minimum tax , a tax provision designed to limit the extent to which firms could make use of loopholes in the tax code . 
Lowering taxes for the rich : under the Bush administration &apos;s original proposal , a family of four earning $ 50,000 would have received zero - yes zero - benefits over four years , while a $ 5 million dollar a year family of four &quot; struggling to make ends meet &quot; would have received a whopping $ 500,000 ! 
The Democrats rightly resisted ; the number of jobs that would have been created was miniscule . 
But the weaknesses in the economy as a result of this economic mismanagement mean that those who lose their jobs will face a tougher time . 
While America loses , Europe loses , many in the developing world lose , and much more is at stake . 
Globalization , well and equitably managed , can benefit all countries . 
But under globalization , as currently managed , many have not gained ; and some of the poorest have lost out . 
Instead , globalization is an unfair game , with the rules written by rich advanced industrial countries for rich industrial countries . 
But the US believes that even this is not enough : it will interpret these rules in ways which suit its political interests , bending and breaking them at will , challenging those who do not like it to do something about it . 
The motto of the Bush Administration seems to be , &quot; Trade is good , but imports are bad ! &quot; 
Think of the lessons that poor developing countries learn . 
Lowering import duties lead to a surge of imports . 
So , under the &quot; new &quot; US rules , that country is entitled to reinstate tariffs as &quot; safeguards . &quot; 
If the US needs to worry about unemployment with an unemployment rate of less than 6 % , what is a poor country with unemployment at 10 % or 20 % to say ? 
The US pleads for understanding ; elections are coming in November , and voters in West Virginia and other states must be &quot; bribed &quot; to accept a new round of trade negotiations . 
But democracies exist across the developing world , and their voters have even more legitimate concerns about the jobs that result from liberalization . 
The IMF - in which the US is the only country with veto power - shows little sympathy with such political concerns in the developing world . 
Why the double standard ? 
If the increase in steel tariffs were an isolated incident it would be bad enough . 
But , while preaching free market doctrines abroad , the US bails out its airlines and increases agricultural subsidies at home . 
Even before these increases , subsidies to agriculture by the advanced industrial countries were enormous - exceeding the total incomes of sub-Saharan Africa . 
The rich effectively close their markets to many goods that represent the comparative advantage of the poor . 
Argentina &apos;s economic position today , indeed , would be vastly different if America and Europe opened their markets to its agricultural goods . 
The same can be said for country after country in the developing world . 
Globalization entails increasing interdependence . 
Given the volatility in the global economy , this entails bearing some risks . 
Rich countries - like the US - are in the best position to bear those risks . 
Much discussion has taken place of late of the advantages to be gained by the world adopting global standards , e.g. in banking . 
Inevitably globalization will entail adopting such standards . 
America &apos;s actions over steel seem to suggest that the US embraces a double standard . 
This cannot be allowed . 
Countries , particularly in Europe , that are capable of standing up to the US must oppose it here . 
Taking strong measures will be in their interests , will be in America &apos;s interest ( even if it is not in the interests of particular special interests , or President Bush &apos;s political interests ) , and will be in the broader interests of the world .
