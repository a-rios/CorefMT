Is &quot; Gene Doping &quot; Wrong ? 
In recent years , the International Olympic Committee and other sports organizations have worried about the possible misuse of gene-transfer technology . 
Two Australian Football League teams have hinted that they are looking into tests that would indicate an athlete &apos;s likely height , stamina , speed , and strength . 
Indeed , for some , &quot; gene doping &quot; now represents the Holy Grail of performance enhancement , while for others it means the end of sports as we know it . 
The prospect of a future of genetically modified athletes incites alarm throughout the sports world , accompanied by portrayals of such athletes as inhuman or some form of mutant . 
This is a misrepresentation of how gene transfer would alter humans , both therapeutically and non-therapeutically , should it ever be legalized . 
The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) prohibited gene doping in 2003 , but some scientists predict that its misuse in sport is likely to appear at the Beijing 2008 Olympics . 
It is in this context that the debate about gene doping erupted during the 2004 Olympics in Athens . 
Unfortunately , because the discussion has so far been dominated by moral panic over the state of sports , many ethical considerations and important questions have been excluded . 
Policies concerning gene doping should not rely solely on the interests and infrastructures of sports organizations . 
In particular , the monitoring committees on genetic technology that nations develop must be taken on board by the world of sport . 
A simple model based on prohibition and testing for gene modification will not be enough , assuming that detection is possible at all . 
Moreover , ethics committees must be made aware of the special circumstances of sports , which limit the effectiveness of broader social policies on genetic modification . 
Again , regulation ought not to rely on one single global authority . 
As has been made clear from the ethical debates on stem-cell research , a global policy cannot easily be adopted or enforced , nor should it be . 
Above all , it is not acceptable for the world of sport to impose a moral view about the role of enhancement technology on nations that wish to participate in the Olympics , without implementing an extensive and ongoing consultative process to accompany its policy decision . 
This cannot involve the creation of working groups that merely pay lip service to ethical debate , but must enable non-sports organizations to develop their own policy framework for the regulation of &quot; gene doping &quot; and , more broadly , the use of genetic information . 
Policies governing gene transfer in sports must , therefore , be recognized as subservient to broader bio-ethical and bio-legal interests that recognize the changing role of genetics in society . 
The rhetoric surrounding &quot; gene doping &quot; relies heavily on its moral status as a form of cheating . 
Yet , this status relies on existing anti-doping rules . 
If we don &apos;t ban gene transfer in the first place , then on one level , it is not cheating . 
In any case , to describe genetically modified athletes as mutants or inhuman is morally suspect , for it invokes the same kind of prejudice that we deplore in relation to other biological characteristics , particularly race , gender , and disability . 
After all , many , if not most , top athletes are &quot; naturally &quot; genetically gifted . 
To refer to these people as mutants would surely invite widespread criticism . 
Those who fear that gene doping heralds the &quot; end of sports &quot; should instead recognize this moment as an opportunity to ask critical and difficult questions about the effectiveness and validity of anti-doping tests . 
Does society really care about performance enhancement in sport ? 
That may sound like a radical question . 
For many years , commentators have expressed concerns about the culture of doping in elite sport . 
Yet , the culture of anti-doping is equally alarming , because it embodies a dogmatic commitment that limits the capacity for critical debate over what really matters in sport . 
If anti-doping authorities truly care about sports , then they have a responsibility to re-examine the basic values that underpin their work . 
They should begin by imagining what would happen if the child of a genetically modified human wanted to become an elite athlete . 
At the very least , they might then be less prone to imposing the narrow moral position of the sports world on the parent .
