Europe &apos;s Last Chance 
BRUSSELS - The only clear thing to come out of the recent European Union-China summit was the scale of the EU &apos;s fallen reputation . 
From being the world &apos;s most widely admired political experiment and enjoying widespread respect and a degree of leadership on policy issues with global impact like climate change and fighting Third World poverty , the Union &apos;s standing among the world &apos;s emerging powers has been brutally downgraded . 
Its new image is that of a low-growth zone whose member governments have turned away from cooperation in favor of short-sighted beggar-thy-neighbor tactics that are imperiling the euro . 
It would be wrong , of course , to suggest that Europe has suddenly become a political backwater . 
What is needed today is a clear definition of Europe &apos;s interests - and its responsibilities . 
Europe needs a sense of purpose for a century in which many of the odds will be stacked against it , as well as a statement of the moral standards that will guide its actions and , one hopes , its leadership . 
The first step towards a narrative capable of replacing earlier rallying cries like &quot; no more war &quot; and &quot; a single market and a single currency &quot; is to set out Europe &apos;s interests . 
For the most part , the EU &apos;s strategic interests - and certainly those of its member states - cannot be secured within the Union &apos;s borders . 
Security is an obvious priority , and that means being able to defuse tensions by economic rather than military means . 
The Arab world and Africa will be Europe &apos;s particular problems , with militant Islam matched by runaway urbanization , with Africa &apos;s population possibly growing from 800 million today to two billion by mid-century . 
Just as important will be Europe &apos;s interests in shaping the global rulebook . 
Climate change and improved banking and financial regulation head the current agenda , but soon global agreement will be needed on access to resources ranging from hydrocarbons to minerals to agriculture . 
Today , when economies compete for markets , not territories , intellectual property rights , as well as trade and investment , must be governed by global agreements . 
Europe &apos;s dominant position in many world markets means that for a while it will retain the clout to try to order the global agenda in ways that suit it . 
That is not good enough . 
European policymakers will have to decide in advance what they want , and then push for it at a global level . 
The confusion that still surrounds Europe &apos;s fragmented and therefore weak representation in international fora like the United Nations Security Council , the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and the G-20 and G-8 is a major hurdle in this respect . 
The short-term challenge is , of course , Europe &apos;s very disparate national economies . 
The eurozone crisis is not a passing phase but the symptom of a serious ailment . 
The â‚¬ 500 billion safety net agreed to in response to the Greek debt crisis and the threat of similar crises in Spain , Portugal , and Ireland only bought time - perhaps 3-5 years . 
It has not resolved the fundamental economic imbalances between eurozone countries . 
Only fiscal union can do that , and taxation is the sacred cow that the EU &apos;s sovereign governments refuse to discuss . 
The eurozone countries are therefore stuck in a place where they cannot go back by scrapping the single currency , yet cannot go forward unless they do what a big but unevenly distributed economy like the US does : pool tax revenues to even things out . 
The longer-term challenge for Europe is demographic . 
It may be that the coming years will somehow see solutions to the EU &apos;s lost competitiveness , poor innovation , shrinking manufacturing , inadequate education , and growing labor shortages . 
The average age of EU citizens will inexorably rise from about 38 now to over 50 by mid-century . 
That means a far smaller proportion of wage earners will be supporting more and more &quot; inactive &quot; people . 
The advantages that the EU can deploy are nonetheless considerable , provided that its member governments pull in the same direction . 
Europe &apos;s position as the world &apos;s largest trading bloc , with nearly 40 % of all international commerce , and the growing importance of the euro - crisis notwithstanding - as a reserve currency , mean that the EU , just as much as the US , can set the agenda for negotiating the new global rulebook . 
The difference is that America acts decisively , and the EU does not . 
Of course , Europe occupies the moral high ground that America has mostly vacated , owing to its mis-adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Europe &apos;s leadership on climate change and on development aid could , if well handled , be the basis for a new moral authority . 
But there is little sign of governments taking advantage of this opportunity . 
The moment is ripe for Europe &apos;s political leaders to define what the EU &apos;s role must be , and why .
