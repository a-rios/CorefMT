Washed Away on the QE2 
NEW YORK - Imagine that you get in the shower , turn on the water , and nothing comes out . 
You call a plumber , who tells you that there are holes in the pipes , and that it will cost you $ 1,000 to repair it . 
You tell him to turn up the water pressure instead . 
Sound sensible ? 
Well , this is the logic behind the United States Federal Reserve &apos;s second round of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ( QE2 ) , its strategy to keep flooding the money pipes until credit starts flowing freely again from banks to businesses . 
You wouldn &apos;t expect this to work in your shower , and there is little reason to expect it to work in the commercial lending market . 
The credit-transmission mechanism in the US - and elsewhere - has been seriously damaged since 2007 . 
Small and medium-size businesses in the US depend on small and medium-size banks for access to vital credit , yet too many of these banks remain zombies , unable to lend because their balance sheets are littered with bad commercial and real-estate loans from the boom years . 
The US Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) was an opportunity to force banks to disgorge bad assets - and thus repair the credit pipes . 
Instead , banks were obliged only to take equity injections from the government , which they consider politically toxic . 
As a result , the banks have been focused on returning the bailout funds at the earliest opportunity , rather than using them to boost lending . 
The net result is that , even though the Fed has pushed its short-term lending rate down to zero , most banks will only lend on the basis of vastly greater collateral , and at much higher real interest rates , than before the bust . 
So now America plows on with the cheap option : flood the pipes and see what comes out . 
Make no mistake : something will come out , though not necessarily where it should . 
We have already seen the liquidity intended to boost US bank lending instead leak through the cracks into markets as diverse as agricultural commodities , metals , and poor-country debt . 
What is remarkable about this is that some of QE2 &quot; s most prominent cheerleaders actually think that wherever new demand shows up is fine and dandy . 
After all , it is only &quot; aggregate demand &quot; that matters to the Keynesian faithful . 
To worry about the composition of demand is silly ; it only complicates the algebra . 
Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman , who berates the Fed for not opening the monetary sluice far wider , showed the follies of the crude Keynesian approach nearly a decade ago . 
In August 2001 , he wrote that , &quot; The driving force behind the current slowdown is a plunge in business investment . &quot; 
But , &quot; &#91; t &#93; o reflate the economy , &quot; he told us , &quot; the Fed doesn &apos;t have to restore business investment ; any kind of increase in demand will do . &quot; 
In particular , &quot; Housing , which is highly sensitive to interest rates , could help lead a recovery . &quot; 
A year later , with the Fed not having moved aggressively enough for him , Krugman divined that &quot; it needs soaring household spending to offset moribund business investment . 
And to do that &#91; it &#93; needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble . &quot; 
Wish granted . 
But neither the US nor the world can afford a sequel . 
The outside world , which relies on the dollar as its primary trade vehicle and therefore reserve asset , cannot be expected to watch passively as dollars continue to pour into their currency , commodity , and asset markets , with no clear end in sight . 
Europe , Germany in particular , has been highly critical of the US approach of placing its central bank at the center of its recovery strategy . 
But the eurozone is doing the same . 
Consider the Irish bailout sorcery . 
The Irish National Asset Management Agency ( NAMA ) was set up in 2009 to clean up Irish banks &quot; balance sheets . 
But it does this by giving the banks newly conjured government IOUs - not euros - in return for dodgy debt . 
The banks then dump the IOUs on the European Central Bank , which then provides the actual cash . 
Since NAMA swaps IOUs for bank debt at only about half its face value , the three-way transaction can result in a € 1 capital loss for every € 1 the banks get from the ECB . 
Of course , the IOUs now lodged with the ECB may themselves have to be written down , threatening to undermine the ECB &apos;s own balance sheet . 
What is the logic of this crazy carousel ? 
German banks hold at least € 48 billion in Irish bank debt , British banks hold another € 31 billion , and French banks hold € 19 billion . 
Since June 2008 , German , British , and French banks have withdrawn € 253 billion worth of credit from Irish banks and other Irish borrowers - 70 % of the total foreign funds withdrawn . 
These countries &quot; authorities are now trying to shield their banks from losses by feigning neighborly concern for the Irish government . 
For decades , the US and Europe lectured the world on the importance of cleaning house in the wake of a financial crisis : in particular , repairing or resolving zombie banks . 
It is time to swallow our own medicine and resume the hard work of repairing our banking systems . 
To rely instead on central banks to refloat the US and European economies is an abdication of responsibility that will cost us dearly in the future .
