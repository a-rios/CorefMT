Game Changers for Growth 
BERKELEY - The recent G-20 meeting of finance ministers in Saint Petersburg confirmed that the debate between growth and austerity is over - at least for now . 
With protracted recession in Europe and slowdowns in emerging markets , concern about budget deficits has given way to apprehension about growth . 
In July , the International Monetary Fund revised its global growth forecast downward for the second time this year . 
Both Japan and the United States stand out as bright spots in the subdued global outlook , but for different reasons . 
In Japan , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has unleashed a combination of aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion along with promised reforms of the labor market , corporate governance , regulation , and trade . 
In response to rapid and bold stimulus measures , Japan &apos;s economy is expected to grow at a rate of around 3 % this year - one of the highest rates among advanced economies - and the Nikkei index rose 80 % in the six-month period ending in May of this year . 
Now Abe has signaled his intention to move forward with tough structural reforms . 
If he delivers , his policies will be game changers for Japan . 
In the US , the story is one of continued recovery as the headwinds slowing growth dissipate . 
State- and local-government budgets are improving , the housing market is strengthening , and households are deleveraging and repairing their balance sheets . 
Counterproductive and excessive fiscal austerity at the federal level has dampened growth this year , but the private sector has proved more resilient than expected . 
Under current law , fiscal contraction is slated to ease next year and monetary policy is likely to remain supportive , so most forecasters predict an acceleration of growth . 
But growth prospects could be undermined by another bruising political battle over the federal budget , resulting in deep spending cuts . 
The current Republican rhetoric in the House of Representatives portends additional fiscal austerity . 
Earlier this year , the Congressional Budget Office warned that the potential US growth rate has declined as a result of years of subpar investment rates , the aging of the population , and smaller productivity gains . 
Every year of below-capacity growth means lower growth capacity in the future , owing to lost investment , erosion of worker skills and experience , and diminished risk-taking . 
Still , there are often-overlooked reasons for optimism about America &apos;s future potential growth . 
A recent McKinsey Global Institute study identifies five mutually reinforcing &quot; game changers &quot; that could have a significant effect on GDP growth , productivity , and employment in the US by 2020 : shale energy , big-data analytics , exports in knowledge-intensive industries , infrastructure investment , and talent development . 
Two of these - shale energy and big-data analytics - build on ongoing technological breakthroughs in which the US has a strong lead and depend primarily on private-sector action , not macroeconomic or structural policies . 
US production of shale gas and oil has been growing by more than 50 % annually over the last five years . 
As a result of increasing supplies , US natural-gas prices have declined by two-thirds since 2008 and are likely to remain significantly lower than prices in the rest of the world at least through 2020 . 
This price advantage will enhance America &apos;s competitiveness as a manufacturing location , particularly for energy-intensive activities . 
The US has the largest recoverable shale-gas reserves and the second-largest recoverable shale-oil reserves in the world . 
It also enjoys a technological lead in shale-energy technologies , and it already has a vast network of pipelines , refineries , and ports in the energy sector that can be repurposed for shale gas and oil ( though much more investment will be needed ) . 
Growth in shale energy will mean more investment , production , and jobs in the energy sector itself . 
Lower gas prices will boost manufacturing production , particularly in downstream industries like petrochemicals and primary metals that use natural gas as fuel and feedstock . 
Growth in energy and energy-intensive industries will fuel additional demand , output , and employment across a wide swath of supporting activities , including transportation , construction , and professional services . 
Overall , McKinsey estimates that growth in shale energy could add 2-4 % to annual GDP and create up to 1.7 million jobs by 2020 . 
But extracting shale energy involves environmental risks and uncertainties , among them groundwater contamination , higher methane emissions , and potential seismic effects . 
And shale gas emits CO2 when burned , even though it has half the carbon content of coal and has played a significant role in cutting US carbon emissions to mid-1990 &quot; s levels . 
Not surprisingly , the President of the Natural Resources Defense Council , an admired environmental group , recently remarked that &quot; fracking is about the most complicated thing I have encountered . &quot; 
More research on the environmental risks and benefits of shale energy , and the development of new standards and regulations to control these risks are required . 
Big data and advanced analytics are another technology-driven game changer for US growth . 
As more data are generated , stored , and transmitted in digital form , new data sets relevant to personal and business decisions are growing exponentially . 
As a result of advances in computing power , the advent of cloud computing , and new software tools , more of these data sets can be quickly analyzed and used by businesses to reduce costs , boost productivity , and create new products and services . 
Big data and advanced analytics can also reduce costs and enhance efficiency in health care and government , and can create value for consumers through greater product variety and quality , as well as enhanced convenience - benefits that are not captured in GDP statistics . 
McKinsey estimates that big-data analytics could add about $ 325 billion , or 1.7 % to annual GDP in the retail and manufacturing sectors , while generating up to $ 285 billion in productivity gains and cost savings in health care and government by 2020 . 
The potential savings in health-care costs would ease pressures on government budgets and release resources to boost growth in the rest of the economy . 
New information and communications technologies were game changers that boosted the potential growth rate of the US economy in the 1990 &quot; s . 
McKinsey &apos;s research suggests that shale energy and big-data technologies will be game changers with similar benefits for the economy &apos;s potential growth over the next several years .
