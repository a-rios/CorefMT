Who is Gordon Brown ? 
At long last , Gordon Brown is taking over from Tony Blair as Britain &apos;s Prime Minister , thus attaining his life-long ambition , as if by right . 
That is his first problem . 
He has not been elected by anyone - not by the Labour Party , and not by Britain &apos;s voters ; he has merely come into an inheritance that he has long thought was his due . 
How , then , will Brown acquire legitimacy as Britain &apos;s new leader ? 
The one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legitimacy if he offers only more of what Blair has been dishing up for the past ten years . 
Brown &apos;s second problem is the mirror image of the first . 
As a senior member of Blair &apos;s government throughout its tenure , he shares responsibility for everything that Blair has done . 
Political commentators sometimes claim to detect important differences in their underlying political attitudes . 
However , in practice , Brown has remained in the shadows , skillfully managing the economy , but remaining silent and enigmatic on vital political issues , and apparently endorsing everything Blair did . 
If Brown is to gain legitimacy , he must offer something new ; but he can do that only by distinguishing himself from the Blair legacy in clearly perceptible - and therefore fairly radical - ways . 
This will be a difficult trick to pull off . 
Perhaps the single most important domestic question Brown faces concerns where he stands on the balance between the free market and the claims of social policy . 
Blair &apos;s government moved the Labour Party a long way to the right of its traditional priorities of protecting the underprivileged , and to justify the change he re-named the party &quot; New Labour . &quot; 
In many ways , the Blair government &apos;s support of free-market policies turned out to be a shrewd and productive shift . 
Britain &apos;s economy grew more steadily and rapidly than it had done for several generations , and the tax revenue generated by growth enabled the government to pour money into education and the National Health Service . 
But this has come at a price , or rather several prices . 
First , inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale . 
At the bottom , the proportion of the population with an income below the poverty line increased from 13 % at the start of Blair &apos;s government to 20 % now . 
That situation is much worse among ethnic minorities . 
And , despite the government &apos;s efforts , childhood poverty also has increased under Blair . 
At the top , the incomes of the mega-rich have soared , with predictable repercussions , especially in the property market . 
Public concern about this issue has been made much worse by claims that the rich get even richer by paying little tax . 
There was a time when Brown was thought to be a believer in traditional Labour Party values . 
Was it true ? 
Is it true now ? 
What will he say about inequality ? 
Unfortunately , Blair and his government are perceived to be tainted by some of the less attractive features of free-market capitalism . 
Blair himself seems to prefer to have &quot; friends &quot; who are very rich and who will lend him their holiday villas in Tuscany . 
This &quot; closeness &quot; has led the police to investigate claims that some Labour Party donors have been rewarded with political honors . 
In short , Blair &apos;s government exudes an aura of sleaze and cronyism . 
Can Brown show that he is different ? 
The worst part of Blair &apos;s legacy , of course , is the war in Iraq . 
Many people predicted , and everyone can now see , that the decision to invade was a disastrous error ; that it is having catastrophic consequences , not just for Iraq , but also for the Middle East generally ; and that it has seriously damaged the moral standing of the United States and Britain . 
The most critical issue facing Brown is whether he chooses to distance himself from Blair &apos;s self-satisfied and delusional claim that the invasion of Iraq was &quot; the right thing to do . &quot; 
Britain has already reduced its forces in southern Iraq , and is on course to reduce them still further as they hand over &quot; security &quot; to the Iraqi police and military . 
In reality , of course , the civil and guerrilla war under way in the rest of Iraq means that any security in the south can only be a temporary illusion . 
The choice facing Brown is whether to cling silently to the existing policy , in the futile hope that the problem will go away , or explicitly recognize Britain &apos;s share in the disaster . 
This is partly a question of what to do now in Iraq ; but it is also a question of Britain &apos;s relationship with the US . 
With hindsight , it is clear that Britain &apos;s participation in the Iraq war was driven solely by Blair &apos;s determination to stick limpet-like to the US . 
Brown believes , and has said , that Britain must always be close friends with America ; and obviously that is the right thing to believe and say . 
But is he prepared to make clear that there is a difference between being close friends and going into an illegal and disastrous war just to please George W Bush ? 
So far , there is no indication that he will . 
While he has publicly regretted the errors in British intelligence about Saddam Hussein , that is merely a way of shifting the blame from the government to the intelligence services . 
But it was not the intelligence services that decided to go to war ; it was Tony Blair , with the support of Gordon Brown .
