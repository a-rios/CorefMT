Virtuous Victuals 
CAMBRIDGE , MA - The maxim &quot; you are what you eat &quot; has defined dietary thinking for hundreds of years . 
The prevailing interpretation is simple : our bodies , like the foods that we eat , are chemical compositions . 
In order to live long and healthy lives , and to maximize our potential , we must consume the right chemicals - that is , foods with the right nutrients . 
Not so long ago , however , this saying was understood quite differently , indicating a profound shift in the way that we think about our diet and ourselves - a shift that has powerful implications for current health debates . 
In ancient Greek and Roman medicine , prevention was key . 
Regimen , commonly called dietetics , prescribed a lifestyle designed to keep people healthy . 
Indeed , while doctors did everything in their power to cure ailing patients , dietetics was considered the most important area of medical practice . 
After all , with a sound diet , one would presumably never need a cure . 
Dietetics was a prescription for an ordered manner of living , guiding people not only on matters of food and drink , but on all governable aspects of their lives that affected well-being , including their places of residence , exercise , sleeping patterns , bowel movements , sexual activity , and an area neglected by medicine today : emotional control . 
In short , dietetics was a matter of virtue as well as of bodily health . 
The medical profession doled out advice about how one should eat in the same breath as instructions about how one should live - and about what sort of person one should be . 
Traditional dietetic advice now seems banal , with its almost exclusive focus on moderation . 
For example , dietetic counsel would recommend that patients eat neither too much nor too little ; sleep when necessary , but not excessively ; exercise , but not violently ; and control anger and stress . 
The Temple of Apollo at Delphi bore the inscription , &quot; Nothing in excess , &quot; while Aristotelian philosophy held that the golden mean was the path to the good . 
Given the current frenzy of fad diets and the eternal search for simple remedies for complex conditions , moderation in all things may seem like shabby medicine . 
But dietetics &quot; conviction that health and morality are two sides of the same coin is a deep-rooted notion . 
After all , Christianity lists gluttony as one of the seven deadly sins , while temperance is one of the cardinal virtues . 
Both good and good for you , moderation became a commanding idea : by rooting medical advice in powerful systems of social values , dietetics shaped medical thought for centuries . 
Rejecting dietetic advice amounted to rejecting moral wisdom . 
This merging of medicine and morality now seems naively unscientific , thanks to &quot; nutrition science , &quot; which replaced traditional dietetics as a formal discipline in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
Nutritional experts today are more likely to suggest monitoring cholesterol levels than they are to give such holistic and common-sense advice as moderation . 
Gluttony was once a sin ; obesity is now a disease ( or a &quot; risk factor &quot; for other diseases ) . 
Because science ostensibly advances by setting aside moral questions to address material cause-and-effect relationships , this shift could be perceived as progress . 
But the separation of the &quot; good &quot; from the &quot; good for you &quot; limits the influence of modern nutritional expertise on people &apos;s behavior , ultimately undermining the goal of improving public health . 
Historical change cannot be undone . 
For example , one plausible explanation of the rise in obesity is the decline of the family meal - at which children might be urged to &quot; eat more , &quot; but also would likely be told when they had eaten &quot; more than enough . &quot; 
In today &apos;s eat-and-run culture , people increasingly tend to consume food free from fear of a disapproving gaze . 
Individuals eat alone , and societies get fat together . 
While there is no simple solution to today &apos;s dietary woes , we can take a collective decision to reconsider not just what we eat , but our approach to eating , and to recognize the inherent value in eating together . 
A shared meal might be good for you as well as good .
