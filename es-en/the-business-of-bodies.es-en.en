The Business of Bodies 
Medical research nowadays increasingly sounds like business . 
Gene sequences are patented ; cord blood is a hot property . 
Geneticists talk of &quot; prospecting &quot; for genes . 
Body tissue is &quot; extracted , &quot; &quot; harvested , &quot; and &quot; banked . &quot; 
This language reflects the growing ability to transform human tissue into research materials and clinical products . 
Blood can serve as the basis for immortalized cell lines in biological studies and in developing pharmaceutical products . 
Snippets of infant foreskin are used for generating artificial skin . 
Biopsied tissues are used to manufacture therapeutic genetic material . 
Human tissue , organs and cells are used in place of animal tissue for testing pharmaceuticals and cosmetics because animals are expensive and using them incites protests . 
Body tissue also has commercial value beyond medicine . 
Placenta is used in shampoos . 
Kiotech , a British biotech firm , harvests human sweat to extract pheromones for a product called &quot; Xcite , &quot; towelettes saturated with a sexual hormone that &quot; boosts the wearer &apos;s sexual smell signature . &quot; 
Kary Mullis , a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist , founded a company called &quot; Star Gene &quot; to market jewelry containing DNA cloned from rock stars . 
Stranger still is &quot; GeneLink , &quot; which markets DNA kits to funeral directors to help them extract DNA from the deceased . 
Research and clinical uses of body parts have been controversial since the early days of anatomical dissection , which once evoked Dante-esque visions of Hell . 
As the Renaissance brought growing interest in anatomy , body snatching became a lucrative business with cadavers obtained through grave robbing , bribing hospital attendants , or even murdering beggars . 
The commercial calculus behind this business sometimes caused riots until anatomy laws allowed the bodies of executed murderers and the unclaimed dead to be used , thus reassuring middle and upper class individuals that their bodies would not be involved . 
These old tensions have assumed new dimensions as the commercial potential of human tissue catches the entrepreneurial imagination . 
But few laws are in place to address the uses of cells , tissues , and genes . 
The most familiar case concerning the body as property is that of John Moore , a patient who developed hairy cell leukemia and had his spleen removed at the UCLA School of Medicine in 1976 . 
His physician patented certain chemicals in Moore &apos;s blood without his knowledge or consent , set up contracts , and sold the rights to a Swiss pharmaceutical company to produce drugs from the &quot; Mo &quot; cell line . 
Moore became suspicious when UCLA cancer specialists kept taking samples of his blood , bone marrow , skin and sperm for seven years . 
When Moore discovered in 1984 that he had become patent number 4,438,032 , he sued for malpractice and property theft . 
His physician claimed that Moore had waived his interest in his body parts by signing a general consent form . 
But Moore felt that his integrity was violated , his body exploited , and his tissue turned into a product . 
The Court held that clinicians must inform patients in advance of surgery that their tissue could be used for research , but denied Moore &apos;s claim . 
Who should profit from parts taken from an individual &apos;s body ? 
The court decided that the doctor and biotechnology company , not the patient , should profit . 
It argued that giving Moore a property right to his tissue would &quot; destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical research . &quot; 
This privileging of biotechnology companies incited today &apos;s genetics gold rush . 
Disputes such as this raise fundamental questions : who profits ? who loses ? 
Can exploitation be avoided ? 
Is body tissue to be defined as waste , like the material in a hospital bed-pan and thus freely available as raw material for commercial products ? 
Or does body tissue have inherent value as part of a person ? 
Are genes the essence of an individual and a sacred part of the human inheritance ? 
Or are they , as a director of SmithKline Beecham purportedly claimed , &quot; the currency of the future . &quot; 
Commodifying human tissue - often without knowledge or consent - is troubling because it violates social assumptions and beliefs about the body . 
Commercialization can undermine trust in science and medical practice by inciting fears of exploitation . 
John Moore &apos;s experience suggests that the commercial interests of doctors can encourage them to take more tissue than needed for their patients &apos; benefit . 
Physicians or institutions with economic interests can also influence the decisions of vulnerable hospital patients who are reluctant to consent to certain procedures . 
Market incentives to treat body tissue as a commodity may also threaten personal beliefs . 
During WWII , the Dutch for example , were reluctant to give blood that could help German soldiers . 
Because of past exploitation , some African-American women refuse to allow amniotic tissue to be collected for prenatal diagnosis as they fear the uses that could be made of this tissue . 
The business of bodies intrudes on privacy , too . 
Banked cord blood and collected tissues can yield not only research materials , but information about future genetic conditions as well . 
Body tissue can be used to identify the genetic predispositions of individuals ( of interest to insurers ) , or to redefine political entitlements ( as Native Americans fear ) , or to reinforce social stereotypes ( say , through research on diseases of specific race groups ) . 
Although the law remains unsettled with respect to controlling commercial interests in body tissue , we are beginning to see the principles of consent and non-commodification , developed to regulate organ donation , extended to this area . 
Certain professional organizations are emphasizing the need to obtain patient consent even if tissue has already been removed from a patient &apos;s body . 
Today , there are brain tissue banks , breast tissue banks , blood banks , umbilical cord banks , DNA banks and tissue repositories for studying various diseases . 
Virtually all of us have tissue on file somewhere . 
Who should have access to these samples ? 
For what purposes can they be used ? 
How can we assure informed consent for future uses of human body materials ? 
In the context of growing commercial interest in human tissue and the potential for abuse , greater regulation is essential .
