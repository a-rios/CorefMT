Europe &apos;s Historic Gamble 
BERKELEY - The last few weeks have been the most amazing - and important - period of the euro &apos;s 11-year existence . 
First came the Greek crisis , followed by the Greek bailout . 
When the crisis spread to Portugal and Spain , there was the $ 1 trillion rescue . 
Finally , there were unprecedented purchases of Spanish , Portuguese , Greek , and Irish bonds by the European Central Bank . 
All of this was unimaginable a month ago . 
Europe &apos;s fortnight mirabilis was also marked by amazing - and erroneous - predictions . 
Greece would be booted out of the monetary union . 
The eurozone would be divided into a Northern European union and a Southern European union . 
Or the euro - and even the European Union - would disintegrate as Germany turned its back on the project . 
But , rather than folding their cards , European leaders doubled down . 
They understand that their gamble will be immensely costly if it proves wrong . 
But they also understand that they already have too many chips in the pot to fold . 
Those forecasting the demise of the euro were wrong because they misunderstood the politics . 
The euro is the symbol of the European project . 
Jacques Delors , one of its architects , once called the single currency &quot; the jewel in Europe &apos;s crown . &quot; 
Abandoning it would be tantamount to declaring the entire European integration project a failure . 
It is true that Germans are incensed about bailing out Greece . 
But her views and actions are shaped by the society in which she lives , which in turn is shaped by that history . 
And what is true of Merkel is still true of Europe . 
This is why European leaders swallowed hard and took their unprecedented steps . 
But , having doubled their bet , Europeans now must make their monetary union work . 
Europe has excellent bank notes . 
It needs to establish them - and fast - which requires finally addressing matters that have been off-limits in the past . 
First , Europe needs a Stability Pact with teeth . 
This will now happen , because Germany will insist on it . 
As the European Commission has proposed , the strengthened pact will have tighter deficit limits for heavily indebted countries . 
Exceptions and exemptions will be removed . 
Governments will be required to let the Commission vet their budgetary plans in advance . 
Second , Europe needs more flexible labor markets . 
Adjustment in the United States &quot; monetary union occurs partly through labor mobility . 
This will never apply to Europe to a similar degree , given cultural and linguistic barriers . 
Instead , Europe will have to rely on wage flexibility to enhance the competitiveness of its depressed regions . 
This is not something that it possesses in abundance . 
Where national wage-bargaining systems are the obstacle , the European Commission should say so , and countries should be required to change them . 
Third , the euro area needs fiscal co-insurance . 
It needs a mechanism for temporary transfers to countries that have put their public finances in order but are hit by adverse shocks . 
To be clear , this is not an argument for Germany &apos;s dreaded &quot; transfer union &quot; - ongoing transfers to countries like Greece . 
It is an argument for fiscal insurance running in both directions . 
Fourth , the eurozone needs a proper emergency financing mechanism . 
Emergencies should not be dealt with on an ad hoc basis by 27 finance ministers frantic to reach a solution before the Asian markets open . 
And European leaders , in their desperation , should not coerce the European Central Bank into helping . 
There should be clear rules governing disbursement , who is in charge , and how much money is available . 
It should not be necessary to obtain the agreement of 27 national parliaments each time action is needed . 
Finally , Europe needs coherent bank regulation . 
One reason the Greek crisis is so difficult is that European banks are undercapitalized , overleveraged , and stuffed full of Greek bonds , thereby ruling out the possibility of restructuring - and thus lightening - Greece &apos;s debt load . 
That happened because European bank regulation is still characterized by a race to the bottom . 
&quot; Colleges &quot; of regulators , the supposed solution , are inadequate . 
If Europe has a single market and a single currency , it needs a single bank regulator . 
This is a formidable - some would say unrealistically ambitious - agenda .
