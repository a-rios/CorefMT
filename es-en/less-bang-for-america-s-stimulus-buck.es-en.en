Less Bang for America &apos;s Stimulus Buck 
MILAN - The run-up to the economic crisis in the United States was characterized by excessive leverage in financial institutions and the household sector , inflating an asset bubble that eventually collapsed and left balance sheets damaged to varying degrees . 
The aftermath involves resetting asset values , deleveraging , and rehabilitating balance sheets - resulting in today &apos;s higher saving rate , significant shortfall in domestic demand , and sharp uptick in unemployment . 
So the most important question the US now faces is whether continued fiscal and monetary stimulus can , as some believe , help to right the economy . 
To be sure , at the height of the crisis , the combined effect of fiscal stimulus and massive monetary easing had a big impact in preventing a credit freeze and limiting the downward spiral in asset prices and real economic activity . 
The reason is simple : the pre-crisis period of consuming capital gains that turned out to be at least partly ephemeral inevitably led to a post-crisis period of inhibited spending , diminished demand , and higher unemployment . 
Counter-cyclical policy can moderate these negative effects , but it cannot undo the damage or accelerate the recovery beyond fairly strict limits . 
As a result , the benefits associated with deficit-financed boosts to household income are now being diminished by the propensity to save and rebuild net worth . 
On the business side , investment and employment follows demand once the inventory cycle has run its course . 
Until demand returns , business will remain in a cost-cutting mode . 
The bottom line is that deficit spending is now fighting a losing battle with an economy that is deleveraging and restructuring its balance sheets , its exports , and its microeconomic composition - in short , its future growth potential . 
That restructuring will occur , deficit spending or no deficit spending . 
So policy needs to acknowledge the fact that there are limits to how fast this restructuring can be accomplished . 
Attempting to exceed these speed limits not only risks damaging the fiscal balance and the dollar &apos;s stability and resilience , but also may leave the economy and government finances highly vulnerable to future shocks that outweigh the quite modest short-term benefits of accelerated investment and employment . 
Demand will revive , but only slowly . 
True , asset prices have recovered enough to help balance sheets , but probably not enough to help consumption . 
The impact on consumption will largely have to wait until balance sheets , for both households and businesses , are more fully repaired . 
Higher foreign demand from today &apos;s trade-surplus countries ( China , Germany , and Japan , among others ) could help restore some of the missing demand . 
Moreover , responding to expanded foreign demand will require structural changes in the US economy , which will also take time . 
Quite the contrary . 
Today , the best way to use deficits and government debt is to focus on distributional issues , particularly the unemployed , both actual and potential . 
In an extended balance-sheet recession of this type , unemployment benefits need to be substantial and prolonged . 
The argument that this would discourage the unemployed from seeking work has merit in normal times , but not now . 
Today &apos;s unemployment , after all , is structural , rather than the result of perverse incentives . 
Benefits should be expanded and extended for a limited , discretionary period . 
When structural barriers to employment have diminished , unemployment benefits should revert to their old norms . 
Monetary policy is a more complex and difficult balancing act . 
A more aggressive interest-rate policy would likely reduce asset prices ( or at least slow the rate of appreciation ) , increase adjustable-rate debt-service burdens , and trigger additional balance-sheet distress and disorderly deleveraging , such as foreclosures . 
All of this would slow the recovery , perhaps even causing it to stall . 
But there are consequences to abjuring this approach as well . 
Low-cost credit is unlikely to have a significant impact on consumption in the short run , but it can produce asset inflation and misallocations . 
Much of the rest of the world would prefer a stronger dollar , fewer capital inflows with a carry-trade flavor , and less need to manage their own currencies &quot; appreciation to avoid adverse consequences for their economies &quot; competitiveness . 
In short , the sort of monetary policy now being practiced for a fragile economy like the US will cause distortions in the global economy that require policy responses in many other countries . 
From a political point of view , the crisis has been portrayed as a failure of financial regulation , with irresponsible lending fueling a rapid rise in systemic risk . 
That leaves the rest of the real economy populated with people who feel like victims - albeit victims who , prior to the crisis , bought a lot of houses , vacations , TVs , and cars . 
Unfortunately , that perception pushes the policy response in the direction of too much remedial action , even when the marginal returns are low . 
What we most need now is support for the unemployed , stable government finances with a clearly communicated deficit-reduction plan , some truth-telling about medium-term growth prospects , and an orderly healing process in which balance sheets are restored mostly without government intervention .
