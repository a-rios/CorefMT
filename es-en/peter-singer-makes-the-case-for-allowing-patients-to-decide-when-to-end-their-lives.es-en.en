Choosing Death 
PRINCETON - &quot; I will take my life today around noon . 
It is time . &quot; 
With these words , posted online , Gillian Bennett , an 85-year-old New Zealander living in Canada , began her explanation of her decision to end her life . 
Bennett had known for three years that she was suffering from dementia . 
By August , the dementia had progressed to the point at which , as she put it : &quot; I have nearly lost me . &quot; 
&quot; I want out , &quot; Bennett wrote , &quot; before the day when I can no longer assess my situation , or take action to bring my life to an end . &quot; 
Her husband , Jonathan Bennett , a retired philosophy professor , and her children supported her decision , but she refused to allow them to assist her suicide in any way , as doing so would have exposed them to the risk of a 14-year prison sentence . 
She therefore had to take the final steps while she was still competent to do so . 
For most of us , fortunately , life is precious . 
We want to go on living because we have things to look forward to , or because , overall , we find it enjoyable , interesting , or stimulating . 
Sometimes we want to go on living because there are things that we want to achieve , or people close to us whom we want to help . 
Bennett was a great-grandmother ; if all had been well with her , she would have wanted to see the next generation grow up . 
Bennett &apos;s developing dementia deprived her of all of the reasons for wanting to continue to live . 
That makes it hard to deny that her decision was both rational and ethical . 
By committing suicide , she was giving up nothing that she wanted , or could reasonably value . 
&quot; All I lose is an indefinite number of years of being a vegetable in a hospital setting , eating up the country &apos;s money but having not the faintest idea of who I am . &quot; 
Bennett &apos;s decision was also ethical because , as the reference to &quot; the country &apos;s money &quot; suggests , she was not thinking only of herself . 
Opponents of legal voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide sometimes say that if the laws were changed , patients would feel pressured to end their lives in order to avoid being a burden to others . 
Baroness Mary Warnock , the moral philosopher who chaired the British government committee responsible for the 1984 &quot; Warnock Report , &quot; which established the framework for her country &apos;s pioneering legislation on in vitro fertilization and embryo research , disagrees . 
She has suggested that there is nothing wrong with feeling that you ought to die for the sake of others as well as for yourself . 
In an interview published in 2008 in the Church of Scotland &apos;s magazine Life and Work , she supported the right of those suffering intolerably to end their lives . 
&quot; If somebody absolutely , desperately wants to die because they &apos;re a burden to their family , or the state , &quot; she argued , &quot; then I think they too should be allowed to die . &quot; 
Because Canada &apos;s public health service provides care for people with dementia who are unable to care for themselves , Bennett knew that she would not have to be a burden on her family ; nonetheless , she was concerned about the burden that she would impose upon the public purse . 
In a hospital , she might survive for another ten years in a vegetative state , at a cost she conservatively estimated to be around $ 50,000- $ 75,000 per year . 
As Bennett would not benefit from remaining alive , she regarded this as a waste . 
She was concerned , too , about the health care workers who would have to care for her : &quot; Nurses , who thought they were embarked on a career that had great meaning , find themselves perpetually changing my diapers and reporting on the physical changes of an empty husk . &quot; 
Such a situation would be , in her words , &quot; ludicrous , wasteful , and unfair . &quot; 
Some will object to the description of a person with advanced dementia as an &quot; empty husk . &quot; 
But , having seen this condition overtake my mother and my aunt - both vibrant , intelligent women , who were reduced to lying , unresponsive , in a bed for months or ( in my aunt &apos;s case ) years - it seems to me entirely accurate . 
Beyond a certain stage of dementia , the person we knew is gone . 
If the person did not want to live in that condition , what is the point of maintaining the body ? 
In any health-care system , resources are limited and should be used for care that is wanted by the patient , or from which the patient will benefit . 
For people who do not want to live on when their mind has gone , deciding when to die is difficult . 
In 1990 , Janet Adkins , who was suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s disease , traveled to Michigan to end her life with the assistance of Dr. Jack Kevorkian , who was widely criticized for helping her to die , because at the time of her death she was still well enough to play tennis . 
She chose to die nonetheless , because she could have lost control over her decision if she had delayed it . 
Bennett , in her eloquent statement , looked forward to the day when the law would allow a physician to act not only on a prior &quot; living will &quot; that bars life-prolonging treatment , but also on one that requests a lethal dose when the patient becomes incapacitated to a specified extent . 
Such a change would remove the anxiety that some patients with progressive dementia have that they will go on too long and miss the opportunity to end their life at all . 
The legislation Bennett suggests would enable people in her condition to live as long as they want - but not longer than that .
