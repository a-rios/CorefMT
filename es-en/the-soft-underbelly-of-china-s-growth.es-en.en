The Soft Underbelly of China &apos;s Growth 
China &apos;s explosive economic growth hinges on the rest of the world , radically changing the global production chain and challenging the global trading system . 
If China maintains its growth momentum over the next two decades , the global system will face huge challenges . 
Indeed , the question is not so much whether the global system will endure the imbalances spawned by China , but how severe those imbalances will prove to be . 
Much of the concern over the past few years has centered on America &apos;s yawning current account and fiscal deficits , and its effort to get China to let the yuan float more freely against the dollar . 
China , by contrast , sees its growth as tied to a stable currency , and may not want to introduce a more flexible exchange-rate regime , even after the 2.1 % revaluation in July , pending alleviation of structural problems for which it is extremely difficult to set a timetable . 
In fact , even as China &apos;s economy has boomed over the past decade , structural adjustment in its domestic sectors slowed , mainly owing to political constraints . 
The banking system remains unhealthy and fragile ; capital markets are dying . 
The private sector &apos;s growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes . 
Mounting regional disparities , as well as the widening urban-rural divide , impede household consumption growth , increasing the economy &apos;s dependence on exports and foreign investment . 
For years , as optimists see it , China has been the world &apos;s cheap assembly shop for shoes , clothing , and microwave ovens . 
Now , it is laying the groundwork to become a global power in more sophisticated , technology-intensive industries . 
Billions of dollars are flowing into auto , steel , chemical , and high-tech electronics plants , setting the stage for China to be a major exporter of high-end products . 
While this argument suggests that the global trading system must make more room for a rising China ( and India ) , it overlooks the need to address the enormous structural problems in China &apos;s domestic sectors if export-led growth is to become sustainable . 
For these sectors , rapid investment-driven growth in the past decade has produced a mountain of excess capacity , reflected in stagnant prices and the banking sector &apos;s soaring volume of bad loans , as price wars squeeze profitability and stimulate real-estate speculation . 
Postponing structural reforms eventually constrains any economy &apos;s performance , as we saw in Japan in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
China has similar problems , with the investment-growth nexus threatening macroeconomic stability - witness the overheating that occurred in 2003 and 2004 . 
Indeed , China faces tremendous challenges in maintaining macroeconomic stability under conditions of export-led growth , with huge repercussions for the rest of the world . 
Given China &apos;s size and its rising share in the global market , macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials . 
But the political reality is that China &apos;s government favors rapid growth in the short run over the structural reforms needed to sustain long-term economic performance . 
Fiscal consolidation and the abrupt closure and restructuring of inefficient banks and state enterprises would , after all , constitute a powerful brake on short-term growth , threatening social peace and political stability . 
This may explain the growing efforts of Chinese businesses in recent years to go global themselves . 
Globalization is increasingly viewed as an alternative to domestic structural complexity . 
This strategy will exact a heavy price , just as it did in Japan twenty years ago . 
The main lesson of Japan &apos;s approach is that launching an aggressive buying spree overseas merely upsets established international balances of interests - thus generating greater tensions with the rest of the world - while hiding the seriousness of structural problems at home . 
China has much to gain by avoiding such a strategy . 
Focusing squarely on structural reforms would allay some of the fears that China &apos;s rise has inspired in the rest of the world , while winning praise from the international business community . 
Rather than scaring global corporations and their home states , China would retain strong political support abroad - and the financing that it needs for its continued development . 
In economic terms , China has no choice : it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two . 
Above all , truly secure and sustainable economic development requires that it build a large consumer base at home . 
Of course , the global imbalances associated with China &apos;s economic rise can take longer to adjust than they otherwise would , simply because the US welcomes it as being in America &apos;s own interest . 
But China &apos;s long-term interest , and that of the world , requires that it get serious about domestic structural reform .
