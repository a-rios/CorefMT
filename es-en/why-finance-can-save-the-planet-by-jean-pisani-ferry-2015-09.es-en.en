Why Finance Can Save the Planet 
PARIS - Most people hate finance , viewing it as the epitome of irresponsibility and greed . 
Action is urgently needed to contain global warming and prevent a disaster for humanity ; yet the global community is desperately short of tools . 
There is not much support for the most desirable solutions advocated by economists , such as a global cap on greenhouse-gas emissions , coupled with a trading system , or the enforcement of a worldwide carbon price through a global tax on CO2 emissions . 
Instead , negotiations for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December are being conducted on the basis of voluntary , unilateral pledges called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions . 
Although the inclusion of voluntary targets has the merit of creating global momentum , this approach is unlikely to result in commitments that are both binding and commensurate to the challenge . 
That is why climate advocates are increasingly looking for other means of triggering action . 
Finance is at the top of their list . 
For starters , finance provides an accurate yardstick to gauge if deeds are consistent with words . 
In 2011 , &quot; Unburnable Carbon , &quot; a path-breaking report by the nongovernmental Carbon Tracker Initiative , showed that the proven fossil-fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exceed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees Celsius . 
Reserves held just by the 200 top publicly listed fuel companies - thus excluding state-owned producers such as Saudi Arabia &apos;s Aramco - exceed this carbon budget by one-third . 
And that means that these companies &quot; stock-market valuation is inconsistent with containing global warning . 
This realization prompted a campaign to convince investors to divest from carbon-rich assets . 
Individuals and institutions representing a $ 2.6 trillion portfolio have already joined the divestment movement . 
Furthermore , Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has highlighted the threat represented by potentially stranded carbon assets . 
Investors are being warned that , from the standpoint of financial stability , &quot; brown &quot; securities bear specific risk . 
The amount of divestment may look big - and it is , particularly given that the campaign started recently . 
Yet $ 2.6 trillion amounts to less than 5 % of global private non-financial securities . 
The trend is real , but it is still too little to trigger significant changes in fossil-fuel companies &quot; valuation and behavior . 
A second reason why finance matters is that the transition to a low-carbon economy requires huge investments . 
According to the International Energy Agency , global investment in energy supply currently amounts to $ 1.6 trillion annually , and 70 % of it is still based on oil , coal , or gas . 
Green investment amounts to only 15 % of the total , and investment in energy efficiency - in buildings , transport , and industry - totals a meager $ 130 billion . 
Containing the increase in average surface temperature to two degrees requires developing clean technologies , and even more important , a four-fold increase in investment in energy efficiency over the next ten years . 
Yet such investment will not be financed easily : its return depends on a still-elusive carbon price and will often materialize only in the long run , while improving energy efficiency implies replacing hundreds of millions of outdated vehicles and refitting hundreds of millions of energy-voracious buildings . 
Adequate financing instruments are required for the right purpose at the right place and at the right scale . 
Development banks and green banks have a huge role to play . 
For example , dedicated long-term loans , coupled with a tax break or a subsidy , would help households decide to modernize their homes . 
But the real hope among climate specialists is that innovative finance could help provide the planning clarity that is currently missing . 
To elicit the investments that are necessary to mitigate climate change and green the economy , the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a credible , fast-rising path for the price of carbon are vital . 
To overcome such trepidation , advocates for climate action are turning to incentives . 
Some have recommended that governments issue CO2 performance bonds , whose yield would be reduced if companies exceed their carbon target . 
Another idea , put forward in a recent paper by Michel Aglietta and his colleagues , is to map out a path for an indicative price of carbon called its &quot; social value &quot; and provide green project developers a government-guaranteed carbon certificate representing the value of the corresponding emissions reduction . 
Central banks , they suggest , would then refinance loans to such developers , up to the value of the carbon certificate . 
This would amount to a calculated bet . 
If the price of carbon in , say , ten years , actually corresponds to the announced social value , the project will be profitable and the developer will repay the loan . 
Failure to increase the price of carbon would result either in higher public debt or , in the case of monetization , inflation . 
The idea is to force governments to have skin in the game , by balancing the risk of inaction on the carbon tax with the risk of insolvency or inflation . 
There would be no procrastination . 
Action against global warming would take place without delay . 
Undertaking massive investment now and deciding only later how to finance it looks irresponsible - and so it is .
