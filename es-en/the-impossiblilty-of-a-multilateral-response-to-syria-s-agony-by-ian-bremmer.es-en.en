Syria &apos;s G-Zero Fate 
NEW YORK - The G-20 has concluded its meetings and dinner discussions of what to do about charges that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has used poison gas to kill more than 1,400 of his own people . 
France , Britain , Turkey , and Canada expressed varying degrees of support for US President Barack President Obama &apos;s call for military action , while Russian President Vladimir Putin called US Secretary of State John Kerry a liar and claimed that the evidence against Assad is inconclusive . 
Russia and China insisted that the US cannot take action without approval from the United Nations Security Council , where they will veto any such move . 
From the sidelines , the European Union and Pope Francis warned that no &quot; military solution &quot; is possible in Syria . 
In other words , it all went exactly as expected . 
The Americans , French , and others continue to push the Russians to accept that Syria &apos;s government has used chemical weapons ; the Russians , anxious to protect their Syrian ally , reject the evidence as inconclusive ; and the carnage continues . 
The focus of the fight now moves to the US Congress , where a rare coalition of liberal Democrats and isolationist Republicans will try to block the president &apos;s plans . 
Those who would seek to halt the bloodshed have no good options . 
That is true for Obama , for Europeans preoccupied with domestic political headaches , and for Arab leaders eager to see Assad &apos;s government collapse but unwilling to say so publicly . 
British Prime Minister David Cameron says that his government has new evidence against Assad , while Parliament has voted to withhold support for a military response . 
France is ready to follow , but not to lead . 
The Arab League wants the &quot; international community &quot; to end the carnage , but without using force . 
Obama will ask Congress to approve limited air strikes that may deter the future use of chemical weapons , but will not shift the balance in Syria &apos;s civil war . 
Assad , Syrian rebels , Americans , Russians , and Arabs all merit criticism . 
Even if the US and France struck Damascus , they would not end the conflict in Syria - unlike in the former Yugoslavia , where they halted the Kosovo war by bombing Belgrade - for three reasons . 
First , there are too many interested parties with too diverse a range of interests . 
While bombing would give Assad plenty to think about , it would not force his surrender or encourage his allies to turn against him . 
Nor would it clarify how to restore stability and build a more stable and prosperous Syria , given the need for cooperation among so many actors with conflicting objectives . 
The US and Europe want a Syria that plays a more constructive role in the region . 
Iran and Russia want to retain their crucial ally . 
Turkey , Saudi Arabia , and Qatar want a Syria that keeps Iran at a distance and does not become a source of cross-border militancy . 
As a result , Syria is most likely to become an arena in which regional powers , with the backing of interested outsiders , compete for leverage . 
Second , the US - the one country with the muscle to play a decisive role - will continue to resist deeper involvement . 
Most Americans say that they want no part of Syria &apos;s pain ; they are weary of wars in the Middle East and want their leaders to focus on economic recovery and job creation . 
Obama will tread carefully as he approaches Congress and , even as his Republican opponents vote to offer limited support , they will make his life as difficult as possible . 
Finally , the US cannot count on its allies to help with the heavy lifting . 
In Libya , it was relatively easy to bomb Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s armies as they advanced through open spaces . 
By contrast , bombing Damascus - which remains a densely populated city , despite the flight of refugees - would undoubtedly kill a significant number of Syrian civilians . 
As in the Balkans a generation ago , when Western leaders moved to end the bloodiest European conflict since World War II , the French are ready to send planes and pilots to Syria . 
Moreover , most of Europe &apos;s leaders are preoccupied with the domestic fallout of the eurozone &apos;s ongoing struggles . 
In Germany , for example , Chancellor Angela Merkel will avoid unnecessary risks ahead of the upcoming general election . 
Likewise , Arab leaders - mindful of the turmoil in Egypt , rising violence in Iraq and Libya , and the threat of social unrest within their own countries - will not openly invite Western powers to bomb a Muslim country . 
Even Canada will sit this one out . 
This G-Zero problem will not last forever . 
Eventually , the political wildfires that are allowed to burn out of control will threaten enough powerful countries to force a certain level of cooperation . 
Unfortunately for Syrians , their suffering alone will not be enough .
