Farewell to the Revolution ? 
&quot; The FARC are finished , no matter how many men and weapons they may still have . &quot; 
Former Salvadoran guerrilla leader Joaquín Villalobos &quot; lapidary conclusion about the Colombian narco-guerrilla movement is worthy of consideration , given his unmatched insight into Latin America &apos;s armed , revolutionary left . 
So is the almost tearful acknowledgement by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez &apos;s ideological guru , Heinz Dieterich , that &quot; Chávez &apos;s speech on the FARC ( calling on it to abandon armed struggle and free its hostages ) is the equivalent of unconditional surrender to Washington &apos;s hemispheric ambition . &quot; 
However hasty these judgments may end up being , it certainly seems that the region &apos;s oldest and last political-military organization is , at long last , on the brink of defeat . 
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe &apos;s strategy of &quot; democratic security &quot; appears to have paid off , supported by the United States-financed Plan Colombia , as well as by much plain good luck , such as finding thousands of incriminating computer files three months ago in an attack on a FARC camp in Ecuador . 
If events in the next few months confirm the FARC &apos;s demise , Latin America would finally be rid of one of its main scourges over the past half-century . 
At least since December 1956 , when Fidel and Raúl Castro , together with a young Argentine doctor , later known as Che Guevara , sailed from Mexico &apos;s port of Tuxpan to Cuba and into history , the region has seen innumerable attempts by small left-wing revolutionary groups to take power through armed uprisings . 
They have all invoked heroic precedents from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , as well as the impossibility of proceeding otherwise under brutal right-wing dictatorships , such as Batista &apos;s in Cuba , Somoza &apos;s in Nicaragua , and military-oligarchic complexes in Guatemala , El Salvador , Bolivia , Argentina , Peru , Uruguay , and elsewhere - including Colombia . 
In many of these cases , they were right : without recourse to guns and bullets , nothing in their countries would ever have changed . 
They achieved only three successes : Cuba , in 1959 ; 
Everywhere else , for whatever reason - misguided strategies , tactical mistakes , erroneous theories , US intervention , etc . - they faced only defeat , repression , and futility . 
By the early 1990 &quot; s , it became increasingly evident that the armed struggle for power in Latin American was winding down . 
Only a few groups remained : the Shining Path in Peru , the Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front in Chile , for a brief time the Zapatistas in Chiapas , Mexico , and the FARC in Colombia . 
Democratic transitions throughout the hemisphere had made guerrilla warfare unjustifiable : as Che foretold in his La Guerra de Guerrillas in 1962 , wherever the trappings ( or , one might add , the realities ) of democratic rule prevailed , taking up arms was pointless . 
In country after country , the guerrillas were defeated , pacified , brought into the democratic process , or rendered irrelevant . 
By the end of the twentieth century , only the FARC endured , together with a smattering of splinter groups in Mexico . 
So if Villalobos and Dieterich are right about the FARC &apos;s imminent collapse , it would be a veritable milestone for the region , and a vindication of a strategy - Uribe &apos;s - of which many of us were wary . 
That strategy has rightly been criticized for human rights violations , but it seems to have proved successful . 
This is no minor matter for the hemisphere , for Colombia , and for Uribe . 
Nonetheless , three major problems remain . 
First , despite high desertion rates , the death of three of their seven leaders , and Chávez &apos;s apparent decision to forsake them ( at least for now ) , the FARC have proved remarkably resilient over the past 40 years . 
Yes , they are divided , unpopular , and devoid of international representation , but the ups and downs of guerrilla warfare are well known ; the only truly dead guerrilla fighter is one who is buried . 
Second , it would seem highly risky to conclude that one speech by Chávez is tantamount to a fundamental affirmation of principle . 
To be sure , Chávez is absolutely crucial to FARC &apos;s survival , given its current , undoubtedly weakened condition . 
But , having met Chávez personally a dozen times , it appears naïve , at least to me , to attribute great significance or conviction to anything he says - moderate , hard left , or in between . 
He may well have opted for a minor tactical &quot; correction , &quot; only to wait to fight another day . 
Finally , supposing Uribe is on the verge of victory , what should he do with it ? 
Many have advocated negotiating pacification with the late FARC leader Manuel Marulanda &apos;s successors . 
But , without any notion of power-sharing , this is easier said than done . 
After all , the 1992 Chapultepec Peace Agreements , which ended the Salvadoran civil war , were signed more than two years after it became obvious that neither side could win . 
And this occurred thanks to skillful United Nations involvement , led by Alvaro de Soto ; the talent of sophisticated FMLN leaders like Villalobos and chief negotiator Salvador Samayoa ; strong pressure from the US and its point-man , Bernard Aronson ; and Salvadoran President Alfredo Christiani &apos;s undeniable courage and vision . 
Few of these ingredients exist in today &apos;s Colombia . 
So perhaps Villalobos should be a bit more cautious , and Dieterich a bit less forlorn .
