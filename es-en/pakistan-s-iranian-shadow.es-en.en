Pakistan &apos;s Iranian Shadow 
As the future of both Pakistan and its president , Pervez Musharraf , wallow in uncertainty in the wake of Benazir Bhutto &apos;s assassination , parallels are being drawn to the 1979 fall of the Shah and the Islamic Revolution in Iran . 
Once again , a &quot; pro-American &quot; autocrat seems to be rapidly losing his grip on power , with his US ally only half-heartedly standing by him . 
The liberal elite and intelligentsia rail against the dictator , confident that their country is primed for secular democracy . 
The obvious lesson to be drawn from 1979 is that America unwisely rested its entire strategic relationship with Iran on the shoulders of an unpopular dictator . 
When his regime crumbled , so did America &apos;s ability to realize its interests there . 
But the Iranian revolution holds another lesson for Pakistani liberals : obsessed with evicting the Shah , Iran &apos;s intelligentsia was delusional about their own society and their potential to emerge victorious via an abrupt political upheaval . 
Once the Shah left , the radical minority that was willing to fight and die for its cause devoured the &quot; moderate majority , &quot; establishing Islamist rule in short order . 
To be sure , profound political and cultural distinctions exist between Iran in the 1970 &quot; s and contemporary Pakistan . 
Iran lacked an independent judiciary , basic press freedoms , and civil society organizations . 
Contemporary Pakistan has , to varying degrees , all of these . 
More importantly , Iran &apos;s Shia clerics were both organized and politically active in a way that Pakistan &apos;s Sunni clergy have not been . 
Indeed , Pakistan &apos;s Islamist parties have never won more than 12 % of the popular vote . 
It would be wrong , however , to think that Pakistan is immune from the Muslim world &apos;s Islamist undercurrents . 
Around 40 % of Pakistanis live below the poverty line , half the population is illiterate , and , among those who are literate , many have been schooled in Wahhabi-funded madrasas . 
Various opinion polls consistently show that a sizable minority of Pakistanis has a favorable view of Osama bin Laden , an unfavorable view of the US , and believe that implementing Islamic law ( Sharia ) should be a priority . 
A Pakistani intellectual once confessed to me , &quot; I fear the weak electoral showings of Islamists in Pakistan has more to do with the fact that a compelling , charismatic Islamist leader - a Pakistani Hassan Nasrallah - has yet to emerge , not that his message wouldn &apos;t resonate . &quot; 
Few Iranians had ever heard of Ayatollah Khomeini until 1978 , but it didn &apos;t take long for his message to electrify millions . 
The army has always been the strongest bulwark in assuring that Pakistan does not go the way of Iran . 
But while the officer corps may be steadfast defenders of secular rule , the rank and file reflects Pakistani society . 
In the event of an Islamist political awakening , the army &apos;s allegiances are not guaranteed . 
In Iran , apart from senior commanders , who were either killed or fled the country , the Shah &apos;s powerful , staunchly secular army switched sides to Khomeini &apos;s revolutionary government virtually overnight . 
This is not to suggest than an Islamist awakening in Pakistan is on the horizon , or that Pakistanis must choose between an unpopular autocrat or a Taliban-style government . 
On the contrary , Pakistan &apos;s liberals are brave to agitate for democracy , the rule of law , and accountability for Musharraf , whose presidency appears beyond rehabilitation . 
But they should learn from Iran &apos;s revolution that their means of agitating for political reform are relevant to the political ends they hope to achieve . 
Emotions are raw in the aftermath of Bhutto &apos;s death . 
More than 50 people have been killed in riots , and both her party and that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif are contemplating mass demonstrations to bring down Musharraf &apos;s government . 
But the politics of rage , retribution , and rioting will not bring the kind of tranquil , pluralistic democracy that Bhutto envisioned . 
The desire to exact revenge on Musharraf for stifling democracy and failing to provide Bhutto with sufficient security will only inflame a political atmosphere that Pakistani liberals seek to de-radicalize . 
Not only in Iran , but also in Lebanon , Palestine , and Iraq , history has shown that Islamists thrive amid political chaos and violence . 
Similarly in Pakistan , it is dangerous to bet that the country &apos;s pro-democracy lawyers , intellectuals , and students will emerge victorious in the tumult and potential carnage of street politics . 
As John Limbert , the erudite Iran scholar and retired US diplomat ( taken hostage in Iran for 444 days ) once reflected on the 1979 Iranian revolution , &quot; Our liberal-minded Iranian friends proved to be helpless in political turmoil .... &#91; T &#93; hey could write biting editorials , &quot; but lacked the stomach to &quot; throw acid , beat up opponents , organize street gangs ... and engage in the brutality that wins &quot; in political uprisings . 
Pakistani liberals may be right that their country is invulnerable to an Islamist power grab . 
But the costs are too high to be impulsive , and the storms of political Islam are difficult to forecast . 
In 1978 , Iran &apos;s liberals were bent on removing the Shah by any means . 
Instead of creating an atmosphere conducive to an Iranian Gandhi , they unwittingly helped usher into power Ayatollah Khomeini and a theocratic regime less tolerant than the one they helped unseat . 
Three decades later , millions of chastened Iranians wish they could relive those heady days differently ; their Pakistani counterparts would be wise to heed their hindsight .
