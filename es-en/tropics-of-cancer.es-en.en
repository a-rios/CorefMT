Tropics of Cancer ? 
STANFORD - Cancer is sometimes thought of as a disease of wealthier countries , but it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in poorer ones as well . 
Indeed , by the end of this decade , about 150 million people worldwide will have cancer , with approximately 60 % of them residing in developing countries . 
Although fewer people in developing countries live to the age at which cancer is most prevalent , inadequate nutrition and environmental exposures to viruses and toxins , combined with a paucity of diagnostic and treatment options , increase cancer &apos;s incidence and lethality . 
Many people in poor countries die from cancers that are preventable or treatable in wealthier societies , but they often succumb to other scourges as well , such as infectious diseases . 
So what could and should be done about this conundrum ? 
Margaret Chan , the head of the World Health Organization , and Yukiya Amano , director of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , noted in a recent article that most developing countries &quot; health-care systems are designed to cope with infectious diseases rather than cancer . 
I find this to be a rational strategy , given the heavy toll that infections take , and that many can be prevented and treated at a relatively modest cost . 
The diagnosis and treatment of most types of cancer in developing countries would require a huge and daunting investment in infrastructure . 
As Chan and Amano point out : 
&quot; &#91; M &#93; ost lack the funds , equipment , and qualified personnel needed to provide basic care for cancer patients . 
Thirty countries - half of them in Africa - do not have a single radiotherapy machine . 
And these countries certainly do not have the financial resources , facilities , equipment , technology , infrastructure , staff , or training to cope with the long-term demands of cancer care . &quot; 
In order to begin addressing these deficiencies , &quot; The IAEA &apos;s work involves building countries &quot; capacity for radiation medicine . 
But technology means nothing without well-trained and motivated staff to use it . &quot; 
Such an approach is , however , poorly focused and unlikely to be cost-effective . 
As the United Nations &quot; own data make clear , infectious diseases , many of them preventable and treatable , remain the scourge of poorer populations . 
In 2008 , about 250 million cases of malaria caused almost a million deaths , mostly of children under five . 
In virtually all poor , malaria-endemic countries , there is inadequate access to antimalarial medicines ( especially artemisinin-based combination therapy ) . 
The incidence of malaria could be reduced drastically by the judicious application of the mosquito-killing chemical DDT , but UN and national regulators have curtailed its availability , owing to misguided notions about its toxicity . 
Hundreds of millions suffer from other neglected tropical diseases , including lymphatic filariasis and cholera . 
Although new HIV infections worldwide declined slightly during the past decade , 2.7 million people contracted the virus in 2008 , and there were two million HIV / AIDS-related deaths . 
By the end of that year , more than four million people in low- and middle-income countries were receiving anti-retroviral therapy , but more than five million who were HIV-positive remained untreated . 
The number of new cases of tuberculosis cases worldwide is increasing , and the growing emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of the bacteria is especially worrisome . 
According to UN statistics , about 15 % of the world &apos;s population lacks access to safe drinking water , and &quot; in 2008 , 2.6 billion people had no access to a hygienic toilet or latrine , &quot; while &quot; 1.1 billion were defecating in the open . &quot; 
Primitive approaches to managing sewage continue to spread infections such as schistosomiasis , trachoma , viral hepatitis , and cholera . 
Many cancers are likely caused by chronic viral infections , another reason that it is surely more sensible to attack infectious diseases by improving access to clean water , basic sanitation , antibiotics , and vaccines than it is to build radiotherapy facilities . 
In some technology-poor but oil-rich Middle East countries , state-of-the-art radiotherapy ( and cardio-pulmonary bypass ) equipment has been delivered , but never used , or has been damaged by electrical surges or power outages . 
And many poor countries do not have a single medical school , and when their citizens study abroad , they often stay there , or are ill-equipped for a low-tech milieu that is so different from where they trained . 
Although the use of big-ticket equipment , expensive chemotherapy drugs , and sophisticated and complex procedures such as bone marrow transplantation would not be wise , this is not to say that we should give up entirely on cancer treatment in developing countries . 
Sometimes , prevention , diagnosis , and treatment are cost-effective . 
Vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B ( and C , when one becomes available ) reduce the incidence not only of the viral infections , but also of sequelae such as cirrhosis and hepatic carcinoma . 
And public-health efforts to curb air pollution and smoking could reduce the prevalence of lung cancer in Asia and Africa . 
Another example is cervical cancers , many of which can be prevented by vaccines against human papilloma virus . 
And acetic acid can be used to visualize cervical cancers , which can then be treated with cryotherapy ( freezing ) . 
The bottom line is that in a world of limited health-care resources , we need to make hard decisions that will deliver high-impact outcomes for the most people at the least cost .
