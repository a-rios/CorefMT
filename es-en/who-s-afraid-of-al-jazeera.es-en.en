Who \ u0027s Afraid of Al Jazeera ? 
No one is indifferent to Al Jazeera , the Qatari-based Arab satellite television station . 
You can practically see the blood of US officials boil when they discuss it . 
To be sure , in the context of the dream of all Arabs being united and independent of foreign control , Al Jazeera is undeniably partial to Arab aspirations . 
But that does not make its news reporting untruthful . 
In fact , Al Jazeera , which US Secretary of State Colin Powell calls &quot; horrible &quot; and &quot; slanted , &quot; is a pivotal vehicle for reform and change , which genuinely democratic Arab activists and the international community alike have been calling for . 
So incensed has America been , however , that it created its own Arabic language mouthpiece in the form of satellite station Al Hurra . 
Yet Al Hurra is forbidden from broadcasting within the US , because it is state controlled . 
Arabs don &apos;t trust it , either . 
It demonstrated its lapdog status by never broadcasting images of prisoners being abused inside Baghdad &apos;s notorious Abu Ghraib prison . 
In this respect , at least , Al Hurra fits perfectly within the tame tradition of Arab state broadcasters . 
America , however , is not alone in challenging Al Jazeera head on . 
The BBC , which briefly ran its own Arabic language news station in the mid-1990 &apos;s - before closing it down because its Saudi funders were unhappy with its reporting - recently announced that it will re-launch an Arabic language news satellite station . 
But instead of bashing or seeking to undermine Al Jazeera , politicians should encourage this bastion of free expression , recognizing that Arabs will need to endure a messy process on the way to democracy . 
Along that tortuous route , the world &apos;s major powers are bound to be offended , probably quite regularly . 
Television in the Arab world has for years been the mouthpiece used by ruling presidents , kings , and emirs to propagate their official opinions and nothing else . 
Elite military units usually protect radio and television stations , because they have often been the first targets in military coups . 
Given this history , and the storm of calls for reform in the Arab world , it is a tragic irony that America and the West have paid so little attention to the terrestrial Arab monopoly television channels . 
Indeed , US criticism of Al Jazeera sounds more like special pleading because of America &apos;s inept bumbling in Iraq than a genuine desire for free , open , and critical Arab media . 
If democracy means giving people a free choice , then there is no doubt that the choice of most Arabs is for a television broadcaster that reflects their aspirations . 
In this sense , Al Jazeera is clearly biased , because it is run by Arab patriots and reflects Arab sentiment . 
But this is no more a crime than the fact that America &apos;s media reflects American aspirations , and in times of war behaves like a cheerleader for US forces . 
The key issue here is whether Al Jazeera , as well as American TV stations , are truthful in what they say . 
Al Jazeera is certainly professional . 
Its leading journalists are Western-trained , many having worked for years at the BBC . 
In fact , Al Jazeera was founded only after the BBC closed its Arabic language station under Saudi pressure . 
Al Jazeera &apos;s motto , &quot; opinion and opposing opinion , &quot; has galvanized Arab viewers , because clashing opinions are rarely heard on terrestrial Arab television stations . 
Of course , when covering the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the US-led war on Iraq , Al Jazeera has not been objective . 
How could it be ? 
But it did not make up facts ; it merely reflected majority Arab opinion . 
On such fundamental issues of Arab consensus , it is simply illogical to expect an Arab broadcaster to be even-handed . 
Moreover , Al Jazeera has not been dumb to complaints about it . 
In July , Al Jazeera became the first Arab TV station to create a professional code of ethics . 
According to the BBC , the code defines with absolute clarity and transparency how Al-Jazeera journalists are to behave , and sets clear divisions between news , analysis , and commentary . 
As for Al Jazeera &apos;s journalistic performance , it is past time that the station be judged by respected professional journalists , not by US or other officials with a policy axe to grind . 
A major university department of journalism working with Arab media critics , for example , could provide a much more honest analysis of the station &apos;s work . 
If American , British , and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world , they must support reform-minded Arab individuals and organizations , even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times . 
If that becomes the West &apos;s standard , Al Jazeera will rightly be seen as part of the solution , not part of the problem .
