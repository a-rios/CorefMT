Rethinking the Sino-American Relationship 
NEW HAVEN - In early July , senior US and Chinese officials will gather in Beijing for the sixth Strategic and Economic Dialogue . 
With bilateral frictions mounting on a number of fronts - including cyber security , territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas , and currency policy - the summit offers an opportunity for a serious reconsideration of the relationship between the world &apos;s two most powerful countries . 
The United States and China are locked in an uncomfortable embrace - the economic counterpart of what psychologists call &quot; codependency . &quot; 
The flirtation started in the late 1970s , when China was teetering in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution and the US was mired in a wrenching stagflation . 
Desperate for economic growth , two needy countries entered into a marriage of convenience . 
China was quick to benefit from an export-led economic model that was critically dependent on America as its largest source of demand . 
The US gained by turning to China for low-cost goods that helped income-constrained consumers make ends meet ; it also imported surplus savings from China to fill the void of an unprecedented shortfall of domestic saving , with the deficit-prone US drawing freely on China &apos;s voracious appetite for Treasury securities . 
Over time , this marriage of convenience morphed into a full-blown and inherently unhealthy codependency . 
Both partners took the relationship for granted and pushed unbalanced growth models too far - the US with its asset and credit bubbles that underpinned a record consumption binge , and China with an export-led resurgence that was ultimately dependent on America &apos;s consumption bubble . 
The imbalances only worsened . 
China &apos;s three decades of 10 % annual hyper-growth led to unsustainable strains - outsize resource and energy needs , environmental degradation and pollution , and mounting income inequality . 
Huge Chinese current-account surpluses resulted from too much saving and too little consumption . 
Mounting imbalances in the US were the mirror image of those in China - a massive shortfall of domestic saving , unprecedented current-account deficits , excess debt , and an asset-dependent economy that was ultimately built on speculative quicksand . 
Predictably , in keeping with the pathology of codependence , the lines distinguishing the two countries became blurred . 
Over the past decade , Chinese subsidiaries of Western multinationals accounted for more than 60 % of the cumulative rise in China &apos;s exports . 
In other words , the export miracle was sparked not by state-sponsored Chinese companies but by offshore efficiency solutions crafted in the West . 
This led to the economic equivalent of a personal identity crisis : Who is China - them or us ? 
In personal relationships , denial tends to mask imbalances - but only for so long . 
Ultimately , the denial cracks and imbalances give rise to frictions and blame - holding a codependent partner responsible for problems of one &apos;s own making . 
Such is the case with the US and China . 
America blames China for its trade deficits and the pressures they inflict on workers , citing a massive accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves as evidence of an unconscionable currency manipulation . 
China counters by underscoring America &apos;s saving shortfall - a gap that must be plugged by surplus saving from abroad , a current-account deficit , and a multilateral trade imbalance with more than 100 countries . 
China blames the US for fixating on a bilateral imbalance as the source of America &apos;s multilateral problem . 
The same blame game of codependency is apparent in the cyber-security controversy . 
The US contends that China steals intellectual property for competitive reasons , inflicting grave damage on companies and workers . 
China , for its part , claims that the US is guilty of equally egregious violations - widespread cyber spying on international leaders , trade negotiators , and foreign firms . 
Equally worrisome are the security disputes that have flared up in the East and South China Seas , which , via treaty obligations , directly involve the US . 
The longer these frictions fester , the greater the risk of an accident or miscalculation leading to a military response - culminating in the ultimate break-up nightmare . 
The US and China could escape the potentially destructive endgame of a codependent relationship by recasting their ties as a more constructive and sustainable interdependency . 
An interdependent relationship fosters healthy interaction between partners , who satisfy their own needs rather than relying on others to do so , and maintain their own identities while appreciating the relationship &apos;s mutual benefits . 
The upcoming Strategic and Economic Dialogue provides the US and China a platform of engagement to seize their collective opportunities . 
Both countries should press ahead with a bilateral investment treaty , which would enhance rules-based market access and eventually foster greater trade liberalization . 
That would allow the US , the world &apos;s preeminent services economy , to seize the opportunity that is about to be provided by the emergence in China of a services-led consumer society . 
At the same time , the upcoming dialogue should aim to restart the military-to-military exchanges on cyber-security issues that were launched a year ago . 
Here as well , the goal should be a rules-based system of engagement - especially vital for all modern economies in an era of IT-enabled globalization . 
Progress on these fronts will not be possible if the US and China remain stuck in the quagmire of codependency . 
Only by embracing the opportunities of interdependency can the hegemon and the rising power reduce tensions and focus on the benefits of mutually sustainable prosperity .
