Russia \ u0027s TV Wars 
Pulling the plug on TV-6 was a sad day for Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Not only did this event hurt the cause of freedom of speech , but the rule of law here has been deeply wounded and President Putin has squandered the goodwill of the very people in the West he seeks to emulate . 
Closing TV-6 in many ways reflects what has gone wrong in Russia since 1991 . 
Many people share the blame for the failures that have occurred since communism &apos;s collapses . 
Indeed , the types of characters involved in TV-6 &apos;s closure have been with us since then . 
Greed , power , position , and egos have beset the electronic media as they have everything else in the postcommunist era . 
The heavy-handed closures of NTV and TV-6 are merely two of the best examples of this country &apos;s halting leap toward normality , and both closures reveal Putin &apos;s selective approach to restructuring Russia . 
Emotions about this event , however , are more in evidence than reasoned thoughts . 
The idea of &quot; freedom of speech &quot; has indeed suffered a set back , but a return to Soviet era thought control is not in the offing . 
For both Russia &apos;s government and its market place of ideas are continuing to discover what a free media actually means . 
Some in government think that a &quot; free media &quot; should only champion and praise the ruling elite . 
Some rich &quot; New Russians &quot; see the media as a means for pushing their personal agendas at the expense of society &apos;s interests , making themselves even wealthier . 
Much of the TV-6 affair , indeed , was about money . 
Whoever secures the stations &apos;s license when it is opened for renewal in late March can , if he or she puts in a professional management , look forward to big revenues from advertising . 
This golden nest egg may have been part of the Kremlin &apos;s thinking about the station and its ownership all along . 
Only days ago President Putin and Premier Mihail Kasyanov claimed that their actions were designed to protect the people of TV-6 . 
Putin &apos;s magnanimous words about the channel were , as usual , made while he was abroad . 
But in reality his words were empty , and merely shrouded another episode in his personal vendetta against the oligarch Boris Berezovsky ( TV-6 &apos;s owner ) , one that is unbecoming in a statesman . 
It is , of course , valid to require Boris Berezovsky to obey the law but , as so often in Russian history , the cost has become higher than the aim . 
For Putin &apos;s Kremlin and his Media Minister have mocked the rule of law by twisting the rules to achieve their aim : to end Berezovsky &apos;s control of the station . 
Still , the so-called victims of the government &apos;s moves against TV-6 are not blameless . 
Many members of TV-6 merely carried over the war of words they had been waging against Putin when they worked at NTV , the channel Putin and his ministers took aim at in an earlier media struggle . 
NTV and TV-6 may be more truthful than state TV about the war in Chechnya , and both upstaged their rivals in exposing government corruption . 
Each however , espoused a journalism in the service of a personal agenda , which is little different than the subservient journalism practiced under state ownership . 
The &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; that President Puting speaks about so often now appears to be more about arbitrary political preferences than establishing a society that plays by the rules . 
Indeed , so far , all that the &quot; dictatorship of law &quot; amounts to is the triumph of might over right . 
The weak retain no recourse . 
TV-6 was exhausted , by legal assaults , into submission . 
But Putin &apos;s victory over Berezovsky is as empty as it is meaningless . 
The threat of force , not neutral enforcement of the law , remains the trump card . 
Here TV-6 and its managers miscalculated grievously . 
They thought that , in the end , Russia &apos;s legal code would protect them . 
Instead , serving the center of power , it crushed them . 
Russia &apos;s public is outraged , not because the loss of TV-6 appears as a triumph of politics as usual , but because it leaves one less broadcaster to entertain . 
Very few Russians I spoke to about TV-6 mentioned the issue of freedom of speech ; they spoke , rather , about who is now stealing from whom . 
Putin is not seen as the bad guy , he is seen as a Russian ruler disciplining a dubious business-political interest . 
Nothing more , nothing less . 
Despite all that has happened , I continue to hope that Russia is not slouching back into its Soviet past . 
The mistakes that have been made tell us that Russia &apos;s ruling elite has yet to take the meaning of democratization seriously . 
Disagreement with the government , it must begin to see , is not sedition . 
Disagreement with government policy can often help rulers fine-tune or correct misdirected policies . 
On the other hand , would-be media magnets have yet to learn that the electronic media is not a personalized soapbox . 
Both sides have yet to realize that TV is more than a cash cow for advertising revenue . 
All the same , those in the West should not see the struggle over TV-6 as a defining moment . 
Putin and Russia are not evil . 
Reform continues , but it is occurring in ways much more painful than we hoped .
