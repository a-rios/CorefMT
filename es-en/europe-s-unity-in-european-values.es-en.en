Europe \ u0027s Unity in European Values 
Alongside the debate about the European Union constitution , a debate about European values has also developed . 
This debate is important not only for implanting meaning in the constitution , but will also determine the vitality and energy of the EU itself . 
The EU , being the product of several great religious and philosophical traditions , is a community of values . 
The ideas of the Greeks and Romans , Christianity , Judaism , humanism , and the Enlightenment have made us who we are . 
Dialogue with Islamic and Arabic cultures also helped form our identity . 
The pattern of our values has been woven over hundreds of years . 
Europe is the continent of Michelangelo and Montesquieu , but also of the guillotine and the gas chamber . 
Indeed , the bitter experience WWII taught Europeans how fundamental is the importance of shared values . 
In an impoverished , war-ravaged Europe , people yearned for peace , freedom , stability , and a new chance to prosper . 
The architects of European integration - Monnet , Schuman , Adenauer , De Gasperi , and others - understood that these ideals could be achieved only by combining and interweaving the practical interests of Europe &apos;s countries . 
They built their fragile house of peace on a foundation of coal and steel . 
The founders passed the torch on to the generation of Jacques Delors , Helmut Kohl , François Mitterrand , Václav Havel , Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , and others . 
They broadened and deepened European cooperation . 
Their leadership made it possible for Europe to make great strides towards its post-war ideals - peace , stability , and prosperity . 
We now stand at the threshold of a new phase of European cooperation . 
In late October , the EU &apos;s Constitutional Treaty will be signed . 
A new generation of politicians is ready to carry the torch onwards . 
But is the torch still burning bright ? 
In the early 1950s , Jean Monnet wrote : &quot; We are not forming a coalition of states . 
We are uniting people . &quot; 
Apparently not . 
As the Union races ahead , it seems that it has lost Europe &apos;s citizens along the way . 
Many are turning their backs on the whole project . 
They have trouble seeing what is common to Europe . 
They do not feel part of the great whole . 
Even in the new member states , enthusiasm for the European family of democracies is cooling . 
We have achieved a united Europe without uniting Europeans . 
Today &apos;s post-war generations , lacking direct memory of WWII , view Europe &apos;s great achievements - liberty , peace , and prosperity - as a given . 
The idea of Europe as a heritage and a mission does not mean much . 
But , without ideals , Europe &apos;s foundations will erode . 
The emphasis on pure self-interest increases this threat . 
My generation grew up with the image of Europe as an economic form of cooperation . 
Political motives behind European integration were overshadowed by the economic project . 
The result is an impression of Europe as a marketplace . 
A Europe of markets and money , not of man and morals , dominated the project . 
But without a moral foundation , there can be no free-market economy . 
Today , we are paying the price for not attending to Europe &apos;s shared values and common mission . 
Until Europeans know precisely what Europe stands for , what inspires and motivates us , the Union will not be able to take joint action in the world . 
The EU Constitution will make Europe more democratic and more transparent . 
It provides further guarantees that decisions will be taken by those closest to citizens , and it acknowledges the significance the values on which the Union rests : respect for human rights and dignity , liberty , democracy , equality , and the rule of law . 
These shared values are the glue that binds governments together in the recognition that clinging to pure self-interest is no longer reasonable when common concerns call for a common strategy . 
For what is the point of doing away with Europe &apos;s physical borders if borders between its citizens remain ? 
How can Europeans be happy that the Iron Curtain is gone if individuals and groups across the Union barricade themselves behind private iron curtains ? 
Indeed , fear , insecurity , and nationalism are again raising their heads . 
It is important for Europeans to reflect on that as they prepare for further rounds of enlargement and consider starting accession negotiations with Turkey . 
The preamble of the Constitution states that Europe is &quot; united in its diversity . &quot; 
This may be the most concise statement of what makes Europe Europe . 
But the words &quot; united in diversity &quot; raise the question of where this unity lies . 
The answer lies in the values on which the Union is based . 
They are contained in three concepts : freedom , solidarity , and mutual respect . 
These three together make it possible for Europe to open its doors to a great diversity of peoples and at the same time to speak as a community of peoples prepared to take responsibility for one another . 
Making such a community a reality will not come about by believing that Europe &apos;s culture is better than others . 
We will make it a reality through dialogue and deep reflection about Europe &apos;s common values . 
Values must be the road that leads to what cannot be reached by markets and institutions alone - the accession of Europe &apos;s citizens to the European Union . 
Only by embracing their shared values can Europeans prevent their Union from becoming a spiritless machine . 
Together , Europeans must find what connects them , and derive new enthusiasm , new spirit from what they find - a spirit sorely needed to tackle the great issues of today . 
No country can address these issues along . 
After more than fifty years , Europe as a community of values remains as necessary as ever .
