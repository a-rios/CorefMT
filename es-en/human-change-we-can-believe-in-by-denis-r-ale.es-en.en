Human Change We Can Believe In 
Montreal - A recent symposium on evolution in Montreal posed to high-school students and university professors the following question : &quot; Do you think that humans are still evolving ? &quot; 
Approximately 80 % of the audience answered &quot; no . &quot; 
Indeed , there is an almost universal belief that , with multifaceted cultures and intricate technology , humans have freed themselves from the pressures of natural selection . 
Recent findings , however , show otherwise . 
Far from providing immunity against evolutionary pressures , culture often creates new ones . 
For example , the genes associated with digestion of lactose are more prevalent in populations that have traditionally bred cattle and consumed milk . 
In scientific reviews in Nature Genetics and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America , the evolutionary biologist Stephen Stearns and his colleagues set out to demonstrate that natural selection operates on contemporary humans . 
Supported by extensive genealogies , including centuries of church and national health registries , their argument is convincing . 
Indeed , contrary to the widely held assumption that evolution takes millennia to manifest itself , recent evidence suggests that its effects can become visible as quickly as in a few generations . 
Rapid evolutionary change , or &quot; contemporary evolution , &quot; is not drastic ; humans are not likely to sprout wings a few generations down the road . 
Rather , these evolutionary effects are difficult to detect , as they are reflected in a population &apos;s genetic composition . 
Contemporary evolution requires a specific set of conditions . 
First , the population must comprise individuals with varying characteristics , or traits . 
Moreover , members of the population must differ in terms of survival rates , including , most important , lifetime reproductive success ( LRS ) - the total number of offspring that they produce over a lifetime . 
These conditions are fundamentally linked : different values for a particular trait translate into diverse survival rates . 
This crucial link facilitates change in a trait &apos;s average value over successive generations . 
For example , if larger individuals produce more children than smaller ones , the number of larger individuals would grow , thereby increasing the average size of individuals in the population . 
The most significant changes occur when individuals at one end of a trait &apos;s value are heavily favored , pushing the entire population in that direction . 
Prevalent human traits are often strongly associated with LRS . 
For example , people who first reproduce at a younger age tend to have more children , so selection generally favors those who become parents earlier . 
Tall women &apos;s LRS tends to be lower , while tall men &apos;s is higher . 
In a recent study , research psychologist Markus Jokela and his colleagues took this link further , connecting LRS to personality . 
According to Jokela , selection pressure favors people of both sexes who are extroverted , open to experience , and less anxious . 
Moreover , women who are agreeable and less meticulous do better reproductively , while these qualities do not affect men &apos;s LRS at all . 
Even certain cultural traits , such as income and wealth , can be connected to LRS : in men , the link is positive ; in women , it is negative . 
But translating selection pressure into evolutionary change requires another crucial ingredient : the variation observed in the trait should be caused at least in part by genetic differences . 
Indeed , evolution is possible only if the resemblance between related individuals has a genetic basis , and is not simply a reflection of a shared environment . 
For example , siblings do not have to grow up together for their resemblance to be evolutionarily meaningful , owing to their common genes . 
Even when it comes to morphology , personality , and life-history traits - such as age at sexual maturity and fertility - related individuals &quot; likeness often has a genetic basis . 
The conditions required for rapid evolutionary change to occur in human populations exist . 
But , given that measurable alterations in a trait over time can occur for many reasons - including those related to shared culture or environment - or randomly ( &quot; genetic drift &quot; ) , studies demonstrating this phenomenon are rare . 
Today &apos;s challenge is to isolate the diverse sources of change . 
Recently developed statistical tools have finally made this possible . 
With more sophisticated methods , my colleagues and I were reliably able to distinguish genetic changes , and thus to demonstrate an evolutionary shift toward a younger age at first birth in a small , insular population in Qu√©bec over the last 140 years . 
This discovery challenges another fundamental myth : evolutionary change necessarily benefits the species . 
In fact , evolution simply increases the average individual &apos;s reproductive success - with potentially damaging demographic consequences . 
So , while contemporary evolution is occurring , adaptation may not always lead to a better life .
