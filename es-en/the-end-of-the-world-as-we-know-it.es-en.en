The End of the World as We Know It 
CAMBRIDGE - Consider the following scenario . 
After a victory by the left-wing Syriza party , Greece &apos;s new government announces that it wants to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel sticks to her guns and says that Greece must abide by the existing conditions . 
Fearing that a financial collapse is imminent , Greek depositors rush for the exit . 
This time , the European Central Bank refuses to come to the rescue and Greek banks are starved of cash . 
The Greek government institutes capital controls and is ultimately forced to issue drachmas in order to supply domestic liquidity . 
With Greece out of the eurozone , all eyes turn to Spain . 
Germany and others are at first adamant that they will do whatever it takes to prevent a similar bank run there . 
The Spanish government announces additional fiscal cuts and structural reforms . 
Bolstered by funds from the European Stability Mechanism , Spain remains financially afloat for several months . 
But the Spanish economy continues to deteriorate and unemployment heads towards 30 % . 
Violent protests against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy &apos;s austerity measures lead him to call for a referendum . 
His government fails to get the necessary support from voters and resigns , throwing the country into full-blown political chaos . 
Merkel cuts off further support for Spain , saying that hard-working German taxpayers have already done enough . 
A Spanish bank run , financial crash , and euro exit follow in short order . 
In a hastily arranged mini-summit , Germany , Finland , Austria , and the Netherlands announce that they will not renounce the euro as their joint currency . 
This only increases financial pressure on France , Italy , and the other members . 
As the reality of the partial dissolution of the eurozone sinks in , the financial meltdown spreads from Europe to the United States and Asia . 
Our scenario continues in China , where the leadership faces a crisis of its own . 
The economy &apos;s slowdown has already exacerbated social conflict , and recent developments in Europe have added fuel to the fire . 
With European export orders canceled en masse , Chinese factories are faced with the prospect of massive layoffs . 
Demonstrations begin in major cities , calling for an end to corruption among party officials . 
China &apos;s government decides that it cannot risk further strife and announces a package of measures to boost economic growth and prevent layoffs , including direct financial support for exporters and intervention in the currency markets to weaken the renminbi . 
In the US , President Mitt Romney has just taken office , following a hard-fought campaign in which he derided Barack Obama for being too soft on China &apos;s economic policies . 
The combination of financial contagion from Europe , which has already led to a severe credit crunch , and a sudden flood of low-priced imports from China leaves the Romney administration in a bind . 
Against the advice of his economic advisers , he announces across-the-board import duties on Chinese exports . 
His Tea Party backers , who were critical in mobilizing electoral support for him , urge him to go further and withdraw from the World Trade Organization . 
Over the next few years , the world economy slumps into what future historians will call the Second Great Depression . 
Unemployment rises to record-high levels . 
Governments without fiscal resources are left with little option but to respond in ways that will only exacerbate problems for other countries : trade protection and competitive exchange-rate depreciation . 
As countries sink into economic autarky , repeated global economic summits yield few results beyond empty promises of cooperation . 
Few countries are spared the economic carnage . 
Those that do relatively well share three characteristics : low levels of public debt , limited dependence on exports or capital flows , and robust democratic institutions . 
So Brazil and India are relative havens , even though their growth prospects are severely diminished as well . 
As in the Great Depression , the political consequences are more serious and hold longer-term significance . 
The eurozone &apos;s collapse ( and , for all practical purposes , that of the EU itself ) forces a major realignment of European politics . 
France and Germany compete openly as alternative centers of influence vis-Ã -vis the smaller European states . 
Centrist parties pay the price for their support of the European integration project , and are repudiated in the polls by parties of the extreme right or extreme left . 
Nativist governments begin to kick out immigrants . 
For nearby countries , Europe no longer shines as a beacon of democracy . 
The Arab Middle East takes a decisive turn towards authoritarian Islamic states . 
In Asia , economic strife between the US and China spills over into military conflict , with increasingly frequent naval clashes in the South China Sea threatening to erupt into a full-scale war . 
Many years later , Merkel , who has withdrawn from politics and become a recluse , is asked whether she thinks that she should have done anything differently during the euro crisis . 
Unfortunately , her answer comes too late to change the course of history . 
A remote scenario ? 
Perhaps , but not remote enough .
