A Tribute to James Wolfensohn 
Over the past decade , the global economy has achieved unprecedented prosperity built on trade , international capital flows , and technological innovation . 
Amidst this undeniable progress , however , remain widespread poverty , disease , and illiteracy . 
In a world made smaller by modern telecommunications , satellite TV , and the Internet , the vast challenges of development that we continue to face confront us everyday . 
Perhaps no individual has done more to raise the alarm - earning deserved credit for many successes and understanding all too clearly the remaining shortcomings - than James Wolfensohn , the outgoing President of the World Bank . 
As Managing Director of the IMF , I have had the privilege of working closely with Jim Wolfensohn , seeing up close a man with an extraordinary mission : the sustainable reduction of global poverty . 
Wolfensohn left a successful business career to lead the global campaign against poverty . 
It is perhaps the ultimate tribute to his commitment and tenacity that his efforts over the past 10 years have attracted criticism as well as praise , for he has stood at the center of every major campaign aimed at alleviating the economic ills of our generation . 
Wolfensohn led the World Bank onto the cutting edge of every important development debate , and was at the forefront of the effort to combat HIV / AIDS , as well as other deadly diseases that threaten so many impoverished countries . 
He has been a forthright spokesman for women &apos;s rights and a champion of environmental concerns , as well as a formidable advocate in arguing for debt reduction for the most heavily indebted nations . 
He also has placed the World Bank at the center of the effort to help rebuild nations emerging from devastating civil conflict , from Bosnia to Sierra Leone to East Timor . 
As World Bank president , Wolfensohn argued consistently that the world cannot be divided into &quot; haves &quot; and &quot; have-nots . &quot; 
Poverty anywhere means poverty everywhere , and equitable growth is needed for the stability and security of all . 
Indeed , that is the true meaning of globalization . 
At the same time , Wolfensohn made a big contribution to development work by arguing that poverty must be treated as a multidimensional problem . 
It is now widely accepted that financial assistance alone will not bring about effective poverty reduction . 
Rather , sustainable , pro-poor growth is the key , requiring political stability - that is , peace and security for individuals - good governance , and ownership of policies by all stakeholders . 
Under Wolfensohn , the World Bank followed through on this comprehensive and coordinated approach in a concrete fashion , making significant inroads into global poverty . 
In the last 10 years , the Bank was the largest external financier of primary education , basic health care , HIV / AIDS programs , and programs aimed at protecting the environment and biodiversity . 
This agenda goes to the heart of improving human dignity and maintaining sustainable development . 
Wolfensohn &apos;s insistence that corruption be confronted as part of the development process was another valuable step forward . 
It used to be that even mentioning corruption in some official circles was considered taboo . 
But corruption poses the single largest obstacle to growth and development in many countries , especially as it diverts resources from the poor . 
The World Bank insisted that corruption be seen as a cancer , and that fighting it be made synonymous with fighting poverty . 
Indeed , outspokenness was a hallmark of Wolfensohn &apos;s tenure . 
Many a government minister , Bank officer and NGO representative has experienced his blunt criticism , as well as his effusive praise . The IMF has not been immune to this treatment . The work of our two institutions - in areas as diverse as poverty reduction strategies , debt relief , and the unheralded joint program to analyze financial sectors in our member countries - strengthened the global economy . Ultimately , development is about people . 
Jim Wolfensohn &apos;s greatest strength has been his genuine caring for the world &apos;s poor . 
His legacy will include a World Bank that is firmly committed to a world free of poverty . 
The poor around the world may feel poorer from losing him as their champion and advocate . 
In fact , their prospects are brighter because of his work over the past decade .
