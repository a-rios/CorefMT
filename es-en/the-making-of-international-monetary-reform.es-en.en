The Making of International Monetary Reform 
BRUSSELS - If French President Nicolas Sarkozy had written the prologue to his presidency of the G-20 , which has just commenced , he could not have done better . 
The run-up to the G-20 &quot; s summit in Seoul was marred by a series of currency controversies , bringing international monetary reform to the fore . 
Whereas French intentions to reform the international monetary system had initially been received skeptically , suddenly reform looks like the right priority at the right time . 
The task is anything but simple . 
The subject is abstruse . 
No one outside academia has taken any interest in it for the last 20 years . 
Accordingly , there are hardly any comprehensive proposals on the table . 
The United States , for which international monetary reform is synonymous with diminution of the dollar &apos;s global role , is lukewarm . 
China , which launched the idea , is happy to see the discussion gaining momentum , but lacks precise ideas . 
As time is on its side , it sees no reason to hurry . 
Emerging countries hold a similar opinion : they want their current problems to be solved but are not ready to re-write the rules of the game . 
Japan is keen , but its views on regional monetary cooperation do not match China &apos;s . 
And Europe is distracted more than ever with its internal crises . 
Nevertheless , international monetary reform remains a legitimate aspiration . 
As Vladimir Lenin once reputedly put it , &quot; the surest way to destroy the capitalist system &#91; is &#93; to debauch its currency . &quot; 
This applies to the world economy today . 
When the rules of the global monetary game are unclear , inadequate , or obsolete , countries cannot abide by them , and some may attempt to exploit them to their own advantage . 
This undermines the fabric of international economic relations . 
The agenda for reform boils down to four key problems . 
The first is exchange-rate relationships . 
Developed countries &quot; currencies have been floating against each other for several decades , but this has been only partly true of emerging and developing countries . 
Many , especially in Asia and the Persian Gulf , are de facto linked to the dollar , others to the euro . 
But fixed exchange rates often lead to undervaluation ( as in China ) or overvaluation ( as in Argentina at the beginning of the 2000 &quot; s , and , in a different context , several eurozone countries now ) . 
And floating and fixed exchange-rate regimes coexist uneasily , because volatility tends to affect the floating currencies ( often the euro , and recently the Latin American currencies ) . 
So the system needs a reshuffle . 
The touchstone is currently the renminbi - not so much because of China &apos;s bilateral relationship with the US , but because other emerging and developing countries monitor the renminbi-dollar exchange rate in setting their own policy . 
China knows that the current situation is not sustainable , but it remains reluctant to move aggressively to let the renminbi strengthen . 
The second problem is imposing discipline on national policies in order to preempt the temptation to export domestic inflation or unemployment . 
Under the gold standard , discipline was automatic . 
With floating exchange rates , it is not . 
According to an unwritten rule that has emerged over the years , central banks can do as they see fit , as long as they keep inflation stable over the medium term . 
This rule normally ensures a modicum of coherence and avoids overreactions in exchange rates , but it is insufficient in deflationary times . 
The US Federal Reserve argues , with some justification , that its quantitative easing is compatible with price stability , while Europe and several emerging countries deem it beggar-thy-neighbor behavior . 
The problem is that the current context provides no yardstick for assessing when a national policy stops being cooperative . 
So we need what the jargon calls &quot; surveillance . &quot; 
This is the International Monetary Fund &apos;s role , but the IMF &apos;s mandate is just that - surveillance , not enforcement . 
It is also the G-20 &quot; s role , but neither the US nor the emerging countries are keen on collective constraints . 
The third problem concerns international liquidity . 
Financial flows are excessively volatile . 
Emerging countries are inundated with capital inflows one day , and faced with abrupt and equally destabilizing outflows the next . 
To prevent their currencies from appreciating too much in the first case and falling too far in the second , emerging countries have accumulated foreign-exchange reserves , two-thirds of which are denominated in dollars . 
These reserves now amount to 15 % of global GDP , compared to 6 % ten years ago . 
Ultimately , whether this is due to self-insurance or to exchange-rate targeting matters little : yesterday this unproductive growth in reserves was an indirect cause of the crisis ; today it is undermining demand . 
The goal should be to make self-insurance unnecessary by guaranteeing access to international credit lines in case of abrupt outflows of private capital . 
The IMF started to do this when it created credit facilities without the Fund &apos;s usual ( and humiliating ) conditionality . 
But suspicion of the IMF persists , and most countries , especially in Asia , still prefer costly self-insurance to a form of mutualization perceived as uncertain . 
The fourth problem is collective anchoring . 
Naturally , the major central banks are concerned with the inflation that they can control - homemade inflation . 
But this neglects global inflation driven by rising commodity prices , which has been increasingly evident . 
This was not an issue in the disinflationary environment of the last decade , but it is becoming more of one , which is probably what prompted World Bank President Robert Zoellick &apos;s proposal to restore a role for gold . 
The notion is absurd - John Maynard Keynes long ago spoke of gold as a &quot; barbarous relic &quot; - but the problem of anchoring global monetary policy and ensuring its alignment with developments in global supply is nonetheless real . 
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell once compared a monetary regime to a political constitution , because it establishes the rules of the game . 
The analogy is apt . 
Unfortunately , it also indicates how ambitious and challenging a task it is to reform the international monetary order .
