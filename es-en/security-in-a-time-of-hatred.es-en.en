Security in a Time of Hatred 
In the wake of the Palestinian suicide bombers and the mass murder and collective suicide that took place last September 11th the world is still trying to redefine what it means by security . 
We know about mass suicides of religious sects and about individual suicides in military operations . 
Never before , however , were the two combined on so devastating a scale . 
Never before have we witnessed a military operation whose participants accept their own death not as a mere possibility , but as an inevitable and , indeed , desired outcome . 
Suicidal mass murder results from organized hatred-the unconditional craving to harm an enemy not for what it has ( as with envy ) or for what it does ( as with anger ) , but for what it is . 
What a person or group has or does can be changed by redistribution or sanctions , but what it is can only be eliminated . 
As an expressive act of religious mania , organized hatred is rooted in a collective revelation of divine order and the duties arising from it , along with the promise of eternal reward for those who are unconditionally committed to fulfilling God &apos;s plan . 
Envy , anger , and sadness hurt . 
There have been countless attempts to pin the hatred of the September 11th attackers on something else : surely , America &apos;s global economic power and political hegemony at least nurtured the conditions in which such hatred could develop . 
Hasn &apos;t the US administration implied as much , speaking of its &quot; vision of a Palestinian state &quot; and sometimes criticizing Israeli policy with hitherto unseen severity ? 
But while shifts in US rhetoric may be &quot; collateral benefits &quot; of the current military campaign , the Israel-related explanation of organized hatred falls short . 
There were no Palestinians among the September 11th terrorists , and the Islamic world &apos;s solidarity with the Palestinian cause is in any case largely rhetorical and tactical . 
Similarly , few in the Islamic world seriously regard Iraq &apos;s defeat in the Gulf War as a humiliation inflicted by the US on all Muslims . 
Islamist terrorism differs fundamentally from Third World revolutionary and national liberation movements , with their comparatively rational anti-imperialist stance . 
What America and the West do or did in the past is irrelevant ; to radical Islamics , what matters are the West &apos;s heretical liberalism , individualism , and secularism . 
So what is to be done to re-establish security ? 
President Bush once told America &apos;s Congress that &quot; Al Qaeda is to terror what the Mafia is to crime . &quot; 
It may be comforting to believe that beheading the hierarchy of some conspiratorial organization will prevent further attacks . 
But the analogy doesn &apos;t hold up sociologically . 
In contrast to fear ( the Mafia &apos;s stock in trade ) , hatred cannot be generated and conditioned systematically . 
An unconditional will to destruction and self-sacrifice can neither be taught nor learned . 
Al Qaeda bundles together rather than produces the hatred of autonomous perpetrators . 
But it is impossible to behead networks , much less networks of unconditional haters . 
Nor can security now be based solely on deterrence , as Israel may be discovering . 
Unlike the Cold War , whose logic of mutually assured nuclear destruction assumed that everybody prefers survival to death , the &quot; war &quot; against terrorism is much less immune to escalation . 
Indeed , because Islamist terrorism relies on the logic of diffuse , unconditional hatred , the preventive effects of even the most precise military attack may be less than zero , and may , instead , merely provoke demonstrative acts of retaliation . 
On the other hand , the deep and morally justified indignation and shared anxiety ( felt well beyond America ) made it politically impossible to not respond militarily . 
The Bush Administration seems aware of the pitfalls , emphasizing at home and abroad how different the conduct of the ongoing anti-terrorism war will be , that it requires military , diplomatic , law enforcement , and humanitarian measures , and that victory will be hard to prove . 
But victory will be even harder to prove if this new type of international conflict continues to be used to justify goals that risk multiplying anti-Western grievances . 
China breezes into the WTO . 
President Bush seeks to win congressional approval for his &quot; fast-track &quot; authority to approve free-trade deals . 
Putin gets a pass on Chechnya . The US withdraws from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty . Efforts to open the southern border of the US and the eastern border of the EU are put on the back burner . 
On the contrary , they risk redefining a conflict between supporters of minimal standards of civilized human coexistence and a despicable gang of religious fanatics as a struggle against the arrogant , predatory , and corrupt agents of Western rationality . 
Ensuring victory against organized hatred requires a very different approach , one that attracts the support of those whose material and spiritual conditions leave them most susceptible to religious extremism . 
This clearly calls for far more than military mobilization and discretionary allocations for debt relief and humanitarian assistance . 
Fighting organized hatred means that we must pay more systematic attention to &quot; soft &quot; issues in international politics , such as human rights , mutual recognition and confidence-building among civilizations and religions , supranational guarantees of stability and peace , and strategies for economic development that are reliable and fair . 
In short , genuine security in the wake of a plague of suicidal terrorists demands that we , too , display a willingness for self-sacrifice in the interest of undercutting support for those who hate the community to be secured .
