Bush &apos;s Second Gulf Disaster 
President Bush has asked that Americans not &quot; play politics &quot; at this moment of terrible national disaster . 
But asking hard questions of our nation &apos;s leaders is exactly what democracy demands when the government &apos;s response to Hurricane Katrina is widely viewed as &quot; a national disgrace . &quot; 
Katrina came with at least two days &quot; warning , but authorities waited to issue an evacuation order . 
There was no transportation for people without cars or money , facilities to house and care for refugees were insufficient , there were no forces in place to deliver desperately needed supplies or to secure order , and there was nowhere near the number of boats , helicopters , and other craft necessary to rescue the stranded . 
Hampered by a National Guard with 40 % of its people in Iraq , the pace of getting military personnel to the hardest hit areas was inordinately slow . 
For four days , there was simply no clear center of command and control . 
As a result , countless people suffered and died . 
Much of this failure is the result of the Bush administration &apos;s policies , which effectively eroded the capacities of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , the government agency primarily responsible for dealing with disasters . 
Obsessed with the war on terror as well as an ideology of privatizing the functions of government , the administration systematically sapped FEMA &apos;s long-term ability to prevent disaster or at least cushion the blows when prevention is not possible . 
FEMA was downsized and downgraded from a cabinet position , then placed under the Department of Homeland Security . 
Its mission of disaster planning and preparation was dropped entirely , and its focus was altered to fight terrorists . 
Its leadership had no experience in disaster management . 
The past director was one of Bush &apos;s Texas political cronies , and the current director &apos;s qualifications include a stint as commissioner for judges and stewards with the International Arabian Horse Association , where he was asked to resign for &quot; supervision failures . &quot; 
Since 2001 , billions of dollars were shifted from disaster relief to homeland security and the war in Iraq . 
Key disaster mitigation programs were slashed and federal funding for post-disaster relief was cut in half . 
The Army Corps of Engineers &quot; budget for levee construction in New Orleans was gutted , including funds specifically aimed at the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project . 
Preventive measures to protect people and property were not carried out despite FEMA &apos;s own conclusion in 2001 that a major hurricane hitting New Orleans was one of the three &quot; likeliest , most catastrophic disasters facing this country . &quot; 
Believing FEMA to be an &quot; oversized entitlement program &quot; and that the &quot; business of government is not to provide services , &quot; Bush &apos;s first FEMA director instituted new outsourcing requirements as part of a major privatization effort . 
This provoked a brain drain as experienced FEMA personnel moved into the private sector 
Privatization also left poorer states and poorer communities especially vulnerable . 
As money dried up and federal programs were contracted out to private firms at higher rates , only the richest and politically most important states and communities could compete successfully for the scarce federal grants necessary to pay for services . 
For example , Florida ( with 16 more electoral votes than Louisiana and where the president &apos;s brother governs ) received its requested funding to protect its wetlands . 
By contrast , a more needy Louisiana ( with its staggering 24 % poverty rate ) was denied its request for flood-mitigation funds in 2004 . 
With Louisiana &apos;s ability to protect itself weakened and the center of disaster relief badly undermined , an inadequate government response and unnecessary destruction were almost inevitable - with the poor paying the price . 
But the failure of this administration runs deeper than its chronic and intentional diversion of resources away from the types of policies that keep people safe from disaster . 
Despite scientific evidence demonstrating that the increased intensity and frequency of hurricanes is related to climate change , the Bush administration systematically rejects participation in international climate-protection regimes . 
Rather than continue a ban on wetlands development instituted by previous administrations , the Bush administration overturned it . 
Because development-provoked erosion has brought the Gulf of Mexico 20 miles closer to land than it was in 1965 , hurricanes are able to retain more strength , and their winds and waves pack more speed and destructive power . 
Similarly , loss of wetlands threatened New Orleans &quot; levees , which were built on the assumption that they would have 40 to 50 miles of protective swamp as buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico . 
Despite every major study showing that a massive coastal restoration program and higher levees were needed to protect New Orleans , the administration permitted federal agencies to stop protecting 20 million acres of wetlands , allowed developers to drain thousands of acres and in 2004 cut funding for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more than 80 % . 
New Orleans is America &apos;s canary in the mineshaft . 
Ideologies of privatization that incapacitate effective government , permitting the privileged to save themselves while leaving the poor clinging to roofs , must now be challenged . 
This disaster is a chilling reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens , and it is imperative that Americans demand accountability . 
Officials who did not do their jobs must be dismissed , and elected officials whose policies aggravated the devastation wrought by Katrina must be removed from office . 
We owe this to the dead and to the survivors .
