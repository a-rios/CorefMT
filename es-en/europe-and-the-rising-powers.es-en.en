Europe and the Rising Powers 
KYIV - The world &apos;s center of gravity is heading eastward so fast that we Europeans can almost feel the ground moving beneath our feet . 
Because almost all major actors on the international stage are redefining their roles in response to this tectonic shift , Europe must do the same . 
So it is right that the EU Council of Ministers is meeting to grapple with this challenge . 
For decades , however , Europeans have been more concerned with unification and constitutional arrangements than with traditional diplomacy . 
Europe &apos;s historic rivalries have , of course , been civilized into a political model that European diplomats often see as applicable across the international arena . 
To be sure , consensus , compromise , and a pooling of sovereignty are the only ways to resolve many of the great issues - climate change , nuclear proliferation - that bedevil our world . 
By contrast , the world &apos;s rising powers - Brazil , China , India , and Russia - insist not only on the primacy of their national interests , but , as the failed climate negotiations in Copenhagen last December demonstrated , on sovereign freedom of action as well . 
To them , geopolitics is not anathema ; it is the basis of all their external actions . 
Defending the national interest still rallies their publics ; the exercise of power remains at the heart of their diplomatic calculations . 
In the face of this new / old reality , Europe must not merely make itself heard on the great global issues of trade and fiscal imbalances , important as they are . 
Unfortunately , one of Europe &apos;s key strategic assets - the European countries , in particular Ukraine , that straddle the great energy corridors that will deliver more and more of the fossil-fuel resources of the Middle East and Central Asia to the world - is probably its most neglected . 
Indeed , ever since the Russia-Georgia war of 2008 , Europe has mostly averted its eyes from developments in the region . 
This neglect is both unwarranted and dangerous . 
The countries that lie between the European Union and Russia are not only a source of geopolitical competition between Europe and Russia , but now intersect with the national interests of the world &apos;s rising powers , particularly China . 
The Russia-Georgia war showed just how much this region matters to the wider world . 
In its wake , China began a systematic effort to buttress the former Soviet countries &quot; independence by offering them huge aid packages . 
Countries from Belarus to Kazakhstan have benefited from Chinese financial support . 
China cares about this region not only because it is concerned with maintaining the post-Cold War settlement across Eurasia , but also because it recognizes that it will provide the transit routes for much of the energy wealth of Iraq , Iran , and Central Asia . 
Indeed , China has been pouring billions of dollars into developing the oil and gas fields of Iraq and Iran . 
Given that security issues will likely prevent most of this energy from being transported eastward to meet China &apos;s domestic needs , Chinese energy concerns will need to become players in international energy markets - which means shipping Chinese-developed oil and gas in Iraq and Iran westward for sale . 
But two countries essential to this trade - Turkey and Ukraine - are increasingly estranged from the EU . 
For Turkey , tensions reflect the lack of progress on the country &apos;s application for EU membership . 
Ukraine is another matter . 
Until Viktor Yanukovych bludgeoned his way into Ukraine &apos;s presidency earlier this year , Ukraine was becoming emphatically European in its orientation . 
Now , Yanukovych seems determined - for the most shortsighted of motives - to weaken Ukraine fatally as an energy-transit country . 
Indeed , his latest gambit is an effort to sell Ukraine &apos;s transit pipelines to Russia &apos;s Gazprom in exchange for cut-rate gas . 
That idea is foolish economically and strategically . 
Ukraine &apos;s industries need to modernize , not become more addicted to cheap gas , and gas transit will become almost as monopolistic as gas supply - a dismal prospect , given past cut-offs of gas supplies between Russia and Europe . 
Moreover , Ukraine &apos;s politics is fracturing . 
A witch hunt is under way against opposition politicians . 
Crusading journalists disappear without a trace . 
The country &apos;s biggest media baron , who happens to be the head of state security , expands his media empire by abusing the courts . 
Yanukovych &apos;s systematic dismantling of Ukraine &apos;s democratic institutions is damaging the country &apos;s potential as a European strategic asset . 
Of course , it is up to Ukrainians to defend their democracy , but Europe is at fault as well , because the EU lacks a grand strategy toward the East . 
The moral and strategic vision of the 1990 &quot; s , which culminated in the EU &apos;s &quot; big bang &quot; of eastward expansion , has exhausted itself . 
Nowadays , Europe is full of whispers that &quot; neo-Finlandization &quot; might be a reasonable compromise for countries like Ukraine and Georgia . 
Rebuilding the EU &apos;s relations with Ukraine and the other countries to the Union &apos;s east would , however , also help shape relations with Russia , which today is facing a series of strategic challenges : relations with the USSR &apos;s former republics ; the proximity of a dynamic China ; the exposed emptiness of Siberia ; the future of Central Asia &apos;s energy resources , around which the nineteenth-century &quot; great game &quot; between Russia , China , India , and America is restarting . 
The EU can play a constructive role through permanent dialogue that is sensitive to Russia &apos;s concerns without acquiescing in all of Russia &apos;s answers to them . 
This requires better relations with all of the world &apos;s rising powers . 
If the EU is to craft a successful policy toward the world &apos;s rising powers , it must speak in a strategic language that they understand .
