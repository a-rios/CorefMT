Europe in Wonderland 
BERLIN - Europe and its national governments are basking in their new capacity to act - and not without reason . 
Who would have dared , even a few weeks ago , to predict that in the end it would be the divided Europeans , not the United States , who determined how to contain the global financial crisis ? 
Serious crises are defining moments in history . 
To be sure , the US is in an interregnum until the election of a new president . 
Moreover , George W. Bush seems to be far weaker than any normal &quot; lame duck &quot; president , creating a global power vacuum that has been filled vigorously by French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who is also the current president of the European Council . 
Sarkozy already took on this role in the Georgia crisis ; now he has reinforced it . 
By summoning the euro group , which so far includes 15 European Union members , the French presidency could rely on a politically functioning avant-garde group . 
Especially with regard to financial and currency issues , the EU has a strong institutional base - the euro as a common currency , the European Central Bank , and the binding budget and debt criteria of the Maastricht Treaty . 
Indeed , the current global financial crisis has demonstrated once more that the EU is strong where it has integrated its member states &quot; interests and weak where it has failed to do so . 
Of course , the crisis has not been overcome . 
We have gained time and can take a deep breath - no more and no less . 
When you are hanging over an abyss , as the global financial system has been in the past few weeks , then gaining solid ground , even if only temporarily , makes a big difference . 
However , beyond the mortgage market , other huge risks are lurking , especially in the US financial system : credit cards , car loans , and presumably a few other things . 
So there are good reasons to doubt that governments &quot; and central banks &quot; current actions will really redress the crisis . 
Parallel to this , the next tsunami is approaching , threatening to inundate the real economy . 
True , everybody is complaining about America &apos;s speculative bubble , and they are right to do so . 
But the whole world economy - from China to Germany - benefited for decades from Americans &quot; debt-driven over-consumption . 
Machinery to China and everywhere in the world ; 
Porsches , Mercedes , and BMWs to the US - that was Germany &apos;s winning formula in this period . 
Thus , a dramatic decline in the real economy , following the collapse of the financial house of cards , will have serious consequences for Germany and the EU . 
The breakdown of the US engine of growth cannot , at least in the short term , be replaced by Asia and stimulation of China &apos;s domestic economic activity . That means that the world economy is approaching a protracted deep recession . 
Even a global depression cannot be excluded in the face of this fundamental crisis . 
So far , thanks to the euro , the ECB , Gordon Brown , and Sarkozy , the EU has worked well in the world financial crisis . 
But the link between the global financial and economic crises will confront Europe with severe challenges - but also a big opportunity . 
Simply put , Europe &apos;s nation states are too small to address a crisis of this dimension on their own . 
Only the EU can protect the interests of all Europeans - including those outside the euro zone and even outside the EU . 
But , while Europeans have created strong institutions with the euro and the ECB , they still lack an adequate political superstructure to confront the coming economic crisis . 
For many years , France has called for a European economic government for the euro zone , which Germany has so far rejected , for good reasons : France &apos;s initiative was nothing but a hidden attack against EU members &quot; annual fiscal-deficit ceiling of 3 % of GDP and worse , against the ECB &apos;s independence . 
And the recent ill-conceived proposals of the French president on state ownership made things even worse in Berlin . 
But , given the global economic and financial crisis , the question now is whether Germany should abandon its resistance to a European economic government and , instead , lead the way toward creating it . 
After all , if the crisis in financial markets continues and combines with a dramatic slump in the real economy , the EU could quickly be at risk if it cannot respond politically . 
There is therefore an urgent need for macroeconomic and fiscal coordination at the EU level . 
This is all the more true because the European Commission is currently proving to be a near-total failure . 
An incompetent president of the Commission has had his term renewed for another five years as a reward for his innocuousness . 
Alas , this , too , is Europe . 
The German chancellor and her Minister of Finance must now quickly learn from their mistakes of recent weeks . 
To wait until events in Europe force them into line has turned out to be a bad strategy . 
It would be far better for the German government to take the bull by the horns by defining the principles of a European economic government in such a way that both countercyclical debt policy within the Maastricht framework and the ECB &apos;s independence are preserved . 
This means not dividing Europe , but forming an active and inclusive avant garde . 
The EU needs an economic government for the deep and long crisis ahead . Germany , Europe &apos;s biggest and most important economy , should lead the way decisively .
