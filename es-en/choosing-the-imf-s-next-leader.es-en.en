Choosing the IMF &apos;s Next Leader 
NEW YORK - Sooner than expected , the International Monetary Fund will have a new managing director . 
For more than a decade , I have criticized the Fund &apos;s governance , symbolized by the way its leader is chosen . 
By gentlemen &apos;s agreement among the majority shareholders - the G-8 - the managing director is to be a European , with Americans in the number two post and at the head of the World Bank . 
The Europeans typically picked their nominee behind the scenes , as did the Americans , after only cursory consultation with developing countries . 
The outcome , however , was often not good for the IMF , the World Bank , or the world . 
Most notorious was the appointment of Paul Wolfowitz , one of the main architects of the Iraq War , to lead the World Bank . 
His judgments there were no better than those that got the United States involved in that disastrous adventure . 
Having placed fighting corruption at the top of the Bank &apos;s agenda , he left in the middle of his term , accused of favoritism . 
Finally , as a new order seemed to emerge in the aftermath of the US-made Great Recession , the G-20 agreed ( or so it was thought ) that the next IMF head would be chosen in an open and transparent manner . 
The presumption was that the outcome of such a process almost surely would be a managing director from an emerging-market country . 
After all , the IMF &apos;s main responsibility is to fight crises , most of which have been in developing countries - more than a hundred since the disastrous policies of financial deregulation and liberalization began some 30 years ago . 
There were many heroes of these battles in the emerging markets . 
Crises need to be carefully managed . 
In 1997 , the mismanagement of the East Asia crisis by the IMF and the US Treasury transformed downturns into recessions , and recessions into depressions . 
The world cannot afford to repeat that performance . 
Today , the imminent crisis is in Europe , where the European Central Bank seems to be putting its own balance sheet and those of European banks - loaded with debt from Ireland , Greece , and Portugal - above the well-being of these countries &quot; citizens . 
This debt almost surely needs to be restructured , but , having allowed the banks to leverage themselves beyond any level of prudence and load up on toxic derivatives , the ECB is now warning against any sort of restructuring or write-down . 
But it is a bit late for the ECB to describe debt restructuring as &quot; unthinkable . &quot; 
The ECB should have done some thinking before it let this state of affairs arise . 
Indeed , more than thinking , it should have done some regulating to prevent Europe &apos;s banks from becoming so vulnerable . 
Now the ECB needs to think about how to help everyone , not just the bankers who bought the bonds . 
The new thinking should put people first , and banks &quot; shareholders and bondholders second . 
Even if the shareholders and bondholders lose everything , with the right restructuring , we can still save the banks and protect taxpayers and workers . 
Where the IMF &apos;s next managing director will come down on this issue - and on whether fiscal salvation is to be achieved through austerity , with costs borne by ordinary citizens , even as bankers get only a mild slap on the wrist - is critically important , but hard to predict . 
Despite the failure of the IMF &apos;s strategy in East Asia , Latin America , and elsewhere , it still has adherents , even within the emerging markets . 
The leadership contest has turned out differently from what many had expected . 
Some of the most qualified candidates ( in both developed and developing countries ) have not received the support of their own governments that the political process seems to require . 
Other qualified people from emerging markets have been reluctant to put their hats into the ring - it is a brutal job , with a travel schedule that requires physical stamina to match wisdom and experience . 
Much as I would like to see someone from the emerging markets and the developing world head the IMF , the first priority is to choose a leader with the requisite skills , commitments , and understandings in an open and transparent process , someone who will continue along the reform path on which the Fund has embarked . 
Realpolitik might mean that there will be senior people from both China and the US in the top management team , but the presumption that the number two position should be filled by an American also has to go . 
Whatever the outcome , the IMF , the World Bank , and the international community need to reaffirm their commitment to an open and transparent process - and ask how that process can be improved . 
For example , rather than nominations from governments , which often are reluctant to support excellent candidates from opposition parties , an international nominating committee could put forward names . 
Similarly , changes in voting procedures ( public voting by countries , rather than through constituencies , or a requirement that candidates win the support of a majority of developing and emerging countries ) could persuade more emerging-market officials to put their names forward . 
What we are seeing now - open campaigning , as opposed to selection behind closed doors - seems to be a move in the right direction . 
But one hopes that campaign promises won &apos;t tie the new leader &apos;s hands , as so often happens in electoral politics . 
Simplistic ideologies got the world into the mess in which it now finds itself , and simplistic prescriptions ( even of the &quot; tough-love austerity &quot; form ) will only compound the problems . 
One of the leading candidates to be the IMF &apos;s next managing director has turned out to be a Frenchwoman , Christine Lagarde , who , as France &apos;s finance minister , helped lead her country through the Great Recession . 
She has been an outspoken advocate of financial-sector reforms , and has won the respect of all of those with whom she has worked . 
Politics is not always kind to good candidates . 
The world should be thankful that there is at least one . 
Where she was born should not be an impediment to her prospects .
