A World of Convergence 
WASHINGTON , DC - For almost two centuries , starting around 1800 , the history of the global economy was broadly one of divergence in average incomes . 
In relative terms , rich countries got even richer . 
There was growth in the poorer countries , too , but it was slower than rich-country growth , and the discrepancy in prosperity between rich and poor countries increased . 
This &quot; divergence &quot; was very pronounced in colonial times . 
It slowed after the 1940 &quot; s , but it was only around 1990 that an entirely new trend could be observed - convergence between average incomes in the group of rich countries and the rest of the world . 
From 1990 to 2010 , average per capita income in the emerging and developing countries grew almost three times as fast as average income in Europe , North America , and Japan , compared to lower or , at most , equal growth rates for almost two centuries . 
This has been a revolutionary change , but will this 20-year-old trend continue ? 
Will convergence remain rapid , or will it be a passing phase in world economic history ? 
Long-term projections based on short-term trends have often been mistaken . 
In the late 1950 &quot; s , after the Soviet Union launched the first spacecraft , eminent Western economists predicted that Soviet income would overtake that of the United States in a few decades . 
After all , the Soviet Union was investing close to 40 % of its GDP , twice the ratio in the West . 
Later , in the 1980 &quot; s , Japan &apos;s spectacular growth led some to predict that it would overtake the US , not only in per capita terms , but even in terms of some measures of &quot; economic power . &quot; 
These kinds of projections have often been based on simple extrapolations of exponential trends . 
Over two or three decades , substantial differences in compound growth rates quickly generate huge changes in economic size or per capita income . 
Will the recent predictions of rapid ongoing global convergence similarly turn out to be wrong , or will most of the emerging countries sustain a large positive growth differential and get much closer to the advanced economies &quot; income levels ? 
Understanding the phenomenon of &quot; catch-up &quot; growth is key to answering this question . 
Trade and foreign direct investment have made it much easier for emerging countries to absorb and adapt best-practice technology invented in the advanced economies . 
The information revolution , allowing much easier access to and diffusion of knowledge , has accelerated the process . 
Once they developed the basic institutions needed for a market economy and learned how to avoid serious macroeconomic policy mistakes , emerging countries started benefiting from catch-up growth . 
Those with very high investment rates , mostly in East Asia , grew faster than those with lower investment rates ; but , overall , catch-up growth probably has been adding 2-4 percentage points to many emerging and developing countries &quot; annual growth rates . 
At the same time , population growth decreased , adding at least another point to the pace of per capita growth . 
This process will likely continue for another decade or two , depending on where in the process particular countries are . 
It is true that catch-up growth is easier in manufacturing than in other sectors , a point recently emphasized by Dani Rodrik of Harvard University , and it may be that a good portion of it has been exhausted in manufacturing by the best-performing firms in emerging countries . 
But there is still a lot of &quot; internal &quot; room for catch-up growth , as less efficient domestic firms become more competitive with more efficient ones . 
The dispersion of &quot; total factor productivity &quot; - the joint productivity of capital and labor - inside emerging countries has been found to be large . 
Moreover , sectors such as agriculture , energy , transport , and trade also have catch-up-growth potential , through imports of technology , institutional know-how , and organizational models . 
Of course , temporary disturbances , a worsening of global payments imbalances , or macroeconomic policy mistakes , including those made in advanced economies and affecting the entire world economy , could undermine global growth . 
But the underlying &quot; convergence differential , &quot; owing to catch-up growth , is likely to continue to reduce the income gap between the old advanced economies and emerging-market countries . 
The Soviet Union never was able to build the institutions to allow for catch-up economic growth . 
Japan slowed down after it had basically caught up . 
China , India , Brazil , Turkey , and others may have firms operating close to the world &apos;s technological frontier , but they still have a lot of unused catch-up potential . 
The more that these countries can invest while ensuring macroeconomic stability and balance-of-payments sustainability , the faster they can adopt better technology and production processes . 
In that case , they can continue to catch up , at least for the next decade or more . 
The convergence process is going to slow , but not yet .
