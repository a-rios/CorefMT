Four Fallacies of the Crisis 
NEW YORK - The current twin crises in finance and the real economy , what Americans call Wall Street and Main Street , and the interminable discussions about financial reform and the prospects for economic recovery , have spawned several fallacies that need to be addressed and dismissed . 
Fallacy 1 : The crisis would produce a &quot; free fall . &quot; 
A free fall means just that . 
But , surely , the world economy , or even the United States or the European Union - to which this dire prediction was applied ( by Joseph Stiglitz , for example , who wrote a book entitled Freefall ) - has not been plummeting like Newton &apos;s apple . 
Animated discussions as to whether either or both economies face an L-shaped or a V-shaped recession have given way to the reality of considerable volatility , for both income and financial indicators , around a mild upward trend . 
Fallacy 2 : Through monetary expansion , the US is manipulating the dollar &apos;s exchange rate in the same way that it accuses China of manipulating the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate . 
The two cases are dissimilar . 
If one grants the premise that there is an insufficiency of aggregate global demand , the alleged Chinese undervaluation of the renminbi can , indeed , be seen as a beggar-thy-neighbor policy , which diverts inadequate world demand to Chinese goods at the expense of other countries . 
On the other hand , the dollar &apos;s weakening is a side-effect of US monetary expansion , undertaken after countries like China and Germany refused to spend more to increase world demand , and after no room remained for further fiscal stimulus . 
This is altogether different from a policy of weakening the dollar to divert inadequate world demand to American goods . 
Fallacy 3 : Current global imbalances will continue to afflict us . 
Economists inevitably generalize from the current situation , so that today &apos;s Chinese and German current-account surpluses and America &apos;s deficit , for example , are seen as being here to stay . 
But history is littered with surplus countries that became deficit countries . 
One of my teachers when I was a student at Oxford , Donald MacDougall , a man who had once been Prime Minister Winston Churchill &apos;s adviser , wrote a book entitled The Long-Run Dollar Problem , which suggested that the dollar was what the International Monetary Fund called a &quot; scarce currency . &quot; 
By the time the book appeared , however , the problem had vanished . 
Initially , the Chinese surplus arose inadvertently , not by design . 
So did the US deficit , which resulted from the failure to finance the second Iraq war with new taxation - a decision rooted in the wild miscalculation that the war would be finished in six weeks . 
Today , the Chinese themselves realize that their surpluses fetch miniscule returns when invested in US Treasuries . 
As a result , Chinese imports will increase - and thus its surplus will fall - for two reasons . 
First , wages will be spent partly on imported goods . 
Second , infrastructure investment requires heavy equipment that is typically supplied by Caterpillar , GE , Siemens , and other , mostly Western , suppliers . 
Moreover , immense pressure in the US to undertake fiscal consolidation , reflected in President Barack Obama &apos;s latest budget proposal , should reduce US import demand , further reducing the bilateral imbalance . 
Fallacy 4 : Forget about Keynesian demand management . 
Some critics of Obama &apos;s Keynesian stimulus spending , among them the economist Jeffrey Sachs , claim that what the US needs is &quot; long-term &quot; productivity-enhancing spending . 
But this is a non sequitur . 
As a Keynesian , I believe that the state paying people to dig holes and then fill them up would increase aggregate demand and produce more income . 
But Keynes was no fool . 
He understood that the government could eventually get huge returns if the money was spent on productivity-enhancing investments rather than on &quot; directly wasteful &quot; expenditure-increasing activities . 
The question , then , is simple : which investments offer the greatest economic payoffs ? 
But it is also fraught : when your bridges are collapsing , your school buildings are in disrepair , teachers are underpaid and have no incentive to be efficient , and much else needs money , it is not easy to decide where scarce money should be spent . 
But one &quot; structural &quot; consideration is not well understood . 
Given the need to cut the deficit in the future and the need to increase it now in order to revive the economy , the problem facing Obama is how to shift smoothly from top gear into reverse . 
Clearly , the lesson is that governments need to attach less weight to spending that cannot one day be cut . 
This was brought home to me when I saw an unfinished high-rise building in Osaka . 
A relic of the bust that followed Japan &apos;s real-estate boom two decades ago , it became known as the Tower of Bubble .
