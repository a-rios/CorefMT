The Beginning of the End for Guant치namo 
The &quot; war on terror &quot; has forced democracies to grapple with the extent to which they can afford to protect the civil rights and liberties of both their citizens and foreigners . 
The debate has been most intense in the United States , where the refrain that the Constitution is not a &quot; suicide pact &quot; and that national security can justify extraordinary measures is heard repeatedly . 
Some measures - unauthorized searches of bank records and wiretapping of telephone calls - compromise the liberty of all . 
Others - most notoriously , the confinement of roughly 450 alleged Muslim fighters in Guant치namo Bay - impinge on people thought to be the enemy . 
Amid rising allegations of abuse , President George W. Bush &apos;s government realized some time ago that it could not maintain its Guant치namo detention camp forever . 
So the Bush administration proposed a middle way : a military commission under military judges , which would recognize fewer rights for the accused and bar appeals to civilian courts . 
In its recent decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the US Supreme Court said &quot; no &quot; : Bush &apos;s exercise of executive power went too far . 
As a result , the decision will have a lasting impact on America &apos;s constitutional structure . 
Salim Ahmad Hamdan served as Osama bin Laden &apos;s personal driver . 
Other than drive his boss around and attend meetings , he did nothing more to promote the terrorist attacks of September 2001 . 
Yet his driving and his knowledge of Al Qaeda &apos;s purposes struck the military as sufficient to charge him with entering a conspiracy to kill civilians and engage in terrorists acts . 
When his trial began , the prosecution tried to exclude Hamdan from the room during the testimony of a witness against him . 
The government wanted to protect its sources . 
The defense immediately sought an injunction in federal court to prevent the trial from continuing . 
The federal court ruled that under the Geneva Conventions , Hamdan , as a prisoner of war , was entitled to a court hearing that followed the same procedures as one judging soldiers of the detaining power , that is , an American court martial . 
The Supreme Court , however , sidestepped the question of whether Hamdan was a prisoner of war , arguing instead that the conflict was governed by common Article III in all the Geneva Conventions , which regulates armed conflict &quot; not of an international character . &quot; 
In such cases , there is a duty to guarantee that all sentences are passed &quot; by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples . &quot; 
Bush &apos;s military commissions were found to fall below this standard . 
While the discussion of the Geneva Conventions and procedural rights is important , the more profound portion of Justice John Paul Stevens &quot; majority opinion addresses the boundaries of the law of war , and specifically whether the conspiracy charge against Hamdan constitutes a violation of this body of customary international law . 
Everyone agrees that , under US law , the jurisdiction of military tribunals is limited to violations of the laws of war , so if conspiracy cannot be charged , Hamdan and others like him cannot be tried in any military courts , not just the ad hoc commissions . 
In order to resolve the question of whether conspiracy constitutes a crime under the laws of war , Justice Stevens followed the arguments made in the brief that I submitted on behalf of Experts on Conspiracy and the Law of War . 
The law of war , the Court reasoned , must reflect the consensus of all legal systems . 
This argument has been well known since the Nuremberg trials , which rejected charges of conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
Justice Stevens cited Telford Taylor , the chief prosecutor in Nuremberg , who made the same point about the oddity of conspiracy charges in international tribunals . 
Moreover , arguments about international law in the post-WWII period have quietly dropped all references to conspiracy charges . 
This admittedly has not been an explicit process , but the pattern is undeniable . 
As Justice Stevens wrote , &quot; The crime of &quot; conspiracy &quot; . . . does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions - the major treaties on the law of war . &quot; 
He could have added the Rome Statute and UN resolutions establishing the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda . 
The international community &apos;s rejection of conspiracy charges is correct , I believe , because international criminal proceedings are oriented to post hoc justice - to judging those who are alleged to have already brought about massacres and other major crimes that concern the international community . 
Conspiracy , by contrast , is suited to a legal system that emphasizes early police intervention , before criminal plans are carried out . 
Early intervention is possible in a domestic legal system , but there is no international police force that could fulfill a similar function . 
The Bush administration is now left in an embarrassing position . 
It does not want to prosecute the Guant치namo detainees in federal courts , but it is unlikely that it can prosecute them under the law of war as interpreted in the Hamdan decision . 
Although Hamdan recognizes the legitimacy of confining enemy combatants until the end of hostilities , doing so is untenable . 
The international community will not accept this form of massive preventive detention , with continuing allegations of abuse and torture . 
Sooner or later , Bush will have to decide between prosecutions in federal court or closing the camp .
