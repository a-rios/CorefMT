Colombia at Peace ? 
BOGOTÁ - The Framework Agreement for the End of the Armed Conflict in Colombia that has just been announced by President Juan Manuel Santos is a historic landmark for his country and all of Latin America . 
It is also a tribute to diplomatic resourcefulness and negotiating skill . 
The agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , better known as the FARC , came after long years of failed attempts by Colombian governments of all political shades to reach an accommodation with the last , and among the most odious , guerrilla movement to have operated in Latin America . 
Never before has the FARC - a monumental apparatus of terror , mass murder , and drug trafficking - agreed to discuss disarmament , its fighters &quot; social and political reintegration , victims &quot; rights , an end to drug production , and participation in &quot; truth and responsibility &quot; commissions to examine the crimes committed during a half-century of conflict . 
But now it has . 
By weakening the so-called Bolivarian Axis ( Venezuela , Ecuador , and Bolivia ) , the FARC guerrillas were left without a supportive regional environment . 
As with peace processes in the Middle East and Central America following the Cold War &apos;s end , regional changes created the conditions for the start of the Colombian process . 
Prior to engaging the FARC in secret talks in Cuba , Santos &apos;s regional diplomacy shifted the region &apos;s politics from saber rattling to the hard work of cooperation . 
He turned Venezuela and Ecuador , which had long been safe havens for the FARC , into friendly neighbors willing to bring an end to the archaic tradition of revolutionary wars . 
In fact , in what is perhaps the most remarkable diplomatic turnaround , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez has become a key facilitator in the resolution of the Colombian conflict . 
The talks with the FARC evolved as regional détente was followed by an ambitious initiative to address the root causes of the Colombian conflict . 
Most notably , Santos signed the Victims and Land Restitution Law in June 2011 , in the presence of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . 
The law provides reparation for the victims of human-rights violations in the course of a 60-year conflict , as well as restitution of millions of hectares stolen from peasants . 
The law thus puts Colombia on a path to peace by blunting the FARC &apos;s appeal to land reform to justify its untold atrocities . 
The law is undeniably complex , and by no means without shortcomings . 
It also represents a novel approach to peace , given that such laws are normally introduced only after a conflict has ended . 
In this case , returning land to dispossessed peasants and offering financial reparation to the victims and those who were displaced by the conflict became the way to peace . 
Indeed , it was none other than Alfonso Cano , a former FARC leader , who called the law &quot; essential to a future of reconciliation &quot; and a &quot; contribution to a real solution to the conflict . &quot; 
Skeptics and opponents of the negotiations do have a case , however . 
The FARC &apos;s record in previous peace talks reveals a penchant for manipulating negotiations to gain national and international legitimacy without actually being willing to strike a deal . 
Santos could , therefore , have been tempted to choose the Sri Lanka way - a ruthless military onslaught to defeat the insurgents , at the price of major human-rights violations and the destruction of civilian communities . 
Instead , Santos opted for the path of least expedience . 
After all , war , in Colombia and elsewhere , frequently unites nations , while peace divides them . 
The repercussions of a genuine end to the Colombian armed conflict would be felt far beyond the country &apos;s borders . 
If Chávez &apos;s Venezuela has become a narco-state in which the regime &apos;s acolytes are drug lords , this reflects their privileged relations with the FARC . 
Repercussions would also be felt in Mexico , where drug cartels are tearing apart the country , and the US , the world &apos;s largest source of demand . 
West Africa , too , would be affected , having become in recent years the main transit point for South American drugs headed to Europe . 
Formidable difficulties still lie ahead , and a final agreement is by no means certain .
