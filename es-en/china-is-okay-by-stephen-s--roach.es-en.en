China is Okay 
NEW HAVEN - Concern is growing that China &apos;s economy could be headed for a hard landing . 
The Chinese stock market has fallen 20 % over the past year , to levels last seen in 2009 . 
Continued softness in recent data - from purchasing managers &quot; sentiment and industrial output to retail sales and exports - has heightened the anxiety . 
Long the global economy &apos;s most powerful engine , China , many now fear , is running out of fuel . 
These worries are overblown . 
Yes , China &apos;s economy has slowed . 
But the slowdown has been contained , and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future . 
The case for a soft landing remains solid . 
The characteristics of a Chinese hard landing are well known from the Great Recession of 2008-2009 . 
China &apos;s annual GDP growth decelerated sharply from its 14.8 % peak in the second quarter of 2007 to 6.6 % in the first quarter of 2009 . 
Hit by a monstrous external demand shock that sent world trade tumbling by a record 10.5 % in 2009 , China &apos;s export-led growth quickly went from boom to bust . 
The rest of an unbalanced Chinese economy followed - especially the labor market , which shed more than 20 million jobs in Guangdong Province alone . 
This time , the descent has been far milder . 
From a peak of 11.9 % in the first quarter of 2010 , China &apos;s annual GDP growth slowed to 7.6 % in the second quarter of 2012 - only about half the outsize 8.2-percentage-point deceleration experienced during the Great Recession . 
Barring a disorderly breakup of the eurozone , which seems unlikely , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s baseline forecast of 4 % annual growth in world trade for 2012 seems reasonable . 
That would be subpar relative to the 6.4 % growth trend from 1994 to 2011 , but nowhere near the collapse recorded during 2008-2009 . 
With the Chinese economy far less threatened by export-led weakening than it was three and a half years ago , a hard landing is unlikely . 
To be sure , the economy faces other headwinds , especially from the policy-induced cooling of an overheated housing market . 
But construction of so-called social housing for lower-income families , reinforced by recent investment announcements in key metropolitan areas such as Tianjin , Chongqing , and Changsha , as well as in Guizhou and Guangdong Provinces , should more than offset the decline . 
Moreover , unlike the bank-funded initiatives of 3-4 years ago , which led to a worrisome overhang of local-government debt , the central government seems likely to play a much greater role in financing the current round of projects . 
Reports of ghost cities , bridges to nowhere , and empty new airports are fueling concern among Western analysts that an unbalanced Chinese economy cannot rebound as it did in the second half of 2009 . 
With fixed investment nearing the unprecedented threshold of 50 % of GDP , they fear that another investment-led fiscal stimulus will only hasten the inevitable China-collapse scenario . 
But the pessimists &quot; hype overlooks one of the most important drivers of China &apos;s modernization : the greatest urbanization story the world has ever seen . 
In 2011 , the urban share of the Chinese population surpassed 50 % for the first time , reaching 51.3 % , compared to less than 20 % in 1980 . 
Moreover , according to OECD projections , China &apos;s already burgeoning urban population should expand by more than 300 million by 2030 - an increment almost equal to the current population of the United States . 
With rural-to-urban migration averaging 15 to 20 million people per year , today &apos;s so-called ghost cities quickly become tomorrow &apos;s thriving metropolitan areas . 
Shanghai Pudong is the classic example of how an &quot; empty &quot; urban construction project in the late 1990 &quot; s quickly became a fully occupied urban center , with a population today of roughly 5.5 million . 
A McKinsey study estimates that by 2025 China will have more than 220 cities with populations in excess of one million , versus 125 in 2010 , and that 23 mega-cities will have a population of at least five million . 
China cannot afford to wait to build its new cities . 
Instead , investment and construction must be aligned with the future influx of urban dwellers . 
The &quot; ghost city &quot; critique misses this point entirely . 
All of this is part of China &apos;s grand plan . 
The producer model , which worked brilliantly for 30 years , cannot take China to the promised land of prosperity . 
The Chinese leadership has long known this , as Premier Wen Jiabao signaled with his famous 2007 &quot; Four &quot; Uns &quot; &quot; critique - warning of an &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and ultimately unsustainable &quot; economy . 
Two external shocks - first from the US , and now from Europe - have transformed the Four Uns into an action plan . 
Overly dependent on external demand from crisis-battered developed economies , China has adopted the pro-consumption 12th Five-Year Plan , which lays out a powerful rebalancing strategy that should drive development for decades . 
The investment and construction requirements of large-scale urbanization are a key pillar of this strategy . 
Urban per capita income is more than triple the average in rural areas . 
As long as urbanization is coupled with job creation - a strategy underscored by China &apos;s concomitant push into services-led development - labor income and consumer purchasing power will benefit . 
Contrary to the China doubters , urbanization is not phony growth . 
It is an essential ingredient of the &quot; next China , &quot; for it provides China with both cyclical and structural options . 
When faced with a shortfall of demand - whether owing to an external shock or to an internal adjustment , such as the housing-market correction - China can tweak its urbanization-led investment requirements accordingly . 
With a large reservoir of surplus savings and a budget deficit of less than 2 % of GDP , it has the wherewithal to fund such efforts . 
There is also ample scope for monetary easing ; unlike central banks in the West , the People &apos;s Bank of China has plenty of ammunition in reserve . 
A growth slowdown is hardly shocking for an export-led economy . 
But China is in much better shape than the rest of the world . 
A powerful rebalancing strategy offers the structural and cyclical support that will allow it to avoid a hard landing .
