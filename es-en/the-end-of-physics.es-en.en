The End of Physics ? 
When communism collapsed , people spoke of the &quot; End of History . &quot; 
Some now speak in a similar way of the &quot; End of Physics . &quot; 
They claim that all the fundamental issues are understood ; that all the great questions are answered . 
Others suggest that even if some fundamental issues remain outstanding they are essentially abstractions , irrelevant to human aspirations . 
So , are there any burning problems left for physicists to tackle or should physicists accept with grace the close of their science ? 
Questions about the end of physics are not new . 
In 1890 , buoyed by centuries of successful applications of Newtonian mechanics and the electromagnetism of Faraday and Maxwell , eminent voices proclaimed physics at an end . 
The decade to follow , however , overturned this exuberance . 
Radioactivity , x-rays and the discovery of the electron opened up a new world . 
Soon after , physics reached new heights as it developed the two revolutionary pillars of 20th century physics : Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity , another of Einstein &apos;s pivotal contributions to modern science . 
So , will man &apos;s hubris be capsized again ? 
To grasp where physics might go it is necessary to know how far it has come . 
Physics emerged in the 16th century as a quantitative , mathematically based set of laws through which humans could comprehend the inanimate world . 
Mysteries that confounded the ancients were replaced by an ever more concise set of principles so that the flight of projectiles , the fall of an apple , the orbit of the moon , and the trajectories of planets could be quantitatively accounted for . 
Definitions of space , time , matter and energy became , thanks to physics , precise . 
Complex phenomena : eclipses , comets , tides , the properties of matter ( e.g. solids , liquids and gases ) , the stability of structures ( e.g. bridges , towers , ships ) , the behavior of light , the processes involving heat flow , temperature , the colors of the rainbow and the more subtle colors emitted by heated substances , electrical charges and magnetism , gravitation and radioactivity were all organized into a small number of &quot; laws of physics . &quot; 
The twentieth century brought a profound understanding of the properties of the physical world , now considered as &quot; understood &quot; by physics . 
Stars , galaxies , the evolution of the universe as well as biological entities such as proteins , cells and genes all came under the purview of physics . 
With this record of advance behind it , what remains for physics to achieve ? 
Let me focus on a few areas where major advances may take place in the coming decades . 
In particle physics and cosmology we are now on the verge of solving problems that have confounded science since antiquity : what are the ultimate blocks of matter ? 
How does the universe work ? 
Our ambition is to find an answer so elegant and simple that it will fit easily on the front of a T-shirt . 
Today , however , we have only achieved a powerful , but flawed , summary , the so-called &quot; Standard Model , &quot; which reduces all reality to a dozen or so particles and four basic forces in nature . 
Why is the &quot; Standard Model &quot; flawed ? 
One obvious flaw is aesthetic - ie , it is too complex . 
The model does not explain why there are so many fundamental particles and why they differ so much . 
Another flaw in the standard model is that one of the fundamental forces in nature is not included : gravity . 
We are still searching for a simple , all-encompassing theory that reconciles all these forces . 
This effort is specially important for cosmology where peaceful coexistence between relativity , which is the theory of gravity , and quantum theory is needed to understand the universe &apos;s beginning . 
During the earliest moments after the creation of the universe in the Big Bang 12 billion years ago , the universe was extremely small and dense and the laws of physics governed perhaps only one kind of particle and one force . 
Unification of relativity and quantum theory is therefore necessary in order for us to understand the earliest moments of creation , when other particles and forces came into being . 
With that understanding , cosmologists will begin to grasp how this dense universe started to expand and why more than 90 % of its mass remains invisible to our instruments . 
Over time we will begin to reveal all the essential features of the cosmos to explain how a single event billions of years ago not only created galaxies , stars and planets but the atoms that assembled into living beings intricate enough to ponder their origins and purposes . 
Of course , some say that physics is unlikely to provide an ultimate explanation for evolution , the event that lies at the basis of biology and medicine . 
However , I think that application of the principles of physics to chemistry and especially to biology will also assume greater prominence . 
As biology becomes a quantitative , hard science , physics - in its techniques , computational power and basic laws - will influence biologists more and more . 
Indeed , the ultimate role of physics may be to unify all human knowledge . 
Edmund O. Wilson , the noted Harvard biologist , wrote in his book &quot; Consilience &quot; of the eventual unification of the hard sciences , the social sciences and the humanities . 
As revolutionary as this sounds , one can - even now - glimpse its possibility through the bridge of human consciousness , because the brain appears to work by the laws of physics and these , utilizing the probabilities of quantum science and the complexity of chaos theory , may be amenable to logical analysis . 
Will this knowledge hijack emotion , love , music , poetry , art ? 
Or will this scientific union enrich the great glories of the human spirit ? 
Must we fear , with Keats , to &quot; unweave the rainbow ? &quot; 
Richard Feynman , the great theoretical physicist , has offered a simple yet powerful retort : &quot; Does our understanding of the mechanisms of stellar activity diminish in any way our appreciation of the beauty and splendor of the night sky ? &quot;
