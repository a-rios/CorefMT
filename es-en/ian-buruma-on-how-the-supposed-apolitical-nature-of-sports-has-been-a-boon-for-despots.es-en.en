The Idiocy of Olympic Values 
NEW YORK - It should surprise no one that the preparations for the Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia , turned out to be wildly expensive and riddled with corruption . 
But the scale of excess is nonetheless staggering . 
The cost of building ski slopes , ice rinks , roads , halls , and stadiums for winter sports in a subtropical Black Sea resort has been well over $ 50 billion . 
Critics say that half of this was either stolen or paid as kickbacks to President Vladimir Putin &apos;s cronies , who just happened to win the biggest contracts . 
One critic , a Russian businessman named Valery Morozov , claims that officials in Putin &apos;s own office demanded payoffs for contracts . 
After being told that he would &quot; be drowned in blood , &quot; Morozov fled the country . 
But what did anyone expect in a country where big business , organized crime , and politics so often coincide ? 
And , the grand scale aside , Russia is hardly the only country where Olympic sports , Formula One racing ( also to take place later this year in Sochi ) , or World Cup soccer is a boon for larceny and graft . 
Then there is the matter of a host country &apos;s unconscionable laws , which can make an international sporting contest appear unseemly . 
Nazi Germany &apos;s race laws were firmly in place when the 1936 Berlin Olympics were held , as were curbs on free speech in China in 2008 . 
Russia , for its part , has adopted a ban on &quot; homosexual propaganda &quot; - a Putin-sponsored law that is both ludicrous and so loose that it could be used to arrest anyone deemed to be inconvenient to the authorities . 
Putin , missing the point of his critics &quot; objections entirely , has reassured the world that gay athletes and visitors to the Winter Games will be absolutely safe , as long as they &quot; leave the children alone . &quot; 
The assumption here is that homosexuals are pedophiles at heart ; to be safe in Sochi , they need only to control themselves until they return home to their decadent countries . 
Russia , meanwhile , will uphold decent traditional values . 
As the mayor of Sochi , Anatoly Pakhomov , informed the BBC , &quot; we do not have &#91; homosexuals &#93; in our city . &quot; 
This kind of bigotry , designed to mobilize the most ignorant sections of Russian society behind the president by pandering to their prejudices , should elicit more protest than it has . 
More than 50 international Olympic athletes have already publicly voiced their opposition to the law . 
It would be good if more athletes spoke out , despite efforts by the Russian organizers to ban political statements . 
But the root of the problems in Sochi lies much deeper than the corrupt practices of Putin &apos;s friends or the hatefulness of his law on homosexual propaganda . 
Over and over , whether it is in Brazil or Qatar preparing for the soccer World Cup , or the Olympic Games held in oppressive and authoritarian societies , the same contradiction becomes apparent . 
Even as FIFA , the world football association , or the International Olympic Committee insist that they are above politics , their grand events are politically exploited by all kinds of regimes , some of them less than savory . 
As a result , sport becomes political . 
And the more FIFA and the IOC protest their political innocence , the better it is for regimes that use international sporting events for their own ends . 
That contradiction goes back to the beginning of the modern Olympic movement . 
Baron Pierre de Coubertin , shocked by France &apos;s defeat in a disastrous war with Prussia in 1871 , initially aimed to restore French males &quot; virility by encouraging organized games . 
Then he became more ambitious and expanded his vision to include other countries . 
In a world so often torn apart by military strife , Coubertin believed that peace and international brotherhood could be achieved by reviving the ancient Greek Olympic Games . 
He insisted from the beginning that his games would be above politics , because politics is divisive , whereas the purpose of the games would be to bring people together . 
Not everyone was pleased with this idea . 
Charles Maurras , leader of the deeply reactionary Action Française , saw Coubertin &apos;s Olympics as a liberal Anglo-Saxon plot to undermine racial vigor and native pride . 
But he soon changed his mind after attending the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 and saw that international sports created a fine opportunity for aggressive chauvinism , of which he much approved . 
Yet Coubertin persisted in his dream of apolitical brotherhood . 
Karl Marx once described being apolitical as a form of idiocy . 
In ancient Greece , idiōtēs were people who were concerned only with private affairs and spurned all political life . 
Coubertin made his idiocy public . 
And so it was that at the age of 73 , a year before his death , the ailing Coubertin still managed to record a speech , broadcast in the stadium at the 1936 Berlin Olympics , about the ideals of fairness and brotherhood . 
Meanwhile , Hitler and his henchman were exploiting the games to raise the prestige of the Nazi Reich . 
Then , too , athletes were discouraged from voicing their opinions . 
Protests against Nazi racism were stifled with stern Olympic lectures about the apolitical nature of sports . 
A few compromises were made . 
Signs barring Jews from public places were discreetly removed for the duration of the games . 
And some Jewish athletes were discreetly dropped from national teams . 
Nothing has changed since then . 
Today , the IOC still wraps itself in the lofty mantle of apolitical Olympic idiocy , while Putin uses the Winter Games to try to add luster to his increasingly autocratic , and failing , Russian state . 
No doubt , the Games will provide much excitement to viewers around the world . 
But let us spare a thought for the homosexuals and other vulnerable citizens who will have to live under Putin &apos;s venal and increasingly despotic rule once the party has moved on .
