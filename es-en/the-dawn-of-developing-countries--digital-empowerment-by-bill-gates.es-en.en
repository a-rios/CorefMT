The Optimist &apos;s Timeline 
SEATTLE - Usually , &quot; optimism &quot; and &quot; realism &quot; are used to describe two different outlooks on life . 
But I believe that a realistic appraisal of the human condition compels an optimistic worldview . 
I am particularly optimistic about the potential for technological innovation to improve the lives of the poorest people in the world . 
That is why I do the work that I do . 
Even so , there is one area of technology and global development where reality has tempered my optimism : the idea that cellphones would revolutionize life in developing countries . 
A decade ago , many people believed that the proliferation of mobile devices in Africa would mean a short leap to digital empowerment . 
It didn &apos;t . 
Digital empowerment is a long and ongoing process , and the mere existence of cellular technology does not immediately change how poor people meet their basic needs . 
But now , after years of investments , digital empowerment is underway , owing to a confluence of factors , including growing network coverage , more capable devices , and an expanding catalogue of applications . 
As more people obtain access to better and cheaper digital technology , an inflection point is eventually reached , at which the benefits of providing digitally services like banking and health care clearly outweigh the costs . 
Companies are then willing to make the investments required to build new systems , and customers are able to accept the transition costs of adopting new behaviors . 
Consider the example of M-Pesa , Kenya &apos;s mobile-banking service that allows people to send money via their cellphones . 
M-Pesa first needed to invest in many brick-and-mortar stores where subscribers could convert the cash they earn into digital money ( and back into cash ) . 
This real-world infrastructure will be necessary until economies become completely cashless , which will take decades . 
Without omnipresent cash points , M-Pesa would be no more convenient than traditional ways of moving money around . 
At the same time , it was impossible to persuade retail stores to sign on as cash points unless there were enough M-Pesa subscribers to make it profitable for them . 
This kind of bootstrapping is exactly what we had to do at Microsoft in the early years of the personal computer . 
No one wanted a machine unless there was software , and no one would create software unless there were machines . 
Microsoft convinced both hardware and software companies to bet on future volume by showing how our platform would change the rules . 
There have been many successful small-scale pilot programs using cellphones . 
But examples of large-scale , self-sustaining programs powered by digital technology , like M-Pesa , are harder to find , because the key pieces have not been put into place to enable the required work to advance beyond the limits of controlled experiments . 
Digitally-enabled health care , or mHealth , is one area that has been slow to emerge , because it is difficult to build a great platform and then convince everybody in a health system that it is worth using . 
If some health workers use cellphones to send information to a central database , but others do not see the value , the digital system is incomplete - and thus just as flawed as the current paper system . 
The most promising mHealth project that I have seen , called Motech , focuses on maternal and child health in Ghana . 
Community health workers with phones visit villages and submit digital forms with vital information about newly pregnant women . 
The system then sends health messages to the expectant mothers , such as weekly reminders about good pre-natal care . 
The system also sends data to the health ministry , giving policymakers an accurate and detailed picture of health conditions in the country . 
Those working on AIDS , tuberculosis , malaria , family planning , nutrition , and other global health issues can use the same platform , so that all parts of a country &apos;s health system are sharing information and responding appropriately in real-time . 
This is the dream , but it works only if frontline workers are inputting data , health ministries are acting on it , and patients are using the information that they receive on their phones . 
I realized that things were taking off when our partners on Motech started talking about burdensome network costs and simplifying the user interface . 
The application was really being used in the field , and the stickiest challenges were presenting themselves - which meant that the system had proved that it was valuable enough for people to put in the work to solve problems as they arose , instead of just reverting to the old system . 
This digital approach is now being extended to other regions , including Northern India . 
A decade ago , people said that this would happen quickly . 
It didn &apos;t , because the pieces just were not there . 
Now they are starting to come into place . 
It will take a decade to get certain applications into a lot of places , but the momentum will build and we will learn as we go . 
In the long run , the results will be just as transformative as we hoped , if not more so . 
Ultimately , when people are truly empowered , they will begin to use digital technology to innovate on their own behalf , building solutions that the established software-development community never considered .
