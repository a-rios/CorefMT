Daniel Ortega &apos;s New Kind of Coup 
MANAGUA - Amid accusations of fraud and expressions of serious doubt by international observers , Daniel Ortega &apos;s re-election as Nicaragua &apos;s president constitutes a new kind of &quot; incumbent &apos;s &quot; coup - one that establishes a dangerous precedent for Latin America . 
What to do about it poses a grave dilemma for the Organization of American States ( OAS ) . 
According to the European Union &apos;s electoral observers , there was a &quot; serious loss &quot; in the election &apos;s democratic quality , while Nicaragua &apos;s own election monitors , its chamber of commerce , and the Episcopal Conference of the Catholic Church called the voting &quot; not transparent &quot; and demanded the resignation of the entire Supreme Electoral Council . 
Unfortunately , the OAS - though bound by the Inter-American Democratic Charter - has failed to act , revealing that it is not prepared to address the gray areas of electoral fraud . 
Ortega &apos;s re-election to a third term , prohibited by Nicaragua &apos;s constitution , completes the last stage of a &quot; coup from above , &quot; in which a government that came to power as a democratically elected political minority in 2006 , uses its control of state institutions - the courts and electoral machinery , in particular - to undermine the rule of law . 
With his widely documented history of fraud in the 2008 municipal elections , Ortega is on his way to becoming Latin America &apos;s Robert Mugabe . 
In most of Latin America , electoral fraud has become a thing of the past . 
Ortega &apos;s victory , achieved by emulating the machinations of Mexico &apos;s long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) and of Alberto Fujimori &apos;s elected dictatorship in Peru in the 1990 &quot; s , strongly suggests that Latin American democracy remains fragile . 
The November 6 elections set a record for lack of transparency , so much so that the EU observers declared them to be &quot; not verifiable , &quot; while the OAS envoy , Dante Caputo , confirmed that his observers were arbitrarily expelled from 20 % of the electoral boards selected for monitoring . 
The opposition estimates that , at more than a third of the polling stations , Ortega &apos;s Sandinista party counted the votes alone because the opposition PLI alliance was not allowed to have supervisors present . 
The irony is that Ortega didn &apos;t need to steal the election in order to win , even by a considerable margin ; pre-election polls gave him a clear advantage . 
Why , then , did he not choose to organize transparent elections ? 
With his authoritarian mindset , Ortega instinctively rejects the norms of representative democracy . 
His behavior reflected his conviction that only party control of the electoral apparatus can guarantee an overwhelming parliamentary majority . 
The outcome of the election , which gave Ortega 62 % of the vote , provides him a comfortable majority in the National Assembly , allowing him to pursue constitutional reforms and modify the political system as he pleases . 
He now holds all governmental power in a regime that combines state , party , and family , and that is advancing toward co-optation of the army and the police . 
The only visible counterweights are civil society &apos;s democratic organizations and an independent press , whose freedoms have been drastically reduced , and a new political opposition that has yet to establish its credentials through a strategy of resistance . 
Ortega &apos;s model , &quot; Christianity , socialism , and solidarity , &quot; is very different from that of his peers in the Alianza Bolivariana ( ALBA ) , headed by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez . 
Beyond the revolutionary rhetoric and the personality cult surrounding Ortega and his wife , Rosario Murillo , he is politically authoritarian , economically pro-business , and socially populist . 
Thus , contrary to Chávez and his state interventionism , Ortega ensures the continuity of neoliberal economic policies backed by the International Monetary Fund . 
Indeed , he promotes an alliance with big money in the grand style of Anastasio Somoza , the dictator who was overthrown by Ortega &apos;s Sandinistas in 1979 . 
Somoza famously told business leaders : &quot; You make money , and I &apos;ll take care of politics . &quot; 
But the key factor explaining Ortega &apos;s strength is not cautious economic management , but rather the political impact of Venezuelan money , inflows of which have been privatized and are therefore not subject to normal mechanisms of public accountability . 
An estimated $ 500 million dollars is dispersed by Chávez to Nicaragua annually - the equivalent of 7 % of GDP . 
Nearly $ 2 billion was sent during Ortega &apos;s previous term . 
These funds are earmarked for private businesses and party campaigns , but also to finance welfare programs under a model of political patronage known as &quot; gifts from the Commandante . &quot; 
Ortega &apos;s re-election thus represents a political triumph for the ALBA , but it also demonstrates his regime &apos;s dependence on Chávez &apos;s re-election in 2012 . 
Ortega &apos;s third term as president may not immediately alarm neighboring governments in Central America , but how it plays out does raise uncertainty in the longer term . 
One possible scenario is that the regime consolidates itself and temporarily resolves its legitimacy crisis with economic aid from Chávez . 
Another , equally likely , is that popular pressure and protest against fraud , mounting corruption , and authoritarianism lead to radical change . 
In any case , the OAS should not remain on the sidelines . 
Remaining silent about Nicaragua sets a dangerous precedent for other Latin American countries . 
Article 20 of the Inter-American Charter allows any government to put Ortega &apos;s regime on the agenda for debate , on the grounds that it represents a threat to democracy . 
It is just a matter of finding one with the political will to do so .
