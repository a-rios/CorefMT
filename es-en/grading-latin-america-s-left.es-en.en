Grading Latin America &apos;s Left 
BOGOTA-In January 2006 , a few days after Evo Morales &quot; election as President of Bolivia , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez predicted that a new wave of left-wing governments would sweep across Latin America . 
Five years later , it is time to ask how well Latin America &apos;s left-wing administrations have done . 
Have they fulfilled their promises to bring about greater equality , reduce poverty , and strengthen democracy ? 
In short , are the countries that turned left better off than they were before ? 
Although income inequality has not varied substantially in Chávez &apos;s time , Venezuela is one of the six countries in Latin America , along with Chile , Uruguay , Mexico , Costa Rica , and Argentina , with the greatest availability and widest distribution of basic services such as education and housing . 
The Chávez government has also been successful in its efforts to reduce poverty , as the World Bank has acknowledged : since 2000 , the percentage of poor households has fallen from 40 % to 21 % , and the rate of extreme poverty has dropped from 20 % to 8 % . 
But the balance sheet with respect to strengthening democracy isn &apos;t nearly as favorable . 
Socioeconomic advances have come at the cost of an erosion of the separation of powers and media independence . 
The armed forces are becoming increasingly politicized , and major civil-society organizations have been forced to close . 
The recent congressional elections , which strengthened the opposition , could be a sign of general discontent with Venezuela &apos;s current institutional arrangements - and with the deterioration of its democracy . 
The socioeconomic indicators for Ortega &apos;s Nicaragua are much less flattering . 
Around 48 % of Nicaragua &apos;s population is mired in poverty , with 79.9 % living on less than two dollars a day . 
The country survives on remittances and international economic aid . 
Moreover , Nicaragua &apos;s record on democratic consolidation is also poor : the 2008 municipal elections were criticized by observers and the opposition as fraudulent , and the separation of powers has been seriously weakened by Ortega &apos;s desire to remain in power after his term expires in 2012 . 
Bolivia , too , has not improved socioeconomically with the left in power : it remains among the worst performers with respect to human development ( ranked 104th out of 174 countries , according to the United Nations Development Program ) . 
The poverty rate is 59-61 % , and almost 25 % of the population lives in extreme poverty . 
Indicators of equality have not improved substantially , either . 
A government that came to power promising to create national unity now seems disoriented in the face of the country &apos;s deepening regional , racial , and economic divisions . 
But , unlike Venezuela and Nicaragua , where corruption scandals are a pox on political life , Morales has tried to govern &quot; cleanly &quot; and , for the most part , has succeeded . 
It is difficult to generalize . 
Some analysts believe that oil has helped Chávez produce better socioeconomic results than Nicaragua and Bolivia have achieved . 
But several previous Venezuelan governments presided over similar bonanzas , and few - if any - invested the resources in public projects and social initiatives , as Chávez has . 
Whether this investment is sustainable in the long term , and how it might affect macroeconomic performance , should be analyzed technically rather than ideologically . 
In this sense , these three cases - and Venezuela in particular - are a clear reflection of the Cuban model , which , despite substantially reducing poverty and providing basic health and education services , seems less sustainable than it did in the past . 
The model &apos;s decadence is now so clear that Raúl Castro &apos;s government has begun heavy cuts in Cuba &apos;s enormous state bureaucracy and has allowed a limited number of private businesses . 
What Cuba is going through today will likely occur in Nicaragua , Venezuela , and Bolivia in the not-too-distant future . 
Of course , a similar evaluation should be made of Latin America &apos;s rightist governments . 
I suspect that the indicators in Colombia , Mexico , Peru , or Chile will not be any more hopeful , and that their governments &apos;promises , too , have not been kept . 
Social objectives and the deepening of democracy in these countries - with the probable exception of Chile - have been sacrificed for higher levels of security . 
Throughout Latin America , the poor and marginalized are growing in number . 
And yet it seems that at both ends of the ideological continuum , they remain far from being a priority of their governments .
