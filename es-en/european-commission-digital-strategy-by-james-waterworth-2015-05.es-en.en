Which Internet for Europe ? 
BRUSSELS - When the European Commission announces its new digital strategy on May 6 , it will face a decisive choice between two very different approaches to the Internet . 
Will it choose a forward-looking , market-driven path ? 
Or will it opt for a defensive , backward-looking , insular retreat ? 
First the good news : the high profile of the planned announcement shows that the continent &apos;s leaders recognize that the Internet can no longer be shunted to the sidelines of European policymaking . 
It is central to economic performance and to modernizing Europe &apos;s industrial base . 
Over the past five years , while Europe has grappled with its macroeconomic woes , the United States and Asia have raced ahead , reaping digital benefits . 
According to a recent study by Plum Consulting , information and communications technology ( ICT ) contributed nearly 1.6 % to annual productivity growth in the US during this period - double its contribution in Europe . 
Perhaps that should come as no surprise , given that nearly 5 % of US investment is spent on ICT , compared to 2 % in Europe . 
&quot; The difference is not because the Internet comprises a larger share of the economy in the US , but because the US has been better at using the Internet throughout the economy , &quot; write Plum consultants Brian Williamson and Sam Wood . 
&quot; Europe invests more than the US overall relative to GDP , but not in relation to the Internet and ICT . &quot; 
The question facing European policymakers is how to close this gap . 
The best way forward would be to embrace the Internet , even where it is disruptive . 
In practice , this means cutting red tape so that all businesses can sell their goods and services across a common market of 500 million people . 
European companies today must navigate 28 sets of rules . 
It is little wonder that only 15 % of consumers shop online across European borders . 
Europe &apos;s focus should be on removing barriers and updating regulation to encourage more , not less , use of the Internet . 
This will require having the courage to face down those who would retreat behind national borders and protect existing business models . 
To benefit fully from the Internet , the EU should avoid favoring local businesses over global competitors , and all investment should be welcome , whether it comes from Stockholm , Seoul , or San Francisco . 
A regulatory regime that gave unfair advantages to local businesses would hurt consumers , hamper innovation , and damage competitiveness . 
European policymakers should also guarantee non-discriminatory wholesale access to communications networks , and that consumers and businesses have a range of choices for telecommunications and online services . 
Similarly , the EU should engage internationally to ensure that the Internet remains a key part of the global trading system . 
For example , it should complete negotiations with the US on an improved &quot; Safe Harbor &quot; framework for data transfers , thereby encouraging companies on both sides of the Atlantic to rely on transfers of commercial data . 
Unfortunately , ominous signs are pointing in the wrong direction . 
Europe &apos;s two heavyweights , France and Germany , have been vocal in their determination to roll back digital progress . 
Recently , European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society GÃ¼nther Oettinger referred to the concept of net neutrality - in which all Internet traffic is treated equally , regardless of its nature or origins - as &quot; Taliban-like &quot; and called for a new levy on online services . 
German and French pressure has led to calls for beefed-up regulatory powers to rein in powerful , usually American platforms , such as Google and Facebook . 
The continent also seems poised to gut the important &quot; one-stop shop &quot; principle , which would have allowed companies to deal with the data protection authority in the country where they have their main European base . 
Meanwhile , protesters across Europe have called for a clampdown on Uber &apos;s ride-sharing service and restrictions on Airbnb &apos;s apartment-sharing service , and the French Senate is considering &quot; search neutrality &quot; obligations . 
All of these moves add up to an alarming and wrongheaded approach to the Internet . 
If Europe continues on this path , it risks missing out on the potential of the online economy . 
After all , it is European small businesses , not just American , that benefit from e-commerce platforms like eBay and Amazon and the advertising services of Google and Facebook . 
And European app developers , too , build businesses on mobile phone software . 
The Internet is not a game of winners or losers ; everyone can win . 
Nor does it pit Europe against other regions . 
After all , Europe has almost as many billion-euro Internet firms as the US . 
The wisest choice for Europe would be to ensure that many more successful Internet firms emerge , by creating the best possible conditions for digital innovators .
