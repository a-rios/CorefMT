The Coming St. Putinsburg Summit 
St. Petersburg is a great place in early summer , when the &quot; White Nights &quot; bathe the city &apos;s imperial palaces and avenues . 
Small wonder , then , that Russian President Vladimir Putin likes to show off his hometown . 
Three years ago , during the Tsarist capital &apos;s 300th anniversary , Putin hosted some 40 heads of state , ranging from George W. Bush and Gerhard Schroeder to Belarusian dictator Alexandar Lukashenka and Turkmenistan &apos;s Saparmyrat Nyazov , who styles himself &quot; Turkmenbashi , &quot; the father of Turkmen . 
Human rights activists questioned the wisdom of endorsing the leader of a growingly authoritarian Russia . 
Yet Putin managed simultaneously to celebrate his anti-Iraq war cooperation with Europe , have the US swallow this , and be recognized in front of his local minions as a world leader . 
This summer , St. Petersburg ( dubbed by local wits &quot; St. Putinsburg &quot; ) may see a repeat performance : Russia will preside over a G8 summit for the first time , despite increasing authoritarianism , the ongoing bloody war in Chechnya , and now support for Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Deflecting mounting criticism , Bush rejects appeals to boycott the summit . 
&quot; I need to be in a position where I can sit down with him &#91; Putin &#93; and be very frank about our concerns , &quot; Bush said in late March at Freedom House in Washington . 
Is Bush wrong ? 
The question of whether to meet with nasty but powerful people has dogged diplomacy since its inception , and both ends of the question have been argued endlessly - and inconclusively . 
So it is probably best to examine the merits of each case separately , looking to precedents and agendas for guidance . 
What is now known as the G8 was launched in 1975 as an informal group of the United States , Europe &apos;s Big Four - Britain , France , Germany , and Italy - and Japan , with Canada added as an afterthought . 
It expanded to include Russia in 1998 for political , not economic , reasons . 
Russia &apos;s unhappy status as a democratizing , but still potentially threatening , former superpower , played a role , as did its huge energy reserves , which is why China , incomparably more powerful economically but politically beyond the pale , was never invited to join . 
Indeed , though supposedly grouping the world &apos;s largest economies , the G8 now includes a country with an economy the size of Holland &apos;s , even if it is still excluded from deliberations of the other members &quot; finance ministers . 
In retrospect , Russian membership should probably be considered a mistake . 
Russia has stabilized under Putin , but its has become markedly less democratic . 
Its economy has boomed thanks to oil and gas exports , not to healthy market developments . 
The state still controls the economy as it sees fit , as the de-facto renationalization of Yukos amply demonstrates . 
On the other hand , the Kremlin has refrained from international adventurism , and rather consistently supported the US in its &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
As European economies grew more dependent on Russian oil and gas , and the US military in Central Asia on Russian acquiescence , reversing the decision to admit Russia to the G8 became politically unthinkable . 
The 2003 summit confirmed Russia &apos;s privileged position . 
A repeat performance this summer would make it all but unshakeable . 
Has &quot; being frank about our concerns , &quot; the justification for hobnobbing with the likes of Putin , proven effective ? 
Perhaps not . 
Nevertheless , although Russia has been backsliding since Putin took power in 2000 , his policies might have been worse had he been ostracized . 
In any case , a US boycott of the forthcoming summit would be a Russian triumph , as it would throw the West into disarray . 
But there need to be limits to the West &apos;s tolerance , particularly given the summit &apos;s agenda , which features energy security , fighting disease , promoting education , counter-terrorism , and non-proliferation . 
Is Russia a trustworthy partner in these areas ? 
Russia is , in fact , the main provider of energy insecurity in Europe . 
Its gas blackmail of Ukraine frightened the entire Continent , and its new Baltic pipeline to Germany has provoked howls of outrage from Poland and the Baltic states , which are angry at losing the economic and political dividends a land route gives them . 
They are also fearful that Russia will use the energy weapon against them in the future , once the new pipeline allows the Kremlin to do so without affecting Western Europe . 
This made little impression on their German EU partners - unsurprisingly , since Schroeder now chairs the consortium that will build the pipeline . 
As former French Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy put it in 1981 , when he refused to cancel a gas deal with the USSR over the imposition of martial law in Poland , &quot; Should the suffering of French people deprived of gas be added to the suffering of Polish people deprived of freedom ? &quot; 
Old habits die hard . 
Russia &apos;s record is equally bleak on other items on the summit &apos;s agenda . 
It heads the list on the spread of preventable diseases - not only HIV , but tuberculosis , with 32,000 deaths last year alone - and its education standards are in severe decline . 
On terrorism , Russia was the first country to host an official Hamas delegation after the Palestinian elections , and it continues to crush Chechen terror and resistance with methods that would bring it to an international court , were it not a Security Council member . 
On non-proliferation , just ask the ayatollahs in Teheran . 
Putin &apos;s Russia is not a place for democratic leaders to hold a summit , especially after the paltry results of the last one . 
Nor does the summit &apos;s agenda justify holding it there . 
While Putin &apos;s policies could have been much worse - it is legitimate to give him credit where it is due - Russia should not be allowed to take the West for granted . 
Nothing would be gained by breaking with Russia and engaging in confrontation with it , but there is no reason not to respond to Realpolitik with Realpolitik .
