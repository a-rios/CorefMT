How Fragile are Emerging Markets ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Emerging-market equities and exchange rates are again under severe downward pressure , but are the underlying economies really as fragile as global traders seem to fear ? 
The short answer , for a few , is probably &quot; yes , &quot; but for most , &quot; not just yet . &quot; 
For most countries , what we are seeing is a recalibration as investors incorporate the risk that China &apos;s GDP might rise more slowly , the US Federal Reserve might start tightening monetary conditions more quickly , and policy backsliding in many countries might undermine potential growth . 
At the same time , Europe &apos;s massive shift to a trade surplus ( a key factor underpinning the region &apos;s new-found stability ) and the Japanese yen &apos;s sharp depreciation are among myriad factors squeezing countries seeking to rein in current-account deficits . 
It seems like only yesterday that Goldman Sachs analysts were celebrating the growth miracle of the &quot; BRICS &quot; ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) and the International Monetary Fund , in its April 2013 World Economic Outlook , was forecasting a three-speed global recovery led by emerging markets . 
What happened ? 
The most popular culprit is the Fed , which has begun to taper its highly experimental policy of &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; or purchases of long-term assets aimed at supporting growth beyond what could be achieved with zero nominal interest rates . 
But the Fed &apos;s role is almost certainly overblown . 
Moreover , the Fed &apos;s modest tightening is being matched by a trend toward looser monetary policy in the eurozone and Japan ; so , overall , advanced-country monetary policy remains highly accommodative . 
Uncertainty over China &apos;s growth path is more fundamental . 
For more than a decade , China &apos;s stunning growth has fueled a remarkable price boom that has flattered policymakers in commodity-exporting emerging markets from Russia to Argentina . 
Remember how the Argentines were able to thumb their noses at the pro-market &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; in favor of an interventionist &quot; Buenos Aires consensus &quot; ? 
Now , not so much . 
China &apos;s near-term growth is an open question , as its new leadership attempts to curb the unsustainable credit-fueled boom . 
Until recently , global markets had not seemed to recognize that a growth recession was even a possibility . 
Certainly , if there ever is a pause in China &apos;s heady growth , today &apos;s emerging-market turmoil will seem like a mere hiccup compared to the earthquake that will ensue . 
There are other notable , if less consequential , fundamentals in the mix . 
The shale-gas revolution in the US is changing the global energy equation . 
Energy exporters such as Russia are feeling the downward pressure on export prices . At the same time , hyper-low-cost energy in the US is affecting Asian manufacturers &quot; competitiveness , at least for some products . 
And , as Mexico reforms its energy sector , the range of pressures on Asian manufacturing will expand ; 
Japan &apos;s Abenomics is also important for some countries , as the sharp depreciation in the value of the yen puts pressure on Korea in particular and on Japan &apos;s Asian competitors in general . 
In the long run , a Japanese resurgence would , of course , be beneficial to the region &apos;s economies . 
Stability in the eurozone has been perhaps the single most important positive factor underpinning market confidence in the last year . 
At the core of emerging-market problems , however , is policy and political backsliding . 
Here , there are significant differences among countries . 
In Brazil , the government &apos;s efforts to weaken the central bank &apos;s independence and meddle in energy and lending markets have harmed growth . 
Turkey is suffering acute challenges to its democratic institutions , as well as government pressure on the central bank . 
Russia &apos;s failure to develop strong independent institutions has made it difficult for an entrepreneurial class to emerge and help diversify the economy . 
In India , central-bank independence remains reasonably strong , with the Reserve Bank of India now mulling a move to an inflation-targeting regime . 
Nevertheless , some emerging markets are moving forward and stand to benefit from the turmoil if they are able to stay the course . 
Aside from Mexico , countries such as Chile , Colombia , and Peru are well positioned to gain from investments in institution-building . 
So , overall , how fragile are emerging markets ? 
Unlike in the 1990 &quot; s , when fixed exchange rates were widespread , most countries now have shock-absorbing flexible rates . 
Indeed , today &apos;s drama can be interpreted , in part , as a reflection of these shock absorbers at work . 
Emerging-market equities may have plummeted , but this , too , is a shock absorber . 
The real question is what will happen when the turmoil moves to debt markets . 
Many countries have built up substantial reserves , and are now issuing far more debt in domestic currency . 
Of course , the option of inflating away debt is hardly a panacea . 
Unfortunately , there is surely more drama to come over the next few years .
