Winning the Fight Against Killer Diseases 
MAPUTO - One of the greatest successes in development aid in the past decade has been the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria . 
The Global Fund has saved millions of lives and helped countries around the world beat back three epidemic diseases . 
Now it is appealing to the world &apos;s governments and the private sector for another three years of funding , with governments set to decide on further financing in early December in Washington , DC . 
Back in 2000 , the HIV / AIDS epidemic was devastating the world &apos;s poorest countries , especially in Africa . 
New antiretroviral medicines had been developed and were being used in rich countries , but were too expensive for the poorest . 
Millions of poor people were dying of AIDS , even though the new medicines could have kept them alive . 
Two other major killer diseases , malaria and TB , were also resurgent . 
Deaths from malaria were soaring , partly because poor countries &quot; health systems were dramatically underfunded , and partly because the malaria parasite had developed resistance to the usual medicines . 
Yet the potential to control malaria was actually improving , thanks to several newly emerging technologies : long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent the mosquitos from biting , better diagnostics to identify infections , and a new generation of highly effective medicines . 
TB was also running out of control , with a massive disease burden in both Asia and Africa . 
As with malaria , the TB bacteria had developed resistance to the traditional therapeutic drugs . 
A frightening new epidemic of multi-drug-resistant TB - or MDR-TB , which was much harder to treat than mainstream TB - had erupted . 
There were also cases of extreme MDR-TB , soon called XDR-TB , which resisted even the back-up medicines . 
Back in 2000 , the rich countries were not taking adequate steps to fight AIDS , TB , and malaria . 
Aid flows were tiny . 
At the time , I had recently been appointed by the Director-General of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to help bring finance ministers and health ministers together to see what could be done , both immediately and in the longer term . 
Our advisory group , known as the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health , recommended that rich countries scale up their health-care aid to poor countries , including efforts to fight AIDS , TB , and malaria . 
This aid would save lives , improve well-being , and help strengthen economic development . 
Former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland , the remarkable director-general of the WHO at the time , strongly supported this recommendation . 
At the international AIDS conference in Durban , South Africa , in July 2000 , I described why a new global fund was needed to fight AIDS . 
In early 2001 , former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan launched a powerful and persuasive appeal to establish the Global Fund . 
Leaders around the world responded to Annan &apos;s call ; within months , the Global Fund was born . 
I remember those days vividly . 
In international public-health circles , there was great excitement . 
Several economists with little knowledge of public health became outspoken opponents . 
They argued on the basis of free-market ideology rather than evidence , claiming that foreign aid always fails . 
Fortunately , world leaders listened to public-health specialists and not to the aid skeptics . 
US President George W. Bush &apos;s administration provided strong and important support for the Global Fund - and also created new US programs to fight AIDS and malaria . 
By the second half of the 2000 &quot; s , programs to fight the three main killer communicable diseases were scaling up around the world . 
Over the objection of the aid skeptics , the Global Fund provided financial support for massive free distribution of bed nets , diagnostics , and medicines to address malaria . 
Lo and behold , for the first time in a generation , deaths from malaria in Africa began to fall ( steeply in some places ) . 
Hundreds of thousands of lives , mainly African children , were now being saved every year . 
Children were spared not only death but also debilitating infections , enabling them to attend school and lead more productive lives in the future . 
The same thing happened with HIV / AIDS and TB . 
Back in 2000 , before the Global Fund was established , infected people in developing countries died of AIDS without any chance to receive life-saving antiretroviral medicines . 
By 2010 , more than six million people in developing countries were receiving antiretroviral treatment . 
Similarly , testing and treatment for TB rose sharply , including a strong increase in several heavily affected Asian countries . 
The aid skeptics were proved wrong . 
Aid for health has worked . 
The world has benefited enormously from the triumph of generosity , professionalism , common decency , and good sense . 
Yet the battle to mobilize adequate financing remains . 
The same skeptics repeat their tired opposition without reference to a decade of evidence . 
It is shocking how their free-market fundamentalism ( or simply ideological opposition to aid of any kind ) can blind them to life-and-death needs and the efficacy of practical approaches that are well known to health professionals . 
( They are also blind to professional methods in other areas , such as food production . ) 
The Global Fund is urgently appealing for a minimum of $ 5 billion per year for the next three years - a tiny sum relative to the world economy ( and equal to roughly $ 5 per person in the high-income countries ) . 
It could wisely use twice that amount . 
It seems likely that the US Government will agree to contribute one-third of the $ 5 billion if the rest of the world delivers the remainder . 
The United Kingdom recently made a strong pledge , and the world now awaits the announcements of Germany , Canada , Australia , Japan , and other long-standing and new donor countries in Europe , the Middle East , and Asia . 
Millions of people around the world will live , or die , depending on what these governments decide in December . 
May they , and we , choose life .
