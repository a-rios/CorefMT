The Vanishing Swedish Exception ? 
For the past two years , Western Europe &apos;s voters have been turning rightward . 
In Denmark , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Norway , and Portugal , concerns about immigration , chronic unemployment , high taxes , and deteriorating public services have fuelled this trend . 
But as Europe &apos;s most recent parliamentary election shows , Sweden &apos;s Social Democrats - in power for 61 of the past 70 years - remain relatively immune to serious challenges from the right . 
Opinion polls just a few months ago gave the Social Democrats 44 % popular support . 
Together with the former Communists and the Greens , the left held a comfortable 12-15 % lead over the four non-socialist parties . 
This margin shrank dramatically during the campaign , and the left retained power by the skin of its teeth , but the lead ultimately proved insurmountable . 
Why has Sweden held out against the right-wing tide sweeping so much of Western Europe ? 
The immediate reason for Social Democracy &apos;s enduring appeal is foreign policy . 
In early 2001 , Sweden held the EU presidency , giving Prime Minister GÃ¶ran Persson , the country &apos;s dominant politician , a bright spotlight in which to shine . 
The Social Democrats also benefited by supporting the US after the September 11 th terrorist attacks - a popular position that thus pre-empted the non-socialist opposition . 
Persson exudes competence and authority . 
He bolstered his image considerably after winning the 1994 election by tightening government finances and eliminating a huge fiscal deficit . 
But he has done nothing remarkable since winning again in 1998 . 
Sweden &apos;s economy rose and fell with the IT bubble , reflected in telecoms giant Ericsson &apos;s troubles today . 
Persson &apos;s main advantages entering this year &apos;s campaign were that he was unencumbered by new promises and was well equipped to run a presidential-style contest based on his personal appeal . 
But force of character cannot mask real problems and a changing political agenda . 
Although foreigners often idealize Sweden &apos;s welfare state , its economy has been losing ground steadily for 30 years . 
In 1970 , GDP per head was the fourth highest in the world ; now it is 17 th place in the OECD . 
Every year Sweden attains 1 % less growth on average than the rest of the West . 
The decline has been gradual , so it fails to alarm voters , but Swedes certainly notice it when they go abroad . 
One reason for this relative malaise is that Sweden remains the world leader in taxation , with public expenditures claiming nearly 60 % of GDP . 
Conservatives demand lower taxes , but this is unpopular : almost 65 % of Swedes live on public salaries or social transfers . 
Unlike other Europeans , Swedes are thus much keener to keep taxes high , which guarantees a large left-wing vote . 
Even so , Swedes fret about the deteriorating quality of services provided by the social welfare system . 
They complain about year-long waits for eye operations and hip surgery - a direct result of a Social Democratic reform of 1994 that abolished the right of patients to seek alternative care at public expense if they are not treated within three months by their regional council . 
The Social Democrats shrewdly reversed themselves on this point during this year &apos;s campaign , but health care entitlements have clearly gone too far . 
No less than 14 % of Swedish employees are currently registered as sick , double the number five years ago . 
The Social Democrats argue that this reflects a serious health problem , while non-socialists suggest that the system is defective . 
Many Swedes have come to believe that it is their right to register as sick regardless of their health . 
No other evidence suggests that public health is actually declining . 
Deteriorating public education poses another worry . 
Stockholm , ruled by conservatives and liberals , has extended its free-market experiments , such as privatization of subway trains , to education vouchers and free choice of alternative schools . 
The Social Democrats lost miserably in the capital . 
As in most recent European elections , immigration loomed large , but as usual , Sweden was out of step with other countries . 
The small Liberal party , which campaigned in favor of free labor immigration , tripled its support . 
The Liberals make the sensible argument that anybody with a job should get a work visa , but that knowledge of Swedish be a citizenship requirement and that unemployed immigrants be barred from receiving social benefits for five years . 
Roughly 70 % of Swedes support free immigration of laborers - far higher than elsewhere in Europe . 
They see that immigrants tend to be qualified East Europeans , many of them physicians , while the number of Swedes registered as sick or in early retirement has underpinned a severe labor shortage . 
But Prime Minister Persson , kowtowing to the trade unions , insists on blocking labor immigration altogether for the next decade . 
Although this stance cost the Social Democrats many votes , it was hardly enough to offset their main electoral advantage : the unseemly control over key public goods that the party has accumulated during its long incumbency . 
For example , the two dominant state-owned TV channels are under strict Social Democratic supervision , and the party also controls professorial appointments and academic research through politicization of funding agencies and university boards . 
After so many years of Social Democratic rule , a large political caste has also developed . 
The main qualification of two current ministers is that their parents were ministers . 
The party itself is awash in trade union money , which is exempt from taxation as a result of sheer cronyism . 
But Swedes have shown that still like the welfare state . 
While they worry about the quality of public services , they are not prepared to join Europe &apos;s rightist revival . 
So Sweden &apos;s Social Democrats don &apos;t have to concede much to remain remarkably strong - even if this weakens the integrity of Swedish democracy .
