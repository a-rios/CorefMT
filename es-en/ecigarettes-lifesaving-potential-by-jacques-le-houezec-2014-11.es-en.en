The Drag on E-Cigarettes 
RENNES - Michael Russell and Murray Jarvik , two pioneers of smoking-cessation research in the 1970s , would probably have welcomed the development of the electronic cigarette or &quot; personal nicotine vaporizer &quot; ( PNV ) . 
Beyond serving as a temporary aid for people attempting to quit smoking cigarettes , such new nicotine-delivery systems could act as long-term alternatives to tobacco - making it possible to eliminate tobacco consumption almost entirely . 
We have long known that people smoke for the nicotine , but die from the smoke . 
Indeed , the vast majority of cigarette-related diseases and deaths arise from the inhalation of tar particles and toxic gases , including carbon monoxide . 
Though nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) has helped many smokers quit , the cigarette habit remains pervasive in many countries . 
The use of nicotine in non-combustible forms like smokeless tobacco , or PNV , would enable millions of current smokers to reduce considerably the harm that their nicotine consumption is doing to their health . 
In Sweden , the widespread use of snus - a smokeless tobacco product with a lower concentration of carcinogenic nitrosamines - has contributed to a dramatic decline in the incidence of lung cancer , to the world &apos;s lowest levels . 
The benefits of phasing out tobacco consumption could not be more compelling . 
That is why PNVs should be actively promoted as an alternative to tobacco products , aided by endorsements from health authorities , tax advantages , and support from the anti-smoking movement . 
But , so far , none of this has occurred , largely because nicotine is viewed as a highly addictive and toxic substance , with even smokers hesitating to try NRT or PNV for this reason . 
In fact , nicotine has been the primary target of anti-tobacco campaigns for more than three decades . 
But nicotine is only partly responsible for tobacco dependence . 
Other substances from tobacco smoke - such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors , which have antidepressant effects -reinforce tobacco dependence , but are absent from vaporized nicotine . 
That may be why PNV user surveys suggest that nicotine is less addictive in its vaporized form . 
In reality , nicotine is a relatively safe drug at dosages that a smoker or &quot; vaper &quot; inhales , with similar effects to caffeine . 
Moreover , smokers and PNV users control very precisely , on a puff-by-puff basis , the dose of nicotine they consume , virtually eliminating the risk of overdose . 
In fact , a lethal dose of nicotine is a lot higher than the 30-60 milligrams that many scientific papers claim . 
After reviewing case reports of nicotine intoxications and suicide attempts , the pharmacologist Bernd Mayer found that the lethal dose of nicotine in humans must be somewhere between 500-1000 mg of absorbed - not just ingested - nicotine . 
Given that one of the first symptoms of intoxication is vomiting , and that 70 % of the remaining nicotine in the digestive tract is metabolized by the liver before it reaches other organs , absorbing that much nicotine is not easy . 
With minimal health risks compared to tobacco smoking , PNVs face only one real barrier to use : smokers &quot; willingness to switch . 
But , even on this front , the devices have had considerable success , with PNV use increasing exponentially in the last few years . 
Though , in an ideal world , people would simply be able to quit using nicotine altogether , experience suggests that many smokers cannot - or do not want to - give it up , and will continue to smoke if there is no safe and acceptable alternative . 
If smokers are willing to accept PNVs as a viable option , high-risk tobacco use could become a thing of the past . 
So far , converted smokers have taken the lead in promoting the shift to PNVs , sharing their experiences online , in Internet forums and on Facebook and Twitter . 
Meanwhile , health authorities and governments have adopted a fear-based approach , scrambling to regulate - or even ban - PNVs . 
The European Union &apos;s Tobacco Products Directive and the United Kingdom &apos;s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency plan to introduce strict regulations of PNV sales and use , based on drug legislation , even though the devices are neither tobacco nor medical products . 
Even the World Health Organization has released a report expressing serious concern about the marketing and use of electronic nicotine-delivery systems . 
Such opposition is not based on scientific evidence . 
Indeed , an increasing number of scientific publications show that PNV use is much safer than smoking tobacco . 
In January , a group of scientists ( including me ) sent a letter to the European Commission imploring it to implement evidence-based , proportionate regulation that allows users of PNVs to identify the product and dosage that suits them . 
&quot; If wisely regulated , electronic cigarettes have the potential to make cigarettes obsolete and save millions of lives worldwide , &quot; we wrote . 
Excessive regulation , by contrast , &quot; will contribute to maintaining the existing levels of smoking-related disease , death , and health-care costs . &quot; 
Russell once declared , &quot; It is nicotine that people cannot easily do without , not tobacco . &quot; 
He was right . 
And it is tobacco smoke , not nicotine , that kills . 
That makes PNVs the ideal solution . 
It is time for health authorities to get on board .
