Rebuilding Euro Governance 
COPENHAGEN - Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt problems have prompted a search for more effective approaches to economic governance in the European Union , particularly in the euro area . 
Having mounted exceptional efforts , first to provide financing for Greece &apos;s adjustment program , and then to create a safety net for other distressed countries , the European Council established a task force , chaired by President Herman van Rompuy and composed largely of EU finance ministers , to make proposals for reform . 
The van Rompuy Task Force will submit its final report in October , but we can anticipate its conclusions in the light of the current system &apos;s major shortcomings . 
At the euro &apos;s planning stage , most observers fell into two camps . 
Some believed that the absence of political union - reflected in the euro &apos;s lopsided design , which centralized monetary authority but left budgetary and other economic policies ( largely ) in national hands - would ensure the common currency &apos;s failure . 
Others believed that the euro itself would trigger political unification . 
Neither view has come close to reality so far - and it remains unclear whether the current proposals will settle the issue , in particular by clarifying what elements of political union are essential for the euro &apos;s survival . 
In retrospect , then , the euro appears to have been a hazardous experiment . 
There was no support for centralizing any significant elements of fiscal policy - nor is there today . 
Instead , the euro &apos;s founders believed that exposure to deeply integrated markets for goods and services and a tough competition regime would keep national price and cost trends broadly in line , and that common and simple fiscal rules would prevent individual countries &quot; budgetary behavior from deviating strongly . 
The fiscal rules , later elaborated into the Stability and Growth Pact , are in themselves elements of a political union . 
The original vision was that this set-up would help to assure a growth-friendly policy mix , with fiscal prudence keeping interest rates low on average . 
This approach was chosen not only because of political expediency ; &quot; indirect coordination &quot; was seen as economically superior to the more direct coordination implied by &quot; economic governance . &quot; 
This model of monetary union left only a small role for financial markets in disciplining national budget behavior . 
Indeed , the adoption of fiscal rules was seen as a necessary substitute for the harsh discipline that financial markets had previously exercised over EU countries . 
It was recognized that , once a country adopted the euro , financial-market discipline would be constrained to credit spreads on sovereign debt - which turned out to be even smaller than foreseen , as interest rates converged to a remarkable degree until 2007-8 . 
Governments and EU institutions were unwilling to draw the attention of financial markets to the weakness of the single currency &apos;s two underpinnings : the fiscal rules were ignored , and national price and cost trends diverged , partly explaining the emergence of growing country imbalances within the euro area . 
Increasingly , the small spreads between sovereign bonds relied on the implicit assumption that no euro area member would be allowed to get into major difficulties , despite the constraints imposed on intergovernmental rescue operations . 
Fiscal discipline came back with a vengeance last year , when the state of public finances in a number of countries had deteriorated massively , owing to the recession and financial-rescue packages . 
In line with past experience in emerging economies , excessive market tolerance was rapidly replaced by very pessimistic assessments of debtor prospects . 
Once contagion effects within the euro area became ominous , governments reacted by overseeing the Greek adjustment program and by creating the European Financial Stabilization Facility ( EFSF ) , a temporary safety net for other major debtor countries . 
Both initiatives were coordinated with the International Monetary Fund , ensuring strict conditionality on the external finance obtained . 
Having gained time , EU governments , the European Commission , and the European Central Bank have now turned their attention to improving future governance . 
Understandably , the initial efforts of the van Rompuy Task Force were directed at more effective crisis prevention : intensified budgetary surveillance and monitoring of movements in real exchange rates and external imbalances . 
A number of useful initiatives are under way in both areas . 
However , in normal times , the policy recommendations arising from intensified monitoring - as well as the ultimate imposition of sanctions - will have to continue to rely on the persuasive power of discretionary decisions taken by the EU &apos;s Economic and Financial Affairs Council ( ECOFIN ) . 
A country in trouble retains primary responsibility for correcting policy . 
Improved surveillance - and the scary experience of having confronted the potential costs of being deprived of access to international financial markets - offers hope that the decentralized model for the euro area &apos;s non-monetary policy components will work better than in the past . 
The future role of financial markets in disciplining budgetary policies under such a reformed regime depends to a major extent on the ability of the van Rompuy Task Force to define a crisis-management mechanism to replace the EFSF . 
Neither this new mechanism , nor potential ECB purchases of bonds issued by the weakest euro area sovereigns , should be allowed to undermine the critical role that financial markets can play in supplementing the closer mutual monitoring of policies . 
A future crisis-management mechanism - if , indeed , governments can agree on one at all - should retain some ambiguity as to how the insurance provided to member states will operate , focusing instead on procedures , in particular regarding creditors &quot; participation in sharing losses , and on the principle of IMF involvement in shaping loan conditionality . 
Leaving scope in this way for financial markets to impose discipline offers the best hope for maintaining individual countries &quot; primary responsibility for their non-monetary policies , which was central to the original vision for the euro .
