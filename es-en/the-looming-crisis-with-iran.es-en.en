The Looming Crisis with Iran 
NEW YORK - When Barack Obama takes office in January , he will be greeted by many difficult challenges , beginning with the acute economic crisis . 
But he will not have the luxury of focusing on this exclusively . 
He will also have to contend with an array of foreign policy challenges . 
Of these , Iran and its nuclear program may well constitute the Obama administration &apos;s first foreign policy crisis . 
The reason is simple . 
Iran is well down the path to being able to enrich uranium on a large enough scale to produce a nuclear weapon . 
The International Atomic Energy Agency just reported that Iran may well reach this point in 2009 . 
An Iran with a nuclear weapon or the ability to produce one or more bombs in short order poses a true danger . 
Still , one path for the new American administration would be to adopt the &quot; North Korea &quot; option and live with the threat . 
The risk is that doing so would make an already unstable and conflict-prone Middle East even more so . 
In a crisis , Israel or Iran could be tempted to use nuclear weapons out of fear that the other would if they did not . 
There is also the chance that other countries such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia would develop or acquire nuclear weapons of their own.ampnbsp ; 
The United States could take steps to reduce these risks , including providing missile defense and security guarantees to selective countries , but it is far from clear that such efforts would succeed.ampnbsp ; 
Moreover , further nuclear proliferation is not the only danger if Iran proceeds with its nuclear efforts . 
What Iran does directly and through such groups as Hezbollah and Hamas has and will continue to have a major and mostly adverse impact on the future of Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon , and Palestine . 
Iran is already one of the Middle East &apos;s most powerful countries . 
A nuclear Iran would likely act more aggressively throughout the region in the belief that its nuclear capability afforded it considerable protection . 
A second policy option would be for the US , Israel , or both to attack Iran &apos;s known nuclear installations . 
Such a preemptive attack would certainly destroy some or even most of Iran &apos;s existing nuclear facilities and materials . 
But some capability would likely survive , and the nuclear program could be rebuilt over several years in a manner that would make a second attack much more difficult . 
There would also be serious consequences long before then . 
It is highly unlikely that Iran would simply absorb a US or Israeli military strike . 
Instead , it could be expected to retaliate by attacking US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq , unleashing terrorist attacks throughout the region and the world , and interrupting the flow of tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz . 
The last thing the world economy needs is a $ 200 barrel of oil , but this could be the result . 
What is certain is that both options - living with a nuclear Iran or attacking it - involve serious risks and costs . 
The best outcome would be one in which Iran was persuaded to freeze or suspend its nuclear efforts or , better yet , give up an independent capability to enrich uranium . 
It is conceivable that Iran could be allowed a symbolic &quot; right &quot; to enrich , but any enrichment program would have to be extremely small so as not to pose a strategic threat . 
It would also need to be subject to highly intrusive inspections , so that the world could be confident that Iran was not secretly enriching uranium and developing nuclear weapons . 
What would it take to essentially eliminate Iran &apos;s uranium enrichment effort ? 
To begin with , it would entail putting together a diplomatic package that offered Iran access to nuclear energy but not physical control over nuclear materials . 
Economic sanctions that are hurting Iran &apos;s troubled economy could be eased . 
Security assurances could be provided to Iran and normal diplomatic relations between Iran and the US and others could be established . 
There is no guarantee that Iran would accept such an offer . 
But it might , especially now that the price of oil has fallen below $ 50 a barrel , a level that leaves Iran &apos;s inefficient economy in worse shape than ever . 
What would also help would be to make clear that Iran would face additional sanctions , including constraints on its ability to import refined petroleum , if it refused to accept a fair and reasonable compromise . 
Convincing Russia and China to support a package of requirements , incentives , and penalties would be important . 
In addition , the odds Iran would accept such an offer might increase if the details were made public . 
The Iranian people may well choose leaders in their June 2009 elections who can deliver a much higher standard of living over those who would run the country into the ground . 
But it is possible that Iran will reject any diplomatic compromise , even one put forward directly by the US . 
Obama and the world would then have to choose between tolerating an Iran with nuclear weapons ( or the ability to produce them quickly ) and using military force to prevent this outcome . 
It is the worst sort of choice , as neither option is attractive . 
For that reason , it is all the more important that diplomacy be recast and given one last chance .
