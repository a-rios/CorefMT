Mario Monti &apos;s Nordic Dream 
ROME - Mario Monti , Italy &apos;s prime minister , is a self-styled German among Italian economists . 
As the European Union &apos;s top competition official a decade ago , he was regarded as a very Anglo-Saxon regulator . 
Today , he is the most Nordic prime minister that Italy has ever had . 
At the outset of his premiership six months ago , Monti declared himself to be an admirer of all things Danish - the country &apos;s &quot; society , economy , and civility . &quot; 
The measures that he has introduced since coming to power - from pension reform to combating tax evasion - have displayed the rigor and transparency that one associates with northern European countries . 
Likewise , Monti has repeatedly said that he is inspired by Scandinavia &apos;s labor-market and social-protection arrangements . 
The Swedish home-furniture giant Ikea &apos;s recent announcement that it will open two new plants in northwest Italy suggests that Scandinavians are taking note of Monti &apos;s Nordic tastes . 
But Monti would readily agree that Italy is not a northern European society . 
Sounding the alarm on inequality , the Bank of Italy calculates that the combined wealth of the ten richest Italians equals that of three million of their poorest countrymen . 
Moreover , a wave of corruption allegations is shaking Italy to an extent not seen since the Mani Pulite ( &quot; Clean Hands &quot; ) inquiry that swept away the country &apos;s political establishment two decades ago . 
A dysfunctional justice system and a jungle of red tape are a perennial curse for investors . 
As the leading daily newspaper La Repubblica recently put it , &quot; Transplanting the Danish model to Italy does not seem easy at all . &quot; 
This applies particularly to reform of the country &apos;s calcified labor-market rules . 
The ongoing negotiations over reform confirm that Italy remains a prisoner of political polarization . 
Business leaders believe that the government &apos;s proposals for easing redundancy rules are not bold enough , while trade unions view the reforms as being underfunded . 
Given this dissonance , the financial markets are responding with renewed upward pressure on Italian borrowing costs . 
Admittedly , Italy does not possess the consensus culture that characterizes Europe &apos;s north . 
But a key northern European quality speaks to one of Monti &apos;s principal concerns : trust . 
The wild swings of Silvio Berlusconi &apos;s tenure only worsened Italy &apos;s longstanding reputation for unpredictability . 
Monti wants to change that by changing Italians &quot; &quot; mentality , &quot; as he puts it - a gargantuan task , but also a political opportunity that he has yet to fully seize . 
The relationship between Monti , a former university professor , and Italy &apos;s politicians and political culture is a complex affair . 
While the credibility of his government of technocrats rests on impartiality , all policy measures are inherently political to the extent that they reflect a vision about the organization of society . 
To be both neutral and right is a logical impossibility in politics . 
Rising tension over Monti &apos;s proposed reforms is a sign that his government has effectively become politicized . 
Fortunately , Monti has not shied away from the political game . 
A visceral attachment to the European project makes him the most pro-EU head of government in Europe today . 
In an ironic reversal of the continent &apos;s north-south divide , his views are influencing German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s position on the need to stimulate growth in Europe . 
Italian government officials speak openly about the need for &quot; political synchronization &quot; with Berlin . 
Monti now has the unique opportunity to take another page out of the Nordic playbook by turning his set of centrist policies into a collective narrative of political responsibility . 
To be sure , he is constantly treading a fine line between jittery markets , EU demands , and partisan maneuvering ahead of national elections in less than a year . 
But his opponents &quot; dismal approval ratings grant him the power of brinkmanship , and the growth and competitiveness agenda that Italy and Europe crave require him to command political center-stage for whatever time he has left in office . 
Keeping politics out of government as much as possible is a risky strategy . 
After all , Monti is not the only one who can play that game . 
Indeed , support for &quot; anti-political &quot; movements , such as comedian / activist Beppe Grillo &apos;s Movimento 5 Stelle ( Five-Star Movement ) , hover around 8 % in some polls . 
Grillo regularly calls the premier &quot; Rigor Montis , &quot; and has depicted him lying in a coffin . 
In a country where left-wing extremists gunned down the last labor-market reformers a decade ago , the joke carries ominous undertones . 
This kind of virulent populism thrives in Europe &apos;s political vacuum . 
The fact that Monti &apos;s government is unelected should not prevent him from filling that vacuum with a determined , reform-minded program . 
His ability to make the most of his brief , exceptional power will test the maturity of Italian democracy . 
Grillo titled a recent entry in his hugely popular blog &quot; Dreaming about Denmark . &quot; 
That vision , however remote , is much safer in Monti &apos;s hands .
