What Euro Crisis ? 
MUNICH - Despite huge rescue packages , interest-rate spreads in Europe refuse to budge . 
Markets have not yet found their equilibrium , and the governments on Europe &apos;s southwestern rim are nervously watching how events unfold . 
What is going on ? 
The rescue packages were put together on the weekend of May 8-9 in Brussels . 
In addition to the € 80 billion program already agreed for Greece , the European Union countries agreed on a € 500 billion credit line for other distressed countries . 
The International Monetary Fund added a further € 280 billion . 
The driving force behind all this was French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who colluded with the heads of Europe &apos;s southern countries . 
French banks , which were overly exposed to southern European government bonds , were key beneficiaries of the rescue packages . 
Since rescue measures beyond the pre-arranged Greek package had not been on the agenda for the Brussels meeting , German Chancellor Angela Merkel thought she could safely go to Moscow to commemorate the end of World War II - unlike Sarkozy , who declined Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin &apos;s invitation . 
Worse , the leader of the German delegation to the EU meeting fell ill and was taken to hospital upon arrival in Brussels . 
This left the German delegation headless . 
Proclaiming a systemic crisis of the euro , Sarkozy seized the opportunity and took Germany by surprise . 
He asked for huge sums of money and , as Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Zapatero reported , threatened to pull France out of the euro and break up the Franco-German axis unless Germany opened its purse . 
After just two days of negotiations , the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s no-bailout clause , which Germany once had made a condition for giving up the Deutsche Mark , was defunct . 
The &quot; Club Med , &quot; as Germans call the southern countries , had taken over Europe . 
Even the European Central Bank chipped in , buying government bonds of over-indebted countries , using a loophole in the Maastricht Treaty and overruling the Bank &apos;s German representatives . 
The European house creaked mightily . 
Germany &apos;s president stepped down soon after the decisions - some say because of them . 
Germany &apos;s political elite are in an uproar , and serious voices advocate splitting the eurozone into northern and southern tiers , with France relegated to the latter . 
I do not share this view . 
The euro has successfully protected Europe against exchange-rate risks , and it is a useful step towards further European integration . 
Moreover , the stability provided by the Franco-German axis is indispensable for Europe . 
Nevertheless , the tensions created by Sarkozy &apos;s recklessness threaten Europe &apos;s political stability , heightening market uncertainty relative to what a more prudent , coordinated rescue program would have implied . 
The programs that have been agreed will not suffice to reassure creditors , and Germany will most likely be unwilling to bow once again to Sarkozy in the coming negotiations to prolong the rescue measures - at least as they are constructed now - beyond the initially stipulated three years . 
The arguments used to justify the coup are dubious . 
In order to overcome the no-bailout clause , Sarkozy and other European leaders dramatized the decline of southern European governments &quot; bonds and the corresponding increase in interest-rate spreads . 
By formally proclaiming a systemic euro crisis - when in fact there was only nervous market reaction concerning a few European countries &quot; government bonds - they could invoke Article 122 of the Union Treaty , which was intended to help member countries in the event of natural disasters beyond their control . 
If anything , the proclamation of a systemic crisis poured fuel on the fire . 
Investors took Europe &apos;s leaders at their word , because politicians usually downplay rather than overstate a crisis . 
The average interest-rate spread relative to Germany of the countries protected by the new rescue package was 1.08 percentage points on May 7 , when the world was claimed to be going under . 
Then it seemed that the rescue packages were pushing the spreads to much lower values , but optimism faded as European leaders &quot; interpretation of the crisis sunk in with more and more market participants . 
In the week ending June 18 , the average spread had climbed to 1.1 points . 
Obviously , the market is now as nervous as it was before that May weekend . 
But that is a far cry from spelling doom for the euro . 
In 1995 , shortly before the euro was announced , the corresponding interest-rate spread was 2.6 percentage points , more than twice today &apos;s level . 
The euro was simply in no danger when European leaders decided to rescue it , and it is not in danger now . 
Markets are just moving towards a new equilibrium with higher interest-rate spreads , which reflect the higher default risk of some European countries - a bit like in pre-euro times , though much less extreme . 
There is nothing wrong with this . 
The market adjustment will end when appropriate spreads are found . 
Any political attempt to stop this process any sooner is bound to fail . 
There is no reason for panic , and every reason to stay calm and wait for the new equilibrium to emerge . 
Interest-rate spreads between safe and risky assets are natural to functioning credit markets . 
They signal potential risks and enforce debt discipline on borrowers . 
This is exactly what Europe needs . 
The Stability and Growth Pact , aimed at punishing countries that breach the 3 % -of-GDP deficit limit , was a joke : not a single wayward country was ever punished . 
Fortunately , capital markets finally stepped in to impose the necessary hard budget constraints on governments . 
This discipline will stem the gigantic capital imports by the countries at Europe &apos;s periphery and end the overheating ushered in by the interest-rate convergence that the euro brought about . 
These countries will go through a slump that will reduce their inflation ( perhaps bringing them close to deflation ) improve their competitiveness , and reduce their current-account deficits . 
Conversely , Germany , which has suffered from relative deflation and a long slump under the euro , will experience an inflationary boom that will reduce its competitiveness and current-account surplus . 
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde , who often complained about trade imbalances in Europe , should applaud these market reactions , which were unintentionally strengthened by her president .
