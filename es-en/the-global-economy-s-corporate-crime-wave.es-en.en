The Global Economy &apos;s Corporate Crime Wave 
NEW YORK - The world is drowning in corporate fraud , and the problems are probably greatest in rich countries - those with supposedly &quot; good governance . &quot; 
Poor-country governments probably accept more bribes and commit more offenses , but it is rich countries that host the global companies that carry out the largest offenses . 
Money talks , and it is corrupting politics and markets all over the world . 
Hardly a day passes without a new story of malfeasance . 
Every Wall Street firm has paid significant fines during the past decade for phony accounting , insider trading , securities fraud , Ponzi schemes , or outright embezzlement by CEOs . 
A massive insider-trading ring is currently on trial in New York , and has implicated some leading financial-industry figures . 
And it follows a series of fines paid by America &apos;s biggest investment banks to settle charges of various securities violations . 
There is , however , scant accountability . 
Two years after the biggest financial crisis in history , which was fueled by unscrupulous behavior by the biggest banks on Wall Street , not a single financial leader has faced jail . 
When companies are fined for malfeasance , their shareholders , not their CEOs and managers , pay the price . 
The fines are always a tiny fraction of the ill-gotten gains , implying to Wall Street that corrupt practices have a solid rate of return . 
Even today , the banking lobby runs roughshod over regulators and politicians . 
Corruption pays in American politics as well . 
The current governor of Florida , Rick Scott , was CEO of a major health-care company known as Columbia / HCA . 
The company was charged with defrauding the United States government by overbilling for reimbursement , and eventually pled guilty to 14 felonies , paying a fine of $ 1.7 billion . 
The FBI &apos;s investigation forced Scott out of his job . 
But , a decade after the company &apos;s guilty pleas , Scott is back , this time as a &quot; free-market &quot; Republican politician . 
When Barack Obama wanted somebody to help with the bailout of the US automobile industry , he turned to a Wall Street &quot; fixer , &quot; Steven Rattner , even though Obama knew that Rattner was under investigation for giving kickbacks to government officials . 
After Rattner finished his work at the White House , he settled the case with a fine of a few million dollars . 
But why stop at governors or presidential advisers ? 
Former Vice President Dick Cheney came to the White House after serving as CEO of Halliburton . 
During his tenure at Halliburton , the firm engaged in illegal bribery of Nigerian officials to enable the company to win access to that country &apos;s oil fields - access worth billions of dollars . 
When Nigeria &apos;s government charged Halliburton with bribery , the company settled the case out of court , paying a fine of $ 35 million . 
Of course , there were no consequences whatsoever for Cheney . 
The news barely made a ripple in the US media . 
Impunity is widespread - indeed , most corporate crimes go un-noticed . 
The few that are noticed typically end with a slap on the wrist , with the company - meaning its shareholders - picking up a modest fine . 
The real culprits at the top of these companies rarely need to worry . 
Even when firms pay mega-fines , their CEOs remain . 
The shareholders are so dispersed and powerless that they exercise little control over the management . 
The explosion of corruption - in the US , Europe , China , India , Africa , Brazil , and beyond - raises a host of challenging questions about its causes , and about how to control it now that it has reached epidemic proportions . 
Corporate corruption is out of control for two main reasons . 
First , big companies are now multinational , while governments remain national . 
Big companies are so financially powerful that governments are afraid to take them on . 
Second , companies are the major funders of political campaigns in places like the US , while politicians themselves are often part owners , or at least the silent beneficiaries of corporate profits . 
Roughly one-half of US Congressmen are millionaires , and many have close ties to companies even before they arrive in Congress . 
As a result , politicians often look the other way when corporate behavior crosses the line . 
Even if governments try to enforce the law , companies have armies of lawyers to run circles around them . 
The result is a culture of impunity , based on the well-proven expectation that corporate crime pays . 
Given the close connections of wealth and power with the law , reining in corporate crime will be an enormous struggle . 
Fortunately , the rapid and pervasive flow of information nowadays could act as a kind of deterrent or disinfectant . 
Corruption thrives in the dark , yet more information than ever comes to light via email and blogs , as well as Facebook , Twitter , and other social networks . 
We will also need a new kind of politician leading a new kind of political campaign , one based on free online media rather than paid media . 
When politicians can emancipate themselves from corporate donations , they will regain the ability to control corporate abuses . 
Moreover , we will need to light the dark corners of international finance , especially tax havens like the Cayman Islands and secretive Swiss banks . 
Tax evasion , kickbacks , illegal payments , bribes , and other illegal transactions flow through these accounts . 
The wealth , power , and illegality enabled by this hidden system are now so vast as to threaten the global economy &apos;s legitimacy , especially at a time of unprecedented income inequality and large budget deficits , owing to governments &quot; inability politically - and sometimes even operationally - to impose taxes on the wealthy . 
So the next time you hear about a corruption scandal in Africa or other poor region , ask where it started and who is doing the corrupting . 
Neither the US nor any other &quot; advanced &quot; country should be pointing the finger at poor countries , for it is often the most powerful global companies that have created the problem .
