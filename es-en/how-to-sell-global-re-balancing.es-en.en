How to Sell Global Re-Balancing 
CHICAGO - At its most recent meeting in Toronto this spring , the G-20 agreed to disagree . 
Even though the world economy is desperately in need of rebalancing , their declaration was deliberately vague enough to accommodate any set of domestic policies that countries might choose . 
Everyone came away thinking that they had won , but the world largely lost . 
World trade is highly imbalanced . 
Households in the United States , having spent too much , are now weighed down by debt . 
Exporters in Europe and Asia have become excessively dependent on selling to the US and other , now-weakened , economies like Spain and the United Kingdom . 
Myopic actions on both sides have helped entrench a longer-term pattern of behavior that only makes it harder to move away from today &apos;s unsustainable equilibrium . 
As ever , change upsets the cozy status quo and the interests that benefit from it . 
For example , the real-estate lobby in the US obviously has no desire to see government support for housing diminish , despite the fact that the US probably has far more housing stock than it can afford . 
Similarly , the export lobby in China has no interest in a strong renminbi , even though it is in China &apos;s long-term interest to let its currency appreciate . 
We keep hoping that somehow meetings of heads of state will magically produce the policies that will rebalance world trade . 
Unfortunately , the macroeconomic changes that countries must make involve actions to which even heads of state are unable to commit . 
No US president can unilaterally agree to alter the pattern of government support and spending ; that is a decision for Congress . 
Similarly , no Chinese president can unilaterally agree to allow the renminbi to appreciate faster ; that is a consensus decision reached together with the various apparatchiks in the State Council and Communist Party . 
Moreover , the necessary reforms in both America and China go well beyond these two steps . 
They require deep , fundamental changes . 
So we are caught between a financially unsustainable pattern of global demand and the need for politically difficult changes in many countries &quot; domestic policies . 
All politics is local , and there is no local constituency for the global economy , so what triumphs often erodes global imbalances further . 
The G-20 asked the International Monetary Fund to prepare a road map for the policies that countries will have to follow to restore stable global growth . 
But neither the G-20 nor the IMF can impose its will on national governments - nor should they . 
How , then , can we go beyond ritualistic meetings that do little to advance the global agenda ? 
Obviously , we need more political support for that agenda . 
Perhaps non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) like Oxfam or Mothers against Land Mines suggest a way . 
These movements use pressure from below to convince political leaders that there is domestic support for international agreement . 
The ability of grassroots movements to influence policy is set to increase . 
As the power of the Internet spreads through social and political networking sites , and as virtual democracy grows , this bottom-up influence is likely to grow . 
Those who want to influence political leaders must get used to convincing their masters , the people , directly . 
Unfortunately , it is difficult for existing NGOs to take up the cause of popularizing global economic policy coordination . 
Unlike hunger or land mines , the cause of rectifying global trade imbalances will not touch the public enough to attract the donations that are necessary to keep NGOs afloat . 
But there is an organization that could do the job : the IMF . 
If the IMF reoriented a substantial portion of its activities towards influencing the influential among the world &apos;s public , it could have far more impact on global macroeconomic policy , especially policies followed by countries that do not need its loans , than it does today . 
The IMF is currently under-equipped for this task . 
If it is to improve its persuasive capabilities , it must learn to become more like grassroots activists , with punchy prose , clear policy recommendations , and TV-ready talking points . 
It must go directly to the public - including political parties , nongovernmental organizations , and influential figures - in each country , and explain its position . 
The Fund must also do more to enhance its presence on the Web and in school and university classrooms , especially as students are often the most receptive to ideas about global citizenship . 
Above all , the Fund must change how it is perceived from outside . 
It must be seen as an institution that respects each country &apos;s sovereignty but works for the global good . 
A transparent and fair process of arriving at its policy recommendations , based primarily on convincing economic research and data analysis , will be essential . 
Countries will have to agree to accept and facilitate the IMF &apos;s direct engagement with their influential citizenry as long as it is carried out in good faith . 
The IMF &apos;s expression of its economic views to local publics should then be protected by international agreement , much like embassies and their activities . 
If we can make these changes - and one should not minimize the scale of the task - perhaps when G-20 leaders meet in the future , they will not think that their citizens have little interest in the outcome . 
Instead , they will have a political mandate to attend meaningfully to the welfare of the global economy .
