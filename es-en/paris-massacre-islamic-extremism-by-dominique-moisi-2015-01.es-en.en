The French 9 / 11 
PARIS - &quot; France &apos;s 9 / 11 . &quot; 
In the immediate aftermath of the massacre at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo , the comparison with Al Qaeda &apos;s 2001 attack on the United States has taken hold across France . 
Indeed , the January 7 attack was the most murderous France has known since the end of the Algerian War in 1962 . 
At first blush , the comparison seems artificial and far-fetched . 
Twelve people died in Paris , whereas nearly 3,000 were killed in the attacks on New York and Washington , DC . 
The attackers used Kalashnikovs , not hijacked planes . 
That is why the attack in Paris 2015 looks more like a combination of two other attacks : the London Underground bombing in 2005 ( the terrorists were all national citizens ) and the plot executed in Mumbai in 2008 ( the terrorists used small arms and targeted people individually ) . 
Yet , despite the major differences , the attacks in Paris and in New York share the same essence . 
Both cities incarnate a similar universal dream . 
Both are metaphors for light and freedom . 
Both belong to the world , not only to their respective countries . 
Moreover , in both cases , the targets chosen by the terrorists were highly symbolic . 
In New York , the Twin Towers embodied capitalist ambition and achievement . 
In Paris , Charlie Hebdo has given form to the spirit of democratic freedom : the ability to write , draw , and publish anything - even extreme ( and at times vulgar ) provocations . 
There is a strong sense in Paris , as there was in New York , that the real target was Western civilization itself . 
Like most Frenchmen , I say , out of disgust for the attack and empathy for the victims , Je suis Charlie - a phrase that recalls the newspaper Le Monde &apos;s declaration , immediately after 9 / 11 : Nous sommes tous Américains . 
But I must admit that I did not always feel that way . 
In 2005 , I had reservations about the decision by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten to publish a series of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad - and about Charlie Hebdo &apos;s choice to reproduce the cartoons the following year . 
At the time , I felt that it was a dangerous and unnecessary - and thus politically irresponsible - provocation . 
One does not play with matches next to a gas pipeline or a bundle of dynamite . 
Our era is probably much more religious than the eighteenth century ever was . 
To invoke Voltaire is one thing , I thought at the time , but to act responsibly may presuppose refraining from insulting what is most sacred to others , whether it be Christ , Muhammad , or the Shoah . 
Today , given the nature of the attack , I leave those reservations behind , though I resist the temptation to sacralize the victims &quot; memories , as so many Frenchmen are doing . 
In France , laïcité , wrongly translated in English as &quot; secularism , &quot; is the equivalent of a religion - the religion of the Republic . 
For the cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo , religion was just another ideology , and they took aim at all three major monotheistic faiths ( though perhaps with a greater emphasis on Islam , probably owing to its more visible fundamentalist face ) . 
So far , a climate of national unity is prevailing in France , just as it did in America immediately after 9 / 11 . 
Indeed , even Marine Le Pen , the leader of the far-right National Front , initially warned against the dangers of an anti-Muslim backlash , stating that a few lost young men were in no way representative of the majority of French Muslims . 
But how long will national unity prevail ? 
The scars of colonialism are fresher in France than anywhere else in Europe ; the country has Europe &apos;s largest Muslim minority ; and , with moderates seeming particularly weak and divided , the extreme right is cresting in opinion polls . 
These ingredients could constitute a recipe for disaster . 
Already , Le Pen appears to be reverting to form . 
&quot; National unity is a pathetic political maneuver , &quot; she complained , after she was not invited to a rally the day after the attack . 
We French must face this terrorist attack the same way the Americans did after 9 / 11 : firmly and clearly , but also with responsibility . 
France &apos;s task now is to uphold the values that have made it a target .
