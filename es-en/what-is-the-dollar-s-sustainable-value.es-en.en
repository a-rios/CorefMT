What is the Dollar &apos;s Sustainable Value ? 
How much further will the dollar fall ? 
Or has it already fallen so far that it will now start to move back to a higher level ? 
For travelers to the United States from Europe or Asia , US prices are dramatically lower than at home . 
A hotel room or dinner in New York seems a bargain when compared to prices in London , Paris , or Tokyo . 
And shoppers from abroad are loading up on a wide range of products before heading home . 
But , despite this very tangible evidence , it would be wrong to conclude that US goods are now so cheap at the existing exchange rate that the dollar must rise from its current level . 
Although the goods and services that travelers buy may cost less in the US than abroad , the overall price of American products is still too high to erase the enormous trade imbalance between the US and the rest of the world . 
To be sure , the falling dollar over the past few years has made American products more competitive and has caused the real value of US exports to rise sharply - by more than 25 % over the past three years . 
But the trade deficit in 2007 nevertheless remained at more than $ 700 billion , or 5 % of GDP . 
The large trade deficit and equally large current account deficit ( which includes net investment income ) implies that foreign investors must add $ 700 billion of US securities to their portfolios . 
It is their unwillingness to do so at the existing exchange rate that causes the dollar to fall relative to other currencies . 
In falling , the dollar lowers the value of the dollar securities in foreign portfolios when valued in euros or other home currencies , shrinking the share of dollars in investors &quot; portfolios . 
The weaker dollar also reduces the risk of future dollar decline , because it means that the dollar has to fall less in the future to shift the trade balance to a sustainable level . 
But what is that sustainable level of the trade balance and of the dollar ? 
While experts try to work this out in terms of portfolio balances , a more fundamental starting point is the fact that a US trade deficit means that Americans receive more goods and services from the rest of the world than they send back - $ 700 billion more last year . 
The difference was financed by transferring stocks and bonds worth $ 700 billion . 
The interest and dividends on those securities will be paid by sending more &quot; pieces of paper . &quot; 
And when those securities mature , they will be refinanced with new stocks and bonds . 
It is unthinkable that the global economic system will continue indefinitely to allow the US to import more goods and services than it exports . 
At some point , the US will need to start repaying the enormous amount that it has received from the rest of the world . 
To do so , the US will need a trade surplus . 
So the key determinant of the dollar &apos;s long-term value is that it must decline enough to shift the US trade balance from today &apos;s deficit to a surplus . 
That won &apos;t happen anytime soon , but it is the direction in which the trade balance must continue to move . 
And that means further depreciation of the dollar . 
An important factor in this process will be the future price of oil and the extent of US dependence on oil imports . 
In each of the past four years , the US imported 3.6 billion barrels of oil . 
At the current price of more than $ 140 a barrel , that implies an import cost of more than $ 500 billion . 
The higher the cost of oil , the lower the dollar has to be to achieve any given reduction in the size of the trade deficit . 
So a rising oil price as measured in euros or yen implies a greater dollar fall , and therefore an even higher oil price when stated in dollars . 
There is one further important consideration in thinking about the future value of the dollar : relative inflation rates in the US and abroad . The US trade deficit depends on the real value of the dollar - that is , the value of the dollar adjusted for differences in price levels in the US and abroad . 
If the US experiences higher inflation than our trading partners , the dollar &apos;s nominal value must fall even further just to maintain the same real value . 
The inflation differential between the dollar and the euro is now relatively small - only about one percentage point a year - but is greater relative to the yen and lower relative to the renminbi and other high-inflation currencies . Over the longer run , however , inflation differentials could be a more significant force in determining the dollar &apos;s path .
