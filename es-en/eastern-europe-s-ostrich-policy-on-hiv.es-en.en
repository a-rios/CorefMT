Eastern Europe &apos;s Ostrich Policy on HIV 
CARDIFF , CALIFORNIA - Russia and Ukraine account for roughly 90 % of the 1.5 million people estimated to be infected with HIV in Central and Eastern Europe . 
On a recent trip to these countries , and despite repeated requests , no politician or public-health official in either country would meet with me . 
Both countries have epidemics driven by injecting drug users ( IDUs ) who share needles and syringes , the most efficient way to transmit HIV . 
Yet proven methods exist to slow the spread of HIV by IDUs . 
If IDUs inject heroin or related opiates - as is primarily the case in Eastern Europe - establishing opiate substitution programs with methadone or buprenorphine can dramatically slow HIV transmission . 
The success of such programs also depends on establishing needle / syringe exchanges at convenient locations , both to provide clean equipment and to draw users into the healthcare system . 
As the third leg of the stool , IDUs need counseling . 
This trio of policies forms the foundation of what &apos;s known among health-care professionals as the &quot; harm-reduction package . &quot; 
Russia and Ukraine , however , spend no money on harm reduction . 
International aid supports harm-reduction efforts in both countries on a modest scale : most of the money comes from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria . 
But Russia , owing to a rise in its national income , no longer is eligible for HIV / AIDS Global Fund grants . 
A group of non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) in Russia that has run a harm-reduction effort with Global Fund money received assurances from the government that it would continue to bankroll the work once that money ran out . 
But last fall the government reneged , and the Global Fund issued the group an emergency grant for two years . 
Cash-strapped Ukraine , which remains eligible for Global Fund help to combat HIV / AIDS , also relies entirely on NGOs - most created by affected communities - to run its harm-reduction programs . 
Aside from shaky funding , the harm-reduction efforts in Russia , and to a large degree in Ukraine , lack a fundamental tool : opiate-substitution treatment . 
Russia bans the use of methadone outright . 
&quot; There is no evidence that use of methadone and buprenorphinefacilitates treatment of drug addicts , &quot; declared Olga Krivonos , head of the Department of Medical Aid and Healthcare Development at Russia &apos;s Ministry of Healthcare and Social Development , in March 2009 . 
Ukraine , which legalized the import of methadone only in December 2007 , had a mere 5,000 people receiving it when I visited . 
&quot; There is a large body of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of substitution treatment vis-Ã -vis HIV / AIDS , &quot; concluded the World Health Organization , the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV / AIDS in a 2004 policy brief . 
The US Institute of Medicine weighed in on the issue in a 2007 report : &quot; Given the strong evidence of its effectiveness in treating opioid dependence , opioid agonist maintenance treatment should be made widely available where feasible . &quot; 
The popular explanation for lack of action in Russia and Ukraine is that their governments view IDUs as criminals , rather than people with a disease , and adopt an informal let-them-rot policy . 
Indeed , police regularly harass users ( and people who help them ) , making matters worse . 
Many countries outside the region take a similar stance . 
But it &apos;s more complicated in Eastern Europe . 
A leftover Soviet distrust of outsiders colors many opinions , and there &apos;s an oft-repeated claim that the culture is different : an intervention that works in the West might fail in the East . 
There is also a suspicion that dirty capitalist pigs want to profit from the sale of opiate substitutes , regardless of whether they work . 
This is as silly as contending that antiretroviral drugs won &apos;t work in the region , and that treating HIV is all a giant plot on the part of big pharmaceutical companies . 
Humans are humans . 
Harm reduction works everywhere , and the main financial benefactors are the countries themselves , which see reduced spread of HIV , drops in crime , and people returning to work . 
Playing ostrich about harm reduction does not harm only IDUs . 
HIV-infected IDUs of course have sex with non-users . 
Pregnant HIV-infected IDUs transmit the virus to their babies , and sometimes - shockingly often in Russia - abandon their newborns , relinquishing them to the state . 
The people infected by IDUs also can infect others sexually , further fortifying the bridge into the &quot; general &quot; population . 
In July , Vienna hosted the 18th International AIDS Conference , attracting nearly 20,000 people . 
Speakers included Austrian President Heinz Fischer , Bill Clinton , Bill Gates , and South Africa &apos;s Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe . 
Organizers held the meeting in Vienna specifically because it is &quot; the gateway to Eastern Europe , &quot; and they hoped to involve the region more than ever . 
For the first time , all proceedings were translated into Russian . 
But no high-level Russian or Ukrainian official attended . 
A &quot; Vienna Declaration , &quot; endorsing harm reduction - and emphasizing drug policy based on science , not ideology - was launched at the meeting , and gathered more than 10,000 signatories . 
But the most influential Eastern European signatory was the First Lady of Georgia , a country whose estimated 2,700 HIV-infected people account for just 0.018 % of the regional total . 
Judging by their governments &quot; indifference , the remaining 99.982 % of the HIV-infected people in Eastern Europe - and all those they place at risk of harm - can just rot .
