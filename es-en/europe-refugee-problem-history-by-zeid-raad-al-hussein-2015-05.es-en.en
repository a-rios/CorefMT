Europe &apos;s Refugee Problem , Then and Now 
NEW YORK - Earlier this spring , I drove to a beautiful spot on the southern bank of Lake Geneva . 
My destination was the Hotel Royale in Évian-les-Bains . 
It was there , in July 1938 , that 32 nations met for a shameful discussion that has been virtually airbrushed from our memory . 
Convened by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the massive refugee crisis triggered by Hitler &apos;s virulent anti-Semitism , the Évian conference was a catastrophe . 
And its disastrous outcome needs to be recalled in the light of Europe &apos;s current migration crisis . 
The Évian conference was supposed to address the plight of hundreds of thousands of German and Austrian Jews who were desperate for refuge . 
Roosevelt believed that only a collective solution could meet the challenge . 
Hitler , too , hoped that other countries would accept them . 
In a speech in Königsberg that March , he jeered , &quot; I can only hope and expect that the other world which has felt such deep sympathy for these criminals will be generous enough to transform this pity into practical aid . 
As far as I am concerned we are ready to place our luxury ships at the disposal of these countries for the transportation of these criminals . &quot; 
He had already begun to expel Jews , including by placing them forcibly on ships and sending them to various destinations in the Mediterranean and across the Atlantic . 
But , throughout Europe , the refugees faced rejection . 
On June 6 , 1938 , as preparations for the conference were underway , the US State Department received a letter concerning 51 Austrian Jewish refugees stranded on a small boat in the international waters of the Danube . 
The writer recalled seeing : &quot; the heartrending fate of 51 human beings driven from one frontier to the other . 
We have gained personal knowledge of the unspeakable misery that has innocently befallen 100,000 inhabitants of Austria . &quot; 
And yet in Évian the following month , although many European delegations voiced eloquent dismay over the torment experienced by the Jews of Germany and Austria , they were unprepared to take concrete action . 
The outcome of the meeting was clear : Europe , North America , and Australia would not accept significant numbers of these refugees . 
In the verbatim record , two words were uttered repeatedly : &quot; density &quot; and &quot; saturation . &quot; 
The European countries were already beset with population &quot; density &quot; and had reached a point of &quot; saturation &quot; - in other words , there was simply no more room at the European inn . 
It was an absurd thing to say , of course , in 1938 , given the size of Europe &apos;s populations today . 
And it would be an equally ridiculous thing to say now , too . 
To be sure , the participants in Évian could not have foreseen the Holocaust , or that Europe was being drawn into another devastating war ; nonetheless , their lack of moral conscience was breathtaking . 
Many of the countries that refused to take in suffering refugees were themselves , in due course , occupied and brutalized by the Nazis - and desperate for the compassion that they denied the Jews in July 1938 . 
The Nazis must have reveled in the knowledge that their virulent anti-Semitism found an echo - sometimes not so faint - in the rest of Europe . 
They also came to realize that if expulsion was not possible , extermination eventually would be . 
Today , anti-Semitism , Islamophobia , racism , xenophobia , and anti-migrant sentiment are again rising across Europe , and we must stop now and reassess precisely where we are . 
A major British tabloid newspaper recently felt it acceptable to allow one of its columnists to call immigrants &quot; cockroaches . &quot; 
Rwanda &apos;s Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines used the same word to describe Tutsis in the run-up to the 1994 genocide , as did Julius Streicher &apos;s Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer to describe Jews . 
Political leaders across Europe regularly - and shamefully - blame migrants for their national woes . 
Attacking migrants or minorities - whether crudely , through language , or more subtly , through policy - is unacceptable everywhere , full stop . 
When words are formulated with the clear intention of causing harm and violence on national , racial or religious grounds , freedom of expression becomes incitement to hatred , which is prohibited by law . 
Countries that have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , which includes all European Union members , are bound to uphold it . 
And yet Europe &apos;s current proposals on migration leave much to be desired . 
The continent needs to recall its past more sensitively , and be more generous to the desperate people crossing the Mediterranean . 
François Crépeau , the United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants , observed in a recent interview that Europe , Australia , and Canada could easily resettle one million Syrian refugees over the next five years , and they could add Eritreans to that list and extend this policy to seven years . 
So why is Europe proposing to accept a paltry 20,000-40,000 people annually for resettlement ? 
To the European politician strongly opposed to migration , I suggest that the next time you need hospital treatment , take a look around you : many of the people caring for you have a migrant &apos;s tale . 
And should you quench your thirst with the famous water drawn from Évian-les-Bains , you may wish to reflect on the craven failure of a conference that could have saved so many lives - and on what it can still teach us today .
