Ukraine &apos;s Struggle for Law 
One year after our Orange Revolution , many Ukrainians see its ideals as betrayed . 
Belief in a government answerable to the people and in a transparent market purged of insider dealing no longer guides government policy . 
Instead , the ideals for which we struggled appear as slogans invoked by those who want to protect their vested interests . 
Cynics explain this by saying that our AOrange &quot; ideals were never anything but the rationalizations of one set of oligarchs struggling to overthrow another . 
Once masters of the situation , it is said , the zeal of those who promised reform mutated into a zeal to preserve their private wealth and that of their friends . 
How did Ukraine reach this state of cynicism ? 
A year ago , everyone gathered in the streets of Kyiv knew what we were standing up against : a corrupt government that sought to command life and labor , and to dispose of state property , at its will . 
In so far as formal legal rights existed , no court could be relied upon to enforce those rights when our rulers saw their interests as challenged . 
In evicting that regime , we believed that this form of absolutism was ended . 
Instead , those who benefited from the regime = s corruptions insisted that their rights to the property they had stolen were inviolate . 
These crony capitalists argue that , if they are left alone to develop their assets , they will make the country prosperous . 
Tamper with property , no matter how ill-gotten , and no investor will have confidence , they claim . 
That is the oldest excuse to justify wrongdoing : the end justifies the means . 
But power - be it political or economic - without legitimate origins is arbitrary . 
An economy that appears arbitrary and illegitimate in the eyes of the majority of people may , for a time , run on the false confidence of easy profits . 
Corruption , however , is inevitable because the rule of law , which is the market = s ultimate guarantor , depends on the consent of all its participants and their belief in its core fairness . 
A radical lawlessness was at the heart of Ukraine &apos;s privatization process . 
So we must not be tricked by the fact that those who gained economic power by looting state assets now employ lawyers , invoke free market nostrums , and claim to follow the letter of the law . 
It is found when governments deny that in making or interpreting laws they are bound by the spirit of law . 
In this respect , the oligarchs and their political placemen who insist that their right to stolen property is sacred make the same crude claim as the regime that we overthrew : that they have an indefeasible right to the exercise of power . 
They reject the principle that there is a law which is superior to presidents , magnates , majorities , or mobs . 
If their claim is upheld , then the cynics are right : our revolution was merely about whether one class or another , one person or another , would obtain the power to work his or her will . 
Endorsing the claim to arbitrary power is the cardinal heresy of those who say we should certify property stolen from the state as rightfully owned . 
I call this a heresy because it rejects the supremacy of equality under law and proclaims the supremacy of particular men . 
This is alien to any and all concepts of liberty . 
It is the legalism of the barbarian , and the nihilist philosophy everyone in reaction against the coming of political and economic liberty to Ukraine . 
Legal primitives are not alone in embracing this stance . 
Many economists also believe that ownership of stolen goods must be recognized . 
They liken the transition from communism to the state of nature described by John Locke . 
So they imagine the property rights acquired through cronyism , nepotism , and backroom dealing as somehow emerging from a Lockean realm of freedom . 
When my government questioned this assumption , they cried out that this was interference by the state with legitimate property rights . 
Another group also succumbed to this delusion . 
Some who a year ago displayed great public spirit came to feel , when in government , that they could not vindicate the supremacy of law without curtailing economic growth . 
Because the grind of government can obscure enduring principle , people inspired by the best motives now find themselves on the same side as their criminal adversaries . 
They have , I believe , lost their way and taken a path that can only lead back to the supremacy of arbitrary power . 
Indeed , the denial that men may be arbitrary is the higher law by which we must govern . 
Without this conviction the letter of the law is nothing but a mask for bureaucratic caprice and authoritarian will . 
For when people do not believe that their government adheres to this higher spirit of law , no constitution is worth the paper it is written on ; no business transaction is safe . 
For maintaining a constitutional order and viable free market requires an intuitive dislike of arbitrariness , a sensitivity to its manifestations , and spontaneous resistance . 
This was why my government sought to recover stolen state property . 
By doing so , and then auctioning that property in a transparent manner , Ukrainians saw that arbitrary action could be redressed , that the rule of law applied to the powerful as well as the weak . 
Indeed , this did happen with the one property recovery that my government was able to secure , the giant Kryvorizhstal steel works that our former president &apos;s son-in-law gained through a rigged sale at a bargain price . 
On its re-auction , Ukraine received more than five times the amount that had been paid through that insider deal . 
Ukraine must continue in this way if our people are to trust the law and their institutions . 
The lesson in the open Kryvorizhstal auction is clear : if a president may not act willfully , arbitrarily , by personal prerogative , then no one may . 
Parliament may not . 
Crowds may not . 
By identifying the law with their vested rights , the oligarchs who have ( for now ! ) derailed the ideals of the Orange Revolution sought to shield their own interests from challenge . 
But because men pervert a truth there is no reason to abandon it . 
If , as we were taught by Marx , belief in a higher law is a mixture of sentimentality , superstition , and unconscious rationalizations , then the predations that incited the Orange Revolution are in reality the only possible conditions in which we can live . 
We must give up the hope of liberty within an ordered society and market and resign ourselves to that interminable war of all against all of which Hobbes spoke . 
Indeed , the policies now being offered seem hostile to the ideals of our Orange Revolution . 
We are asked to choose between social solidarity and economic growth . 
To escape from want we are told we must embrace illegality . 
To promote the truth , we are told that old crimes - even the beheading of a journalist and the poisoning of our president - must not be closely examined . 
These choices are as false as they are intolerable . 
Yet these are the choices offered by our influential doctrinaires . 
But to see these as Ukraine &apos;s only options is to mistake weariness for wisdom , and to be discouraged rather than to understand . 
For the search for law has an irresistible energy . 
No human obstruction can long withstand it . 
Though we may take a step back now and then , as we have recently , only by adhering to this higher law can Ukraine achieve freedom and prosperity for all . 
Achieve it we will .
