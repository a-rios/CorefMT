The Failure of China Bashing 
With China &apos;s rapid growth increasingly affecting a wide range of issues worldwide , it has become expedient for US presidential candidates to blame China for some of America &apos;s domestic problems . 
But in this year &apos;s US presidential election campaign , China bashing has been virtually non-existent . 
There are good reasons for this welcome change . 
Recent US elections rarely spared China , which found itself a frequent target of populist demagoguery . 
Its exchange-rate regime , which pegs the Renminbi to the US dollar , was blamed for the mounting US trade deficit . 
Never mind that America &apos;s bilateral trade deficit with China , even including Hong Kong , accounts for less than one-fifth of the total US deficit : growing imports from China and more direct investment by US companies supposedly fueled US unemployment . 
Similarly , the unfinished reforms in China &apos;s banking sector and state-owned enterprises have been used as evidence of state subsidies for dumping activities . 
Although the majority of China &apos;s exports now come from private companies that receive virtually no loans from state banks , American candidates in previous elections routinely sought to curry favor with working class voters by vowing to protect US jobs against China &apos;s supposedly unfair business practices . 
The jobs issue could be exploited further by citing poor working conditions , low wages , child labor , and other problems commonly found in developing countries . 
Attacking a communist country has always seemed to offer American politicians a convenient way to appeal to the average voter . 
After all , most US voters can be trusted not to learn how other countries , let alone countries in the Far East , really work . 
But this time , George W. Bush and John Kerry both know that it would be unwise to bash China too hard . 
American companies and the entire US economy have a huge stake in China now , so both candidates have no interest in rocking the boat . 
A candidate may promise more anti-dumping actions against Chinese goods , vow to press harder on China to change its exchange rate regime , or sharpen criticism of China &apos;s weak enforcement of intellectual property rights ; but over-protectionism may make a candidate look irresponsible in 2004 . 
Indeed , protectionism can do nothing to reduce America &apos;s trade deficit and stanch domestic unemployment . 
No matter how much politicians blame others , growing US imports mean greater reliance on international markets , and some China factor in America &apos;s investment portfolio is needed to compete against European and Japanese firms . 
There is no hiding these facts from American voters anymore . 
George W. Bush failed to honor his anti-Chinese protectionist campaign promises of 2000 , as did Bill Clinton throughout his presidency . 
Any China-bashing and protectionist pleas this time around will most likely ring just as hollow . 
Moreover , China &apos;s geopolitical importance to the US has grown immensely since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. of September 11 , 2001 . 
At least for now , engaging China in the global fight against terrorism is in America &apos;s interest . 
China does have some common interests in fighting Islamic extremist terrorism , and it did not try to block America &apos;s path to the Iraqi war in the UN Security Council . 
China has also been cooperating constructively with the US and its allies in dealing with North Korea &apos;s nuclear capabilities . 
Of course , America still wants to contain China and prevent it from becoming a major regional and world power . 
But that remains a long-term strategic goal , not the stuff of presidential campaigns , especially when China seems too weak to pose any immediate threat to the US on any front in the foreseeable future . 
China has never been a positive factor in American politics ; so , from its perspective , the less it is mentioned in this US election season , the better . 
The relative silence about China in the US these days may be due merely to the news dominance of the Iraq War . 
Yet it may also indicate that America &apos;s political elites are in the process of facing up to new realities and adjusting their view of China accordingly .
