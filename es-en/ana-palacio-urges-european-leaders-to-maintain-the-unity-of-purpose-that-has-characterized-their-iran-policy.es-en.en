Europe &apos;s Iranian Imperative 
MADRID - Last month , with the world &apos;s attention fixed on the crisis in Crimea and the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 , the latest round of negotiations between Iran and the P5 + 1 ( the United States , China , France , Russia , and the United Kingdom , plus Germany ) passed quietly in Vienna . 
Even with discussions set to continue next week , the talks &quot; outcome remains far from certain - and world leaders cannot afford to become distracted . 
This is especially true for Europe , whose unified approach to Iran has been invaluable up to this point . 
Indeed , it was the bite of European sanctions that ultimately brought Iran to the negotiating table , and the force of unified European diplomacy facilitated the &quot; joint plan of action , &quot; which set out the terms for reaching a comprehensive long-term agreement within six months . 
But now , at the plan &apos;s halfway point , there has been little concrete progress , with last month &apos;s negotiations producing no headway on two key issues being discussed : the acceptable level for uranium enrichment in Iran and the future of the heavy-water reactor at Arak . 
The sharp contrast between this lack of achievement and Iran &apos;s recent declarations about reaching a final deal by July raises important questions about Iran &apos;s strategy and goals - questions that negotiators must consider carefully when determining the best approach . 
The key to success is the background against which the process plays out . 
Iran is a land of contrasts . 
On a recent visit organized by the European Council on Foreign Relations ( ECFR ) , the coexistence of entrenched tradition and rapid transformation was starkly apparent . 
Central Tehran - ebullient with young people and high-heeled women donning testimonial headscarves and mid-thigh jackets over pants - embodies a thirst for openness . 
More than 60 % of Iranians were born after the 1979 Islamic Revolution , and more than 40 % were born after the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980 &quot; s . 
For them , the revolution is a part of history , not the main source of their personal values . 
The toll taken by years of tough economic sanctions is also apparent . 
Despite Iranian officials &quot; best efforts to downplay the sanctions &quot; impact , it is difficult to spin inflation in excess of 30 % and projected GDP growth of just 1 % this year . 
The combination of a young population and a crumbling economy is a combustible mix , one that amounts to an existential threat to the regime - and the regime knows it . 
In this sense , the imperative to reach a prosperity-enhancing agreement with the international community is greater than ever for Iran &apos;s leadership . 
Furthermore , Iran &apos;s negotiating style , like its capital city , can be both fatiguing and confusing . 
Just moments after elaborating at length on the Koran &apos;s prohibition of nuclear weapons , an interlocutor would declare that the underground Fordow nuclear facility &apos;s impregnability to airstrikes must be central to any deal . 
The reality is that Iran does not envisage giving up its nuclear breakout capacity . 
The negotiations are aimed not at eradication , but at lengthening lead-time - specifically , limiting uranium-enrichment levels to 3.5 % , establishing a strong inspections regime , and reaching an agreement on the Arak nuclear facility . 
But even this may not happen . 
Moreover , Iran has managed to separate the nuclear negotiations from broader , related issues like its ballistic-missile program , its support for groups like Hezbollah , and its domestic human-rights record . 
With the US loath to introduce potential spoilers into the mix , there is no chance that any of these issues will be up for discussion . 
In this context , EU High Representative Catherine Ashton &apos;s meeting with dissidents during her most recent trip to Tehran was merely a symbolic gesture . 
This leaves Iran the opening it needs to place a strategic bet that the Syrian conflict will generate increasing friction between the West and Iran &apos;s regional archrival , Saudi Arabia . 
For Iran , a staunch supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , a weaker US-Saudi relationship is key to shifting the regional balance of power - especially if it is accompanied by the easing of Western economic sanctions . 
To some degree , this hope is reinforced by Iran &apos;s perception of US President Barack Obama as a motivated partner in the nuclear talks . 
After all , a long-term agreement would be both a singular foreign-policy achievement for Obama and a boon to his efforts to disentangle the US from the Middle East . 
But Iran also recognizes that the clock is ticking . 
Obama &apos;s presidency is coming to an end , the Republicans are poised to regain control of the Senate in November &apos;s mid-term election , and Democrats are increasingly reticent to be viewed as &quot; soft on Iran . &quot; 
As a result , the US Congress appears to be growing more hostile toward a deal ; indeed , the longer it takes to conclude a final agreement , the more likely Congress is to scupper it . 
In this context , Europe has a key role to play . 
While Europe &apos;s reputation for foreign-policy &quot; softness &quot; continues to shape Iranian perceptions , the EU &apos;s role in compelling Iran to negotiate underpins the current talks . 
Likewise , it was France &apos;s insistence on more stringent controls that initially blocked the agreement in Geneva last November . 
A decade ago , Europe disappointed Iran by withdrawing from negotiations , under pressure from the US - a move that some have suggested aided former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &apos;s rise to power . 
Today , Europe will be critical to driving progress , particularly in the event that the US Congress torpedoes a sensible agreement . 
Indeed , on Iran , Europe &apos;s unified approach has enabled it to have a greater impact than on any other significant foreign-policy issue . 
This should be regarded as a model for the future and a lesson for the present . 
By preserving its unity of purpose and maintaining the pressure and negotiating momentum that it has generated , Europe can demonstrate to Iran , the US , and itself that it has what it takes to be a major global actor .
