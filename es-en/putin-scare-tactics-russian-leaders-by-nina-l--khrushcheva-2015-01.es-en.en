Putin &apos;s Scare Tactics 
COSTA SMERALDA , SARDINIA - &quot; Every nation gets the government it deserves , &quot; observed Joseph de Maistre , the Sardinian kingdom &apos;s diplomatic envoy to the Russian empire , some 200 years ago . 
He was commenting on Russians &quot; deep-seated political apathy - a trait that persists to this day . 
Of course , Russia is no longer an absolute monarchy as it was in Maistre &apos;s time . 
Nor is it a communist dictatorship , with the likes of Joseph Stalin using the threat of the Gulag to discourage political expression . 
But President Vladimir Putin has learned much from the autocratic tactics of his predecessors , whereas the Russian people seem to have learned nothing . 
In an opinion poll at the end of 2014 , 68 % of respondents said that Putin should be &quot; Man of the Year . &quot; 
His seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in March , together with his refusal to bow to the Western powers that disputed the move , made him a hero among ordinary Russians . 
In fact , Putin &apos;s efforts to recapture Russia &apos;s former territory have overshadowed his stifling of non-governmental organizations , repression of independent media , and silencing of opposition voices . 
Even as Russia &apos;s economy collapses - with the ruble having lost more than half of its value against the dollar since June , interest rates rising to 17 % , and inflation reaching double digits - Putin retains an 85 % approval rating . 
Russians should be demanding a solution to their country &apos;s economic troubles , not praising the leader who caused them . 
But Putin , an ex-KGB officer , possesses a dictator &apos;s shrewdness . 
He knows that centuries of tight government control have made Russians obedient . 
They may fear the government ; but they fear being left to fend for themselves even more . 
In mid-December Putin held his annual dinner with the oligarchs - a feast in a time of plague , so to speak . 
Forty industrial and financial leaders ( most of whom manage Kremlin-affiliated firms ) attended the event to gain - and give - reassurance that , together , they and the government would weather the crisis . 
At the dinner , Putin reiterated his promise to protect the oligarchs &quot; fortunes from American and European sanctions . 
Specifically , he pledged to apply the so-called Rotenberg Law , named after Arkady Rotenberg , a financier who was forced in September to surrender $ 40 million in assets to Italy &apos;s government . 
The law obliges the Kremlin to compensate oligarchs for any foreign assets that they lose as a result of Western sanctions . 
These statements built upon a promise Putin made in an interview earlier last month . 
If Russian businesspeople repatriate their offshore accounts , their financial indiscretions will be forgiven and forgotten . 
Relying upon such promises would be financial suicide . 
Just a few months ago , Putin assured everyone that Russia &apos;s economy would weather the European and American sanctions easily . 
Likewise , during the 1998 financial meltdown , Russian oligarchs lost big - and most never recovered . 
Clearly , Russia &apos;s government cannot be trusted to safeguard anyone &apos;s wealth , with the possible exception of that of its own members . 
Yet refusing the Kremlin &apos;s embrace is equally destructive . 
After all , in Putin &apos;s Russia , political dissent brings financial ruin . 
In 2003 , Russia &apos;s wealthiest oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky - a vocal advocate of democratization and tireless critic of Putin - was imprisoned on trumped-up charges of fraud and tax evasion , and his Yukos Oil Company was driven to bankruptcy , broken up , and sold off to Kremlin cronies . 
Ten years later , the message remains the same : If you obey your government , your follies ( no business in Russia is free of kickbacks and bribes ) will be forgiven . 
Failure to fall in line will be your downfall - regardless of how wealthy or well known you are . 
Of course , it is not the tycoons who will bear the brunt of the economic crisis . 
After all , Putin needs their support - as short-lived or ephemeral as it may be - to retain his grip on power . 
Ordinary Russians have far less leverage - and will suffer far more . 
But maybe they deserve to suffer . 
Harsh austerity measures - cuts to pensions , salaries , and social services ( including a recent decision to close hundreds of hospitals and lay off thousands of medical personnel ) - have inspired barely any criticism . 
At the end of December , a few thousand people staged a demonstration in Moscow &apos;s central Manezh Square , partly to show support for Alexei Navalny - an anti-corruption lawyer , well-known blogger , and leader of a dwindling opposition movement - and his younger brother , Oleg . 
The Navalny brothers had just been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for defrauding a cosmetics company . 
Alexei , an opponent of Putin on par with Khodorkovsky , received a suspended sentence ; 
Oleg , an apolitical postal executive , will have to serve his full term in prison . 
This tactic - to &quot; forgive &quot; one &apos;s enemies , while punishing them via their relatives - was a favorite of Stalin &apos;s . 
The &quot; enemy &quot; would quickly come to his or her senses , and the public , unfamiliar with those imprisoned , would quickly lose interest . 
They still do . 
Today &apos;s Russians hope that Putin , who blindsided his opponents with his annexation of Crimea , might have another daring trick up his sleeve - one that will stabilize financial markets and revive the oil prices on which Russia &apos;s economy depends . 
Of course , Russians know enough to worry that Putin has run out of ideas . 
But that fear does not compare to their dread of what might happen if they rock the boat . 
And Putin , for his part , understands this well enough to know that he needs no gulags - only the canny use of fear and forgiveness - to retain his grip on power .
