A Breach in the Eurozone Dike 
PRINCETON - While all eyes have been on the European periphery , has the core been cracking ? 
The Bundesbank has lowered its forecast for German annual GDP growth in 2013 to 0.4 % . 
The Central Bank of the Netherlands expects Dutch GDP to shrink by -0.5 % this year - following a contraction of about 1 % in 2012 . 
The eurozone crisis may be entering its third stage . 
In the first stage , beginning in the spring of 2008 , the locus of the North Atlantic crisis moved from the United States to the eurozone . 
In the second stage , starting in the spring of 2009 , the crisis spread to the sovereigns , as investors grew increasingly worried that propping up banks would strain government finances . 
In turn , sovereign weakness made the banks appear riskier , and the banks and their home governments became joined at the hip . 
Throughout the crisis , it has been widely assumed - at least so far - that the eurozone core would remain solid , and would continue to write the checks for the periphery &apos;s distressed governments and banks . 
That assumption appeared plausible . 
In particular , Germany stood above the fray . 
Following strong performance in 2010 , Germany &apos;s GDP exceeded pre-crisis levels by early 2011 , a somewhat better achievement than that of the US . 
Indeed , given Germany &apos;s surprisingly impressive employment performance , another Wirtschaftswunder appeared to be in the making . 
Then a subtle change occurred . 
The US - despite a historically slow return to normalcy - pulled ahead of Germany . 
Absent a prolonged fiscal-cliff and debt-ceiling mess , the US may be cobbling together a sustainable recovery . 
Following the German economy &apos;s sharp contraction in the last quarter of 2012 , the question for the country today is whether it can avoid a technical recession ( defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction ) . 
Europe does not have its own growth engine . 
The German rebound was initially robust because world trade rose rapidly after a precipitous fall . 
China &apos;s voracious appetite for German cars and machines provided the needed boost , even as Germany &apos;s traditional trade partners in Europe struggled . 
Since then , however , Chinese demand growth has slowed , and Germany &apos;s European trading partners are in even deeper trouble . 
Fiscal austerity in the periphery requires cutting back on imports ; hence , the countries exporting to the periphery need to curtail their own imports - and so the process cascades . 
This trade multiplier is causing European economies to drag each other down , and the rest of the world is feeling the effects . 
The Dutch economy &apos;s poor prospects are similarly alarming . 
The Netherlands is second only to Germany in the volume of credit that it channels through the so-called &quot; Target 2 &quot; system to the eurozone periphery , and it is the periphery &apos;s largest creditor in per capita terms . 
Economic forecasters continue to promise that growth will revive . 
But the track record of charting this recovery has been discouraging . 
In his book The Signal and the Noise , the American statistician Nate Silver says that forecasters perform worst when faced with a circumstance that they have not encountered before . 
This is such a circumstance . 
In April 2010 , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s World Economic Outlook projected 1.8 % annual GDP growth in Germany and the Netherlands in 2013 . 
In October of last year , the IMF lowered its 2013 growth forecast for Germany to 0.9 % and to 0.4 % for the Netherlands . 
And , a mere two months later , both countries &quot; central banks report that even these reduced expectations are too optimistic . 
Who is to say that the second half of 2013 will bring more hope and cheer ? 
The European crisis-management process has been predicated on the Scarlett O &apos;Hara principle that &quot; tomorrow will be a better day . &quot; 
Although everyone knows that postponing hard decisions only makes the problem larger , they could still believe that there would always be a firm line of defense . 
That may be changing . 
The third stage of the eurozone crisis will arrive when the economic strength of the core is in doubt . 
Those very doubts undermine the credibility of the safety net that has been supporting the European periphery . 
A solution to the eurozone crisis that relies on Germany has always been politically uncertain .
