New Security Laws Increase Hong Kong \ u0027s Insecurity 
No news is not necessarily good news for Hong Kong . 
Before its reunification with mainland China , many people expected the former British colony to grab headlines as Beijing progressively stripped its freedoms . 
Instead , Hong Kong mostly vanished from the world &apos;s news radar after 1997 . 
Five years since its handover , and contrary to expectation , Hong Kong retains its rights . 
But this could be changing . 
C.H. Tung , Hong Kong &apos;s Chief Executive , began his second term last year by proposing new security laws , causing a few news blips of worry . 
The legislation is meant to comply with Article 23 of the Basic Law , the mini-constitution that governs Hong Kong and that requires the government to enact laws against treason , sedition , subversion , and theft of national secrets . 
Article 23 has been a sensitive issue from the moment Hong Kong was returned to China , because its inclusion in the Basic Law came in the wake of the Hong Kong population &apos;s strong support for the 1989 pro-democracy movement in Beijing . 
To maintain political stability , both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments willingly shelved the issue during Tung &apos;s first term . 
With his re-election , they abruptly decided that they had waited long enough and would enact the Article 23 security laws before mid-2003 . 
Vague in wording and unnecessarily broad in scope , the new laws sparked widespread fear that Article 23 will lead to curtailment of basic rights . 
Lawyers warn of a threat to individual liberty and due process . 
Journalists argue that defending the public &apos;s interest sometimes requires reporting state secrets . 
Teachers worry that banning possession of seditious materials will undermine academic freedom . 
Religious and sociopolitical associations fear that their global ties will be severed and their existence threatened if their counterparts abroad are declared subversive in mainland China . 
Hong Kong &apos;s people do not reject all security legislation . 
They only demand that the proposed laws be less arbitrary and that their scope be minimized . 
But government officials merely reiterate the political righteousness of the proposed anti-subversion laws . 
In one of the more desperate and egregious examples , Regina Ip , the Secretary for Security , attributed Hitler &apos;s rise to power to flaws in the workings of democracy . 
The government , she hints , will correct similar flaws . 
Heated exchanges between the authorities and opponents of the laws led many to believe that the devil is , indeed , in the details . 
What has emerged is an almost unanimous demand that the Tung government publish a detailed draft of the laws for one more round of consultation . 
The government , under intense pressure from Beijing to enact the blessed version , calls this unnecessary . 
Blocked in their efforts to change the law through consultation , Hong Kong &apos;s people have taken to the streets . 
At one demonstration , 60,000 participants marched against Article 23 - the largest protests in Hong Kong since the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations . 
A counter-demonstration mobilized by pro-China forces drew a smaller crowd . 
The government claims extensive support , but opinion polls consistently show that an overwhelming majority of Hong Kong &apos;s people oppose the legislation . 
The three-month consultation period before any piece of legislation enters into force ended in December . 
Will the Tung government consider opposing views in redrafting the Article 23 laws ? 
Given the undemocratic nature of the Legislative Council , it is almost certain that the government has enough votes to pass almost any law it wants . 
But the seriousness of the current situation extends beyond particular laws , no matter how noxious they may be . 
Slighting public opinion in so direct a way will have more far-reaching implications for Hong Kong &apos;s future . 
First , Tung &apos;s repeated policy failures over the last five years caused public confidence in his administration to evaporate . 
Ignoring public opinion concerning an issue as critical as the security laws will only alienate the middle class further and deepen a festering crisis of legitimacy . 
Second , Hong Kong has an international image to maintain , and in international politics what is perceived is often as important as what really happens . 
The bottom line is that Hong Kong &apos;s image as an open society has been tarnished , with criticism coming from international rights organizations , academics , and the global media . 
This damage will become permanent if those who oppose the security laws go completely unheeded . 
Finally , Hong Kong represents a test of the &quot; one country , two systems &quot; model proclaimed in 1997 , and thus of the feasibility of China &apos;s applying the same scheme to its reunification plans for Taiwan . 
The prevailing attitude in Taiwan toward reunification is highly skeptical ; enactment of strict security laws in Hong Kong will hardly be seen as reassuring . 
Hong Kong &apos;s people have spoken . 
They are waiting to be heard . 
A shortsighted decision on the part of the Tung government will have serious negative repercussions not only in Hong Kong , but for Taiwan and around the world . 
Any ruler in his right mind should be concerned whether making such a move will not ultimately harm rather than advance his interests .
