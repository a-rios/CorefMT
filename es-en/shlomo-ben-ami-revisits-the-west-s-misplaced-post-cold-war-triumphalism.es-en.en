History Strikes Back 
MADRID - When the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed , the victors were beyond complacent , for they were certain that their triumph had been inevitable all along . 
Many in the West assumed that liberal capitalism &apos;s victory over totalitarian socialism would necessarily bring an end to wars and sanguinary revolutions . 
Today , two powerful leaders - Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping - are demonstrating just how farfetched this view was . 
The predominant Western view was exemplified in Francis Fukuyama &apos;s 1992 book The End of History and the Last Man , which presumed that Western liberal democracy was the endpoint of humanity &apos;s sociocultural evolution . 
In other words , Christian eschatology was transformed into a secular historical postulate . 
That transformation was not new . 
Hegel and Marx embraced it . 
In 1842 , the historian Thomas Arnold stated , with typical Victorian complacency , that Queen Victoria &apos;s reign contained &quot; clear indications of the fullness of time . &quot; 
All of these historical prophets - whether heralding the realization of the Absolute Idea or the dictatorship of the proletariat - proved to be miserably wrong . 
Not long after the West &apos;s Cold War victory , the rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the return of national tribalism , even in the heart of &quot; post-historical &quot; Europe , challenged the concept of &quot; the end of history . &quot; 
The Balkan wars of the 1990 &quot; s , America &apos;s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the bloody Arab revolts , and the exposure of Western capitalism &apos;s ethical and systemic flaws in the global economic crisis undercut the idea further . 
But perhaps the most salient reminders that history is still very much alive come from China and Russia . 
After all , neither China &apos;s one-party state-capitalist system nor Russia &apos;s plutocratic political economy is particularly liberal , and neither country is especially averse to asserting its ( self-identified ) rights by military means . 
For China , this means &quot; defending &quot; its territorial claims in the East and South China Seas with an increasingly assertive foreign policy , conspicuously backed by growing military muscle . 
This behavior is amplifying long-festering regional tensions , while fueling competition between China and the United States / Japan alliance - a situation that recalls the pre-World War I struggle for maritime dominance between the United Kingdom and Germany . 
For its part , Russia has ruthlessly strived to recover its lost continental empire , be it through the brutal repression of Chechnya , the 2008 war in Georgia , or the current assault on Ukraine . 
In fact , Russia &apos;s recent actions in Crimea share many disturbing features with Adolf Hitler &apos;s 1938 seizure of Czechoslovakia &apos;s German-speaking Sudetenland - an important catalyst of World War II . 
The fact is that Putin &apos;s actions are not just about Crimea , or even about Ukraine . 
Just as Hitler was driven by the desire to reverse the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles , which ended WWI , Putin is focused on reversing the Soviet Union &apos;s dismemberment , which he has called &quot; the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the twentieth century . &quot; 
Putin is thus challenging one of America &apos;s greatest foreign-policy achievements : the end of the division of Europe and the establishment of free countries that could be drawn into the Western sphere of influence . 
And , unlike US President Barack Obama in Syria and Iran , Putin respects his own red lines : the former Soviet republics are not for the West to grab , and NATO will not be allowed to expand eastward . 
Moreover , Putin has made ethnic nationalism a defining element of his foreign policy , using Crimea &apos;s Russian-speaking majority to justify his adventure there . 
Likewise , ethnic nationalism drove Hitler &apos;s assault on the European order : the Sudetenland was mostly German , and the Austrian Anschluss was aimed at merging the two vital parts of the German nation . 
In his controversial 1961 study of WWII &apos;s origins , the historian A.J.P. Taylor vindicated Hitler &apos;s decision to take over the small successor states that were created at Versailles to check Germany &apos;s power - a strategy by the victors that Taylor called &quot; an open invitation for German expansionism . &quot; 
The same could presumably be said today of Russia &apos;s fatal attraction to the former Soviet republics . 
Of course , no one wants a new European war . 
But Putin &apos;s provocations and the legacy of Obama &apos;s foreign-policy failures could spur him to cut his political losses by taking unexpected action . 
After all , Obama &apos;s entire foreign-policy agenda - a nuclear deal with Iran , an Israel-Palestine peace agreement , reconciliation with estranged allies in the Middle East , and America &apos;s strategic pivot toward Asia - now hinges on his capacity to tame Putin . 
China &apos;s role is complicating the situation further . 
By acquiescing in Russia &apos;s actions in Crimea , Xi is joining Putin in challenging the world order that emerged from America &apos;s Cold War victory . 
In doing so , China has allowed power calculations to outweigh its own long-held principles , particularly non-interference in other countries &quot; internal affairs - a change that its leaders would defend by asserting that the US has repeatedly demonstrated that power ultimately determines principles . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel - whose East German upbringing should have given her especially acute insight into Putin &apos;s authoritarian mindset - has described the Russian leader as detached from reality , guided by nineteenth-century Machtpolitik . 
But it is Europe that has been living in a fantasy : a &quot; post-historical &quot; world where military power does not matter , subsidies can tame nationalist forces , and leaders are law-abiding , well-mannered gentlemen and women . 
Europeans truly believed that the Great Game between Russia and the West was settled in 1991 . 
Putin &apos;s message is that the last quarter-century was merely an intermission .
