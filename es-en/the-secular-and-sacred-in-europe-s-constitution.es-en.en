The Secular and Sacred in Europe \ u0027s Constitution 
One controversy surrounding the draft constitution for the European Union is whether or not to include an explicit reference to Europe &apos;s Christian heritage in its preamble . 
Silvio Ferrari , a noted scholar of Church ‑ State relations , dissects the issues . 
Europe &apos;s churches may be empty , but religion still incites heated debate , this time about its place in Europe &apos;s constitution . 
Some people demand that the constitution include some explicit reference to Europe &apos;s Christian heritage . 
Others want Europe to affirm its secular nature . 
What role should the secular and the sacred play in the European Union &apos;s fundamental law ? 
Unsurprisingly , religious freedom is given prominence in the draft constitution . 
Every European citizen has the right to practice the religion of his or her choice , to adopt another religion , or to practice no religion . 
Underlying this notion is the paramount position of individual conscience , which carries with it the right of every person to make his or her own decisions on religious matters , without that choice resulting in negative legal consequences . 
Whether Catholic , Protestant , or Orthodox , believer or atheist , civil and political rights must be equally apportioned regardless of a citizen &apos;s choice of religion or conscience . 
The second guiding principle concerns the autonomy of religious communities . 
The EU recognizes the &quot; identity and specific contribution &quot; of churches to European life . 
That language is , of course , a little vague , but it means that religious communities have characteristics that distinguish them from other associations and institutions ‑ ‑ and that Europe is prepared to respect these distinctions . 
Article 37 of the draft constitution establishes that a &quot; regular dialogue &quot; will be maintained between the Union and Europe &apos;s religious communities ( as well as philosophical and non ‑ confessional organizations ) . 
Separation of church and state does not mean mutual ignorance . 
The common good benefits more from open , transparent dialogue than by turning a deaf ear to religion ‑ ‑ that is , provided that the borders between religion and politics are clearly defined . 
The state &apos;s laicité ‑ ‑ fundamental in most European countries ‑ ‑ does not require isolating churches in political ghettoes . 
Finally , the EU undertakes to respect and not prejudice &quot; the status under national law of churches and religious associations or communities in the Member States . &quot; 
In other words , the boundaries of religious autonomy and cooperation with churches are matters that should primarily be framed in law by the EU &apos;s members . 
This means that the EU will not interfere with the national systems of church ‑ state relations that now exist , and will refrain from imposing a common model of church ‑ state relations . 
Poland and Italy can maintain their concordats with the Catholic Church , France will not be compelled to abandon its century ‑ long separation of church and state , and Queen Elizabeth II can continue to head the Church of England . 
Defining the church ‑ state system and its principal features is a right of the citizens of each EU member state . 
In essence , Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 37 of the draft Constitution reflect characteristics that are largely part of a common European heritage : religious liberty , autonomy of religious communities , church ‑ state cooperation , and respect for the specific differences in various member states . 
Of course , improvements are possible . 
Equal treatment of religious communities is not mentioned in the text prepared by the European Convention . 
Although granting equal treatment is primarily a task of EU states , omitting this principle from the Constitution endangers not only the principle of equality , but that of religious liberty as well . 
If there is no equality , religious liberty is at risk . 
Moreover , the nature of church ‑ state cooperation could , perhaps , be defined more explicitly by drawing clear distinctions between what constitutes the spiritual and the secular . 
Regular dialogue with religious communities , though a good thing , should not be extended to purely secular areas . 
It is here that efforts to include a reference to Europe &apos;s Judeo ‑ Christian heritage in the preamble of the Constitution must be considered dispassionately . 
Of course , European civilization arises from a synthesis of religious and humanistic values . 
The Judeo ‑ Christian tradition , the legacies of Greece and Rome , and the Enlightenment are all at the root of the way many Europeans regard their lives , although a long process of secularization has made it more difficult to discern this relationship . 
But mentioning a specific religious tradition in Europe &apos;s Constitution is dubious . 
It would be largely symbolic and , although symbols are important and help to foster unity , they are dangerous when they exclude and divide . 
A considerable part of Europe &apos;s Muslim community would certainly feel marginalized if such a reference were included in the future European Constitution , which will also be their Constitution . 
This would be a bonanza for Muslim fundamentalists , and could be exploited by all who want to prevent the development of a moderate , modern European Islam .
