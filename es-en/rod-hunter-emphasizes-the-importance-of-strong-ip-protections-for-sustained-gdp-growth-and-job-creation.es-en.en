Intellectual Property and Economic Development 
WASHINGTON , DC - In his recent State of the Union address , US President Barack Obama reiterated his ambition to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a proposed trade agreement among the US and 11 Pacific countries . 
Meanwhile , the European Union and China are pressing to close their own deals in Asia and elsewhere . 
If these proliferating trade pacts are to spur virtuous cycles of growth for developing countries , they must not only reduce trade barriers ; they must also build the institutional framework of a modern economy , including robust intellectual property ( IP ) rights . 
Some activists and government officials get the relationship between strong IP protection and economic growth backwards , claiming that IP rights are an obstacle to development , and thus should not be enforced until after countries achieve high-income status . 
This attitude is particularly prevalent in India , which recently put trade negotiations with the EU on hold , and it was central to the failure of the Doha Round of global trade talks . 
As Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma put it , &quot; inherent flexibilities must be provided to developing countries . &quot; 
But the bottom line is that the ideas protected by IP rights are the dynamo of growth for developed and developing countries alike . 
Instead of diluting IP rights , developing countries like India should recognize that strengthening IP protection is a prerequisite for attracting the foreign investment that they need to help their economies grow , create jobs , and improve their citizens &quot; capacity to consume . 
Today , IP accounts for much of the value at large companies . 
One study found that in 2009 , across a variety of industries in the US , intellectual capital - patents , copyrights , databases , brands , and organizational knowledge - held a 44 % share of firms &quot; overall market value . 
Such companies have little desire to put their IP at risk of erosion or outright theft ; they want to do business where they know that their IP is safe . 
Developing countries have a lot to gain from attracting multinational firms . 
Such companies bring technologically advanced imports and new management techniques that foster growth in domestic firms , while spurring industrial modernization . 
They also spawn new local companies that serve as suppliers , thereby boosting employment , augmenting workers &quot; skills , improving productivity , and increasing government revenue . 
Currently , India attracts a mere 2.7 % of global spending on research and development ; 
China , with its stronger IP rights , attracts close to 18 % ; and the US brings in 31 % . 
United Nations data show that India &apos;s stock of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) was equivalent to just 11.8 % of its GDP from 2010 to 2012 - far lower than the developing-economy average of roughly 30 % . 
According to a new study by the economists Robert Shapiro and Aparna Mathur , if India achieved Chinese levels of IP protection , its annual FDI inflows would increase by 33 % annually . 
In the pharmaceutical sector - which is particularly vulnerable to IP infringement - a stronger IP regime could increase FDI inflows from $ 1.5 billion this year to $ 8.3 billion in 2020 , with pharmaceutical R &amp; D doubling to $ 1.3 billion over the same period . 
The increased FDI would create 18,000 new jobs in the pharmaceutical industry . 
If India could transform its IP regime to resemble the US system , which is more robust than China &apos;s , the benefits would be even greater . 
Inward FDI could increase by as much as 83 % annually by 2020 ; in the pharmaceutical industry alone , FDI could reach as much as $ 77 billion , with R &amp; D rising to $ 4.2 billion and 44,000 new jobs being created . 
The Indian government &apos;s ongoing assault on pharmaceutical IP makes these findings even more significant . 
Over the last two years , India has invalidated or otherwise attacked patents on 15 drugs produced by international firms in order to make way for local champions , claiming that exclusivity enables companies to charge high prices that harm consumers . 
Allowing local producers to copy patented medicines , officials assert , will bring down prices and expand access . 
But drug patents and prices are not the main - or even a major - obstacle to patients &quot; access to medical care in India . 
The bigger issue , as the IMS consultancy found last year , is the shortage of doctors , clinics , and hospitals , especially in rural areas . 
Even the public clinics and hospitals that do exist are often rendered useless by high rates of absenteeism by doctors . 
Medicine , however affordable , is of no value if no one is available to prescribe or administer it . 
Furthermore , Indians lack access to insurance programs , particularly for outpatient care . 
This , coupled with the lack of a public safety net , makes health problems a leading source of economic hardship , even for middle-class families . 
Far from improving citizens &quot; access to health care , weak IP protections are exacerbating India &apos;s formidable health-care challenges . 
It is time for India &apos;s leaders to recognize the positive role that IP can play in fostering growth and improving citizens &quot; wellbeing . 
It is equally important for trade negotiators worldwide to reject the notion that IP protection is a luxury that only rich countries can afford . 
The reality is that IP protection is an economic engine that developing-country citizens should not have to forego .
