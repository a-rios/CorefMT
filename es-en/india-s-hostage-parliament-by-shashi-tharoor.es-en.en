India &apos;s Hostage Parliament 
NEW DELHI - The ongoing disruption of the &quot; monsoon session &quot; of the Indian parliament has showcased both the resilience of India &apos;s democracy and the irresponsibility with which its custodians treat it . 
Demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the allegedly improper allocation of coal-mining blocks to private companies , the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has stalled parliament &apos;s work for three of the session &apos;s four weeks . 
The repeated paralysis of parliament by slogan-shouting BJP members - violating every canon of legislative propriety and prompting the hapless speaker to adjourn each day &apos;s meeting - has caused legislative business to grind to a halt . 
The code of conduct that is imparted to all newly-elected MPs - including injunctions against speaking out of turn , shouting slogans , waving placards , and marching into the well of the house - has been completely ignored . 
Equally striking is the impunity with which lawmakers flout the rules . 
Successive speakers have pleaded helplessness in the face of such determined obstructionism by the principal opposition party . 
India &apos;s parliamentary system is embedded in its British colonial history . 
Like the American revolutionaries of two centuries ago , Indian nationalists fought for &quot; the rights of Englishmen , &quot; which they thought the replication of the Houses of Parliament would both epitomize and guarantee . 
Former Prime Minister Clement Attlee , a member of a British constitutional commission , recalled that when he suggested the United States &quot; presidential system as a model to Indian leaders , &quot; they rejected it with great emphasis . 
I had the feeling that they thought I was offering them margarine instead of butter . &quot; 
Many of India &apos;s veteran parliamentarians - several of whom had been educated in England and regarded British parliamentary traditions with admiration - reveled in their adherence to British convention and complimented themselves on the authenticity of their ways . 
Indian MPs still thump their desks in approbation , rather than applauding by clapping their hands . 
When bills are put to a vote , an affirmative call is still &quot; aye , &quot; rather than &quot; yes . &quot; 
Even the Communists embraced the system with great delight . 
An Anglophile Marxist MP of yesteryear , Hiren Mukherjee , used to assert proudly that British Prime Minister Anthony Eden had felt more at home during Question Hour in India &apos;s parliament than he had in Australia &apos;s . 
But six decades of independence have wrought significant change , as exposure to British practices has faded and India &apos;s natural boisterousness reasserted itself . 
Some of the state assemblies in India &apos;s federal system have already witnessed scenes of unruly legislators fighting , overturning furniture , ripping out microphones , and flinging slippers . 
While things have not yet degenerated that far in the national legislature , the practice of disrupting the house has become an established substitute for parliamentary procedure . 
In 2010 , an entire parliamentary session was lost when the BJP held it hostage to the party &apos;s demand that government establish an investigative committee to inquire into an alleged act of corruption . 
This time , mercifully , at least one week &apos;s worth of business could be conducted before the troublemaking began . 
There was a time when parliamentary misbehavior was dealt with firmly . 
I , and many of my generation , recall the photograph of the burly Socialist MP , Raj Narain , a former wrestler , being carried out of the house by four attendants for shouting out of turn and disobeying the speaker &apos;s orders to return to his seat . 
But , over the years , standards have been allowed to slide , with adjournments being preferred over expulsions . 
Last year , five MPs in the Rajya Sabha ( the upper house ) were suspended for charging the presiding officer &apos;s desk , wrenching his microphone , and tearing up his papers . 
But , after a few months and some muted apologies , they were quietly reinstated . 
Perhaps this makes sense , reflecting a desire to allow the opposition its space in a system where party-line voting determines most outcomes , but it does little to enhance the parliament &apos;s prestige . 
Opposition parties , recognizing that the outcome of most votes is a foregone conclusion , treat parliament not as a solemn deliberative body , but as a theater to demonstrate their power to disrupt . 
The well of the House - supposedly sacrosanct - becomes a stage for opposition MPs to crowd and jostle , waving placards and chanting slogans until the speaker , after several futile attempts to restore order , adjourns in despair . 
The result is that the vast majority of the public has lost respect for the &quot; temple of democracy , &quot; as the parliament is known . 
The daily adjournments have also taken place on many occasions in the presence of bemused visiting members of other countries &quot; legislatures , which does India &apos;s international reputation little good . 
Pluralist democracy is India &apos;s greatest strength , but its current manner of operation is the source of its major weaknesses . 
The disrepute into which the political process has fallen , and the widespread cynicism about the motives of India &apos;s politicians , can be traced directly to the flawed workings of the parliamentary system . 
India &apos;s many challenges require political arrangements that permit leaders to concentrate on governance and take decisive action , whereas its parliamentary system increasingly promotes drift , indecision , and a narrow focus on survival in power . 
And now the cavalier attitude reflected in the opposition &apos;s frequent disruption of the parliament risks discrediting parliamentary democracy itself . 
That is one thing India cannot afford . 
But its politicians must recognize that for themselves .
