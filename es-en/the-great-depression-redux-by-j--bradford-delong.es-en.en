Let it Bleed ? 
BERKELEY - In the 12 years of the Great Depression - between the stock-market crash of 1929 and America &apos;s mobilization for World War II - production in the United States averaged roughly 15 % below the pre-depression trend , implying a total output shortfall equal to 1.8 years of GDP . 
Today , even if US production returns to its stable-inflation output potential by 2017 - a huge &quot; if &quot; - the US will have incurred an output shortfall equivalent to 60 % of a year &apos;s GDP . 
In fact , the losses from what I have been calling the &quot; Lesser Depression &quot; will almost certainly not be over in 2017 . 
There is no moral equivalent of war on the horizon to pull the US into a mighty boom and erase the shadow cast by the downturn ; and when I take present values and project the US economy &apos;s lower-trend growth into the future , I cannot reckon the present value of the additional loss at less than a further 100 % of a year &apos;s output today - for a total cost of 1.6 years of GDP . 
The damage is thus almost equal to that of the Great Depression - and equally painful , even though America &apos;s real GDP today is 12 times higher than it was in 1929 . 
When I talk to my friends in the Obama administration , they defend themselves and the long-term macroeconomic outcome in the US by pointing out that the rest of the developed world is doing far worse . 
They are correct . 
Europe wishes desperately that it had America &apos;s problems . 
Nevertheless , my conclusion is that I should stop calling the current episode the Lesser Depression . 
Yes , its shape is different from that of the Great Depression ; but , so far at least , there is no reason to rank it any lower in the hierarchy of macroeconomic disasters . 
The US bond market agrees with me . 
Since 1975 , the nominal annual premium on the 30-year Treasury bill has averaged 2.2 % : in other words , over its lifespan , the 30-year nominal T-bill yields are 2.2 percentage points more than the expected average of future short-term nominal T-bill rates . 
The current 30-year T-bill yields 3.2 % annually , which means that , unless the marginal bond buyer today is unusually averse to holding 30-year Treasuries , she anticipates that short-term nominal T-bill rates will average 1 % per year over the next generation . 
The US Federal Reserve keeps the short-term nominal T-bill rate near 1 % only when the economy is depressed , capacity is slack , labor is idle , and the principal risk is deflation rather than upward pressure on prices . 
Since WWII , the US unemployment rate has averaged 8 % when the short-term nominal T-bill rate is 2 % or lower . 
That is the future that the bond market sees for America : a slack and depressed economy , if not for the next generation , at least for most of it . 
Barring a wholesale revolution in thinking and personnel at the Fed and in the US Congress , activist policies will not rescue America . 
Once upon a time , policymakers understood that the government should tweak asset supplies to ensure sufficient supplies of liquid assets , safe assets , and savings vehicles . 
That way , the economy as a whole would not come under pressure to deleverage and thus push production below potential output . 
But this basic principle of macroeconomic management has simply gone out the window . 
A majority of the Fed &apos;s governors believes that aggressive monetary expansion has reached , if not exceeded , the bounds of prudence . 
A majority in the US Congress is taking its cues from &quot; Theodoric of York , Medieval Barber &quot; ( a staple of the US comedy show Saturday Night Live in the 1970 &quot; s ) . 
It believes that what America &apos;s infirm economy needs is another good bleeding in the form of more rigorous austerity . 
As Oscar Wilde &apos;s Lady Bracknell says in The Importance of Being Earnest : &quot; To lose one parent ... may be regarded as a misfortune . 
To lose both looks like carelessness . &quot; 
It was America &apos;s misfortune to undergo one disaster of the Great Depression &apos;s scale ; to undergo two does indeed look like carelessness . 
What , then , should economists who seek to improve the world do , if we can no longer realistically expect to nudge policy in the right direction ? 
At a similar point in the Great Depression , John Maynard Keynes turned away from focusing on influencing policy . 
Instead , he attempted to reconstruct macroeconomic thought by writing his General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , so that the next time a crisis erupted , economists would think about the economy in a different and more productive way than they had between 1929 and 1933 . 
This week , the economist and frequent US official Lawrence Summers , in a lecture at the London School of Economics , called for another reconstruction of macroeconomic thought - and of the institutions and orientation of central banking . 
That is a Keynesian ambition , but can it be accomplished ? 
A latter-day Keynes is nowhere to be found , and no Bretton Woods-style global consensus to reform central banking is on the horizon .
