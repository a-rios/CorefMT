The Chinese Economy &apos;s Secret Recipe 
BEIJING - China &apos;s GDP growth this year may approach 10 % . 
While some countries are still dealing with economic crisis or its aftermath , China &apos;s challenge is - once again - how to manage a boom . 
Thanks to decisive policy moves to pre-empt a housing bubble , the real-estate market has stabilized , and further corrections are expected soon . 
This is good news for China &apos;s economy , but disappointing , perhaps , to those who assumed that the government would allow the bubble to grow bigger and bigger , eventually precipitating a crash . 
Whether or not the housing correction will hit overall growth depends on how one defines &quot; hit . &quot; 
Lower asset prices may slow total investment growth and GDP , but if the slowdown is ( supposedly ) from 11 % to 9 % , China will avoid economic over-heating yet still enjoy sustainable high growth . 
Indeed , for China , the current annualized growth rate of 37 % in housing investment is very negative . 
Ideally , it would slow to , say , 27 % this year ! 
China has sustained rapid economic growth for 30 years without significant fluctuations or interruption - so far . 
Excluding the 1989-1990 slowdown that followed the Tiananmen crisis , average annual growth over this period was 9.45 % , with a peak of 14.2 % in 1994 and 2007 , and a nadir of 7.6 % in 1999 . 
While most major economies in their early stages of growth suffered crises , China &apos;s story seems abnormal ( or accidental ) , and has elicited periodic predictions of an &quot; upcoming crash . &quot; 
All such predictions have proved wrong , but the longer the story lasts , the more people forecast a bad end . 
For me , there is nothing more abnormal about China &apos;s unbroken pattern of growth than effective macroeconomic intervention in boom times . 
To be sure , both economic development and institutional reforms may cause instability . 
Indeed , the type of central government inherited from the old planned economy , with its over-stretched growth plans , causes fluctuations , and contributed significantly to instability in the early 1980 &quot; s . 
But the central government must be responsible for inflation in times of overheating , lest a bursting bubble fuel unemployment . 
Local governments and state-owned enterprises do not necessarily have those concerns . 
They want high GDP growth , without worrying much about the macroeconomic consequences . 
They want to borrow as much as possible to finance ambitious investment projects , without worrying much about either repayment or inflation . 
Indeed , the main cause of overheating in the early 1990 &quot; s was over-borrowing by local governments . 
Inflation soared to 21 % in 1994 - its highest level over the past 30 years - and a great deal of local debt ended up as non-performing loans , which amounted to 40 % of total credits in the state banking sector in the mid-1990 &quot; s . 
This source of vulnerability has become less important , owing to tight restrictions imposed since the 1990 &quot; s on local governments &quot; borrowing capacity . 
Now , however , the so-called &quot; animal spirits &quot; of China &apos;s first generation of entrepreneurs have become another source of overheating risk . 
The economy has been booming , income has been rising , and markets have been expanding : all this creates high potential for enterprises to grow ; all want to seize new opportunities , and every investor want to get rich fast . 
They have been successful and , so far , have not experienced bad times . 
So they invest and speculate fiercely without much consideration of risk . 
The relatively high inflation of the early 1990 &quot; s was a warning to central government policymakers about the macroeconomic risks posed by fast growth . 
The bubble bursts in Japan &apos;s economy in the early 1990 &quot; s , and the Southeast Asian economies later in the decade , provided a neighborly lesson to stop believing that bubbles never burst . 
Since then , the central government &apos;s policy stance has been to put brakes on the economy whenever there is a tendency toward over-heating . 
Stringent measures were implemented in the early 1990 &quot; s to reduce the money supply and stop over-investment , thereby heading off hyperinflation . 
In the recent cycle , the authorities began cooling down the economy as early as 2004 , when China had just emerged from the downturn caused by the SARS scare in 2003 . 
In late 2007 , when GDP growth hit 13 % , the government adopted more restrictive anti-bubble policies in industries ( steel , for example ) and asset markets ( real estate ) , which set the stage for an early correction . 
Economic theory holds that all crises are caused by bubbles or over-heating , so if you can manage to prevent bubbles , you can prevent crises . 
The most important thing for &quot; ironing out cycles &quot; is not the stimulus policy implemented after a crash has already occurred , but to be proactive in boom times and stop bubbles in their early stages . 
I am not quite sure whether all Chinese policymakers are good students of modern economics . 
But it seems that what they have been doing in practice happened to be better than what their counterparts in some other countries were doing - a lot on &quot; de-regulation , &quot; but too little on cooling things down when the economy was booming and bubbles were forming . 
The problem for the world economy is that everybody remembered Keynes &apos;s lesson about the need for countercyclical policies only when the crisis erupted , after demanding to be left alone - with no symmetric policy intervention - during the preceding boom . 
But managing the boom is more important , because it addresses what causes crises in the first place . 
In a sense , what China has been doing seems to me to be the creation of a true &quot; Keynesian world &quot; : more private business and freer price competition at the micro level , and active countercyclical policy intervention at the macro level . 
There may be other factors that could slow down or interrupt China &apos;s growth . 
I only hope that policymakers &quot; vigilance will prevail ( and be improved upon ) , enabling China &apos;s high-growth story to continue for another 10 , 20 , or 30 years .
