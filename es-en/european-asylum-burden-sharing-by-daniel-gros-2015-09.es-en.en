Europe Under Siege ? 
BRUSSELS - Many Europeans feel like their countries are under assault , as huge numbers of migrants flow across their borders . 
Whether they are being exposed to refugees firsthand , or just seeing images of them splashed across newspaper pages , Europeans are well aware of the vast numbers of desperate people trying to enter European Union territory by any means possible . 
But this awareness has yet to translate into a unified response . 
Tensions among member states seem to be rising , perhaps because the problem differs so greatly across countries . 
On a per capita basis , Sweden receives 15 times more asylum applications than the United Kingdom , where official policy toward refugees remains the most hostile . 
Germany has now become the main destination overall , receiving nearly 40 % of the EU total ; even on a per capita basis , this is several times more than the EU average . 
Of course , there are clear rules about how responsibility for refugees is delineated : according to the so-called Dublin Regulation , the first EU member state into which a refugee crosses is responsible for that person &apos;s asylum application . 
But this is clearly problematic , as it puts the entire burden of refugees on the EU &apos;s frontier countries . 
Though this may not have been a huge problem in the 1990s , when EU countries received , in all , only 300,000 asylum applications annually , it cannot work in a year when the total is expected to be triple that number . 
Smaller border countries like Hungary and Greece simply do not have the capacity to register and house hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers . 
And larger countries like Italy have an incentive to overlook the large numbers of refugees landing on their shores , knowing that , if nothing is done , those refugees will likely head elsewhere ( mainly to northern Europe ) . 
Germany , recognizing that the Dublin system is untenable , has now decided to process all asylum applications from Syrians , regardless of where they crossed into the EU . 
The decision was likely driven , at least partly , by how difficult it is , given the EU &apos;s porous internal borders , to determine where a refugee first entered . 
A 2013 ruling by the European Court of Justice that Germany could not return an Iranian refugee to Greece ( where the applicant was found &quot; to face a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment &quot; ) probably heightened Germany &apos;s sense of responsibility on this issue . 
Germany is the largest EU member country in terms of population and GDP ; so , to some extent , it does make sense for it to take the lead . 
But Germany still accounts for less than one-fifth of the EU &apos;s population , and less than one-quarter of its economy . 
In other words , not even Germany can handle all of Europe &apos;s refugees today . 
A few months ago , the European Commission tried its hand at resolving this problem with a courageous proposal to distribute refugees across member states according to a simple equation that accounts for population and GDP . 
But the plan was rejected , with member states - particularly those with the fewest refugees - claiming that it represented an undue interference in domestic affairs . 
This has put the EU in its usual quandary : everybody recognizes that there is a problem , but a solution requires unanimity , which cannot be achieved , because each country defends only its own interests . 
The only way forward is to leave out the countries that are most averse to accepting immigrants , at least temporarily , and create a solution involving just those that are willing to share the burden . 
This may not seem &quot; fair , &quot; but , with more refugees landing on Europe &apos;s borders every day , EU leaders cannot afford to delay action . 
But there is another dimension to the crisis that makes addressing it all the more complicated . 
The migrants are not all from conflict areas like Syria , and thus do not , according to international law , have a &quot; right to asylum . &quot; 
There are also plenty of economic migrants from , say , the poorer parts of the Balkans , hoping to escape poverty at home - and willing to misuse the asylum system in the process . 
Lodging an application , even one without any chance of being accepted , is appealing , because until it is rejected , the applicant receives basic housing , social services ( including health care ) , and pocket money in an amount that may well exceed wages in his or her home country . 
Spending a few months in northern Europe while an asylum application is processed is far more attractive than going home to a job that pays a barely livable wage , or to no job at all . 
As the number of asylum-seekers increases , so does the time it takes to process their applications , making the system all the more tempting for economic migrants . 
And , indeed , close to half of all asylum-seekers in Germany now come from safe countries , like Serbia , Albania , or Macedonia . 
As Europe &apos;s populists use such cases of &quot; welfare tourism &quot; to sow fear and anger among the European public , reaching an agreement to accommodate actual refugees becomes increasingly difficult . 
Against this background , the EU needs to take action on two fronts . 
First , member countries must urgently boost their capacity to deal with asylum applications , so that they can quickly identify those who deserve protection . 
Second , the EU needs to improve burden sharing - ideally among all countries , but perhaps among a smaller group at first - in providing shelter for those who gain asylum . 
International law - and basic morality - demands nothing less .
