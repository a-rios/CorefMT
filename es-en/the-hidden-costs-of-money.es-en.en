The Hidden Costs of Money 
PRINCETON - When people say that &quot; Money is the root of all evil , &quot; they usually don &apos;t mean that money itself is the root of evil . 
Like Saint Paul , from whom the quote comes , they have in mind the love of money . 
Could money itself , whether we are greedy for it or not , be a problem ? 
Karl Marx thought so . 
In The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 , a youthful work that remained unpublished and largely unknown until the mid-twentieth century , Marx describes money as &quot; the universal agent of separation , &quot; because it transforms human characteristics into something else . 
A man may be ugly , Marx wrote , but if he has money , he can buy for himself &quot; the most beautiful of women . &quot; 
Without money , presumably , some more positive human qualities would be needed . 
Money alienates us , Marx thought , from our true human nature and from our fellow human beings . 
Marx &apos;s reputation sank once it became evident that he was wrong to predict that a workers &quot; revolution would usher in a new era with a better life for everyone . 
So if we had only his word for the alienating effects of money , we might feel free to dismiss it as an element of a misguided ideology . 
But research by Kathleen Vohs , Nicole Mead , and Miranda Goode , reported in Science in 2006 , suggests that on this point , at least , Marx was onto something . 
In a series of experiments , Vohs and her colleagues found ways to get people to think about money without explicitly telling them to do so . 
They gave some people tasks that involved unscrambling phrases about money . 
With others , they left piles of Monopoly money nearby . 
Another group saw a screensaver with various denominations of money . 
Other people , randomly selected , unscrambled phrases that were not about money , did not see Monopoly money , and saw different screensavers . 
In each case , those who had been led to think about money - let &apos;s call them &quot; the money group &quot; - behaved differently from those who had not . 
When given a difficult task and told that help was available , people in the money group took longer to ask for help . 
When asked for help , people in the money group spent less time helping . 
When told to move their chair so that they could talk with someone else , people in the money group left a greater distance between chairs . 
When asked to choose a leisure activity , people in the money group were more likely to choose an activity that could be enjoyed alone , rather than one that involved others . 
Finally , when people in the money group were invited to donate some of the money they had been paid for participation in the experiment , they gave less than those who had not been induced to think about money . 
Trivial reminders of money made a surprisingly large difference . 
For example , where the control group would offer to spend an average of 42 minutes helping someone with a task , those primed to think about money offered only 25 minutes . 
Similarly , when someone pretending to be another participant in the experiment asked for help , the money group spent only half as much time helping her . 
When asked to make a donation from their earnings , the money group gave just a little over half as much as the control group . 
Why does money makes us less willing to seek or give help , or even to sit close to others ? 
Vohs and her colleagues suggest that as societies began to use money , the necessity of relying on family and friends diminished , and people were able to become more self-sufficient . 
&quot; In this way , &quot; they conclude , &quot; money enhanced individualism but diminished communal motivations , an effect that is still apparent in people &apos;s responses today . &quot; 
That &apos;s not much of an explanation of why being reminded of money should make so much difference to how we behave , given that we all use money everyday . 
There seems to be something going on here that we still don &apos;t fully understand . 
I am not pleading for a return to the simpler days of barter or self-sufficiency . 
Money enables us to trade - and thus to benefit from each other &apos;s special skills and advantages . 
Without money , we would be immeasurably poorer , and not only in a financial sense . 
But now that we are aware of the isolating power that even the thought of money can have , we can no longer think of money &apos;s role as being entirely neutral . 
If , for example , a local parents &quot; organization wants to build a children &apos;s playground , should it ask its members to do the work on a voluntary basis , or should it launch a fundraising campaign so that an outside contractor can be employed ? 
Harvard economist Roland Fryer &apos;s proposal to pay poor students for doing well at school is another area where using money is open to question . 
If money were neutral , this would be just a question of whether the benefits of using money outweigh the financial costs . 
Often , they will - for example , if the parents lack the skills to build a good playground . 
But it would be a mistake to assume that allowing money to dominate every sphere of life comes without other costs that are difficult to express in financial terms .
