Humpty-Dumpty Iraq 
Iraq &apos;s draft constitution will probably be approved in the referendum to be held on October 15 . 
But whether it is ratified or not ultimately does not matter , as the constitution - and the whole constitution-making process - is totally out of touch with the realities of a country that no longer exists as a coherent body politic . 
The problem is not with the constitution , but with the conventional wisdom - almost an id√©e fixe - that Iraq is a viable modern nation-state , and that all it needs to make it work properly is the right political institutions . 
But this is a fallacy , and responsible leaders should begin to think of alternatives . 
The Iraqi state , established in the 1920 &quot; s by British imperialist planners ( with Winston Churchill in the lead ) , is a strange pastiche of three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire : Mosul in the north with a Kurdish majority , Baghdad in the center with a Sunni Arab majority , and Basra in the south with a Shia Arab majority . 
For their own political reasons , the British put the Sunni Arabs - never more than 25 % of the population - in control of the whole country , and even imported a Sunni Arab Hashemite prince to rule over their creation . 
Ever since , the country could be held together only by an iron fist : Iraq &apos;s history is replete with Shia , Kurdish , and even Christian Assyrian revolts , all put down in bloody fashion by the ruling Sunni minority . 
Throughout its history , modern Iraq has always been the most oppressive of the Arab countries . 
Saddam &apos;s rule was only the most brutal in a long line of Sunni regimes . 
It was this Sunni hegemony - and not merely that of Saddam &apos;s Ba &apos;athist regime - that was toppled by the United States . 
But , given Iraq &apos;s history and demography , the American attempt to refashion the country as a functioning democracy has foundered on three shoals : the Shia majority &apos;s empowerment , the Kurds &apos;s refusal to give up their hard-won de facto mini-state in the north , and the Sunnis &quot; violent campaign to undermine any system that they do not lead . 
In short , the draft constitution is an attempt to square a circle . 
The Sunni resistance - a guerilla and terrorist war that was well prepared in the last years of Saddam &apos;s rule - will continue to try to subvert any semblance of order representing the current majority Shia-Kurdish coalition . 
The Sunnis will go on with their murderous attacks on Shias , Kurds , and the US-led military coalition . 
They will probably boycott the constitutional referendum and all subsequent elections , just as they have boycotted the previous elections . 
After all , given the brutal logic of their long hegemony in Iraq , why should the Sunnis contemplate submitting to a process that is premised on their minority status , particularly when whole areas of the country are under the effective control of the Sunni insurgency ? 
Similarly , why should the Shias , for their part , submit to Sunni hegemony rather than building up their own political structure in the south , modeled on what the Kurds have already achieved in the north ? 
Let &apos;s be frank : Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia as it disintegrated in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
This should be acknowledged and ultimately welcomed , despite conventional diplomatic norms regarding the inviolability of the territorial integrity of existing states . 
Of course , such norms are helpful . 
But once a state disintegrates , as happened in Yugoslavia , no constitutional formulations can save it . 
Constitutions works only if all sides have an interest in operating within the proposed framework - and this obviously is not the case in Iraq . 
There is nothing sacrosanct in the continued existence of multi-ethnic and multi-religious states if their constitutive groups do not wish to live together . 
On the contrary , there are lessons to be learned from the demise of the Soviet Union , Yugoslavia , and even - perhaps especially - Czechoslovakia , which negotiated its break-up without violence . 
By contrast , the current Bosnia-Herzegovina is an example of another failed attempt to keep a decrepit multi-ethnic entity alive : it doesn &apos;t work , and the country is held together only by the almost dictatorial power of the international community &apos;s High Representative and the presence of foreign troops . 
It is time to face reality : the Kurdish region in the north is functioning in a reasonable way , and it has even been able to allay Turkey &apos;s fears that its existence will aggravate that country &apos;s own Kurdish problem . 
With the Shias building their polity in the south , the Sunni areas too should be allowed to go their own way . 
This may be more conducive to peace than trying to impose on them a hated occupation or an equally hated Shia hegemony . 
The emergence of three states - or highly autonomous regions - instead of a unified Iraq is happening anyway , constitution or no constitution . 
Nobody , it appears , can put Humpty-Dumpty Iraq together again . 
But it will require courage to acknowledge what is occurring before our eyes , rather than continue to grasp at the chimera of a consolidated Iraqi state . 
In fact , to acknowledge the obvious in Iraq is also to recognize that there are grounds for hope . 
As in the former Yugoslavia , the separate entities now emerging may stand a better chance of developing a semblance of representative and eventually democratic governance than if Iraq &apos;s warring communities are forced to live together in the prison house that the country has always been for most of its citizens .
