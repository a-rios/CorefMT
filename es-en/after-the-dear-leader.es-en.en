After the Dear Leader 
SEOUL - Korea is a unique country . 
The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 , and is now remembered only as history to most people around the world . 
The Korean Peninsula , however , remains divided along ideological lines , and the two Koreas co-exist as living remnants of the Cold War . 
A total of almost 1.5 million young soldiers from both North and South Korea face off against each across the heavily armed Demilitarized Zone . 
Events and structural forces , however , have affected and changed the nature of the North Korean system since 1991 . 
The sudden discontinuation of the supply of petroleum and natural resources from Russia in the early 1990 &quot; s , the failure of the centrally-planned economy , and the subsequent massive famine in the mid-1990 &quot; s left North Korea &apos;s leaders no alternative but to tolerate informal market activities . 
Nowadays , every North Korean seems to like money and know its value . 
The engagement policy pursued by the South Korean government in recent years also contributed to changes in North Koreans &quot; perceptions of the outside world and of their own abject economic situation . 
In these desperate circumstances , North Korea &apos;s leaders clung to their strategy of developing nuclear weapons as a last resort to defend the security of their regime . 
But , regardless of whether the nuclear issue is resolved , the spread of market forces in North Korea will continue to change every aspect of life there in the coming years . 
Nobody yet knows what the political consequences of these economic changes will be . 
So , even before the recent reports of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il &apos;s health problems , North Korea was already a country marked by growing uncertainty . 
Nevertheless , the reports about Kim &apos;s ill health hit like a rude wake-up call about the precarious nature of conditions in North Korea . 
The &quot; Dear Leader &apos;s &quot; declining health will add even more uncertainty and may cause international instability across East Asia . 
For example , Kim Il Sung groomed his son Kim Jong-il as his successor for about two decades before the younger Kim took power in 1994 . 
Kim Jong-il , however , has not yet even chosen his successor . 
Indeed , it is widely expected that a new system of collective leadership will emerge if Kim Jong-il is incapacitated . 
The problem is that North Korea has no experience with collective leadership . 
In the last six decades , all power has been concentrated in the hands of one person . 
One-man rule has been so completely embedded in North Korea &apos;s political culture and system that it is difficult to expect collective leadership to succeed . 
Thus , some type of power struggle , rather like what occurred in the Soviet Union following Stalin &apos;s death , may invariably follow a brief period of collective rule . 
The dilemma for the world is that major decisions will have to be made during this period of instability . 
Will the North &apos;s would-be leaders be able to manage the country &apos;s stock of nuclear weapons responsibly and safely without transferring a few of them abroad , much less respond to international pressure to dismantle them in a reasonable and flexible manner ? 
Over the past decade , Kim Jong-il has emphasized the importance of his military-first policy . 
But the problem with military rule is a tendency toward incomplete understanding of the implications of political decisions - a problem that will be aggravated further by collective leadership . 
Under a North Korean collective leadership dominated by the military , the power of the country &apos;s economic bureaucrats will be marginal , at best . 
In such a difficult domestic situation , North Korea &apos;s leaders may adopt more hostile policies to obtain economic aid from both South Korea and the United States . 
Recently , South Korea &apos;s government made it clear that it would continue to engage North Korea , but in a more principled way than had previous administrations . 
This reflects a hardening of South Korean public opinion , following North Korea &apos;s nuclear test in 2006 . 
As a result of this policy shift - and the recent killing of a South Korean tourist in North Korea &apos;s Kumgang Mountains - official dialogue between North and South has stopped for the past several months . 
International relations in northeast Asia will become more subtle and unstable as the Kim Jong-il era ends . 
After six turbulent but somewhat predictable decades , we may be entering into a new era of greater turbulence but less predictability on the Korean Peninsula .
