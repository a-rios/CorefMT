Wooing China &apos;s Princelings 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - China &apos;s &quot; princelings &quot; - the offspring of senior Chinese officials who benefit from lavish privileges in education , employment , and business - are coming under scrutiny as never before . 
Bo Xilai , the son of one of Mao &apos;s comrades and a supposed &quot; immortal &quot; of the revolution , was recently sentenced to life in prison after his conviction on charges of corruption and abuse of power . 
Outside China , princelings are feeling the heat as well . 
Not long ago , the United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it was investigating JPMorgan Chase &apos;s hiring of princelings in Hong Kong , who apparently delivered lucrative underwriting deals for the bank . 
While recent scandals have put China &apos;s princelings under a harsh media spotlight , they have been hot commodities for Western companies seeking to capitalize on their guanxi ( connections ) in order to secure multi-billion dollar transactions . 
The list of financial institutions that have engaged in such hiring practices reads like a who &apos;s who of investment banking . 
Of course , it is premature to conclude that JPMorgan violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by employing children of Chinese officials who oversaw companies that retained the bank to underwrite their stock offerings . 
Nonetheless , the case highlights a broader trend : the wooing of China &apos;s princelings by prestigious Western educational institutions and businesses for the purpose of advancing their parochial interests in the burgeoning Chinese market . 
The unseemly race to recruit princelings starts at the world &apos;s leading colleges and universities . 
Because China has no universities that rival the Ivy League or Oxford and Cambridge , senior Chinese officials prefer to send their children to these schools . 
Given the opacity surrounding admission to these highly selective institutions ( where the acceptance rate typically is as low as around 8 % ) , it is impossible to tell whether princelings get in on the basis of merit or family background . 
But it is notable that princelings are not found in the most prestigious doctoral programs , where professors , not administrators , make admissions decisions . 
Likewise , MIT and Caltech , where only the truly gifted survive , have a dearth of princelings . 
Indeed , the sheer number of princelings , including children of incumbent Chinese leaders , now attending Ivy League universities clearly points to the importance of family ties . 
President Xi Jinping &apos;s daughter , for example , studies at Harvard under an assumed name , and Bo Xilai &apos;s son has been a student at Oxford and Harvard &apos;s Kennedy School of Government ; he is now studying at Columbia Law School . 
Simply put , elite Western colleges and universities , having identified China as a top market for fund-raising and high-end network-building , regard the princelings as a valuable investment . 
Nurturing ties with China &apos;s political elite is good business , and the princelings can help open doors . 
But preferential treatment for princelings at elite universities ( and business schools ) has real social costs , because admission to these institutions is zero-sum . 
A place awarded to a less-qualified princeling is a place denied to a more qualified applicant . 
Worse still , this injustice is self-perpetuating . 
Western investment banks and multinationals can use princelings &quot; elite academic credentials to justify hiring them , even if the real reason is the hope that putting a princeling on the payroll will give the company a rainmaker in China . 
Defenders of this practice insist that princelings are well educated and highly qualified . 
Undoubtedly , some of them are ; but many are not . 
Apologists also claim that nepotism is universal , citing examples of children of American politicians and business leaders who have graduated from Ivy League universities and secured coveted private-sector jobs . 
But hiring Chinese princelings is not the moral equivalent of American-style nepotism . 
The political and social environments in which the two practices occur are completely different . 
In the US , nepotism is difficult to hide , and public scrutiny helps to check its most blatant manifestations . 
The democratic process , particularly the role played by a free press , constrains rent-seeking by children of government officials . 
In China , by contrast , pervasive corruption , the absence of a free press , and state capitalism mean that princelings &quot; conduct is unconstrained - and typically shrouded in secrecy . 
Chinese censors methodically suppress news coverage of princelings &quot; business dealings . 
Most important , as part of its strategy for regime survival , the Chinese Communist Party favors princelings for appointments in government and state-owned enterprises . 
Now , in the wake of Bo &apos;s fall from grace , and in light of the controversy over JPMorgan &apos;s hiring of Chinese princelings , Western academic and business leaders must ask themselves a tough question : Do they want to be complicit in helping the Party perpetuate its hereditary rule ?
