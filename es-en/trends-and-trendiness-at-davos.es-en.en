Trends and Trendiness at Davos 
The annual World Economic Forum is rightly perceived as a global &quot; barometer . &quot; 
But the superb sunshine in Davos these days cannot avoid the shadows of the financial crisis that have enveloped the world , casting an atmosphere of gloom and doom on this year &apos;s meeting . 
Today , more than ever , the Forum &apos;s proud motto , &quot; Committed to the improvement of the world , &quot; seems disconnected from reality . 
It is not confidence that dominates Davos 2008 , but rather a sense of impotence , if not bewilderment , at the world &apos;s growing complexity . 
In fact , Davos is less a barometer that helps us to understand the deep trends that are shaping the world than a mirror that reflects trendy ideas , worries , and perhaps gossip . 
From formal debates and informal schmoozing with fellow members of the Davos crowd , one gets a sense of who the American establishment favors to win the next presidential election ( Hillary Clinton ) , predictions for the upcoming referendum in Ireland on the European &quot; simplified &quot; treaty ( it will be very close ) , and French President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s international image ( not good ) . 
You do not need to go to Davos for this , but in the Swiss mountains these ideas acquire an aura of legitimacy - call it the &quot; I was told in Davos &quot; imprimatur - which explains why political and economic analysts and commentators keep coming back , despite the Forum &apos;s combination of pomposity and intellectual vacuity . 
The eminent people who pass through are given opportunities only for sound bites , developed thoughts . 
As for business leaders , despite the hefty fees they must pay to become members of the &quot; Davos Family , &quot; they , too , keep coming because for them the Forum ultimately represents a time- and money-saving investment . 
Where else in the world could they meet so many of their potential partners or customers , including heads of emerging states , in one place ? 
Of course , the danger of Davos lies in this concentrated commingling of the chattering classes and the real world of politics and business . 
Conformism flows naturally from these encounters and creates a world in which everybody tends to think alike , as if a truly global community could create a global way of thinking , even if positions on how to address the current financial crisis are varied . 
What is trendy at Davos this year is to view the crisis as reflecting two deep global trends - for example , the declining clout of the United States . 
After the war in Iraq and the Bush administration &apos;s slow reaction to Hurricane Katrina , America &apos;s subprime mortgage crisis is perceived by many as simply accelerating the irresistible rise of Asia and the shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world , even if the wider financial crisis will equally affect Asia &apos;s growth . 
For countries like China or India , the scaling down of growth from 8 % to 5 % is nearly the equivalent of a recession in the West . 
Yesterday , when America sneezed , the world caught a cold . 
Today , when America catches pneumonia , can Asia only sneeze ? 
The second trend underlined at Davos is the return of the state . 
In the latest issue of Foreign Affairs , Forum &apos;s founder and president , Klaus Schwab , asks &quot; How can business help save the world ? &quot; 
But , with the financial crisis hanging over Davos participants &quot; heads like the sword of Damocles , the question is becoming , &quot; Can states and international institutions save business ? &quot; 
The return of the state , even when it is the power of the European Commission to sanction Microsoft , is on everyone &apos;s lips . 
This trend , if it is confirmed by reality , could signify the end of what Davos stands for : an open , global , and transparent world . 
But is the world ready for a return to protectionist policies and nationalist reflexes ? 
Will today &apos;s freedom and transparency , having led to undesired results , result in a return to restrictions on movements of goods , people , and capital ? 
In Davos this year , great hopes have given way to great apprehensions . 
How can you pretend to be acting to change the world if you no longer understand it ?
