Capital Shrugged 
LOS ANGELES - Capitalism &apos;s greatest strength has been its resiliency - its ability to survive the throes and challenges of crises and business cycles to fuel innovation and economic growth . 
Today , however , more than four years into a credit crisis , a conspicuous enigma calls this legacy into question . 
Despite recent hopes of recovery in the US , including an inventory catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2011 , real US GDP growth has remained persistently below trend . 
Moreover , although seasonally adjusted January employment data have brought the unemployment rate down to 8.3 % ( while total jobs were actually lost in January ) , the more realistic rate of &quot; underemployment &quot; remains over 15 % and the labor-force participation rate is at a record 30-year low . 
And the US is clearly not alone in its malaise , with the eurozone fighting a far more urgent sovereign-debt crisis . 
So , why is this time different ? 
The answer lies in Ayn Rand &apos;s rhetorical invocation of despair in her 1957 epic Atlas Shrugged : &quot; Who is John Galt ? &quot; 
Simply put , when the state seizes the incentives and drivers of capital investment , owners of capital go on strike . 
Rand portrays innovative industrialists as akin to Atlas in Greek mythology , carrying on his back a dystopian world of growing and overbearing collectivist government . 
The hero , John Galt , calls for them all to shrug , to &quot; stop the motor of the world &quot; by withdrawing from their productive pursuits , rather than promoting a world in which , under the guise of egalitarianism , incentives have been usurped in order to protect the politically connected from economic failure . 
Today , Rand &apos;s fictional world has seemingly become a reality - endless bailouts and economic stimulus for the unproductive at the expense of the most productive , and calls for additional taxation on capital investment . 
The shrug of Rand &apos;s heroic entrepreneurs is to be found today within the tangled ciphers of corporate and government balance sheets . 
The US Federal Reserve has added more than $ 2 trillion to the base money supply since 2008 - an incredible and unprecedented number that is basically a gift to banks intended to cover their deep losses and spur lending and investment . 
Instead , as banks continue their enormous deleveraging , almost all of their new money remains at the Fed in the form of excess reserves . 
Corporations , moreover , are holding the largest amounts of cash , relative to assets and net worth , ever recorded . 
And yet , despite what pundits claim about strong balance sheets , firms &quot; debt levels , relative to assets and net worth , also remain near record-high levels . 
Hoarded cash is king . 
The velocity of money ( the frequency at which money is spent , or GDP relative to base money ) continues to plunge to historic lows . 
No wonder monetary policy has had so little impact . 
Capital , the engine of economic growth , sits idle - shrugging everywhere . 
Rand , perhaps better than any economic observer , underscored the central role of incentives in driving entrepreneurial innovation and risk-taking . 
Whittle away at incentives - and at the market &apos;s ability to communicate them through price signals - and you starve the growth engine of its fuel . 
Alas , central bankers , with their manipulation of interest rates and use of quantitative easing , patently neglect this fact . 
Interest rates are more than a mere economic input that determines levels of saving and investment . 
Rather , as the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises emphasized , they are a reflection of people &apos;s aggregate time preference - or desire for present versus future satisfaction - not a determinant of it . 
Interest rates thus incentivize and convey to entrepreneurs how to allocate capital through time . 
For example , lower interest rates and cost of capital raise the relative attractiveness of cash flows further in the future , and capital investment increases - the system &apos;s natural homeostatic response to higher savings and lower consumption . 
State manipulation of interest rates , however , does not influence time preference , even though it signals such a change . 
The resulting inconsistency creates distortions : as with any price control , capital receives an incentive to flow to investment that is inconsistent with actual supply and demand . 
The Fed is purposefully and insidiously distorting the incentive system - specifically , signals provided by the price of money - resulting in mal-investment ( and , when public debt is monetized , inflation ) . 
This can continue for a time , rewarding unproductive investments and aspiring oligarch-speculators who presume that the Fed has eliminated risk . 
But , as Rand reminds us , at some point the jig is up . 
Today , after the largest credit expansion in history , that point has clearly been reached . 
Impassive capital now ignores deceptive market signals , and the liquidation of untenable mal-investment percolates through the system as immutable time preferences prevail . 
The state , in the long run , simply cannot direct entrepreneurs to lend , borrow , and invest ; investment capital will inevitably shrug when faced with oppressive manipulation of free markets . 
When that happens , we see the true result of loose monetary policy : not the creation of more economic activity , but the destruction of the natural mechanism of economic coordination and adjustment , robbing the system of its resilience . 
In effect , monetary policy has &quot; stopped the motor of the world . &quot; 
At the conclusion of Atlas Shrugged , Galt aims to restore the old system anew as the collectivist regime crumbles . 
Will something like that , too , happen in our own dystopian world ( in which all remaining Republican US presidential candidates seem to favor firing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke ) ? 
How long must capital wait for the day when , free of distorted incentives , the engine of growth is fueled and humming again ?
