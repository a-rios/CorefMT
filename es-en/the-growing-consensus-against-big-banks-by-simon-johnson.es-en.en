Too Big To Handle 
WASHINGTON , DC - In the discussion of whether America &apos;s largest financial institutions have become too big , a sea change in opinion is underway . 
Two years ago , during the debate about the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation , few people thought that global megabanks represented a pressing problem . 
Some prominent senators even suggested that very large European banks represented something of a role model for the United States . 
In any case , the government , according to the largest banks &quot; CEOs , could not possibly impose a cap on their assets &quot; size , because to do so would undermine the productivity and competitiveness of the US economy . 
Such arguments are still heard - but , increasingly , only from those employed by global megabanks , including their lawyers , consultants , and docile economists . 
Everyone else has shifted to the view that these financial behemoths have become too large and too complex to manage - with massive adverse consequences for the wider economy . 
And every time the CEO of such a bank is forced to resign , the evidence mounts that these organizations have become impossible to manage in a responsible way that generates sustainable value for shareholders and keeps taxpayers out of harm &apos;s way . 
Wilbur Ross , a legendary investor with great experience in the financial services sector , nicely articulated the informed private-sector view on this issue . 
He recently told CNBC , 
&quot; I think it was a fundamental error for banks to get as sophisticated as they have , and I think that the bigger problem than just size is the question of complexity . 
I think maybe banks have gotten too complex to manage as opposed to just too big to manage . &quot; 
In the wake of Vikram Pandit &apos;s resignation as CEO of Citigroup , John Gapper pointed out in the Financial Times that &quot; Citi &apos;s shares trade at less than a third of the multiple to book value of Wells Fargo , &quot; because the latter is a &quot; steady , predictable bank , &quot; whereas Citigroup has become too complex . 
Gapper also quotes Mike Mayo , a leading analyst of the banking sector : &quot; Citi is too big to fail , too big to regulate , too big to manage , and it has operated as if it &apos;s too big to care . &quot; Even Sandy Weill , who built Citi into a megabank , has turned against his own creation . 
At the same time , top regulators have begun to articulate - with some precision - what needs to be done . 
Our biggest banks must become simpler . 
Tom Hoenig , a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and now a top official at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , advocates separating big banks &quot; commercial and securities-trading activities . 
The cultures never mesh well , and big securities businesses are notoriously difficult to manage . 
Hoenig and Richard Fisher , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas , have been leading the charge on this issue within the Federal Reserve System . 
Both of them emphasize that &quot; too complex to manage &quot; is almost synonymous with &quot; too big to manage , &quot; at least within the US banking system today . 
George Will , a widely read conservative columnist , recently endorsed Fisher &apos;s view . 
Big banks get a big taxpayer subsidy - in the form of downside protection for their creditors . 
This confers on them a funding advantage and completely distorts markets . 
These subsidies are dangerous ; they encourage excessive risk-taking and very high leverage - meaning a lot of debt relative to equity for each bank and far too much debt relative to the economy as a whole . 
Now these themes have been picked up by Dan Tarullo , an influential member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System . 
In an important recent speech , Tarullo called for a cap on the size of America &apos;s largest banks , to limit their non-deposit liabilities as a percentage of GDP - an entirely sensible approach , and one that fits with legislation that has been proposed by two congressmen , Senator Sherrod Brown and Representative Brad Miller . 
Tarullo rightly does not regard limiting bank size as a panacea - his speech made it clear that there are many potential risks to any financial system . 
But , in the often-nuanced language of central bankers , Tarullo conveyed a clear message : the cult of size has failed . 
More broadly , we have lost sight of what banking is supposed to do . 
Banks play an essential role in all modern economies , but that role is not to assume a huge amount of risk , with the downside losses covered by society . 
Ross got it right again this week , when he said : 
&quot; I think that the real purpose and the real need that we have in this country for banks is to make loans particularly to small business and to individuals . 
I think that &apos;s the hard part to fill . &quot; 
He continued , 
&quot; Our capital markets are sufficiently sophisticated and sufficiently deep that most large corporations have plenty of alternative ways to find capital . 
Smaller companies and private individuals don &apos;t have really the option of public markets . 
They &apos;re the ones that most severely need the banks . 
I think they &apos;ve kind of lost track of that purpose . &quot; 
Hoenig and Fisher have the right vision . 
Tarullo is heading down the right path . 
Ross and many others in the private sector fully understand what needs to be done . 
Those who oppose their proposed reforms are most likely insiders - people who have received payments from big banks over the past year or two .
