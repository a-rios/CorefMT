Convicts for Export 
NEW DELHI - China has devised a novel strategy to relieve pressure on its overcrowded prisons : employ convicts as laborers on overseas projects in the developing world . 
The practice has exposed another facet of China &apos;s egregious human-rights record , which , when it comes to the overseas operations of Chinese companies , includes the government &apos;s failure to enforce its own regulations . 
China executes three times as many people every year as the rest of the world combined . 
Amnesty International has estimated that , in 2007 , China secretly executed on average &quot; around 22 prisoners every day . &quot; 
In addition to being the world &apos;s leading executioner , China has one of its largest prison populations . 
The 2009 &quot; World Prison Population List &quot; compiled by the International Center for Prison Studies at King &apos;s College , London , put the total number of inmates in Chinese jails at 1.57 million - larger than the population of Estonia , Guinea-Bissau , Mauritius , Swaziland , Trinidad 
Tobago , Fiji , or Qatar . 
It also adds a new element - the dumping of convicts - to its trade and investment policy , which has been much criticized for dumping goods . 
Thousands of Chinese convicts , for example , have been pressed into service on projects undertaken by state-run Chinese companies in Sri Lanka , a strategically important country for China as it seeks to enhance its regional position in the Indian Ocean . 
After providing Sri Lanka &apos;s government with offensive weapon systems that helped end the country &apos;s decades-long civil war , China has been rewarded with port-building , railroad , and other infrastructure projects . 
Chinese convicts also have been dispatched to the Maldives , where the Chinese government is building 4,000 houses on several different islands as a government-to-government &quot; gift &quot; to win influence . 
So far , however , China has failed to persuade the country &apos;s president to lease it one of the 700 uninhabited Maldivian islands for use as a small base for the Chinese navy . 
Chinese companies &quot; operating practice for overseas projects , including in Africa , is to keep the number of local workers to a bare minimum and to bring in much of the workforce from China , some of which comprises convicts &quot; freed &quot; on parole for project-related overseas work . 
Convict laborers , like the rest of the Chinese workforce on such projects , are housed near the project site . 
That way , if any convict worker escaped , he would be easy to find in an alien setting . 
In theory , such practices run counter to regulations promulgated by the Chinese commerce ministry in August 2006 , in response to a backlash against Chinese businesses in Zambia following the death of 51 Zambian workers in an explosion at a Chinese-owned copper mine . 
These regulations called for &quot; local Â­ ization , &quot; including hiring local workers , respecting local customs , and adhering to safety norms . 
During an eight-nation 2007 African tour , Chinese President Hu Jintao made a point of meeting with Chinese businesses to stress the importance of corporate responsibility in their local dealings . 
Moreover , in October 2006 , the State Council - China &apos;s cabinet - issued nine directives ordering that Chinese overseas businesses , among other things , &quot; pay attention to environmental protection , &quot; &quot; support local community and people &apos;s livelihood cause , &quot; and &quot; preserve China &apos;s good image and its good corporate reputation . &quot; 
But Chinese regulations are sometimes promulgated simply to blunt external criticism , and thus are seldom enforced , except when a case attracts international attention . 
For example , in 2003 China enacted a law on environmental-impact assessments , which was followed in 2008 by &quot; provisional measures &quot; to permit public participation in such assessments . 
Yet Chinese leaders remain more zealous about promoting exports and economic growth than in protecting the country &apos;s air and water . 
Similarly , the State Council &apos;s 2006 nine directives to Chinese overseas companies have been subordinated to the drive for exports and growth , even when it imposes environmental and social costs on local communities abroad . 
Indeed , as part of the government &apos;s &quot; going global &quot; policy , Chinese companies are offered major incentives and rewards for bagging overseas contracts and boosting exports . 
The use of convict laborers adds a disturbing new dimension to this strategy . 
But even before convicts became part of China &apos;s overseas development effort , some Chinese projects , especially dam-building schemes , were embroiled in disputes with local communities in Botswana , Burma , Pakistan , Ghana , and Sudan . 
In fact , several small bombs exploded less than three months ago at the site of Burma &apos;s Myitsone Dam , whose construction by a Chinese company in insurgency-torn Kachin State is displacing thousands of subsistence farmers and fishermen by flooding a wide swath of land . 
Chinese companies cannot get thousands of prisoners released on their own , let alone secure passports and exit permits for them . 
It is obvious that the practice of pressing convicts into service on overseas projects has been instituted at the instance of the Chinese government . 
Until the Chinese government &apos;s treatment of its own citizens and those of other countries is guided by respect for basic human rights and the rule of law , China is unlikely to command the respect that it seeks on the world stage .
