Will China Stand Up in North Korea ? 
On October 1 , 1949 , as Chiang Kai-chek &apos;s defeated Kuomintang ( KMT ) troops fled for Taiwan , Mao Zedong declared that &quot; China has stood up . &quot; 
China has , indeed , stood up , and continues to rise as one of the world &apos;s largest economies . 
Last year , China alone accounted for roughly 60 % of global export growth . 
But in a crisis , China &apos;s diplomatic influence usually resembles that of some peripheral backwater . 
Nowhere does this seem truer than in China &apos;s own backyard . 
Beijing &apos;s seeming silence over the nuclear ambitions of North Korea has left US , Japanese , and South Korean officials alike wondering when it will &quot; stand up &quot; to assert its influence over its neighbor and erstwhile ally . 
One reason China seems paralyzed in the current crisis is that , among the world &apos;s major powers , it is almost alone in having a genuine &quot; two Koreas &quot; policy . 
Since China established diplomatic relations with South Korea in the early l990 &apos;s , economic ties have grown dramatically , and cultural relations have expanded at a comparable pace . 
China also reciprocated outgoing President Kim Dae-jung &apos;s overtures in the political-security realm , despite South Korea &apos;s strategic ties with the US . 
But in recognizing South Korea , China took greater care than , say , Russia , in seeking to ameliorate North Korea &apos;s anxieties . 
China is North Korea &apos;s most important trading partner , with turnover exceeding $ 700 million in 2002 , up 30 % from 2001 . 
Indeed , China is believed to supply about 70 % of the North &apos;s oil , and has doubled its sales of grain and vegetables . 
While China no longer promises the North military support ( except in the event of external attack ) , &quot; consultations &quot; are pledged . 
Privately , China &apos;s leaders are dubious ( at best ) about North Korea . 
They think that economic reform is long overdue , and , like others , consider Kim Jong-il &apos;s political system bizarre . 
For their part , North Korea &apos;s elite understands that they have no true allies at present , not even in Beijing . 
Yet Kim Jong-il &apos;s two trips to China illustrate his interest in China &apos;s reforms and his desire to cultivate China &apos;s support . 
How much the Chinese know about the inner workings of North Korea &apos;s policy-making and power structure , and how much influence they can have , are uncertain . 
China claims that its power over Pyongyang is limited . 
What China wants above all is to prevent North Korea from collapsing , whatever the cause . 
Conflict on the Korean peninsula , nourished by the vitriolic language often employed by Kim Jong-il &apos;s regime , is China &apos;s nightmare . 
War between the Koreas would confront Beijing with a flood of hundreds of thousands of refugees . 
Equally important , China is wary of the prospect of Korea being unified under South Korean rule and backed up by continued strategic support from the US . 
Fortunately , North Korea &apos;s leaders prefer survival to suicide . 
They know that despite the extensive damage that they could inflict on the South , in the end , they would be destroyed by American and South Korean power if combat ever starts . 
Hence , war initiated by the North , while not unthinkable , seems unlikely . 
A third possibility is an indefinite continuation of the status quo . 
This , too , seems doubtful . 
North Korea is a failing state economically , a fact that Kim Jong-il and his cronies appear to recognize . 
Since the mid-l990 &apos;s , they have been exploring - albeit cautiously and uncertainly - avenues of change , including flawed price liberalization many prices in mid-2002 . 
Whatever the eventual outcome , the status quo is untenable . 
A fourth alternative , favored by China and other key players , is an evolutionary process that combines economic reform with increased interaction with the external world , focusing initially on South Korea . 
China will move carefully but firmly in promoting this path . 
It is anxious to see a US-North Korea dialogue begin , one capable of alleviating the North &apos;s anxieties about an American attack and America &apos;s concerns about a renewed nuclear program . 
Indeed , the main factor fueling the current crisis and complicating its resolution is that the North has only one bargaining chip : threats . 
Aside from a pledge of non-aggression , its central interest is in obtaining economic assistance . 
Yet the US and others are wary of being labeled appeasers . 
Well aware of the complexities and hazards - and seeking to avoid alienating any of the parties - China is willing to play the role of convener , but not adjudicator , of an American-North Korean dialogue . 
Thus , its proclaimed &quot; disagreement &quot; with North Korea &apos;s withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty was relatively mild . 
Nonetheless , China &apos;s stake in the outcome of the current crisis is big enough to make it a party to a wide range of exchanges , formal and informal , bilateral and multilateral - all with the objective of promoting change without upheaval on the Korean peninsula . 
In this respect , the US and China have common interests , as do Japan , Russia , and South Korea . 
China , too , believes that if advocates of &quot; regime change &quot; do not push North Korea too hard , a strategy can be pursued that is based on slow evolution rather than a precipitous break - and a possible violent breakdown .
