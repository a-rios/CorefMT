From Payer to Player in the Middle East 
The European Union &apos;s policy in the Middle East is the litmus test of its common foreign and security policy . 
Many Europeans share this belief , but , as the EU considers entering the fray of Middle East peace talks , it must respond to former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s jibe that in the region &quot; you are payers , not players . &quot; 
Yet Europe &apos;s potential contribution should not be underestimated . 
Europe &apos;s financial contribution to the Middle East has been consistent and impressive . 
Between 1995 and 1999 , it spent roughly € 3.4 billion in the region , to which the European Investment Bank added a further € 4.8 billion in loans . 
From 2000 to 2006 , Europe spent another € 5.35 billion , and the EIB approved € 6.4 billion in loans . 
This year , the European Commission has committed € 320 million in Palestine alone . 
So much for the role of payer . 
But has Europe &apos;s financial aid brought peace any closer ? 
The Palestinian Authority has received more aid per capita than did post-war Europe under the Marshall Plan , yet the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have foiled hopes of a broader Euro-Mediterranean framework that , through dialogue and investment , would bring tangible improvements to the lives of millions . 
Yet it is starkly obvious that peace in the Middle East will not be born out of projects . 
Rather , it will emerge from a concept that addresses existential needs . 
A stability charter to address people &apos;s concerns in terms of land ownership , the economy , demography , and supra-national cooperation must form the core of future dialogue and investment . 
For peace to take root , long-term regional interests must overcome national agendas . 
It is this vital multilateral ethos that Europe must champion . 
I believe that a stability pact for the region could help to match what was achieved a decade ago in the Balkans . 
An enforced template of international law is essential - one with which all state and non-state actors must comply . 
Violators of international law must be made aware that the Middle East is subject to the same norms as other regions , and that the principles of democracy belong as much to its people as to those of more politically developed nations . 
The Middle East urgently needs support in creating a regional stability charter to encompass codes of conduct , goals for regional cooperation , and the mechanisms of a regional cohesion fund to tackle underdevelopment and fund new infrastructure . 
The complementarities between countries rich in human resources and oil-producing states should be harnessed , while energy-derived investment must be diverted from the old markets of the West to the Gulf &apos;s troubled hinterland . 
The ultimate result would be an interdependent Middle East that fosters stability and nurtures growth . 
For to end friction and suffering the crisis-ridden Middle East needs more than troops - a reality that has been recognized in previous conflicts around the World . 
The Helsinki Process that emerged out of the tensions of the Cold War addressed basic security , economic , and social concerns . 
It held that Europe &apos;s peoples could not be divided in terms of human dignity . 
Recognition of cultural rights and humanitarian norms underpinned the activities of brave individuals like Václav Havel who knew that a better future was not only possible but essential . 
In all conflicts , human rights are among the first casualties , and in the Middle East the degradation of human dignity has now undone international conventions agreed over several generations . 
We should look to the Helsinki Process to show us how to retrieve what has been lost . 
With today &apos;s emphasis on military action in the so-called &quot; war on terror , &quot; the need for a conference to discuss security and military affairs , combined with a stability charter , has become urgent . 
A regional agenda must be created to help identify priorities , based on a three-pronged strategy that includes energy and water policy , arms control , and debt reduction . 
Europe &apos;s contributions to the Middle East have been great . 
Funding from the EU and from member states has helped to alleviate suffering , while compassionate community-building efforts by European individuals and organizations have highlighted the true closeness of all who share a common Mediterranean history . 
It is vital that Europe &apos;s experience , commitment , and heritage of hope be framed in a vision for the Middle East that becomes a model for its future .
