The Elixir of Education ? 
Many people see education as a cure-all . 
But , while it is right to believe in the power of education - indeed , many scholars are convinced that it creates healthier , more prosperous citizens - such enthusiasm doesn &apos;t tell us how to get more children to stay in school longer , or how to ensure that they learn useful skills while they are there . 
Today , virtually every Latin American and Caribbean child enrolls in primary school , and most complete several years of secondary education - remarkable progress compared to a half-century ago . 
Yet Latin American and Caribbean children gain fewer skills in each year of school than students do in high-income countries - and even in some other developing countries . 
Indigenous children have a significantly lower chance of educational success . 
Guatemala , Haiti , Honduras , Nicaragua , and Paraguay lag behind even other Latin American countries . 
Despite the widespread enthusiasm for lifting educational performance in Latin America and the Caribbean , little effort has been devoted to working out how to maximize investments in education . 
Which policies work best ? 
There are myriad options . 
The World Bank recommends decentralizing school administration and decision-making so that schools are more responsive to local needs . 
But no reliable studies have established this strategy &apos;s effectiveness . 
Bilingual education is another suggestion that requires further research if we are to establish the benefits . 
Research in Africa suggests that giving de-worming medicine to primary school pupils reduces the prevalence of health problems that lower children &apos;s concentration and attendance . 
A program to provide teachers with monetary incentives and professional training was recently established in Mexico , but research conducted to date has found no significant impact on educational outcomes . 
Clearly , there is a deficit of useful information and serious scientific research in this field . 
However , three options should be promoted . 
First , there is credible evidence that children who are better nourished in their first years of life stay in school longer and learn more each year that they remain there . 
This was first demonstrated in the 1960 &quot; s , when Guatemalan researchers gave children in two randomly selected villages a nutritious porridge each day , and a much less nutritious fruit drink to children in two other villages . 
More recently , Bolivia launched the Proyecto Integral de Desarrollo Infantil ( PIDI ) , which gave low-income urban children food and extra educational activities . 
This policy can be very affordable : providing porridge in Guatemala cost just $ 23.25 per child per year , while the monetary value of the increase in the children &apos;s future wages is between two and four times higher . 
A second option is Conditional Cash Transfer Programs , which provide cash payments to poor households whose children attend school regularly . 
Families in some rural communities of Honduras , Nicaragua , and Mexico get monthly cash payments if their children &apos;s school attendance rates are 85 % or higher . 
In Nicaragua , these programs have increased school enrollment rates by about 13 percentage points . 
However , such incentives do not address the problem of low-quality education , and research shows that the benefits do not always outweigh the costs . 
Policymakers may choose instead to follow the example of Chile and Colombia , which give students government money to pay for private education . 
In Colombia , scholarships were provided to 125,000 students from poor , urban communities in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
Where demand exceeded supply , private education &quot; voucher &quot; recipients were selected by lottery . 
Each voucher cost the Colombian government $ 24 a year more than its previous education spending per student , but the vouchers increased attendance rates and test scores . 
It is estimated that children in the program increased their future incomes by $ 300 per year . 
With the benefits exceeding the costs by between 10 and 25 times , this seems to be a sound option . 
Yet an analysis of Chile &apos;s voucher program found no positive effect on students &quot; test scores or years in school . 
Instead , the program &apos;s main effect seems to have been to encourage the best students in public schools to switch to private schools . 
Investing in education is vital for Latin America and the Caribbean . 
But much remains unknown . 
Many policy options unravel when examined closely ; others show promise but require more study . 
The most expensive programs aren &apos;t necessarily the most successful . 
Merely waxing lyrical about the benefits of education will do nothing to help Latin American and Caribbean countries catch up with developed countries . 
Instead , governments and international organizations should support education policies that have been shown to be effective , encourage research and evaluation of other types of education policies and programs , and back non-education policies and programs that improve the quality of life in developing countries .
