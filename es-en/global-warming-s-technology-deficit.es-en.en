Global Warming &apos;s Technology Deficit 
COPENHAGEN - Our current approach to solving global warming will not work . 
It is flawed economically , because carbon taxes will cost a fortune and do little , and it is flawed politically , because negotiations to reduce CO2 emissions will become ever more fraught and divisive . 
And even if you disagree on both counts , the current approach is also flawed technologically . 
Many countries are now setting ambitious carbon-cutting goals ahead of global negotiations in Copenhagen this December to replace the Kyoto Protocol . 
Let us imagine that the world ultimately agrees on an ambitious target . 
Say we decide to reduce CO2 emissions by three-quarters by 2100 while maintaining reasonable growth . 
Herein lies the technological problem : to meet this goal , non-carbon-based sources of energy would have to be an astounding 2.5 times greater in 2100 than the level of total global energy consumption was in 2000 . 
These figures were calculated by economists Chris Green and Isabel Galiana of McGill University . 
Their research shows that confronting global warming effectively requires nothing short of a technological revolution . 
We are not taking this challenge seriously . 
If we continue on our current path , technological development will be nowhere near significant enough to make non-carbon-based energy sources competitive with fossil fuels on price and effectiveness . 
In Copenhagen this December , the focus will be on how much carbon to cut , rather than on how to do so . 
Little or no consideration will be given to whether the means of cutting emissions are sufficient to achieve the goals . 
Politicians will base their decisions on global warming models that simply assume that technological breakthroughs will happen by themselves . 
This faith is sadly - and dangerously - misplaced . 
Green and Galiana examine the state of non-carbon-based energy today - nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , etc . - and find that , taken together , alternative energy sources would get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050 , and only a tiny fraction of the way toward stabilization by 2100 . 
We need many , many times more non-carbon-based energy than is currently produced . 
Yet the needed technology will not be ready in terms of scalability or stability . 
In many cases , there is still a need for the most basic research and development . 
We are not even close to getting this revolution started . 
Current technology is so inefficient that - to take just one example - if we were serious about wind power , we would have to blanket most countries with wind turbines to generate enough energy for everybody , and we would still have the massive problem of storage : we don &apos;t know what to do when the wind doesn &apos;t blow . 
Policymakers should abandon fraught carbon-reduction negotiations , and instead make agreements to invest in research and development to get this technology to the level where it needs to be . 
Not only would this have a much greater chance of actually addressing climate change , but it would also have a much greater chance of political success . 
The biggest emitters of the twenty-first century , including India and China , are unwilling to sign up to tough , costly emission targets . 
They would be much more likely to embrace a cheaper , smarter , and more beneficial path of innovation . 
Today &apos;s politicians focus narrowly on how high a carbon tax should be to stop people from using fossil fuels . 
The market alone is an ineffective way to stimulate research and development into uncertain technology , and a high carbon tax will simply hurt growth if alternatives are not ready . 
In other words , we will all be worse off . 
Green and Galiana propose limiting carbon pricing initially to a low tax ( say , $ 5.00 a ton ) to finance energy research and development . 
Over time , they argue , the tax should be allowed to rise slowly to encourage the deployment of effective , affordable technology alternatives . 
Investing about $ 100 billion annually in non-carbon-based energy research would mean that we could essentially fix climate change on the century scale . 
Green and Galiana calculate the benefits - from reduced warming and greater prosperity - and conservatively conclude that for every dollar spent this approach would avoid about $ 11 of climate damage . 
Compare this to other analyses showing that strong and immediate carbon cuts would be expensive , yet achieve as little as $ 0.02 of avoided climate damage . 
If we continue implementing policies to reduce emissions in the short term without any focus on developing the technology to achieve this , there is only one possible outcome : virtually no climate impact , but a significant dent in global economic growth , with more people in poverty , and the planet in a worse place than it could be .
