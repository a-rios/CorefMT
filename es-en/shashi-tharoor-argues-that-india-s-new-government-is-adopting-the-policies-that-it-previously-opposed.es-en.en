Modi &apos;s Hypocrisy 
NEW DELHI - According to Prime Minister Narendra Modi &apos;s supporters , his overwhelming victory in India &apos;s general elections was a sweeping repudiation of everything for which the previous United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) government , led by the Indian National Congress , stood . 
Will Modi live up to voters &quot; expectations ? 
There has certainly been a lot of hype . 
Modi , it was claimed during the election campaign , would reverse the UPA &apos;s &quot; poor governance &quot; and &quot; policy paralysis , &quot; introducing a radically new approach , based on his corporatist &quot; Gujarat development model . &quot; 
In doing so , he would transform India , liberating it from the UPA &apos;s exhausted and ineffective policies and thus improving the lives of millions . 
&quot; Achhe din aane wale hain &quot; - &quot; the good days are coming &quot; - his supporters declared upon his victory . 
In particular , the Modi public-relations machine proclaimed an end to the sops and compromises that supposedly characterized the UPA coalition . 
Modi pledged to make the tough decisions that the UPA could not , weaning Indians from the statist culture of &quot; doles &quot; and subsidies , while pursuing bold policies aimed at spurring economic growth and job creation . 
Indians today , he averred , want jobs , not handouts . 
It took just a few weeks for the hollowness of these claims to become apparent . 
A commonly cited example of the outgoing government &apos;s alleged economic mismanagement was its sugar-price policy . 
Powerful sugarcane cooperatives , led by major UPA supporters , supposedly drove the government to fix extravagant prices and write off sugar farmers &quot; bad debts , leading to over-production . 
Instead of eliminating this system , as expected , Modi &apos;s government has augmented subsidies for sugar exports to support higher output , raised import duties on sugar to discourage foreign competition , and increased the percentage of sugar-based ethanol that must be blended with petrol . 
His motivation is not difficult to discern : his Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) hopes that such concessions will help it to wrest control of Maharashtra , India &apos;s main sugar-producing state , from the UPA in the upcoming state assembly election . 
This goal explains another policy reversal as well . 
The UPA &apos;s critics long claimed that unsustainably low , state-dictated passenger fares and freight charges for rail services - which could not cover the cost of maintenance to ensure the safety of trains and tracks , much less enable expansion and improvement of service - reflected the government &apos;s inability to make tough decisions . 
It is true that coalition politics prevented decisive action , with a railway minister being summarily dismissed by his own party leader - whom the UPA was politically unable to confront - after attempting to raise fares . 
But , in the pre-election interim budget , the UPA government finally bit the bullet , proposing a 14.2 % increase in rail fares and a 6.5 % hike in freight rates . 
Per India &apos;s code of political conduct , the budget changes were deferred until after the election . 
Soon after taking office , the Modi government announced its intention to implement the price increases , though officials made sure to emphasize that they were merely following through on an existing mandate . 
Then , faced with public resistance , they moderated the planned hikes , particularly of the significantly discounted monthly pass currently available to suburban commuters - an important segment of the electorate in Mumbai , Maharashtra &apos;s capital . 
Modi had previously derided the UPA &apos;s populist railway ministers for distorted policies that punished businesses , declaring during his election campaign that India &apos;s railways should be run more like China &apos;s , with increased government investment , including for bullet trains . 
Yet , no sooner had he been sworn in than he acquiesced in precisely the kind of political compromise to which he and the BJP - which won a parliamentary majority , and thus does not depend on coalition partners for its government &apos;s survival - was supposed to be immune . 
Modi &apos;s government has adopted an even weaker stance on another unpopular but necessary decision : fuel-price increases . 
In order to align Indian fuel prices more closely with world market prices , thereby enabling domestic oil and gas producers to finance exploration and extraction , the UPA government had announced that natural-gas prices would be doubled from April 1 . 
But , as with railway fares , the final decision was left up to Modi . 
And , instead of doing what was needed - even while blaming his predecessors - Modi postponed the decision until September . 
This hypocrisy has characterized virtually every policy decision that the BJP government has taken so far . 
Despite the BJP &apos;s strident criticism of the United States-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation deal - the UPA administration &apos;s signature foreign-policy triumph - Modi &apos;s government has just ratified an India-specific &quot; additional protocol , &quot; granting the International Atomic Energy Agency access to India &apos;s civilian nuclear sites . 
Moreover , the BJP had opposed interaction with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , pending satisfactory progress on the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks , which killed 164 people and injured more than 300 . 
Yet Sharif was an honored guest at Modi &apos;s inauguration , exchanging gifts with India &apos;s newly affable leader . 
The Modi government has also adopted the UPA-proposed Goods and Services Tax , which had been stalled by opposition from BJP-ruled states ( including Modi &apos;s Gujarat ) . 
And it will strengthen the national anti-terrorism effort , which Modi previously denounced as an assault on Indian federalism . 
Many Modi supporters in the media have already begun to decry the series of policy abdications Modi has conducted since his campaign . 
Indian citizens who thought that they voted for change are beginning to wonder if the BJP has simply reprised the UPA government &apos;s policies . 
As a member of the previous government , I must say that that may not be such a bad thing .
