Darwin , the Greatest Psychologist 
CORONADO , CALIFORNIA - Most people do not think of Charles Darwin as a psychologist . 
In fact , his work revolutionized the field . 
Before Darwin , philosophical speculation shaped our psychological understanding . 
But even great philosophers - Plato , Aristotle , Hobbes , Hume , Locke , Kant , Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , and others - could only describe current mental events and behaviors ; they could not explain their causes . 
Darwin provided the profound understanding that evolution has influenced the shape of our minds as strongly as it has the shape of our bodies . 
Since humans evolved from the same primate ancestor as modern chimpanzees or gorillas , he suggested one could learn more by comparing human instincts , emotions , and behaviors to those of animals than one can surmise from subjective speculation . 
As he put it , &quot; he who understands baboon would do more towards metaphysics than Locke . &quot; 
Philosophy is inadequate to understand the roots of human psychology , because self-reflection does not make us aware of the forces that drive most of our reactions to the environment . 
Rather , we are subject to inborn tendencies , which develop through the reciprocally influential forces of natural and sexual selection . 
Natural selection is the process by which the variants within a species that are best adapted to survive in their environment win the reproductive contest - at least until an even better-adapted variant comes along . 
The traits that enable people to feed and protect themselves increase the likelihood that they will live long enough to produce offspring , whom they will be able to feed and protect until maturity . 
In a sense , sexual selection is the psychological extension of natural selection . 
But , instead of gaining an advantage from traits that enhance one &apos;s ability to survive , one gains an advantage from qualities that potential mates have evolved to find appealing . 
Given that humans &quot; sexual choices determine who reproduces most and , in turn , which physical and psychological features are favored over time , a trait that may not help a person to survive can still provide a reproductive advantage that is passed along to offspring . 
In other words , in choosing a mate , one shapes the course of evolution . 
Moreover , the principle of sexual selection implies that , in addition to regulating bodily functions , the nervous system indirectly influences the progressive development of bodily and mental structures such as ornamental appendages ; cognitive skills like musical ability ; and characteristics such as courage and perseverance . 
Peacocks have evolved to have long , colorful feathers simply because peahens have evolved to find them attractive . 
Darwin explained that such qualities are propagated and enhanced over generations , through &quot; the exertion of choice , the influence of love and jealousy , and the appreciation of the beautiful in sound , color , or form . &quot; 
Indeed , while natural selection is blind , sexual selection has an eye for beauty - although the nature of beauty is always in the eye of the beholder . 
Given that human psychology has developed through a sometimes-uneasy balance of natural and sexual selection , evolution and psychology influence and interact with each other . 
Darwin &apos;s contributions to understanding human psychology involved careful study of child development , which he reported in 1877 in &quot; Biographical Sketch of an Infant . &quot; 
For the first three years of his first-born son William &apos;s life , Darwin observed him with the practiced eye of a naturalist , recording developments as diverse as his ability to follow a candle with his eyes to the first manifestations of conscience . 
Darwin also pioneered the experimental tools of scientific psychology , such as the use of photographs of facial expressions and surveys to determine the universality of human emotions . 
Darwin had already made most of his major psychological discoveries even before he identified natural selection as the mechanism of evolution - but he waited 35 years before publishing his findings . 
This decision can be partly attributed to his meticulous approach to research , which entailed carefully collecting and studying evidence before presenting theories . 
But Darwin also knew that , if he needed time to accept his own conclusions , the rest of the world was not ready to face such a materialist view of humanity . 
He shied away from the inevitable confrontation with critics - among whom were friends and colleagues . 
By the time Darwin died , his ideas had gained significant influence among psychologists and neuroscientists - even if they did not always fully realize it . 
Sigmund Freud never met Darwin , but most of his mentors were enthusiastic Darwinists . 
Just as Isaac Newton revolutionized astronomy and physics by &quot; standing on the shoulders &quot; of his predecessors , Freud built on Darwin &apos;s evolutionary insights in order to understand psychological symptoms , dreams , myths , art , anthropology , and much more . 
Freud &apos;s biographer , Ernest Jones , was mistaken in calling Freud &quot; the Darwin of the mind . &quot; 
Darwin himself was the Darwin of the mind ; 
Freud was his great popularizer . 
Since Darwin , academic psychology has expanded significantly , enriched by the sophisticated tools of cognitive science , cybernetics , and brain imaging . 
But most of these developments have been derivative elaborations of Darwin &apos;s grand evolutionary model . 
The fundamentals of our conception of human nature can all be found in Darwin &apos;s notebooks , written 175 years ago and before his thirtieth birthday .
