The French Don &apos;t Get It 
CAMBRIDGE - The French government just doesn &apos;t seem to understand the real implications of the euro , the single currency that France shares with 16 other European Union countries . 
French officials have now reacted to the prospect of a credit rating downgrade by lashing out at Britain . 
The head of the central bank , Christian Noyer , has argued that the rating agencies should begin by downgrading Britain . 
The finance minister , Francois Baroin , recently declared that , &quot; You &apos;d rather be French than British in economic terms . &quot; 
And even the French Prime minister , Francois Fillar , noted that Britain had higher debt and larger deficits than France . 
French officials apparently don &apos;t recognize the importance of the fact that Britain is outside the eurozone , and therefore has its own currency , which means that there is no risk that Britain will default on its debt . 
When interest and principal on British government debt come due , the British government can always create additional pounds to meet those obligations . 
By contrast , the French government and the French central bank cannot create euros . 
If investors are unwilling to finance the French budget deficit - that is , if France cannot borrow to finance that deficit - France will be forced to default . 
That is why the market treats French bonds as riskier and demands a higher interest rate , even though France &apos;s budget deficit is 5.8 % of its GDP , whereas Britain &apos;s budget deficit is 8.8 % of GDP . 
There is a second reason why the British situation is less risky than that of France . 
Britain can reduce its current-account deficit by causing the British pound to weaken relative to the dollar and the euro , which the French , again , cannot do without their own currency . 
Indeed , that is precisely what Britain has been doing with its monetary policy : bringing the sterling-euro and sterling-dollar exchange rates down to more competitive levels . 
The eurozone fiscal deficits and current-account deficits are now the most obvious symptoms of the euro &apos;s failure . 
But the credit crisis in Europe , and the weakness of eurozone banks , may be even more important . 
The persistent unemployment differentials within the eurozone are yet another reflection of the adverse effect of imposing a single currency and a single monetary policy on a heterogeneous group of countries . 
President Nicolas Sarkozy and other French politicians are no doubt unhappy that the recent European summit failed to advance the cause of further EU political integration . 
It was French officials Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman who launched the initiative for European political union just after World War II with the call for a United States of Europe . 
The French regarded the creation of the euro as an important symbol of progress toward that goal . 
In the 1960 &quot; s , Jacques Delors , then the French finance minister , pressed for a single currency with a report , &quot; One Market , One Money , &quot; which implied that the European free-trade agreement would work only if its members used a single currency . 
For the French , achieving a European political union is a way to increase Europe &apos;s role in the world and France &apos;s role within Europe . 
But that goal looks harder to reach now than it did before the beginning of the European crisis . 
By attacking Britain and seeking to increase British borrowing costs , France is only creating more conflict between itself and Britain , while creating more tensions within Europe as a whole . 
Looking ahead , stopping the eurozone financial crisis does not require political union or a commitment of German financial support . 
It depends on individual eurozone countries - especially Italy , Spain , and France - making the changes in their domestic spending and taxation that will convince global financial investors that they are moving toward budget surpluses and putting their debt-to-GDP ratios on a downward path . 
France should focus its attention on its domestic fiscal problems and the dire situation of its commercial banks , rather than lashing out at Britain or calling for political changes that are not going to occur .
