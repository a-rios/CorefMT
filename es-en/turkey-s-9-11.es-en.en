Turkey \ u0027s 9 / 11 
So far , al-Qaeda has successfully inflamed the dreaded &quot; clash of civilizations . &quot; 
When its terrorists struck America in 2001 , they seemed to confirm the Western world &apos;s worst fears about Islam . 
Now the terrorists strike at Turkey . 
Why would Islamists kill Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan ? 
As punishment , because Turkey sided with the US-led invasion of Iraq ? 
But Turkey neither let foreign troops be stationed on its territory , nor did it send its troops into the war . 
Perhaps al-Qaeda &apos;s motive in targeting Turkey is to derail a Muslim nation from its progress toward joining the European Union ? 
Not surprisingly , after the attacks Western leaders reaffirmed the urgency of bringing Turkey into the European fold . 
But these questions miss a fundamental truth about Turkey . 
Much comment on Turkish society pays lip service to Turkey &apos;s unique place as a &quot; bridge &quot; between Islam and secularism , and between East and West . 
The problem with being the bridge , though , is that neither side - neither the &quot; West &quot; nor the &quot; Muslim world &quot;  - considers Turkey fully one of its own . 
Too Muslim for the West ; too secular for the Muslims : over time , this dichotomy has been a source of weakness for Turkey , bringing successive national identity crises . 
In today &apos;s multicultural world , however , Turkey stands out as a genuinely multifaceted and complex unity of multiple identities . 
The day after the second set of bombings in Istanbul , I took a taxi to the bombed British Consulate . 
The obvious topic of conversation as the horrors of the bombing , but the driver , while polite , was unresponsive . 
Perhaps it was just a matter of personality , or he may have been reflecting the shock and confusion that covered most of Istanbul after the blasts . 
I spent some moments studying the cab . 
There were two stickers by the rearview mirror , standing side-by-side and sending seemingly contradictory messages . 
One read , &quot; Hakimiyet Allah &apos;indir , &quot; which roughly translates as &quot; Allah rules &quot; or &quot; power belongs to Allah , &quot; a slogan that could be identified with Islamist sentiments . 
Right next to it , though , was the Turkish flag in duplicate - a central symbol of secular Turkish nationalism . 
Complicating the picture more was a third item : soft Western music on the car &apos;s radio . 
Survey after survey show that most Turks believe in God and identify themselves as Muslims . 
But their adherence to Islam is illustrated by the example of a man I once saw at Muslim prayer in the ruins of the ancient Zeus temple in a small town on the Aegean coast . 
Clearly , this devout believer was overtaken by the sanctity of this pagan temple and was praying to his own God in the only way he knew . 
He saw no contradiction between his beliefs and the setting in which he expressed them . 
This is what al-Qaeda , as well as purists in the West , can &apos;t understand about Turks : they do not feel they have to choose between being modern and being Muslim . 
In the days following the attacks in Istanbul , Turks across the board condemned this brutal violence : there was no ( or only negligible ) blame-the-victim sentiment toward Turkish Jews ( or toward Israel ) or toward the British and Americans , whose war in Iraq is extremely unpopular in Turkey . 
At the same time , Turks did not turn against Islam , as though this killing could be justified by religion . 
Instead , they expressed sorrow for the victims ( whether Jewish , Muslim , or British ) and a firm commitment to Turkey &apos;s chosen path . 
The terrorism of Turkey &apos;s Kurdish separatists had , in the past , caused great strife , due to numerous mistakes made in assessing and addressing the source of the problem . 
But the terrorist attacks in Istanbul are unlikely to generate a nervous reaction in restricting democratic rights . 
If al-Qaeda was behind the attacks , it grossly miscalculated . 
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s reaction summed up the Turkish sentiment : &quot; These bombs aim to destroy the peace and stability in our country . 
We will not change our course . 
If these bombings are meant to send a message , I will sweep it off and crush it under my feet . &quot; 
The terrorists have picked the wrong fight . 
Indeed , even much of the Islamist political movement in Turkey has already made its choice in favor of democracy and universal human rights . 
When the Muslim world was thrown into confusion and disarray after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the democratic wing of the Islamist movement was working on a platform of legislative reforms it would propose for EU accession . 
Turkey &apos;s &quot; conservative democrats &quot; in the Justice and Development ( AK ) Party came to power in the first election thereafter , in November 2002 , and were quickly able to marginalize radical elements among both the Islamists and secularists . 
In fact , the current AK Party government is the best placed to win the war against al-Qaeda in Turkey . 
While a secularist coalition , mixing apples and oranges , may have declared war against a broad front of Islamic tendencies , the government , with its moral authority among the Muslim majority in Turkey , will be able to isolate the violent fringe and drive it into oblivion . 
This would , perhaps , be the ultimate triumph of the Turkey &apos;s unique cultural model .
