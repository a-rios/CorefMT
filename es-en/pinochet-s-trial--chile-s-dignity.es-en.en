Pinochet &apos;s Trial , Chile &apos;s Dignity 
The court battle on whether or not to punish former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is now over . 
After prolonged reflection on medical reports regarding Pinochet &apos;s health , Judge Juan Guzmán found him mentally fit to stand trial on nine counts of kidnapping and one count of homicide . 
Chile &apos;s Supreme Court has now upheld that indictment . 
All of those crimes were committed during &quot; Operation Condor , &quot; a Latin America-wide program among the continent &apos;s dictators to physically eliminate their opponents on the left . 
Judge Guzmán also determined that the former dictator is not insane and knows right from wrong . 
This is critical , as Pinochet has sought to deny his competency . 
A recent &quot; vascular incident &quot; that sent him to a military hospital - where he regained consciousness and motor skills - will furnish excuses to request new medical examinations and delays as criminal proceedings move forward . 
But Guzmán &apos;s efforts to bring the dictator to justice should not remain isolated . 
Other judges and official bodies need to keep the pressure on Pinochet . 
Much , for example , is still to be learned in cases such as the assassination of General Carlos Prats and his wife in Buenos Aires in 1974 . 
Moreover , investigations by the US Congress into the Riggs Bank have uncovered the suspicious means by which Pinochet and his family obtained their wealth . 
These investigations need to be followed up with judicial action . 
The investigation into the death in 1980 of ex-president Frei Montalva , the principal opponent of the dictatorship , has advanced but needs to be pursued vigorously in the courts . 
Frei &apos;s death implicates the repressive apparatus that Pinochet and Manuel Contreras , his &quot; right hand , &quot; managed in lockstep . 
Operation Condor , the Riggs , Frei , and Prats affairs , and many other crimes are documented in the recent report on torture and political imprisonment written by the special commission established by President Ricardo Lagos . 
Arriving 30 years after the military coup that brought Pinochet to power , the report has both unsettled and empowered Chileans . 
Seemingly invincible for many years , the former dictator &apos;s final collapse began in London in October 1998 , when Spanish lawyers , Judge Baltasar Garzón of Spain , and Scotland Yard brought charges against him . 
Pinochet responded with arrogance , provoking a huge sense of shame for Chile &apos;s young democracy . 
Pinochet &apos;s ability to evade the courts cast a dark shadow over the country &apos;s military institutions and made many Chileans wonder how far the country had really gone in its transition to democracy . 
Without Judge Garzón &apos;s insistence on pursuing the matter , prosecuting Pinochet would have been nearly impossible , owing to powerful opposition from wealthy and media-savvy Chileans . 
The Chilean government &apos;s excessive caution - rooted in fear of instability that could affect the basic rights regained after the dictatorship - also helped Pinochet evade justice . 
Indeed , Chile &apos;s courts could not have garnered the necessary public support to free them from their inertia without the push Garzón provided . 
It would also have been impossible to consider bringing Pinochet to justice without the extraordinarily important human rights struggles waged by victims &quot; organizations , victims &quot; families , and jurists who , against all the odds , remained true to their cause for decades . 
Few organizations in Chile have been as capable or as successful as those dedicated to human rights . 
Because of the tenacity and passion of ordinary Chileans demanding that the state fulfill its mandate to protect their human rights , Pinochet finds himself before the bar of justice , and others who used their power to kill , torture , or exile their fellow citizens are being pursued . 
Yet many still wonder , &quot; Will Pinochet ever pay for his deeds ? &quot; 
International public opinion and history have already condemned him . 
Chile &apos;s dignity now hinges on whether or not its legal system reaches the same conclusion . 
Doubts that Pinochet will be punished exist because &quot; pinochetismo &quot; remains alive in Chile . 
Powerful supporters defend him , using any underhanded means they can muster . 
They are aided by the fact that some within the government would prefer to close a sorrowful chapter of human rights violations rather than bringing it to a conclusion . 
Depending on the course the nation takes , Chileans may in time reconcile themselves to their past . 
For now , their different views coexist and they live together peacefully . 
But citizens and the state must also face the truth and bring human rights abusers to justice if people are to live honestly in their society and in history . 
To the extent that Chileans do so , they will create the conditions for a more dignified and honorable society . 
A judicial judgment against Pinochet is an important step forward .
