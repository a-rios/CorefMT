Tzipi Livni &apos;s Israel 
HAIFA - Famously irreverent , Israelis tend to call their leaders by their first name or childhood nickname . 
But don &apos;t be fooled : Tzipi ( Tzipora ) Livni is nobody &apos;s close friend . 
Her dry style , personal remoteness , and forced smiles make her an atypical Israeli . 
Perhaps the country needs exactly this just now : an atypical Israeli at the steering wheel . 
Newly elected as leader of the Kadima party , Livni only barely defeated her rival , Shaul Mofaz . 
Her predecessor , Ehud Olmert , inundated by corruption charges and set to resign , is hardly her best asset . 
But , beyond narrow party confines , opinion polls were exceptionally kind : a vast cross-section of the Israeli public wants Livni to lead . 
It has been a while since any national figure won such high esteem . 
If she manages to rebuild Olmert &apos;s coalition and become Israel &apos;s next prime minister , Livni &apos;s initial credit at home and abroad will be outstanding . 
The reason is that Livni is the quintessential envoy of &quot; Middle Israel . &quot; 
She comes from the heartland of a successful and moderate civil society flanked by extremism and rage . 
Despite her brief spell in Mossad , Israel &apos;s spy service , Livni is deeply civilian when set against Israel &apos;s militarized landscape . 
Given reasonable security conditions , she may be able to navigate Israel from war to peace . 
She represents the civic values that have been common to many &quot; middle Israelis &quot; ever since Theodore Herzl first put them in writing : the Jewish state must be modern and democratic to the core . 
It should respectfully leave the rabbis and the army officers in their confined quarters . 
It belongs in the world of nations , and seriously strives for peace with its Arab neighbors and equality for all its citizens . 
The vast center of the Israeli political spectrum nowadays is essentially Herzlian . 
Uninterested in nationalist daydreams or religious mystique , we simply want to live safely , and , if at all possible , next door to a stable and peaceful Palestine . 
But , for now , Middle Israel is conducting its creative and affluent life alongside an assortment of Muslim and Jewish fanatics , many of whom are sponsored by the moderate middle &apos;s tax money . 
Livni herself , like other ex-Likudniks - including her mentor , Ariel Sharon - cool-headedly read the map . 
She gave up the dream of Greater Israel in favor of a two-state solution . 
If she becomes prime minister , her term may prove to be a window of opportunity , perhaps a last chance , to enact this least-of-evils settlement for the region &apos;s future . 
Moreover , Livni is as clean as politicians come . 
Her legal background and previous experience as minister of justice accentuate her self-declared mission : stabilizing Israeli government and cleaning up all traces of corruption , including those associated with Olmert and Sharon . 
Israel &apos;s excellent judiciary can rely on her full support . 
Livni is also an unpretentious person , not quite as ascetic as Menachem Begin and David Ben Gurion , but far humbler than Israel &apos;s last four prime ministers , all men of sturdy egos and large expense accounts . 
Livni is a selective and unsentimental peacemaker . 
As minister for foreign affairs , she appeared to distrust Syria &apos;s peace signals but kept an open link of negotiation with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas . 
She is not &quot; nice , &quot; her rhetoric tends to be flat and uninspiring , and her English is not great . 
Nor , for that matter , is her Hebrew . 
But linguistic skills , like gender , are refreshingly irrelevant at this moment . 
Far removed from left-wing apologetics , Livni is a self-righteous believer in Israel &apos;s basic right to exist . 
Yet she is ready to do business with pragmatic Palestinians and offer them full sovereignty in exchange for full peace . 
She will not allow the repatriation of Palestinians to Israel proper ( the controversially named &quot; right of return &quot; ) , but territory is not holy to her . 
Here is an Israel that you may not recognize , especially if the electronic media is your window on the world . 
In Israel &apos;s lively market of ideological debates , the fact that Livni is a woman is almost beside the point . 
After all , Israel is not the United States , and gender can never work as anyone &apos;s sole adjective . 
Nevertheless , if Livni becomes Israel &apos;s prime minister in a few weeks , then Israel will become the world &apos;s first country where all three branches of governments are led by women . 
She would join the head of the legislature , Knesset Speaker Dalia Itzik , and the head of the judiciary , Supreme Court President Dorit Beinish - not bad for a warring nation with generals-turned-politicians and a macho public image . 
Middle Israel has produced the Livni mindset , but there are many other forces at work . 
Livni may fail in several ways . 
If she does not put a coalition together , Israel will go to the ballot box and a religious-right coalition would be likely to emerge . 
Even if she persists , she may break her teeth on the same bones of contention that kept her predecessors from achieving security and peace . 
But , given Livni &apos;s record , she richly deserves the chance to try .
