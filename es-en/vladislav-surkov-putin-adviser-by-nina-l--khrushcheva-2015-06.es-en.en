The Goebbels of the Kremlin 
MOSCOW - In Soviet Russia , everybody knew that they were being watched . 
Any deviation from officially sanctioned behavior would be treated with suspicion and most likely punished . 
The Soviet state saw itself as being at war with almost everything - foreign spies , class enemies , people wearing jeans or playing jazz . 
The regime &apos;s dominant ideology was not Marxism-Leninism , but suspicion and animosity . 
Not since the early 1980s , before the first rays of glasnost in Russia , have those dark times felt as close as they do now . 
Protecting society from enemies , foreign and domestic , is once again the order of the day . 
Indeed , an ethos of perpetual vigilance is central to sustaining President Vladimir Putin &apos;s high popular-approval ratings . 
And no one plays a more important role in creating the necessary public atmosphere than Vladislav Surkov . 
Once Putin &apos;s chief of staff , Surkov served as Deputy Prime Minister from 2011 to 2013 . 
He now formally advises Putin on foreign affairs , but is really the regime &apos;s chief propagandist . 
He has been credited with the introduction of the concept of &quot; managed democracy &quot; in Russia , and he played a leading role in nurturing the secession of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia . 
More recently , he was a guiding hand behind Russia &apos;s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea , inspiring the feverish media campaigns that have delivered near-universal public support for these moves . 
Surkov is the man most responsible for nurturing pro-Putin sentiment , which increasingly resembles a Stalin-like cult of personality . 
Surkov is Chechen by descent , infused - like Stalin - with the saber-rattling mindset of the Caucasus . 
Under his watch , the central focus of the Kremlin &apos;s communication strategy has been to sustain the perception that the West wants to destroy Russia . 
Thus , the conflict in Ukraine has been framed as a renewed struggle against fascism - and in defense of Russia &apos;s true , anti-Western identity . 
The supposed threat to Russia today was underscored for the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II , with billboards springing up across Moscow to remind Russians of the sacrifices that victory required . 
Like the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels , Surkov is not overly concerned about facts . 
Emotions are at the core of the Kremlin &apos;s message ; indeed , they are the tie that binds Putin to his subjects . 
This is why Surkov portrays Putin , who recently divorced his wife of 30 years and is rumored to have fathered several children with a former Olympic gymnast , as an avatar of conservative values , with the Orthodox Patriarch constantly at his side . 
The Kremlin &apos;s campaign against gay rights has secured the support of the church , while reminding ordinary Russians that the state takes a watchful interest in their lives . 
Today &apos;s Russian propaganda combines quintessentially Soviet-style heavy-handedness and state-of-the-art technique . 
There have been no mass purges and few large rallies . 
Western values may be under assault , but Western goods are welcome . 
A common sight in Russia is a shiny German-made car with a bumper sticker recalling the glories of World War II : &quot; On to Berlin &quot; or &quot; Thank you , grandfather , for the victory , and grandmother for the tough bullets . &quot; 
For the last two decades , Russians have been able to travel internationally without restrictions . 
Now , however , many seem ready to give up this right . 
Last month , the Kremlin warned the country &apos;s citizens that the United States was &quot; hunting &quot; Russians abroad . 
A few Russians have indeed been arrested and extradited to the US : the arms dealer Viktor Bout , for example , who is charged with providing aid to terrorists , or the hacker Vladimir Drinkman , who is accused of stealing millions of credit card numbers . 
There is no credible threat to ordinary Russians , yet Surkov &apos;s campaign is having a profound impact . 
Rather than risking mockery with outlandish claims - a staple of Soviet propagandists - that Russia will one day surpass the West economically , Surkov taps a deeper and safer emotion : fear . 
Whatever Russians think of the country &apos;s economic malaise - GDP is expected to contract by 3.8 % this year , while inflation could top 15 % - they are assured that they would be much worse off without Putin . 
And Russians have fallen into line . 
A few years ago , it seemed that every tenth person wore a white ribbon , a symbol of protest against Putin . 
Today , one gets the impression that every third Russian is wearing the Ribbon of Saint George , an orange and black symbol of patriotism and loyalty to the Kremlin . 
Those who do not wear the ribbon can expect to be asked - and not very politely - why they choose not to . 
It is an insidious and effective strategy , one that marginalizes dissenters and generates the impression of near-universal support for the regime . 
On my last visit to Moscow , I noticed that a friend , a singer in the Bolshoi opera , had tied a small Ribbon of Saint George to her white Mercedes . 
Though she is no fan of Putin , she did not want to stand out unnecessarily . 
It is through small surrenders like hers that men like Surkov ultimately succeed . 
Citizens pretending to be loyal build a culture of conformity . 
With dissent suppressed , the authenticity of citizens &quot; loyalty becomes irrelevant . 
Indeed , like Goebbels , Surkov understands that when public life and private expression can be turned into theater , there is no difference between performance and reality .
