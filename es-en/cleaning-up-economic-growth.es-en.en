Cleaning Up Economic Growth 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised that the G-8 meeting on July 6-8 at Gleneagles , Scotland , which he will chair , will focus on two of the most important and longstanding global problems - Third-World poverty and global warming . 
For a long time , these two issues seemed to be at odds . 
The developing world understandably does not want to sacrifice its growth for a global public good , especially when the United States , the richest country in the world , seems unwilling to sacrifice even a little of its luxurious life style . 
Led by Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica , a group of developing countries , a new rainforest coalition has now come forward with an innovative proposal , not only offering to commit to greenhouse-gas limits , but also showing how this can be done in a way that will promote their development . 
Developing countries have long provided a vital global public good : maintaining global environmental assets . 
Their rainforests are a vast storehouse of biodiversity , and forests are major carbon sinks , reducing the level of CO2 in the atmosphere . 
I served on the International Panel for Climate Change in the mid-1990 &quot; s , reviewing the scientific evidence concerning the magnitude of increases in greenhouse gasses and their economic and social consequences . 
At the time , there was already overwhelming evidence of a serious problem that needed to be addressed , and data since then ­ ­ - concerning , for example , the rapid melting of the polar ice cap - have strongly reinforced this conclusion . 
About a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions are from land-use change , mainly deforestation , an amount comparable to US emissions from burning fossil fuels ( the US is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions . ) 
But , especially after the signing of the Kyoto protocol , we can value at least part of these environmental services : carbon sequestration ( that is , if they did not maintain their forests , the level of carbon concentrations in the atmosphere would be enormously higher ) . 
The Kyoto Protocol has generated new markets for trading carbon emissions , such as the European Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) . 
At current carbon prices , the value of carbon sequestration by tropical rainforests likely equals or exceeds the current level of international aid being provided to developing countries . 
In effect , the poor are aiding the rich . 
Biodiversity and climatic stability are global public goods . 
The benefits of conservation to the world as a whole far exceed the value of exploitation to a country like Papua New Guinea ( PNG ) . 
The PNG government would like to do the right thing , to maintain its natural capital for future generations . 
A huge mistake was made ( for a variety of reasons ) at Kyoto . 
While countries can be compensated for planting forests , they cannot be compensated for avoiding deforestation . 
Countries like PNG would thus be doubly better off if they cut down their ancient hardwood trees and replanted . 
These countries should be given incentives to maintain their forests . 
( There are , as always , technical issues to be resolved , concerning monitoring and measurement , but these can be overcome easily with modern technologies . ) 
At the very least , markets like ETS should credit emissions reductions that result from limiting deforestation . 
Without such a program , unfortunately , developing countries have neither the means nor incentives to underwrite conservation . 
There are some 2.7 billion people in over 60 developing countries that are home to the world &apos;s tropical forests . 
Cutting down the hardwood forests - even when they presently receive just 5 % of the final price in , say , New York - is the only way people can make ends meet . 
Some have suggested waiting to address this issue until 2012 , when a revised protocol is supposed to come into effect . 
At currents rates of deforestation , the combined contributions to greenhouse gas concentrations from Brazil and Indonesia alone would offset nearly 80 % of the emission reductions gained from the Kyoto protocol . 
What is so impressive about the new rainforest initiative is that it comes from the developing countries themselves ; it represents their creativity and social commitment . 
For the first time , developing countries seem willing to undertake the kinds of commitments that Europe , Japan , and the other advanced industrial countries ( except the US ) have made to avoid what could be a global disaster . 
Costa Rica , for example , has already shown that a system of paying for the provision of environmental services ( like maintaining natural forests ) can work in ways that preserve the environment and boost the economy . 
Compensating the developing countries for providing these environmental services would be one way of substantially increasing aid - and at the same time , providing these countries with the right market incentives . 
From a global point of view , the best use of these resources is to maintain the forests , which is even possible with managed cutting . 
This is an initiative around which all countries can and should rally . 
In a world divided - between rich countries and the poor , between those focusing on environmental protection and those concentrating on growth - this initiative can unite us all . 
The G-8 leaders should heed the call .
