Ben Bernanke &apos;s Global Legacy 
WASHINGTON , DC - The world is still struggling to digest Alan Greenspan &apos;s mixed legacy as Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board from 1987 to 2006 . 
So it is too soon to assess whether his departing successor , Ben Bernanke , is headed for history &apos;s chopping block or its pedestal . 
But the crucial international role that Bernanke and the Fed played during his tenure - a time when domestic economic weakness translated into relatively ineffective American global leadership - should not be overlooked . 
In these last five crisis-ridden years , the Fed has affected the world economy in two ways : through its hyperactive policy of purchasing long-term assets - so-called quantitative easing ( QE ) - and through its largely overlooked role in providing international liquidity . 
Let us consider each . 
Whatever the impact of QE on the US economy , its impact on the rest of the world has been , on balance , generally benign . 
The first round of QE was unambiguously beneficial , because it minimized , or even eliminated , the tail risk of a global depression after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 . 
To be sure , subsequent action by the Fed received a mixed reception in the rest of the world . 
In 2010 and 2011 , when QE pushed capital to emerging markets , there were complaints that the US was practicing a form of currency manipulation . 
Since May 2013 , when Bernanke signaled the possibility of unwinding QE , emerging economies have faced the opposite type of pressure : capital outflows and sharp currency adjustments . 
But in both cases , the problems for which blame was heaped on the Fed largely reflected macroeconomic mismanagement in the affected countries . 
For example , Brazil complained most vocally about capital inflows , because its currency had over-appreciated in a short period of time ; but the main culprits were domestic wage increases and overheating , not the Fed &apos;s policies . 
Likewise , India was severely affected by Bernanke &apos;s suggestion that the Fed would &quot; taper &quot; QE , but only because its economy was characterized by high inflation and large budget and external deficits . 
It was as if the emerging markets had forgotten that exposure to Fed policies was part of the bargain they willingly made when they signed on to financial globalization . 
Meanwhile , the Fed has been mindful of its international responsibilities , playing a constructive role by increasing dollar liquidity in times of extreme financial stress . 
It provideddollar liquidity ( via swap lines ) to the central banks of Brazil , Mexico , Singapore , and South Korea in the aftermath of the Lehman failure . 
And it has provided nearly unlimited amounts of similar liquidity to central banks in Europe and the Bank of Japan . 
These actions contributed to easing extremely tight financial conditions and corresponding market volatility . 
The Fed &apos;s support to emerging-market central banks was remarkable , because most of these countries chose not to borrow from the International Monetary Fund , which , in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis in the 1990 &quot; s , had come to be considered an instrument of US hegemony . 
They preferred to deal directly with the United States via the Fed , to which the IMF stigma evidently did not extend . 
In fact , the speed , timeliness , and effectiveness of Fed support have now led to efforts to institute similar mechanisms at the IMF . 
The Fed &apos;s support for Europe was similarly remarkable , because the rest of the US government was an ineffective bystander at the time - able to offer cheap counsel but little hard cash to the eurozone &apos;s distressed economies . 
Even efforts to augment the IMF &apos;s resources floundered on the reef of American political dysfunction . 
All other major economies , including key US allies , have enacted the legislation needed to strengthen the IMF ; in the US , however , there has been no comparable action since 2010 , owing to Congressional resistance . 
The explanation for the Fed &apos;s exceptional role in the context of otherwise anemic American international leadership is simple : though the US economy is weak , and American politics is polarized to the point of paralysis , the dollar is still in demand . 
In these circumstances , Bernanke effectively leveraged his role as controller of the mighty dollar-printing machine known as the US Federal Reserve . 
Dollar supremacy will not last forever , and it is increasingly being challenged by the Chinese renminbi , as I describe in my book Eclipse : Living in the Shadow of China &apos;s Economic Dominance . 
But that vestigial source of American supremacy made Bernanke a constructive and effective international leader . 
As he departs from office , the assessment of his performance as &quot; Helicopter Ben , &quot; who dropped piles of cash on the US economy , will begin in earnest . 
But history should not neglect &quot; Ambassador Ben &apos;s &quot; crucial global role .
