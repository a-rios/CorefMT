China &apos;s Growing Growth Risks 
BEIJING - If everything goes right for China , it will surpass the United States as the world &apos;s largest economy , in current dollar terms ( and more quickly in real terms ) , by 2021 . 
Its per capita income will reach that of today &apos;s lower tier of high-income countries . 
But , despite its forward momentum , the Chinese economy faces looming risks in the coming decade . 
The immediate risk is continuing stagnation , or recession , in Europe . 
In the last decade , export growth has accounted for roughly one-third of China &apos;s overall economic growth , and about one-third of Chinese exports went to the European Union . 
If the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate , China &apos;s growth will be dragged down . 
Over-tightening of domestic macroeconomic policies , especially those aimed at the real-estate market , could heighten the risk of a slowdown , with house prices currently falling across China , owing to stringent government measures . 
Indeed , the situation is much like that of the 1997 Asian financial crisis . 
In the several years before that crisis hit , China had been combating inflation , and appeared to be headed for a soft landing . 
But the combination of crisis and austerity condemned China to several years of deflation and considerably slower growth . 
Today , as China looks to the medium term , the government must face the problems created by its pervasive role in the economy . 
A new World Bank report singles out lack of reform of state-owned enterprises as the most important impediment to the country &apos;s economic growth . 
But that is only a symptom of a deeper problem : the government &apos;s dominant role in economic affairs . 
In addition to controlling 25-30 % of GDP directly , the government also takes a lion &apos;s share of financial resources . 
In recent years , more than one-third of total bank lending has gone to infrastructure , most of which has been built by government entities . 
Indeed , recognizing its over-investment in infrastructure , the government recently abandoned several high-speed rail projects that were already under construction . 
But government over-investment is also evident in numerous industrial parks and high-tech zones . 
China &apos;s investment frenzy reminds many people of Japan in the 1980 &quot; s , when high-speed rail links were extended to Japan &apos;s remotest corners . 
Most rely on government subsidies to this day . 
And , while the subsidies may improve the quality of life for ordinary people in some respects , they also detract from it by suppressing domestic consumption . 
Infrastructure investment will inevitably run up against the law of diminishing marginal returns , but consumption growth does not have a limit . 
Suppressing consumption thus suffocates future growth , and the share of household consumption in GDP has declined from 67 % in the mid-1990 &quot; s to below 50 % in recent years , with most of the decline reflecting the distortions created by government policies . 
China &apos;s government is production-oriented by nature . 
The upside is that this has helped to maintain high GDP growth rates . 
One negative consequence is the persistent deepening of income inequality . 
The Gini coefficient of per capita income has surpassed 50 ( with 100 representing maximal inequality ) , putting China in the upper quartile of inequality worldwide . 
The problem may not be inequality per se , but its consequences , one of which is the bifurcation of human capital . 
The return on education is increasing in China , but access to education is becoming increasingly divided socially and geographically . 
While education is improving in urban areas , children in the countryside are facing a decline in educational quality , because better teachers find their way to the cities . 
Moreover , given the income disparities between cities and rural areas , their education is more expensive than it is for urban families . 
As a result , a majority of rural kids will enter the workforce without a university diploma . 
Among China &apos;s 140 million migrant workers , 80 % have only nine years or less of formal education - far short of what high-income countries require . 
Despite officials &quot; seeming desire to reduce income inequality , China &apos;s government is aggravating it , by - among other things - subsidizing producers , favoring capital-intensive industries , and maintaining a highly inefficient financial sector . 
But there are also promising signs of an economic uptick . 
The government has just announced new rules for household registration , known as hukou . 
Except in large cities , people can now freely choose their hukou after three years of residency . 
This will greatly help migrants by ensuring equal access to education for their children . 
To change completely the government &apos;s distorting behavior , however , requires more drastic political changes . 
The hukou reform is a good start , as it will strengthen migrants &quot; political rights in local communities . 
Given their large numbers , their political participation may force local governments to become more responsive to ordinary people &apos;s needs . 
And government responsiveness at lower levels , one may hope , might eventually trickle up to the top .
