Islam &apos;s Fanatical 1 % 
The dominance of conservative Islam in the Middle East reflects a fundamental reality of Muslim society . 
But this conservatism should not be mistaken for violent radicalism , as America , unfortunately , has done . 
While conservatism may claim a majority of the &quot; Arab street &quot; ( and the Persian street ) , this does not mean that violence and terrorism will inevitably rule the region . 
A recent study published in Damascus by the Center of Islamic Studies pointed out that conservatives make up about 80 % of the population of the Middle East &apos;s Islamic societies . 
Reformers make up most of the other 20 % . 
Radicals can count on support from no more than 1 % of the population . 
In my view , these rough proportions have been stable throughout ten centuries of Islamic history , with slight differences . 
Islamic terminology has been established to describe these differences . 
Radicals first emerged as &quot; Khawarij , &quot; a fanatical group dating to the first century of Islam , which used accusations of blasphemy - and violence - to suppress even small differences of opinion . 
Today &apos;s conservatives are known among religious scholars as &quot; People of the Letter &quot; - those who adhere to the letter of the Islamic texts . 
Reformists , as they are known today , are the equivalent of &quot; People of Intellect . &quot; 
The difference between Muslim conservatives and reformists can be measured in two ways : their stance on the possibility of making personal judgments on religious matters ( known in religious terms as &quot; diligence &quot; ) and their attitude towards non-Muslims . 
Conservatives believe that the revealed law was settled during the glorious days of Islam , and that individual interpretation should therefore be restricted . 
As a result , they don &apos;t look for new solutions to the problems that Muslims now face . 
Banks and insurance companies are to be avoided , on the theory that their activities are usurious and thus prohibited . 
Likewise , head covering for Muslim women is considered a requirement . 
For conservatives , Islamic law is based on the Koran and the verified sayings and doings ( the Sunnah ) of the Prophet Mohammad , as these are unanimously viewed by respected scholars . 
Thus , conservatives reject democracy , because it subjects the will of God to popular opinion . 
For them , the ultimate authority within a society is God &apos;s revelation to the people . 
Reformists , on the other hand , argue that individual judgment - diligence - is permissible , and that society is empowered to make choices based on contemporary needs , regardless of the opinions of previous religious scholars . 
Reformists also take an expansive view of religious law ( Sharia ) , incorporating ideas of public welfare within a continually developing legislative process . 
Thus , for reformists , banks and insurance companies serve the welfare of society , and this takes precedence over a traditional reading of religious texts . 
They also adopt a liberal attitude toward women &apos;s head covering , as well as their political participation and travel , which should be determined individually . 
Finally , reformists see no contradiction between democracy and Islamic teaching , though democracy does conflict with centuries of tradition governing how Muslims actually have been ruled . 
As for attitudes toward non-Muslims ( or non-practicing Muslims , for that matter ) , conservatives believe that the coming of Islam abrogated all other religions , while reformists believe that Islam completes other religions , but does not invalidate or disprove them . 
Conservatives draw their proofs from the texts of the Koran , while reformists argue that the Koran mentions and recognizes both the Old and New Testaments . 
In this manner , the reformists reject an Islamic monopoly on salvation , paradise , or the truth . 
They believe that the ways to God and paradise are numerous . 
Conservatives , by contrast , are unyielding on this point , believing that there is but one path to God , and that salvation comes only through following Islamic teachings . 
However , conservatives do not support the use of violence against non-Muslims . 
On the contrary , the jurisprudential traditions of Islamic conservatism obligate Muslims to be just in their treatment of non-Muslims . 
Thus , conservatives and reformists agree that the rights of others should be observed and preserved . 
Although radicals represent no more than 1 % of the Muslim population , their influence is based on the widening effects of their violence and their total rejection of compromise . 
The radicals totally repudiate the Other , and do not see a place for the non-Muslim either in heaven or on Earth . 
This stance sanctions the use of violence against the Other , whether Christian , Jew , or even other Muslims who do not share their beliefs . 
This devotion to violence stands on two legs : radical culture and injustice . 
When radical culture prevails , it brings people over to violence . 
And the extremism of radical culture is fueled by the many inequities and grievances that face the peoples of the Middle East . 
Unfortunately , Iraq has become a breeding ground for radical Islam , owing to the brutality that the Iraqi people suffered under Saddam and now at the hands of the occupation forces . 
But this scenario is not limited to Muslims . 
Radicalism threatens any society where human dignity is lost and human rights mean nothing .
