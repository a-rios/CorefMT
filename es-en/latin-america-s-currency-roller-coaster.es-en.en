Latin America &apos;s Currency Roller Coaster 
BUENOS AIRES - Ever since World War II , the countries of Latin America have served as something of a currency laboratory . 
Across the region , countless exchange-rate regimes have been tried - some succeeding , others failing abysmally . 
In all cases , however , exchange-rate policies have played a central role in determining these countries &quot; overall macroeconomic results . 
And today , after two turbulent decades , they seem to be converging toward a more unified and sustainable framework . 
The 1980 &quot; s was a harrowing decade for most Latin American countries . 
The second oil shock and high international interest rates , coupled with a lack of foreign investment , led to significant internal and external imbalances and high levels of foreign debt . 
In all the major countries , this resulted in defaults , significant and continuous exchange-rate adjustments , and , by the end of the decade , a severe inflation / devaluation spiral , bordering , in some cases , on hyperinflation . 
These traumatic events set the stage for Latin America &apos;s two-decade-long currency roller coaster . 
That experience was marked by the attempt to use a fixed exchange-rate regime as the main policy instrument to control inflation ; that attempt &apos;s colossal failure ; and the shift , over the last decade , to more flexible regimes , freeing the exchange rate from playing a central role in controlling inflation , but not necessarily allowing a pure float in world currency markets . 
At the beginning of the 1990 &quot; s , with inflation rampant , the three largest Latin American countries decided to use the exchange rate as the centerpiece of their stabilization strategies . 
Given that international capital flows had restarted , they did not fear immediate external constraints . 
Argentina adopted the hardest peg , introducing a quasi-currency board and fixing the exchange rate by law . 
Mexico and Brazil also put in place fixed exchange rates as part of broader reform policies . 
The result of these experiments reminds one of the rueful saying : the operation was a success , but the patient died . 
Inflation did , indeed , come down ; but the real exchange rate rapidly became overvalued . 
This , together with external shocks and severe recessions , made fixed exchange-rate regimes untenable , first in Mexico , later in Brazil , and then , spectacularly , in Argentina . 
During the same period , other Latin American countries , particularly Colombia and Chile , adopted an alternative strategy . 
Their inflation was lower , and they oriented their policies toward maintaining a competitive exchange rate through the adoption of a so-called &quot; crawling band , &quot; whereby the currency is allowed to fluctuate within a band around a central parity . 
Both countries managed to reduce inflation gradually while maintaining economic growth . 
Their greater currency flexibility , however , did not prevent the recessionary impact of the Asian and Russian crises of 1997-98 , and Colombia did experience a financial crisis in 1999 . 
The collapse of Latin America &apos;s currency pegs in the financial crises of the 1990 &quot; s contributed to a shift in the world &apos;s currency paradigm . 
Coming from different experiences , most countries converged on the adoption of a floating exchange rate , many in the context of inflation targeting . 
But what most characterizes Latin America &apos;s experience is that , despite publicly preaching the virtues of a floating rate , the authorities actively intervene in currency markets , this time in different and creative ways . 
Thus , the exchange-rate regime in Latin America today is one of actively managed floating . 
During the first part of the decade , intervention was motivated by the desire to avoid devaluation , and therefore to support the inflation-targeting objectives . 
However , in later periods the objective was to avoid real exchange-rate appreciation , and , at the same time , to accumulate international reserves and strengthen credibility . 
One important lesson from Latin America &apos;s journey concerns the futility of relying on the exchange-rate regime as the main stabilization instrument . 
Inflation is too stubborn to be tackled without a coordinated set of fiscal and monetary policies . 
Anchoring the exchange rate is likely to result in disproportionate real appreciation , loss of competitiveness , external and financial crises , and disastrous recessions . 
A second lesson is the importance of flexibility . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , when hard pegs were in vogue , it was believed that flexibility reduced credibility . 
Yet , in the end , credibility collapsed because of the lack of flexibility . 
Now , in a low-inflation environment , flexibility is properly regarded as an important tool to avoid misalignments and to shield economies from external shocks . 
But flexibility is not a synonym for &quot; pure &quot; floating . 
In a highly integrated world of highly volatile prices and volumes , flexibility also implies the capacity to intervene and actively manage the exchange rate . 
Indeed , a third lesson is that neither hard pegs nor unfettered floating facilitate the preservation of a competitive real exchange rate , which is crucial to promoting and sustaining economic development . 
Managing a floating rate has also allowed Latin American countries to accumulate a significant level of international reserves . 
Despite advice to the contrary , this has been highly stabilizing . 
There is little doubt that substantial foreign reserves , together with the flexibility to float and intervene , have mitigated the impact of the recent crisis on Latin America , and contributed to its emergence as one of the best-performing regions in an era of deep uncertainty elsewhere .
