Reforming China &apos;s State-Market Balance 
BEIJING - No country in recorded history has grown as fast - and moved as many people out of poverty - as China over the last thirty years . 
A hallmark of China &apos;s success has been its leaders &quot; willingness to revise the country &apos;s economic model when and as needed , despite opposition from powerful vested interests . 
And now , as China implements another series of fundamental reforms , such interests are already lining up to resist . 
Can the reformers triumph again ? 
In answering that question , the crucial point to bear in mind is that , as in the past , the current round of reforms will restructure not only the economy , but also the vested interests that will shape future reforms ( and even determine whether they are possible ) . 
And today , while high-profile initiatives - for example , the government &apos;s widening anti-corruption campaign - receive much attention , the deeper issue that China faces concerns the appropriate roles of the state and the market . 
When China began its reforms more than three decades ago , the direction was clear : the market needed to play a far greater role in resource allocation . 
And so it has , with the private sector far more important now than it was . 
Moreover , there is a broad consensus that the market needs to play what officials call a &quot; decisive role &quot; in many sectors where state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) dominate . 
But what should its role be in other sectors , and in the economy more generally ? 
Many of China &apos;s problems today stem from too much market and too little government . Or , to put it another way , while the government is clearly doing some things that it should not , it is also not doing some things that it should . 
All of this undermines trust within society and in government - a trend that is particularly obvious with respect to , say , food safety . 
Such problems could worsen as China restructures its economy away from export-led growth toward services and household consumption . 
Clearly , there is room for growth in private consumption ; but embracing America &apos;s profligate materialist life-style would be a disaster for China - and the planet . 
Air quality in China is already putting peoples &quot; lives at risk ; global warming from even higher Chinese carbon emissions would threaten the entire world . 
There is a better strategy . 
For starters , Chinese living standards could and would increase if more resources were allocated to redress large deficiencies in health care and education . 
Here , government should play a leading role , and does so in most market economies , for good reason . 
America &apos;s privately-based health-care system is expensive , inefficient , and achieves far worse outcomes than those in European countries , which spend far less . 
A more market-based system is not the direction in which China should be going . 
In recent years , the government has made important strides in providing basic health care , especially in rural areas , and some have likened China &apos;s approach to that of the United Kingdom , where private provision is layered atop a public base . 
Whether that model is better than , say , French-style government-dominated provision may be debated . 
But if one adopts the UK model , the level of the base makes all the difference ; given the relatively small role of private health-care provision in the UK , the country has what is essentially a public system . 
Likewise , though China has already made progress in moving away from manufacturing toward a service-based economy ( the GDP share of services exceeded that of manufacturing for the first time in 2013 ) , there is still a long way to go . 
Already , many industries are suffering from overcapacity , and efficient and smooth restructuring will not be easy without government help . 
China is restructuring in another way : rapid urbanization . 
Ensuring that cities are livable and environmentally sustainable will require strong government action to provide sufficient public transport , public schools , public hospitals , parks , and effective zoning , among other public goods . 
One major lesson that should have been learned from the post-2008 global economic crisis is that markets are not self-regulating . 
They are prone to asset and credit bubbles , which inevitably collapse - often when cross-border capital flows abruptly reverse direction - imposing massive social costs . 
America &apos;s infatuation with deregulation was the cause of the crisis . 
The issue is not just the pacing and sequencing of liberalization , as some suggest ; the end result also matters . 
Liberalization of deposit rates led to America &apos;s savings and loan crisis in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Liberalization of lending rates encouraged predatory behavior that exploited poor consumers . 
Bank deregulation led not to more growth , but simply to more risk . 
China , one hopes , will not take the route that America followed , with such disastrous consequences . 
The challenge for its leaders is to devise effective regulatory regimes that are appropriate for its stage of development . 
That will require the government to raise more money . 
Local governments &quot; current reliance on land sales is a source of many of the economy &apos;s distortions - and much of the corruption . 
Instead , the authorities should boost revenue by imposing environmental taxes ( including a carbon tax ) , a more comprehensive progressive income tax ( including capital gains ) , and a property tax . 
Moreover , the state should appropriate , through dividends , a larger share of SOEs &quot; value ( some of which might be at the expense of these firms &quot; managers . ) 
The question is whether China can maintain rapid growth ( though somewhat slower than its recent breakneck pace ) , even as it reins in credit expansion ( which could cause an abrupt reversal in asset prices ) , confronts weak global demand , restructures its economy , and fights corruption . 
In other countries , such daunting challenges have led to paralysis , not progress . 
The economics of success is clear : higher spending on urbanization , health care , and education , funded by increases in taxes , could simultaneously sustain growth , improve the environment , and reduce inequality . 
If China &apos;s politics can manage the implementation of this agenda , China and the entire world will be better off .
