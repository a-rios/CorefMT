The Right Priorities for the G8 
In the run-up to the G8 meeting in Scotland on July 6-8 , British Prime Minister Tony Blair has called on the international community to set the right global priorities , which he has unequivocally stated should be Africa and global warming . 
Blair is right in challenging us to set priorities . 
While we should accept his challenge , we should also get our priorities right . 
Political leaders rarely espouse clear priorities , preferring to seem capable of giving everything to everybody . 
They must work with bureaucracies , which are naturally disinclined to have their efforts prioritized , lest they end up as anything less than number one . 
Whenever we prioritize , we not only say where we should do more ( which is good ) but also where we should not increase our efforts ( which is regarded as cynical ) . 
But not talking about priorities does not make the need to prioritize go away . 
Instead , the choices only become less clear , less democratic , and less efficient . 
Refusing to prioritize , dealing mainly with the most publicized problems , is wrong . 
Imagine doctors at a perpetually overrun hospital refusing to perform triage on casualties , merely attending patients as they arrived and fast-tracking those whose families made the most fuss . 
Refusing to prioritize is unjust , wastes resources , and costs lives . 
So what should be our top global priorities ? 
This question was addressed in a groundbreaking project involving a long list of the world &apos;s top economists at the Copenhagen Consensus last year . 
A &quot; dream team &quot; of eight economists , including three Nobel Laureates , confronted the basic question : if the world had , say , an extra $ 50 billion to do good , where could that money best be spent ? 
The top priority turned out to be HIV / AIDS prevention . 
A comprehensive program would cost $ 27 billion , but the potential social benefits would be immense : avoidance of more than 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS by 2010 . 
This makes it the best investment the world could make , reaping social benefits that outweigh the costs by 40 to 1 . 
Similarly , providing micronutrients missing from more than half the world &apos;s diet would reduce diseases caused by deficiencies of iron , zinc , iodine , and Vitamin A with an exceptionally high ratio of benefits to cost . 
If we could only find the political will , establishing free trade could be achieved at a very low cost , with benefits of up to $ 2.4 trillion a year . 
Fighting malaria pays off at least five times the costs . 
Mosquito nets and effective medication could halve the incidence of malaria and would cost $ 13 billion . 
The list goes on to focus on agricultural technologies to tackle food production and hunger , as well as technologies to boost the supply of clean drinking water and improve sanitation . 
Given that these problems are most acute in Africa , Blair &apos;s priorities have some merit . 
But the Copenhagen Consensus showed us not only what we should be doing , but also what should not be done - at least not right now . 
The experts rated responses to climate change extremely low on the &quot; to do &quot; list . 
In fact , the panel called these ventures - including the Kyoto Protocol - &quot; bad projects &quot; because they cost more than the good they do . 
This does not mean that we should ignore climate change . 
Global warming is real . 
But the Kyoto rules will make an almost imperceptible difference ( postponing temperature increases from 2100 to 2106 ) at a substantial cost ( about $ 150 billion per year ) . 
Given scarce resources , we must ask ourselves : do we want to do a lot of good now , or a little good much later ? 
We need to ask if we can do more for the world by investing differently . 
Far from suggesting a policy of laissez faire , this question addresses the pressing problem of prioritization head on . 
Why did thousands die in Haiti during the recent hurricanes and not in Florida ? 
Because Haitians are poor . 
Breaking the cycle of poverty by addressing the most pressing issues of disease , hunger , and polluted water will not only do obvious good , but also make people less vulnerable . 
The G-8 meeting has put global prioritization on the agenda . 
The urgent problem of the poor majority of this world is not climate change . 
Their problems are more basic : not dying from easily preventable diseases ; not being malnourished from lack of simple micronutrients ; not being prevented from exploiting opportunities in the global economy by lack of free trade . 
We can prevent HIV by handing out condoms and improving health education . 
We can prevent millions from dying from malnutrition simply by distributing vitamin supplements . 
These are not space-age technologies , but staple goods that the world needs . 
Doing the best things first would be a great investment in the planet &apos;s future . 
If we are serious about solving the world &apos;s most serious challenges , we owe it to ourselves to set the right priorities .
