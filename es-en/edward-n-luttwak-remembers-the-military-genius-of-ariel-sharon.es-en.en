The Ingenious General 
WASHINGTON , DC - Had Ariel Sharon never entered politics , he would still be known around the world as a military commander and tactician . 
In both roles , he was extraordinary , because his methods diverged from normal military practices , even in the unconventional Israeli army . 
Consider the Yom Kippur War . 
On October 16 , 1973 , ten days after Egypt &apos;s army surprised the Israelis by crossing the Suez Canal , Sharon turned defeat into victory by leading his own troops across the canal through a narrow gap in the Egyptian front . 
The Israelis swiftly spread out behind the Egyptians , overrunning anti-aircraft batteries and blocking supply and reinforcement routes . 
Within six days , Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had to plead for an immediate , unconditional ceasefire : so many Egyptian units were cut off , wrecked by air strikes , under attack , or fully encircled that no major forces were left to stop the advancing Israelis - not even to guard the road to Cairo . 
The Egyptian high command was convinced that Sharon &apos;s crossing was only an overnight raid by light forces . 
Their reasoning was sound : The Israelis did not control even their own side of the canal , so they could not possibly reinforce the first wave of a few hundred men with a handful of tanks . 
Rather than pulling their units back across the canal to chase the raiding Israelis , the Egyptian commanders believed that their forces could capture all of them by converging toward one another , thus closing the two-mile gap that Sharon had exploited . 
Sharon &apos;s superiors agreed with their Egyptian counterparts . 
They ordered Sharon to stop sending forces across the canal , and instead to widen the gap on the Israeli side . 
Sharon did not obey , pleading communications difficulties while sending as many of his forces as possible across the canal . 
He calculated that attacking the Egyptians from their own rear - destroying the missile batteries that impeded the Israeli air force , ambushing reinforcements and supplies , and simply causing massive confusion across the entire front - would induce organizational collapse in the Egyptian army . 
That is exactly what happened . 
In 1953 , at the age of 25 and already a wounded veteran of the 1947-49 War of Independence , Sharon was recalled to active duty to establish Israel &apos;s first commando unit . 
Arab raiders were crossing Israel &apos;s unfenced borders to rob cattle and steal farm implements , sometimes attacking civilians . 
Guarding Israel &apos;s elongated borders would have required 20 times more troops than Israel had . 
Sharon was given a free hand to raise and train his unit . 
Instead of insisting on discipline , his men wore whatever they liked , never saluted anybody , and never drilled . 
But they launched devastating night raids while suffering few casualties , even when going up against Jordan &apos;s Arab Legion , by far the best Arab military force . 
Sharon sought natural fighters rather than dutiful soldiers , and he carefully planned each raid , always sending some men well beyond the target of the attack to ambush any reinforcements . 
The main assault force advanced toward the target in the darkness until detected , then rushed forward , firing every weapon , while mortar and machine-gun emplacements remained in the rear , firing just ahead of the advancing troops . 
Within three years , Sharon commanded an entire brigade in the 1956 Sinai campaign , which he led in a swift advance across the desert to link up with a paratroop battalion that had been dropped deep into Egyptian territory at the entrance to the strongly defended Mitla Pass . 
There Sharon was to stop but did not , instead fighting a bloody battle to conquer the pass . 
His immediate superiors wanted him out , but the top leadership instead promoted him to command a division . 
That is how Sharon came to plan and fight the extraordinary battle of Umm Katef in the June 1967 war . 
The battle lasted only one night , but it was unique in its complexity . 
The Egyptian defenses blocked the central highway across the Sinai with a fortified box containing powerful artillery and more than a hundred tanks , fronted by three parallel trench-lines manned by thousands of infantrymen and anchored on sand dunes and high ground at each end . 
Sharon had his troops climb over the sand dunes to enter the trench lines at their top end and attack down their length - a simple maneuver that the Egyptians could have defeated had they not been pinned down by an artillery barrage and Israeli tanks firing directly at them . 
The Israeli infantrymen had taped flashlights to their helmets so that the tank gunners could direct their fire at the Egyptians just ahead of them . 
Still , the Egyptian artillery was superior , and should have at least silenced the tanks firing at the trench line . 
The Egyptians &quot; tanks could still have counter-attacked , but they were engaged by an Israeli tank battalion that appeared from well behind the trench lines , having crossed supposedly impassable sand dunes . 
Then the Israeli tanks that had been shooting up the trench lines crossed over them to enter the box , and finish off Egyptian resistance . 
The road through Umm Katef was opened . 
Sharon had once again broken the basic rules of warfare , yet won total victory . 
But , even for the unconventional Israeli army , Sharon was too unconventional . 
When he was passed over for promotion to Army Chief of Staff and retired from active duty ( he fought his epic 1973 battle as a reservist ) , a wise Israeli general warned his colleagues that he would return as Defense Minister , and that if he lost that office - as he did after the 1982 Lebanon War - he would return as Prime Minister . 
Only now has Sharon met an enemy that he cannot outmaneuver .
