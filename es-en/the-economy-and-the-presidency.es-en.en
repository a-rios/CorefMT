The Economy and the Presidency 
CAMBRIDGE - America &apos;s presidential election is now just six months away . 
If history is a reliable guide , the outcome will depend significantly on the economy &apos;s performance between now and November 6 , and on Americans &quot; perception of their economic future under the two candidates . 
At the moment , America &apos;s economy is limping along with slow growth and high unemployment . 
Output grew by just 1.5 % last year , and real GDP per capita is lower now than before the economic downturn began at the end of 2007 . 
Although annual GDP growth was 3 % in the fourth quarter of 2011 , more than half of that reflected inventory accumulation . 
Final sales to households , businesses , and foreign buyers rose at only a 1.1 % annual rate , even slower than earlier in the year . 
And the preliminary estimate for annual GDP growth in the first quarter of 2012 was a disappointing 2.2 % , with only a 1.6 % rise in final sales . 
The labor market has been similarly disappointing . 
The March unemployment rate of 8.2 % was nearly three percentage points above what most economists would consider a desirable and sustainable long-run level rate . 
Although the rate was down from 9 % a year ago , about half of the change reflected a rise in the number of people who have stopped looking for work , rather than an increase in job creation and the employment rate . 
Indeed , the official unemployment rate understates the weakness of the labor market . 
An estimated 6 % of all employees are working fewer hours per week than they would like , and about 2 % of potential employees are not counted as unemployed because they have not looked for work in the past few weeks , even though they would like to work . 
Adding these individuals to those officially classified as unemployed implies that about 15 % of potential labor-force participants are working less than they want . 
Solid increases in payroll employment at the start of the year contributed to a general sense of confidence . 
But the rate of increase in payroll employment fell in March to less than half of the rate recorded in previous months , and the number of workers claiming unemployment benefits recently jumped to a four-month high . 
Even those who are working are seeing their incomes shrink . 
Real average weekly earnings have fallen in recent months , and are now lower than they were 18 months ago . 
The broader measure of real per capita after-tax personal income has also been falling , and is back to levels last seen a year ago . 
Despite their declining incomes , households raised their spending in early 2012 at a rapid pace by cutting their saving rate to just 3.7 % . 
Without further declines in the saving rate from this very low level , consumer spending will not continue to grow as robustly . 
Recent reports of declining consumer confidence reinforce the likelihood that spending will slow in the months ahead . 
Moreover , the housing market remains in bad shape . 
The most reliable index of comparable house prices has continued to decline month after month , and prices are now about 7 % lower in real terms than a year ago , implying a $ 1 trillion loss of household wealth . 
With roughly 25 % of all homeowners with mortgages owing more than their homes are worth , the decline in house prices reflects high rates of default and foreclosure . 
Falling prices , together with stricter lending standards , has spurred a shift by would-be home buyers to the rental market , causing recent declines in the sales of both new and existing homes . 
The weakness of America &apos;s economy is not limited to the household sector . 
Industrial production has been unchanged for the past two months , and utilization of industrial capacity has declined . 
And the monthly purchasing surveys conducted by the Institute for Supply Management now indicate weaker activity among service firms as well . 
Looking ahead , strong headwinds imply that it will be difficult to achieve better economic performance in the rest of the year . 
Higher energy prices are reducing real household spending on non-energy goods and services ; weakness in Europe and Asia will hurt America &apos;s exports ; state and local governments are cutting their spending ; and concerns about higher taxes in 2013 will dampen both business investment and big-ticket consumer spending . 
The economy is thus shaping up to be a serious liability for President Barack Obama , who is likely to place the blame on the conditions that he inherited from President George W. Bush , and on the Republican majority in the House of Representatives . 
But the public is likely to place the blame on the president , and surveys indicate that a growing number of Americans believe that Mitt Romney , the almost certain Republican candidate , would do a better job than Obama at managing the economy . 
The polls are very close , and voters have not yet locked in their decisions . 
The economy could rise more sharply than expected in the months ahead . 
If not , Obama will try to shift attention from the overall economy by emphasizing his plan to raise taxes on high-income individuals . 
And a variety of other issues , including immigration and the role of women , might influence voters . 
But the state of the economy is usually the most important determinant of who wins national elections in the United States . 
And US economic conditions now favor Romney .
