Football is War 
NEW YORK - The flags are already flying , from Holland to Argentina , from Cameroon to Japan . 
Soon the drums will be beating , the trumpets blowing . 
Colors will be unfurled , and battle cries will sound . 
It &apos;s that time again : the World Cup is upon us . 
The late Rinus Michels , also known as &quot; the General , &quot; coach of the Dutch team that narrowly lost to Germany in the 1974 final , famously said , &quot; Football is war . &quot; 
When the Dutch had their revenge in 1988 and beat Germany to go on to become European champions , more people danced in the streets in Holland than on the day that the real war ended in May 1945 . 
On one occasion , in 1969 , a football match between Honduras and El Salvador actually led to military conflict , known as the Soccer War . 
Tensions between the two countries were already high . 
Of course , soccer wars are rare ( indeed , I can &apos;t think of another example ) , but the notion that international sporting competitions inevitably inspire warm fraternity - an idea advanced by Baron de Coubertin , founder of the modern Olympic games - is a romantic fiction . 
The violence of British football hooligans , for example , reflects a peculiar nostalgia for war . 
Life in peaceful times can be dull , and British glory seems a long way in the past . 
Football is an opportunity to experience the thrill of combat , without risking much more than a few broken bones . 
Even when football doesn &apos;t lead to actual bloodshed , it inspires strong emotions - primitive and tribal - evoking the days when warriors donned facial paint and jumped up and down in war dances , hollering like apes . 
The nature of the game encourages this : the speed , the collective aggression . 
Tennis does not create frenzy on a national scale . 
Not even boxing does , except on very rare occasions , such as when Joe Louis , the &quot; Brown Bomber , &quot; beat Max Schmeling , the Nazi favorite , in 1938 . 
After all , these forms of combat are between two individuals , not two tribes . 
Arthur Koestler was right when he said that there is nationalism , and there is football nationalism - and that the latter is the more deeply felt . 
Koestler himself , born in Budapest but a proud British citizen , remained a Hungarian football nationalist all his life . 
It helps to have traditional enemies , old hurts , and humiliations that need to be redressed , if only symbolically . 
It would be hard for Americans , who are neither very good at soccer , nor cursed by great historical hatreds , to share the joy of the Dutch , say , when the Germans were defeated in 1988 , or that of the Koreans when they defeat Japan . 
Perhaps the best example of this type of sporting nationalism was not a football game , but the world ice hockey final in 1969 , when Czechoslovakia beat the Soviet Union just one year after Soviet tanks rolled into Prague . 
The Czech players pointed their hockey sticks at the Russians like guns , and their victory provoked anti-Soviet riots back home . 
Clearly , then , whatever de Coubertin might have hoped , cosmopolitanism and cross-cultural brotherhood comes less naturally to human beings than the raw emotions of the tribe . 
The tribe can be a club , a clan , or a nation . 
Before World War II , football clubs often had an ethnic or religious component : Tottenham Hotspur in London was &quot; Jewish , &quot; while Arsenal was &quot; Irish . &quot; 
Vestiges of these markings remain : Ajax of Amsterdam is still taunted by provincial opponents as the &quot; Jew club . &quot; 
But a common race or religion is not essential . 
The French football heroes who won the World Cup in 1998 included men of African and Arab origin , and they were proud of it . 
Most successful modern football clubs are as mixed as Benetton advertisements , with coaches and players from all over the globe , but this seems to have done nothing to diminish the enthusiasm of local supporters . 
In some countries , football is the only thing that knits together disparate people , Shia and Sunnis in Iraq , or Muslims and Christians in Sudan . 
Of course , most right-thinking people are a bit like de Coubertin . 
Tribal emotions are embarrassing , and dangerous when given free reign . 
After World War II , for obvious reasons , the expression of nationalist emotions was virtually taboo in Europe ( not least in Germany ) . 
We had all become good Europeans , and nationalism was for racists . 
And yet , since Koestler was right , these emotions could not simply be crushed . 
They had to find some outlet , and football provided it . 
The football stadium became a kind of reservation where taboos on tribal frenzy and even racial antagonism could be relaxed , but only up to a point : when the taunting of Ajax supporters as rotten Jews degenerated into actual violence , sometimes accompanied by a collective hiss , mimicking escaping gas , the city authorities decided to step in . 
Some games have had to be played without the presence of rival supporters . 
Not all football games are fraught with negative feeling and violence . 
This year &apos;s World Cup might well be a festival of brotherhood and peace . 
Few people even care anymore when Germany wins . 
But the fact that sport can unleash primitive emotions is not a reason to condemn it . 
Since such feelings cannot simply be wished away , it is better to allow for their ritual expression , just as fears of death , violence , and decay find expression in religion or bull fighting . 
Even though some football games have provoked violence , and in one case even a war , they might have served the positive purpose of containing our more savage impulses by deflecting them onto a mere sport . 
So let the games begin , and may the best team win .
