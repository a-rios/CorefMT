A European Opening for the Arab World 
BERLIN - The people of Tunisia and Egypt have shown that democracy in Arab countries need not come at the barrel of a Western gun . 
But , while the drive for democratic change has been local and authentic , there is no guarantee of a successful political transition : democratically elected governments will have to address the same social and economic problems that contributed to the old regimes &quot; fall - not least the need to create jobs and opportunities for the young . 
This will be impossible without external support . 
Given the myriad links between the European Union countries and the Mediterranean &apos;s southern rim , Europe must not miss this opportunity . 
So far , the EU has offered to support democratization in Tunisia and Egypt by helping to organize free and fair elections , establish political parties , and reform the police , courts , and local administrations . 
But such political-administrative support is not enough . 
This is not to discount the need for such projects ; the renewable-energy sector , in particular , holds enormous opportunities for cooperation . 
Europe needs clean energy , and will not be able to produce enough on its own territory . 
The countries of North Africa also need energy - particularly more electricity and new networks to support urban and industrial development . 
Indeed , the availability of uninterrupted electricity often makes the difference between , say , a shoemaker &apos;s workshop and a shoe factory . 
And these countries have the most suitable environment for solar thermal power production . 
According to some optimistic studies , solar thermal power plants and wind farms in North Africa could not only boost economic growth there , but also provide more than 15 % of Europe &apos;s electricity by 2050 . 
Obviously , cooperation agreements and private investment in this sector should be encouraged . 
The problem is that such long-term investments bring results only in the medium and long term . 
They do not address today &apos;s social or economic problems , nor do they signal a new society-oriented approach by Europe towards its Mediterranean neighbors . 
New EU programs should mainly aim at strengthening the specific capacities of Tunisia , Egypt , and others , and seek opportunities that benefit both sides of the Mediterranean . 
Catherine Ashton , the EU &apos;s vice-president and high representative for foreign affairs and security policy , has proposed a Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean , which contains a host of useful measures , including facilitation of visas for students , academics , and business people . 
But , to make this scheme more concrete , I would suggest augmenting it with a &quot; pact for labor and skills &quot; between the EU and the Arab countries that choose a path to democratic transformation . 
Europe , while afraid of illegal migration , needs foreign labor for its own demographic reasons - not least young engineers , technical staff , doctors , and health-care workers . 
Tunisia , Egypt , and the other Southern Mediterranean countries have an abundance of young people with degrees and no jobs , who often also need to acquire practical skills . 
This is most urgent for the Arab world &apos;s baby boomers - those between 20 and 35 . 
The next generation is already smaller . 
As a practical step , the EU and its member states should offer 30,000 visas and work permits annually for graduates from participating Mediterranean countries . 
Such a program would include , first , a traineeship in European firms , followed by the opportunity to work in Europe for 5-8 years . 
At the end of that period , participants would receive soft business-startup loans from European development banks to create employment in their countries of origin . 
Designed for at least a 15-year period , such a program would be a strong signal in itself . 
It would show young people from Tunisia , Egypt , and other transformation countries that there are other options than getting on a boat to the Italian island of Lampedusa . 
It would be a real incentive to finish one &apos;s university education ( indeed , it should be augmented by investment in vocational schools , technical high-schools , and universities in North Africa and the Middle East ) . 
Once implemented , the labor pact would help to change attitudes towards Arab immigrants in Europe - and Europe &apos;s image in the Southern Mediterranean . 
It would likely create lasting ties between people and economies . 
And it would address real needs in the Southern Mediterranean countries - improving professional skills , reducing the pressure on the local labor market , creating businesses and jobs - as well as in Europe . 
Some warn against any programs for &quot; temporary &quot; or &quot; circular &quot; migration . 
To be sure , some who benefit would want to stay . 
But , while this &quot; burden &quot; might , in fact , benefit aging European countries , the risk is relatively low in the first place : Arab countries entering such a pact would be better governed than they were under the previous regimes . 
If they become consolidated democracies , as hoped , would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption . 
And start-up loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one &apos;s fortune back home . 
Such an approach needs to be communicated both to the European public and to the people of Tunisia , Egypt , and other Arab countries . 
It would reverse the pattern whereby Europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas and guard its borders against migrants . 
At long last , these countries &quot; demographic wealth would be used to meet their development needs .
