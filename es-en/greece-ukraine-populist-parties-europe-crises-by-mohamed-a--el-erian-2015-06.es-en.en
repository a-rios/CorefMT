Shelter from the Storm in Europe 
LAGUNA BEACH - Dark clouds are lowering over Europe &apos;s economic future , as three distinct tempests gather : the Greek crisis , Russia &apos;s incursion in Ukraine , and the rise of populist political parties . 
Though each poses a considerable threat , Europe , aided by the recent cyclical pickup , is in a position to address them individually , without risking more than a temporary set of disruptions . 
Should they converge into a kind of &quot; perfect storm , &quot; however , a return to sunny days will become extremely difficult to foresee any time soon . 
As it stands , the three storms are at different stages of formation . 
The Greek crisis , having been building for years , is blowing the hardest . 
Beyond the potential for the first eurozone exit , Greece could be at risk of becoming a failed state - an outcome that would pose a multi-dimensional threat to the rest of Europe . 
Mitigating the adverse humanitarian consequences ( associated with cross-border migration ) , and geopolitical impact of this storm would be no easy feat . 
The second storm , rolling in from the EU &apos;s east , is the costly military conflict in Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region . 
The crisis in eastern Ukraine has been contained only partly by the Minsk II ceasefire agreement , and reflects the deepest rupture in the West &apos;s relationship with Russia since the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse . 
Further Russian interference in Ukraine - directly and / or through separatist proxies in Donbas - would present the West with a stark choice . 
The third storm - political tumult brought about by the rise of populist political movements - poses yet another serious threat . 
Energized by broad voter dissatisfaction , particularly in struggling economies , these political movements tend to focus on a small handful of issues , opposing , say , immigrants , austerity , or the European Union - essentially whomever they can scapegoat for their countries &quot; troubles . 
Already , Greek voters handed the far-left anti-austerity Syriza party a sweeping victory in January . 
France &apos;s far-right National Front is currently second in opinion polls . 
And , in Spain , the leftist anti-austerity Podemos commands double-digit support . 
These parties &quot; extremist tendencies and narrow platforms are limiting governments &quot; policy flexibility by driving relatively moderate parties and politicians to adopt more radical positions . 
It was concern about the United Kingdom Independence Party &apos;s capacity to erode the Conservatives &quot; political base that pushed Prime Minister David Cameron to commit to a referendum on the country &apos;s continued EU membership . 
With three storms looming , Europe &apos;s leaders must act fast to ensure that they can dissipate each before it merges with the others , and cope effectively with whatever disruptions they cause . 
The good news is that regional crisis-management tools have lately been strengthened considerably , especially since the summer of 2012 , when the euro came very close to collapsing . 
Indeed , not only are new institutional circuit breakers , such as the European Financial Stability Facility , in place ; existing bodies have also been made more flexible and thus more effective . 
Moreover , the European Central Bank is engaged in a large-scale asset-purchasing initiative that could be easily and rapidly expanded . 
And countries like Ireland , Portugal , and Spain have , through hard and painful work , reduced their vulnerability to contagion from nearby crises . 
But these buffers would be severely strained if the gathering storms converged into a single devastating gale . 
Given the EU &apos;s fundamental interconnectedness - in economic , financial , geopolitical , and social terms - the disruptive impact of each shock would amplify the others , overwhelming the region &apos;s circuit breakers , leading to recession , reviving financial instability , and creating pockets of social tension . 
This would increase already-high unemployment , expose excessive financial risk-taking , embolden Russia , and strengthen populist movements further , thereby impeding comprehensive policy responses . 
Fortunately , the possibility of such a perfect storm is more a risk than a baseline at this point . 
Nonetheless , given the extent of its destructive potential , it warrants serious attention by policymakers . 
Securing Europe &apos;s economic future in this context will require , first and foremost , a renewed commitment to regional integration efforts - completing the banking union , advancing fiscal union , and moving forward on political union - that have been crowded out by a never-ending series of meetings and summits on Greece . 
Likewise , on the national level , pro-growth economic-reform initiatives - which seem to have lost some urgency in the face of overly complacent and excessively accommodating financial markets - need to be revitalized . 
This would ease the policy burden on the ECB , which is currently being forced to pursue multiple ambitious objectives that far exceed its capacity to deliver sustainably good outcomes regarding growth , employment , inflation , and financial stability . 
The current focus on the downpour in Greece is understandable . 
Europe &apos;s leaders must act now to minimize the risks , lest they find their shelters inadequate to the extreme weather that could lie ahead .
