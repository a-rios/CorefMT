Modernizing Multilateralism 
WASHINGTON , DC - 2008 will be remembered as a year of extraordinary turmoil . 
The financial crisis came on the heels of food and fuel crises . 
Now the world is in the midst of an economic crisis , which will lead to many job losses . 
Virtually no country has escaped . 
We are moving into a new danger zone , with heightened risks to exports and investment , to credit , banking systems , budgets , and balances of payments . 
In 2009 , we may see the first decline in global trade since 1982 . 
As always , the poor are the most defenseless . 
For developing countries , tighter credit conditions and much weaker growth mean that governments are less able to meet education and health goals , and to invest in the infrastructure needed to sustain growth . 
Remittances are drying up . 
Already 100 million people have been driven into poverty as a result of high food and fuel prices , and current estimates suggest that every 1 % decline in developing-country growth rates pushes an additional 20 million people into poverty . 
Countries are trying to break the credit freeze , bolster financial institutions , ease interest rates , strengthen safety nets , and revive consumption and investment in order to boost business , enable people to work , and lay the foundation for future growth . 
These steps will be most effective if countries act in concert , in a mutually supportive way . 
Economic nationalism that seeks gains from the disadvantage of others will trigger ever more dangers . 
Global challenges require global solutions . 
In October , I called for modernizing multilateralism and markets to better reflect the changing world economy and to enable countries to act in concert to address interconnected problems . 
Looking beyond the old G-7 system , we need a twenty-first-century approach to multilateralism through the dynamism of a flexible network , not new hierarchies of a fixed or static system. ampnbsp ; 
The new multilateralism must maximize the strengths of interdependent and overlapping actors and institutions , public and private . 
It should reach beyond the traditional focus on finance and trade , to include other pressing economic and political issues : development , energy , climate change , and stabilizing fragile and post-conflict states . 
It needs to draw together existing international institutions , with their expertise and resources , to reform them when necessary , and encourage effective cooperation and common action . 
Multilateralism , at its best , is a means for solving problems among countries , with the group at the table willing and able to take constructive action together . 
It needs to draw its strength - and legitimacy - from both broader participation and by achieving results . 
November &apos;s G-20 summit brought to the table for the first time the rising powers as active stakeholders to address the global financial crisis . 
They agreed to a good agenda , but the true test will be the follow-up . 
It is a positive step that leaders of major developed economies are now meeting with leaders from the rising economic powers . 
But the poorest developing countries must not be left out in the cold . 
We will not solve this crisis , or put in place sustainable long-term solutions , by accepting a two-tier world . 
The goal must be to build an inclusive and sustainable globalization . 
Trillions of dollars are now being spent on a financial rescue in the developed world . 
By comparison , about $ 100 billion a year is currently being spent on overseas aid . 
We need a &quot; human &quot; rescue as well as a financial rescue . 
In this environment , the global commitment to provide development assistance to the poorest countries must be paramount.ampnbsp ; 
At the World Bank Group , we are scaling up our financial support for those in need . 
We are speeding up grants and long-term , interest-free loans to the world &apos;s 78 poorest countries , half of them in Africa . 
Donors last year pledged $ 42 billion over three years for the World Bank &apos;s fund for these countries , the International Development Association ( IDA ) .ampnbsp ; 
This money is vital if we are to meet the Millennium Development Goals . 
In addition , the Bank &apos;s lending arm to developing countries , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , could make new commitments of more than $ 35 billion this fiscal year - almost triple last year &apos;s - and up to $ 100 billion over the next three years . 
This increase is aimed at protecting the poorest and most vulnerable from harm , supporting countries that face borrowing problems because of broken credit markets , and helping to sustain investments upon which recovery and long-term development will depend . 
Our private sector arm , the International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) , is launching or expanding three facilities to help the private sector , expected to total around $ 30 billion over the next three years . 
They will address high-priority problems that have emerged in recent months : expanding trade finance , recapitalizing banks in poorer countries , and sustaining infrastructure investment by helping viable projects facing a liquidity crisis.ampnbsp ; 
At the same time , we will continue special efforts to counter malnutrition and hunger , and provide energy to the poor.ampnbsp ; 
Our newly launched $ 6 billion Climate Investment Funds will build practical experience with technology , forestation , and adaptation to support the United Nations negotiations on climate change and assist developing countries . 
As the world digs out of the current financial and economic hole , we need to look further ahead . 
Today &apos;s crises reflect the lightning speed of an interconnected world.ampnbsp ; 
The factors that produced this globalization offer great opportunities to overcome poverty , increase opportunity , and open societies.ampnbsp ; 
But we will need a new multilateralism to expand the availability of these benefits to all .
