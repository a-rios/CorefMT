Brazil \ u0027s Baleful Bailout 
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) came through last week with a larger rescue package for Brazil than world financial markets expected . 
This should have eased fears about Brazil &apos;s future . 
So far , it hasn &apos;t . 
After an initial rally , Brazilian interest rates have settled at levels incompatible with long-term solvency . 
Its benchmark &quot; C bonds &quot; now yield around 22 % in dollar terms . 
Brazil &apos;s debt equals 60 % of GDP , of which 35 % falls due within a year . 
The IMF has required that Brazil run a &quot; primary surplus &quot; ( i.e. interest on government debt is excluded in the budget calculations ) of 3.75 % on its budget . 
But this will clearly not be able to prevent a big further deterioration in the country &apos;s debt / GDP ratio , especially as high interest rates push Brazil into recession . 
The fact that this package failed to bring relief indicates that something is fundamentally wrong with the international financial system . 
Brazil &apos;s problems cannot be blamed on anything Brazil has done wrong ; responsibility falls squarely on international financial authorities . 
Admittedly , Brazil may soon elect a president that global financial markets do not like ; but if international financial markets take precedence over democratic choice , the system is undoubtedly flawed . 
Under the influence of market fundamentalism , the IMF does not benefit all of its members sufficiently . 
In recent years , the so-called &quot; Washington consensus &quot; as espoused by the IMF and World Bank has put its faith in the self-correcting nature of financial markets . 
That faith was and is misplaced . 
Ever since financial capital began moving freely around the globe , crisis has followed crisis , with the IMF called upon to put together rescue packages of ever larger size . 
Market fundamentalists blame this state of affairs on the moral hazard created by IMF bailouts . 
In the aftermath of Asia &apos;s crisis of 1997 , the IMF switched from bailouts to &quot; bail-ins &quot; that shifted more of the risk back to international lenders . 
By doing so , the true risks of investing in emerging markets were revealed . 
What is the result ? 
Capital flows have reversed . 
Instead of capital flowing to economies on the world &apos;s periphery , it is leaving them and flowing to economies at the center . 
If stability is to be preserved , financial markets need regulators and a lender of last resort . 
But there can be no lender of last resort without a modicum of moral hazard . 
Every developed country learned this lesson domestically decades ago , but the world has yet to learn it internationally . 
The system we have in place is lopsided . 
It is designed to preserve international financial markets , not the stability of emerging economies on the periphery . 
That is what rendered the risk / reward ratio of investing in emerging markets so unfavorable . 
Once we recognize the problem , solutions can be found . 
The Washington Consensus starts by asking how big a budget surplus is needed in order to keep indebtedness within bounds ; the higher the interest rates , the bigger the required surplus . 
In the case of Brazil , with 22 % interest and 4 % growth , the primary surplus would have to be 4.8 % to keep the debt / GDP ratio from rising - an obvious impossibility . 
The right question to ask is this : what level of interest rates can be reconciled with reasonable growth ? 
A primary surplus of 3.75 % then becomes the maximum , not the minimum , that can be exacted , and it can support real interest rates of not more than 10 % . 
So the question then becomes : how do you bring interest rates down to that level ? 
This may require some international credit enhancements or guarantees . 
The world &apos;s task is to find instruments that can minimize the possibility of moral hazard and yet keep the level of real risk within tolerable bounds . 
I suggest that Instead of a traditional IMF package , the central banks of the developed countries should open their discount windows for Brazilian government debt . 
Brazilian bonds would rally and confidence would return at the sight of a lender of last resort . 
The risk would be minimized by not raising the amount the central banks are willing to lend in line with the rise in market prices . 
Commercial banks would soon reinstate their lines of credit for Brazil , which would help ensure a recovery of exports . 
The crisis would then dissolve into thin air . 
My proposal would achieve what the recently announced package failed to achieve , and at no higher a price . 
It is not too late to adopt it . 
Once it is in place , Brazil &apos;s incoming president ( no matter who he is ) would have no reason to contemplate interfering with Brazil &apos;s normal debt servicing commitments . 
As things now stand , he would be justified in demanding greater international support rather than allow his country to bleed to death as Argentina is now doing . 
In political conditions such as those that now prevail in Brazil , markets are right to take into account the possibility of a debt reorganization or even of a default . 
But once they do , their actions soon become a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
This is why financial markets cannot be left to their own devices .
