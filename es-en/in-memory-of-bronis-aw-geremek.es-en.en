In Memory of Bronisław Geremek 
Warsaw - When a friend dies unexpectedly , we recall his face , his smile , the conversations forever unfinished . 
Today I can see Bronisław Geremek , who died in a car crash a few weeks ago , in jail in Białołęka and hear his hoarse shouts from behind the bars of the prison on Rakowiecka Street . 
I see and hear Bronek in Castel Gandolfo , addressing Pope John Paul II . 
I see him also during underground meetings of &quot; Solidarity &quot; and during the 1989 Round Table negotiations ; 
And I remember dozens of private conversations , discussions , and arguments conducted over almost 40 years . 
Bronisław Geremek was one of us , to quote the words of Joseph Conrad , a writer whom Geremek admired . 
He was an activist in the democratic opposition and in Solidarity , who fought for Polish independence and human freedom , and who paid a high price for it . 
He was one who wanted to remain true to the tradition of the January Uprising and the Legions of Józef Piłsudski , to the tradition of the insurgents of the Warsaw ghetto and Warsaw Uprising , to the values of the Polish October and the student revolt of 1968 , to the values of KOR ( Workers &quot; Defense Committee ) and of &quot; Solidarity . &quot; 
Geremek knew that exclusion and enslavement destroy human dignity , and degrade our humanity . 
He knew that dictatorships lead to moral shabbiness . 
He valued freedom , authentic knowledge , independent thought , the courage of nonconformity , the spirit of resistance , the beauty of Polish romanticism , disinterested behavior , and human dignity . 
He reacted to moral shabbiness with revulsion , but also with fear . 
He saw it as a source of disposable masses , a human reservoir for totalitarian movements . 
He was both idealist and pragmatist . 
As a child , Geremek witnessed the degradation of those enslaved in the Warsaw ghetto . 
Miraculously saved from the Holocaust , he spent the rest of his life dreaming of a Poland where people lived in dignity and respected the dignity of others . 
Geremek fought for this Poland . 
He believed that everyone can change for the better , and that we must nurse the spirit of dialogue , tolerance , and the ability to forgive and to reconcile . 
He wanted a democratic Poland in a strong and democratic Europe . 
Now that he is gone , we see how much he accomplished . 
Geremek knew that a feeling of national identity and pride is priceless , and that in Poland , condemned to struggle for independence , they are necessary virtues . 
But he also knew that in the interwar period , the concept of &quot; Polishness &quot; was used as a tool of aggressive nationalism . 
For Geremek , Polishness denoted neither a biological community nor a blood lineage . 
What was important was the nation &apos;s history , whether that history was mythologized or de-mythologized , apologetic or critical . 
In relation to the past , he used to say , we make a choice of traditions , and with its help we express our views and options . 
Although events like the Stalinist terror were outside the Polish tradition as he conceived it , Geremek knew that a communal identity demands consciousness of the entirety of its history , all its good , all its evil . 
We must remember that acts which we now reject were also possible within our community , as we work to make what was once possible impossible . 
Bronek was proud of Poland &apos;s stubborn will to freedom , its achievements , the democratic transformation which , thanks to the compromise reached at the Round Table negotiations , allowed for a bloodless end to dictatorship . He was proud of Poland &apos;s membership in NATO and the European Union , of Polish economic successes . 
But he also worried . 
A year ago , together with Lech Wałęsa and Tadeusz Mazowiecki , he warned : &quot; A state that we treated as a common good is being treated as a trophy to be seized by the rulers . 
Freedom and independence , to which we tried to point the way , are not accompanied by a sense of solidarity , especially towards those who are weaker and poorer . 
Insults and squabbles fill our political stage and ruin the citizens &quot; trust in the government . 
Institutions which should protect the law are becoming tools in the hands of the rulers , and we are witnessing serious accusations that they are being abused . &quot; This declaration was accompanied by a dramatic appeal to &quot; cleanse Polish politics of dirt , fury , and hatred . &quot; 
Geremek &apos;s essay about Marc Bloch , the French historian and anti-Nazi resistance fighter , is among his greatest intellectual and moral accomplishments . 
In writing about Bloch , Geremek described himself , particularly when he recalled Bloch &apos;s self-definition as being part of &quot; liberal , disinterested , and humanely progressive traditions of thought . &quot; 
And he was describing himself as well when he cited Bloch : &quot; Attached to my country , fed with her spiritual heritage and its history , unable to imagine any other country where I could breathe freely , I loved and served it with all my strength . 
I am a Jew . 
I see this as a reason neither for pride nor for shame . 
I appeal to my ancestry only in one single case : when I encounter an anti-Semite . 
Nevertheless , I would like to leave just this one honest testimony : I am dying , just as I lived , as a good Frenchman . &quot; 
Geremek had two messages about anti-Semitism . 
The first , directed inside Poland , was that we have to fight anti-Semitism and all its manifestations , even when marginal . 
The second , directed to western public opinion , was that we should not play with outmoded stereotypes . 
Bronisław Geremek died with a clear conscience and clean hands . 
His lived Conrad &apos;s credo : &quot; I shall be faithful , &quot; and also &quot; To follow the dream , and again to follow the dream . &quot; 
Bronek , you were faithful .
