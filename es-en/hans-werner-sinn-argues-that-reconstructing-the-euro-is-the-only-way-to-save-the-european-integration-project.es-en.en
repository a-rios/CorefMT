Rescuing Europe from the Ground Up 
MUNICH - The European Union has earned its place as an instrument for peace in Europe . 
Free trade has brought prosperity to its peoples , and the freedom to choose a place of residence guards against the resurgence of totalitarian regimes . 
The Acquis Communautaire protects all member states &quot; citizens under the rule of law . 
Anyone who doubts the existence of these benefits need only look to Kyiv &apos;s &quot; Euromaidan , &quot; where hundreds of thousands of people have been gathered for weeks to demonstrate their support for closer ties with Europe , rather than an alliance with Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia . 
The paradox is that the same enthusiasm and benefits do not apply when it comes to Europe &apos;s common currency . 
On the contrary , the euro has plunged southern Europe and France into a deep economic crisis that is fraying the nerves of all involved . 
I have never seen so many swastikas and hateful slogans directed at Germany . 
The ex-head of the Eurogroup , Luxembourg &apos;s longtime Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker , has said that 2013 makes him think of 1913 , when no one could imagine what would happen a year later . 
That may be stretching things a bit , but a statement like this by such a distinguished politician is chilling . 
Unfortunately , the crisis is far from over . 
While the insurance that the European Central Bank has offered , free of charge , to buyers of EU members &quot; government bonds has temporarily calmed financial markets , ordinary workers fretting about their jobs look to the future with trepidation . 
In Greece and Spain , half of all young people not studying are unemployed , as is a quarter of the adult workforce . 
Particularly worrying is the continuing rise in unemployment in France and Italy , where industrial production has been shrinking and price competitiveness continues to deteriorate . 
The euro itself is responsible for this debacle . 
During the first several years after the EU &apos;s Madrid Summit in 1995 officially launched the move toward a common currency , too much capital was steered into southern Europe , creating an inflationary credit bubble there . 
An inordinately lax regulatory environment proved lethal , encouraging northern European banks to pad their balance sheets with southern European government and bank bonds . 
When the bubble burst , it left in its wake woefully expensive economies that had lost their competitiveness . 
Europe should now use the calm between the storm fronts to rethink the European currency union from the ground up . 
The effort to create a European equivalent of the dollar and impose a fiscal union on top of it , despite the absence of a common European state , is bound to fail . 
It will turn member countries into debtors and creditors to each other , stoking even more animosity . 
The fundamental requirement for functioning monetary and fiscal unions in Europe is the establishment of a United States of Europe , with a real parliament that gives all citizens equal representation , together with a common legal system . 
Above all , the success of the European peace project requires a common army and a common foreign policy - that is , a genuine , long-lasting mutual-insurance union based on reciprocity in ensuring security and stability . 
Those who try to anticipate such a common state with a fiscal union will never achieve their goal . 
Because France is not yet willing to accept a common European state , we need an intermediate stage to preserve and stabilize the eurozone . 
This requires sorting out the current mess and introducing a flexible membership system based on hard budget constraints . 
Four measures are needed to achieve this . 
First , a debt conference is needed , with creditors of the southern European governments and banks forgiving part of the debt . 
The creditors relinquishing part of their claims must include public entities , first and foremost the ECB , that have now largely replaced private lenders . 
Second , eurozone members whose path to regaining competitiveness through price and wage reductions is too long and grueling , and whose societies risk being rent asunder by the necessary imposition of austerity , must temporarily exit the monetary union . 
The pain of exiting should be cushioned with communal financial help , which would not be necessary for long , because a devaluation of the new currency would quickly restore competitiveness . 
In fact , a &quot; breathing eurozone &quot; that permits - and regulates - exit and re-accession should be clearly stipulated . 
Europe needs a system that is halfway between the dollar and a fixed-exchange-rate system like Bretton Woods . 
Third , this breathing currency union must include hard budget constraints on its members &quot; national central banks . 
Specifically , a ceiling must be set on local money creation by establishing the obligation to settle balance-of-payments imbalances with gold or other comparably safe means of payment . 
Finally , bankruptcy regulation for countries is essential in order to make it clear to investors from the outset that they are taking on risk . 
This is the only way to avoid the destabilizing credit flows that drove southern Europe to ruin . 
If we are serious about deepening European integration , we must recognize that there is no credible alternative to reforming the euro from the ground up . 
Otherwise , Europe &apos;s admirers and aspirants , like those in Ukraine , will eventually look elsewhere .
