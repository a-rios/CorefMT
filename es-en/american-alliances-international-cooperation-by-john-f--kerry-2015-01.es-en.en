Alliances for Peace 
WASHINGTON , DC - I grew up in the shadow of World War II , and at the dawn of the Cold War . 
My father &apos;s work as a Foreign Service officer gave me an opportunity to see history up close in a searing way : I will never forget walking the beaches of Normandy with him and seeing the burned hulks of Higgins &quot; boats still on those shores , just a few years after so many young men went to their graves so the world could be free . 
Likewise , I will never forget the eerie feeling of riding my bike through the Brandenburg Gate from West Berlin into the East , and seeing the contrast between people who were free and those who were trapped behind the Iron Curtain . 
What strikes me now , all these years later , is that a generation of leaders won not only a war , but also the peace . 
They did it together . 
Old enemies became new allies , and together pioneered a new global economic system that made the world more prosperous . 
And even as the Cold War raged , leaders found ways to cooperate on arms control and prevent a nuclear Armageddon . 
In short , by building effective and indispensable international institutions and strategic partnerships , we did not just avoid another catastrophic world war ; we ultimately ended the Cold War and lifted global living standards for hundreds of millions of people . 
Today , the world order faces new challenges . 
Russian aggression is rattling allies . 
Extremists who hijack religion threaten governments and people everywhere . 
We have gone from a world where power resided in hierarchies to one where it inhabits networks . 
The international institutions and partnerships that emerged in the postwar years demand both maintenance and modernization . 
In the face of all of this turbulence , some suggest that America should turn inward . 
That is nothing new . 
Some argued the same after WWII . 
They were wrong then - and they are wrong now . 
The need for leadership has never been greater , and the US has never been more engaged with the world . 
Our role in Afghanistan &apos;s first-ever peaceful , democratic transition reminds us all that , having invested so much blood and treasure in helping to give Afghans a chance to succeed in battle , the world has just as much responsibility to help its leaders succeed in governance . 
We know that the destruction of 100 % of Syria &apos;s declared chemical weapons would not have happened without direct , hands-on diplomacy and perseverance , just as Syria &apos;s immoral and horrifying civil war will not end without an equal commitment . 
So , too , in Asia , where President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping just announced ambitious commitments to tackle climate change , we are reminded of what countries can accomplish together with real leadership - and of how much additional leadership is required to conclude a successful climate agreement in Paris next year . 
The world has changed , and we are changing with it . 
Lines on the map no longer contain the gravest threats , and the players are no longer divided neatly into two camps . 
In the twenty-first century , next door is everywhere . 
That is why the world needs coalition diplomacy . 
No country can defeat terrorism on its own . 
No country can solve the existential threat of climate change alone . 
No country can eradicate extreme poverty , combat potential pandemics , or improve nuclear security by itself . 
None of us can live safer , richer lives by turning our back to the world . 
We must build on our history of working with allies by forming new coalitions - with governments , with civil society , and , yes , with everyday people . 
A good example is the international effort to confront the Islamic State &apos;s malign brutality in Iraq and Syria . 
Political , humanitarian , and intelligence tools from more than 60 countries are being used to support unified military action . 
Success depends not on what one or even a handful of countries can do alone , but on what all of us are able to achieve by moving forward together against this common threat . 
On an equally important front , the US is working with the United Nations to galvanize a global response to the danger posed by the Ebola virus . 
I have personally talked with more than 50 foreign leaders , and we all agree that only by coordinating our actions can we stop the devastation in West Africa and halt Ebola &apos;s spread . 
We are making progress on both issues , but much work remains . 
Bringing together countries with competing interests and varying resources is hard work . 
It demands intense diplomatic engagement and calls upon relationships that have been built and maintained over decades , as well as alliances with new partners . 
But by overcoming differences and coordinating efforts to defeat the Islamic State and conquer Ebola , we are reinforcing support for a world order grounded in collective solutions to common problems . 
Cooperation is equally vital in reinforcing the bedrock economic principles on which America and other countries built their postwar prosperity . 
Frustration cannot grow faster than opportunity in any country . 
For example , the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) reflect President Obama &apos;s determination to strike an accord with countries that represent one-third of global trade and 40 % of global GDP . 
The benefits - for both the US and our partners - are enormous . 
Estimates are that the TPP could provide $ 77 billion a year in real income and support 650,000 new jobs in the US alone . 
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated with the European Union offers another major step toward increasing trade . 
Whether for mutual security or shared prosperity , genuine partnerships are not built overnight . 
Patient diplomacy and a collective will are needed to advance common goals . 
America &apos;s objectives remain the same as they have been for decades - peace , prosperity , and stability for the US and for our partners around the world .
