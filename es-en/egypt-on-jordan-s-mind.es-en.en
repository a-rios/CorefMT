Egypt on Jordan &apos;s Mind 
AMMAN - The behavior of Jordan &apos;s Royal Court in the days following the official announcement of the victory of the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt &apos;s presidential election tells an intriguing story . 
At first , Jordan &apos;s King Abdullah II hesitated to sign a long-sought-after election law . 
This was followed by approval of the law , a request for its revision , and a surprise official meeting with the leader of Hamas . 
During the past year , King Abdullah has been adamant that Jordanians should vote in free and fair elections no later than the end of 2012 . 
Constitutional changes were adopted . 
An independent election commission was created by law . 
And a respected Jordanian jurist who had been a judge at the International Court of Justice was reprimanded for dragging his feet in getting the election law passed . 
So why did the king wait four days after both houses of parliament passed the law to sign it , and why did he immediately ask for changes ? 
The law , which establishes a largely majoritarian system based on single-member districts , with only 17 of the parliament &apos;s 140 seats to be elected according to national party lists , was approved by Jordan &apos;s Senate just hours before Egypt &apos;s independent election commission declared Morsi the winner . 
People to whom I spoke in Jordan &apos;s government and palace say that they were led to believe that the post would go to Mubarak &apos;s last prime minister , Ahmed Shafiq . 
Morsi &apos;s victory changed everything . 
Jordan &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood boycotted the country &apos;s parliamentary election in 2010 , arguing that the government &quot; did not provide any guarantees of its integrity . &quot; 
In the 2007 election , the Brotherhood accused the government of &quot; fraud , &quot; and opposed the majoritarian electoral system . 
Senior officials in Jordan have been slowly walking back from the comprehensive political reforms that were promised in the initial euphoria of the Arab Spring . 
Many , including former Prime Minister Awn Khasawneh , believe that this reflects a belief among senior Jordanian officials that the Arab Spring has run its course in Jordan and the region . 
After all , popular protests have failed to gather steam ; 
But Khasawneh , who had encouraged Islamists to join the political process , and forged a rapprochement with the Palestinian Islamic movement Hamas , warns that it is a mistake to write off the Arab Spring . 
In May , shortly after his resignation , he warned Jordanian leaders of complacency in the reform process . 
His last word after being replaced by a conservative was to remind Jordan &apos;s leaders that spring is a season that always returns . 
With the announcement of Morsi &apos;s victory in Egypt , spring seems to have returned to Jordan more quickly than even Khasawneh had expected . 
The Islamic Action Front , the Brotherhood &apos;s political party in Jordan , continued to reject the majoritarian electoral system , which favors tribes over political parties and other important social groups . 
In particular , owing to the relative insignificance of national party lists , Jordanians of Palestinian origin , who comprise nearly half the electorate , receive only a small percentage of elected officials . 
The King &apos;s approval of the law will allow the newly established election commission to begin its work . 
But now he wants the parliament to make the law more representative as well . 
Indeed , he welcomed Hamas leader Khaled Mashal in an official meeting that included a royal lunch , meetings with Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh , and , most important , talks with the head of Jordan &apos;s intelligence service , which in 1999 had recommended the expulsion from Jordan of Mashal and four other senior Hamas officials . 
The decisions to improve the election law and receive Mashal are not aimed solely at persuading Jordan &apos;s own Islamists to join the political process . 
Like other Arab countries , Jordan , with seven million people , looks up to Egypt , its most populous and powerful Arab neighbor . 
And , economically , Jordan is still dependent on Egypt for natural gas , which is delivered at reduced rates . 
Jordan seems to have read the political tea leaves and concluded that it makes more sense to improve relations with Egypt &apos;s rising leaders than it does to fight them . 
And better relations with Egypt presuppose closer ties with Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood .
