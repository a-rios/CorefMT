Small Steps to European Growth 
PARIS - The topics chosen by the European Central Bank for its annual forum in Sintra , Portugal , at the end of May were not deflation , quantitative easing , or financial stability . 
They were unemployment , productivity , and pro-growth reforms . 
Draghi is undoubtedly right . 
The European Commission now expects growth in the eurozone to reach 1.5 % in 2015 and 1.9 % in 2016 . That certainly looks good in comparison to the near-stagnation of recent years . 
The fact that leaders and pundits are hailing this brighter outlook indicates just how diminished our expectations have become . 
Until recently , fiscal austerity and the euro crisis could be blamed for poor economic performance . 
Although growth may exceed the Commission &apos;s forecast , there are reasons to be concerned about the eurozone &apos;s growth potential . 
In order to strengthen that potential , central bankers can only advocate economic reforms ; it is governments that are responsible for adopting them . 
And critics point out that repeated exhortations could prove counterproductive . 
After all , central banks are quick to rebut monetary-policy suggestions from governments in the name of independence . 
Why should governments behave differently ? 
Draghi has good reason to insist that , in the absence of significant national action , the eurozone might well stumble from crisis to crisis until its very viability is jeopardized . 
Participation in a monetary union is a demanding endeavor that requires policy agility among its participating countries , as well as a sense of common purpose . 
But governments have good reason to argue that , as far as reforms are concerned , policymaking requires precision and political realism , which outside advice often lacks . 
The ECB simply cannot whip the European Union into shape . 
A natural solution could be for the ECB to rely on the other European institutions . 
Since 2010 , the EU has been piling up coordination procedures in the hope of pushing governments into enacting politically difficult reforms . 
Each year , every member country is handed a to-do list of public spending , labor-market , and competition reforms , as well as other recommendations . 
The European Commission is also trying to lure reluctant governments into bolder action by offering them more fiscal room . 
And , two years ago , German Chancellor Angela Merkel floated the idea of individually tailored &quot; reform contracts &quot; that , again , would create incentives for governments to enact pro-growth reforms . 
But the effectiveness of these initiatives has proved to be limited , to say the least . 
Schemes aimed at strengthening policy coordination have merely added complexity to an already Byzantine architecture of procedures . 
Recommendations issued to individual countries lack both traction in national capitals and coherence at the eurozone level . 
The EU has a strong hand when a country is in need of financial assistance , but otherwise it can do little more than offer counsel . 
The eurozone must overcome this shortcoming , but no simple solution is at hand . 
Proposals are expected in the coming months . 
There is broad agreement that streamlining is required ; but that will not suffice . 
Some advocate further centralization of decisions ; but that will not help , either , because reforms are intrinsically national , if not sub-national . 
Instead , progress can be made in three directions . 
First , the ECB &apos;s analysis of the economic challenges facing the eurozone should be very transparent . 
Governments should know precisely how Draghi and his colleagues assess the potential for growth and employment and how this will affect monetary policy . 
They should have a clear idea of what they can expect from the ECB and what outcome ( rather than precise measures ) the ECB expects from them . 
Second , the EU should support the creation of national institutions to monitor domestic developments and their compatibility with overall eurozone goals . 
These could be modeled on the fiscal councils that were created a few years ago in each member country to assess national governments &quot; public-finance plans . 
Because they are part of the national conversation , these councils have proved to be a useful addition . 
In the same way , competitiveness councils could monitor the evolution of wages and prices , employment and growth , and the current account , and provide recommendations to national governments and social partners . 
Such institutions would be much better placed than the EU to formulate timely and granular reform recommendations . 
Third , the EU could foster aggregate action in high-priority areas by implementing schemes to support individual citizens , companies or public entities , access to which would be conditional on national policies fulfilling minimal requirements . 
For example , the EU could create a training support scheme for unemployed young people , but make it contingent on the elimination of national policies that hinder youth employment . 
Or it could create a scheme to support higher education , but reserve it for universities in countries where educational institutions have been granted a minimum degree of autonomy . 
The justification would be that EU money can help only in the context of supportive national policies in the same field . 
Conditionality of this sort would be positive , local , and non-punitive ; it would serve as a carrot , not a stick . 
These are modest proposals , because , when it comes to pro-growth reform in Europe , there is no magic bullet . 
There can be no centralization , and coordination always risks becoming murky . 
But the measures recommended here would serve to build a more decentralized , incentive-based policy regime . 
This would be a good start .
