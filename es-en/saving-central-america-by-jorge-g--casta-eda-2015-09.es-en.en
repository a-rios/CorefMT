Saving Central America 
MEXICO CITY - Four Central American countries - Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , and Nicaragua - are struggling , still burdened by the legacy of the last century &apos;s wars . 
They are resilient yet incomplete democracies , challenged by poverty , violence , and corruption - and all but forgotten by the international community . 
But now there is reason to hope that these countries &quot; prospects could improve . 
Nicaragua , it should be noted , is not quite in the same category as Central America &apos;s other three . 
Like them , it suffered through a brutal and protracted civil war ; unlike them , however , successive governments have built institutions capable of supporting a reasonable level of territorial control and domestic security . 
By contrast Guatemala , El Salvador , and Honduras suffer levels of violence that are among the highest in the world , laying waste to cities and slums , bleeding younger generations , and driving away investment and tourism . 
The specifics vary across countries , but the results are the same . 
In Honduras , local gangs work with international organized crime groups . 
Since 2005 , with the help of Venezuelan Chávistas and Mexican capos , the country has served as a pipeline for illegal drugs , especially cocaine , from Venezuela to Mexico and the United States . 
In Guatemala , the major criminal organizations have long been embedded in the state , making gangs more of a vehicle of social mobility than anything else . 
Since Mexico closed its air space to drug traffickers &quot; planes from Colombia and Venezuela , Guatemala &apos;s coasts and highways have become crucial to the trade , with local , Mexican , and Colombian traffickers fighting for control . 
In El Salvador , drug traffickers have a smaller presence ( the country is not exactly a route to the north ) , and the country &apos;s armed gangs have a different origin : Los Angeles . 
During El Salvador &apos;s civil war , hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled to the US , where some joined gangs for protection and a livelihood . 
About 15 years ago , many of these gang members were deported , bringing their criminal activities with them . 
A ceasefire with the gang leaders , reached under the previous government , dampened the violence for a while . 
But the current administration &apos;s decision to cancel the deal ( which was weakening anyway ) triggered a fierce response from major gangs . 
With the government now fighting back , violence has reached unprecedented levels : 250 deaths just in the first week of August . 
Given their instability , it is perhaps not surprising that these countries &quot; diasporas play a central role in their economies . 
Nicaragua , whose emigrants typically head south to Costa Rica or to work in Panama &apos;s construction industry , depends on remittances for 10 % of its GDP . 
Guatemala receives as much as 10 % of its national income from expatriates , usually in the US . 
Remittances account for 17 % of Honduras &quot; GDP , and 17 % of El Salvador &apos;s . 
Despite US efforts to deport Central Americans who reach its territory , and Mexico &apos;s attempt to seal its southern border to help its northern neighbor , the flow of immigrants continues . 
As the former Salvadoran politician Joaquín Villalobos has warned , the region is at risk of becoming so dependent on external funds , whether remittances or aid , that its labor capabilities and capacity for innovation could all but disintegrate , condemning it to persistent poverty . 
Central America &apos;s struggling countries need help to escape their current predicament . 
Fortunately , after decades of mostly staying out of the region &apos;s affairs , the US appears ready to get involved again , this time in a positive way . 
This is appropriate , given America &apos;s role - from the &quot; war on drugs &quot; launched in 1971 to the dirty wars of the 1980s - in creating and sustaining the region &apos;s problems . 
So far , the US has focused almost exclusively on limiting drug trafficking . 
But the variety and scale of the challenges facing the region is compelling President Barack Obama &apos;s administration to act on other issues , from migration , which affects the US directly , to violence and corruption . 
Most promisingly , the US is taking an active role in revitalizing and transforming the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala ( CICIG ) , created in 2006 . 
Originally financed by the European Union and others involved in the 1996 peace agreements , which ended 36 years of civil war , CICIG aimed to aid in the investigation and prosecution &quot; of the crimes committed by members of the illegal bodies of security . &quot; 
More recently , CICIG has focused on government corruption , becoming a more significant body than ever . 
Since the start of this year , it has implicated several members of President Otto Pérez Molina &apos;s cabinet , as well as the president himself , in major corruption scandals . 
Vice President Roxana Baldetti was forced to resign , after reports linked her to a group accused of taking bribes to avoid levying customs taxes , and was arrested in August . 
Then Molina himself stepped down and was arrested immediately . 
With a strong new Colombian commissioner and 200 security officers and 200 prosecutors , all of them foreigners , together with sufficient resources and the support of the US embassy , CICIG has become a powerful instrument in the fight against one of Guatemala &apos;s worst blights . 
As a high government official has put it : &quot; It hurts to admit that we are unable to clean up our own house , but it is better that someone else does it than that nobody does . &quot; 
The rest of Central America is taking note . 
In Honduras , citizens have taken to the streets , sometimes even approaching the US embassy directly , to demand the establishment of an equivalent to CICIG in their country . 
Even in El Salvador , where corruption poses a lesser challenge , demands for an analogous commission have arisen . 
Such institutions , together with the billion dollars that the US promised to the three countries last year , could help put them on the path toward stability . 
Perhaps it could even enable them to revive the old dream of a customs union , possibly including Nicaragua and / or Costa Rica . 
This is the first ray of hope the region has seen in a while . 
One hopes that it signals a long-awaited new dawn .
