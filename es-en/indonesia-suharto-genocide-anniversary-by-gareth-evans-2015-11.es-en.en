Indonesia &apos;s Forgotten Genocide 
CANBERRA - October marked 50 years since the Indonesian military launched one of the twentieth century &apos;s worst mass murders . 
Yet the anniversary passed almost unnoticed . 
The massacre of some 500,000 members or sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party ( PKI ) during 1965-1966 is the least talked-about genocide of the last century . 
Lifting the veil on the bloodbath is long overdue , but those with a past to hide seem bound to resist this . 
Organizers of Bali &apos;s renowned Ubud Writers and Readers Festival have just had a foretaste of what may be a new round of active censorship , with local officials threatening to cancel the entire festival if proposed panel discussions of the massacres went ahead . 
The killings started in October 1965 in the aftermath of an abortive coup allegedly planned by the PKI . 
The military reacted by portraying the party and its supporters as an atheist force of evil which had to be annihilated . 
The resulting carnage was deliberate , systematic , and spanned the country , with the most horrific and intense violence in Central and East Java , Bali , and northern Sumatra . 
This year also marks the centenary of the Armenian genocide , about which successive Turkish governments have maintained an indefensible denial . 
By contrast , the Indonesian genocide remains the only killing of this scale that has not been the subject of minute international attention . 
Nor , apart from a largely ignored National Human Rights Commission report in 2012 , has there been any significant domestic truth-finding , let alone a reconciliation process or reparations . 
The subject is avoided in history books , evaded by diplomats , and forms no part of domestic political discourse . 
The story begins with an abortive coup on the night of September 30 , 1965 , when junior military officers , claiming to be protecting President Sukarno from a right-wing clique , captured and executed the army commander and five other high-ranking generals . 
The following evening , Major General - later President - Suharto led a successful counter-coup . 
Suharto &apos;s action marked the beginning of the end of the Sukarno era , and the birth of his &quot; New Order &quot; : the pro-Western , business-friendly regime that would govern Indonesia for the next three decades . 
Suharto and his associates immediately blamed the PKI as the masterminds of the &quot; September 30 Movement , &quot; and spread gruesome stories about the torture and mutilation of the executed officers . 
Army-led and militia-implemented mass murders soon followed . 
Controversy continues to this day as to who was actually responsible for the initial coup . 
Candidates include Suharto himself ( he certainly had some foreknowledge of events ) , acting with or without United States support , and even the British Foreign Office . 
The balance of opinion among international scholars is that a small group around PKI leader Aidit was involved , but not in a way that even remotely implicated the entire party , or that could even begin to justify the bloody nationwide purge which followed . 
With Suharto &apos;s accession to power , Indonesia shifted almost overnight from being a strong voice for neutrality and anti-imperialism , actively courting the attention of the Soviet Union and Communist China , to becoming a more compliant partner with the US , which now saw Indonesia as a major stabilizing force in a volatile region . 
As a result , there was no appetite among the US and its allies - including my own country , and the Australian government of which I was a member - to look closely , then or since , at how Suharto &apos;s New Order consolidated its power . 
Within Indonesia itself , even with the Suharto era long gone , anti-communist sentiment remains strong , survivors remain cowed , and demands for justice and accountability remain few . 
Things may , however , be starting to change , especially following the release three years ago of Joshua Oppenheimer &apos;s extraordinary documentary film , The Act of Killing . 
Some viewers are not persuaded of the film &apos;s accuracy , or are troubled by the occasionally surreal character of the film-within-a-film structure adopted by the director . 
I hope that Oppenheimer &apos;s film and its recently released follow-up , The Look of Silence , achieve the audience and impact they deserve - and not just at the world &apos;s film festivals , but in Indonesia itself . 
The Indonesian genocide - and it deserves to be so described , even if its impulse was ideological rather than ethnic , religious , or national - is an alarming case study in the politics of mass murder . 
It shows what leaders can get away with when they demonize opponents , achieving conceivably defensible ends by morally atrocious means . 
That is just one reason Indonesia &apos;s campaign of killing demands much more of the world &apos;s attention , and censure , than it has so far received .
