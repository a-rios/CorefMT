Israel versus America versus Iran 
TEL AVIV - Israel &apos;s concern about the specter of a nuclear Iran has now degenerated into a crisis of confidence concerning the United States . 
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has embarked on a campaign to force President Barack Obama to set a red line that Iran must not cross , lest it risk unleashing an American military response . 
Implicit threats of a unilateral Israeli attack , together with conspicuous meddling in the US presidential election campaign , have compounded Netanyahu &apos;s effort to twist Obama &apos;s arm . 
The controversy between the two allies partly reflects their divergent timelines : for Israel , the red line is Iran &apos;s imminent burial deep underground of its uranium-enrichment facilities ; for the US , it is the start of a dedicated weapons program . 
But , equally important , the dispute underscores their different objectives . 
For Israel , war with Iran is not about neutralizing an existential threat ; it is about reasserting its regional status . 
Israel &apos;s leaders see their country &apos;s standing in the region being seriously threatened by the emergence of a hostile Islamist regime in Egypt ; the possibility that a similarly hostile regime will eventually emerge in Syria ; the fragility of traditionally friendly Jordan ; and the dangerous boost that the regional Islamist awakening has given to Israel &apos;s sworn enemies , Hamas and Hezbollah . 
Both Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak thus regard an attack on Iran as a major strategic move aimed at the broader Middle East , which implies that they would not discount a military campaign that goes well beyond surgical air strikes . 
Indeed , they probably contemplate land incursions into Iran , and possibly a decisive - and , from their perspective , long overdue - showdown with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon . 
Though determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , even if doing so requires military action , the US weighs the consequences of a military showdown in very different terms . 
A superpower that has earned only frustration in its abortive efforts - whether war or regional diplomacy - in the dysfunctional Middle East , the US faces the Iran crisis in the midst of its epochal strategic shift to Asia and the Pacific . 
The fallout from a war in Iran would pin down the US in the Middle East for years to come , undermining its new strategic priorities . 
As a result , the US , though certainly better equipped than Israel for a war to ensure that Iran forever abandons its nuclear ambitions , could nonetheless conclude that that objective is simply too costly . 
The recent report by The Iran Project , whose signatories include the former US national security advisers Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski , concluded that an American military attack on Iran could only delay its nuclear program for up to four years . 
To guarantee that Iran never acquires a nuclear bomb , the US would need to maintain military pressure on Iran for several years . 
And , if forced to impose regime change as the ultimate solution to the dilemma , the report assumes that this would require military occupation , which would entail a commitment of resources and personnel greater than what the US invested in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined . 
Moreover , the conventional assumption that the region &apos;s Sunni Arab regimes would give tacit approval to a military attack on Iran &apos;s nuclear installations must be revisited in the wake of the Arab Spring - particularly in the aftermath of the recent , sudden upsurge in anti-American violence throughout the Muslim world . 
The pre-Arab Spring paradigm that framed the Middle East as being divided between &quot; moderates &quot; and &quot; extremists &quot; has become obsolete . The Islamist governments that have emerged from the downfall of America &apos;s puppet regimes are no friends of an Iranian nuclear empire . 
But , in their struggle to survive , they must channel popular anti-Americanism . 
For Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi , that imperative meant placating the angry mob that recently attacked the US embassy rather than merely condemning the violence . 
An attack on Iran , especially if it develops into a longer war involving regional proxies , is bound to become the trigger for mass anti-Israel and anti-US hysteria , which might draw the Islamist regimes in the region into a dynamic of escalation . 
It would be impossible to rule out a regional war . 
The main problem facing a military operation in Iran is the need to ensure its legitimacy . 
China and Russia would never allow the US to secure a United Nations mandate for an attack . 
Moreover , while Iranian provocations that clearly reveal the regime &apos;s intentions to develop a nuclear-weapons capability might help build support for American military action , it is far from certain that Europeans , or others , would rush to join another US-led &quot; coalition of the willing . &quot; 
The dire legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan weighs heavily on the Western democracies . 
The saddest part of the story is Israel &apos;s utter indifference to the need to build international legitimacy for its drive to stop Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Netanyahu thinks in bold military terms , not in terms of geopolitical strategy . 
His careless Palestine policy has left Israel with few friends in the international community , let alone in the Arab Middle East . 
Indeed , many regard Netanyahu &apos;s Iran obsession as nothing more than a successful ploy to divert attention from the Palestinian issue . 
Only a generous , bold peace initiative that would genuinely revive the two-state solution , accompanied by a freeze on construction and enlargement of West Bank settlements , would help to recover the good will of the Palestinians and their brethren throughout the Arab world .
