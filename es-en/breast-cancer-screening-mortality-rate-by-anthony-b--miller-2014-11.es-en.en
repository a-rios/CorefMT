The Screening Myth 
TORONTO - Breast-cancer screening has long been viewed as one of the most important tools for reducing mortality from the disease . 
That is why recent doubts about its effectiveness - intensified by the publication in February of the 25-year follow-up to the Canadian National Breast Screening Study - have come as such a shock . 
How can breast-cancer screening , which facilitates early detection of the disease , not prevent deaths from it ? 
Understanding screening &apos;s limitations requires , first and foremost , an understanding of the process . 
A mammogram ( x-ray of the breast ) is administered to ostensibly healthy people to detect unsuspected disease . 
If any abnormalities are found , a diagnostic test is conducted to confirm the presence of the disease . 
If the results are positive , treatment begins . 
The first limitation of breast-cancer screening is obvious : where effective diagnosis and treatment are not available , screening cannot have any impact . 
But there is more to the issue - namely , whether screening ultimately fulfills its intended purpose of reducing breast-cancer mortality rates . 
There have been several attempts to evaluate , through observational studies , the impact of screening in the general population . 
But such studies , which are based on comparisons between uncontrolled groups , tend to produce biased results . 
None has been able to account for differences in treatment . 
More important , none has found a reduction in advanced breast cancer in the screened groups - a requirement to deem screening effective . 
With observational studies producing inadequate results , scientists turned to a procedure developed years ago to evaluate new tuberculosis drugs : randomized screening trials . 
Such trials begin with the selection of women at risk of developing breast cancer , and randomly allocate them to be screened or not . 
Any woman in either group who develops breast cancer is treated to the fullest extent possible , following the closest possible treatment plan to other participants in the trial ( taking into consideration the stage of the disease at diagnosis ) . 
Researchers follow the women &apos;s progress over many years , with the goal of comparing the two groups &quot; mortality rates . 
In North America , where , for ethical reasons , randomization requires informed consent , only two such trials have been conducted . 
The first was in New York in the 1960s , using annual mammograms and breast examinations for the screened group . 
The second , the Canadian National Breast Screening Study , which began in the 1980s , also used annual mammograms and breast examinations for the screened group . 
But , in the control group , women aged 50-59 also received annual clinical breast examinations , and women aged 40-49 were given a single breast examination . 
In Europe , one trial began in the United Kingdom in the 1970s , again using breast examinations and mammography for the screened group . 
A more recent British trial , performed on women aged 39-41 , used only mammography , as did the largest of all , the Swedish two-county trial . 
Though the trial results have been inconsistent , the conclusion is clear : breast-cancer screening does not reduce mortality rates . 
The trials that have shown a significant decrease in mortality are usually older , and other factors have compromised the results . 
For example , the Swedish two-county trial was randomized by clusters of population groups , and the comparability between the women in the screened and control groups was not confirmed . 
Moreover , the trial was conducted before modern breast-cancer treatments were freely available . 
More recent trials , such as that conducted in the UK , show at most a non-significant benefit from screening . 
The results of the 25-year follow-up of the Canadian trial - which can be considered the most accurate , given that the women were carefully characterized according to risk factors and had access to the most advanced treatments - are even more damning . 
Beyond showing no benefit from mammography screening , the Canadian trial highlighted one of the practice &apos;s major disadvantages : over-diagnosis . 
Indeed , 22 % of those in the screened group were over-diagnosed , meaning that the cancers found would not have become clinically detectable during the woman &apos;s lifetime . 
Add to that the in situ cancers - early-stage cancers that have not spread to neighboring tissue - and the number rises to 50 % . 
To be sure , over-diagnosis is inevitable with good screening tests . 
The real problem is the over-treatment that follows , owing to the lack of reliable tests to differentiate observable lesions from those that actually require medical intervention . 
Many of the women who believe that their lives were saved by mammography screenings actually had so-called &quot; IDLE &quot; cancers ( indolent lesions of epithelial origin ) , which would not have progressed before they died of other causes . 
Meanwhile , the very aggressive cancers , which are most likely to prove fatal , tend to present as &quot; interval &quot; cancers that appear between screenings . 
In the deadliest cases , regular screenings would not make much difference . 
Efforts to develop new , more sensitive screening tests are thus likely to do more harm than good , as they increase the rate of over-diagnosis , without improving outcomes among women with aggressive cancers . 
What breast-cancer patients really need are tests that identify the risk that the disease actually poses , as well as new , lifesaving treatments . 
It is time to recognize that breast-cancer screening does not save lives - and to focus on the strategies that will .
