Is the US Losing Latin America ? 
MADRID - It is a mantra increasingly heard around the world : US power is in decline . 
And nowhere does this seem truer than in Latin America . 
No longer is the region regarded as America &apos;s &quot; backyard &quot; ; on the contrary , the continent has arguably never been so united and independent . 
But this view fails to capture the true nature of US influence in Latin America - and elsewhere as well . 
It is true that US attention to Latin America has waned in recent years . 
President George W. Bush was more focused on his &quot; global war on terror . &quot; 
His successor , Barack Obama , seemed to give the region little thought as well , at least in his first term . 
Indeed , at the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena in April 2012 , Latin American leaders felt sufficiently confident and united to challenge US priorities in the region . 
They urged the US to lift its embargo on Cuba , claiming that it had damaged relations with the rest of the continent , and to do more to combat drug use on its own turf , through education and social work , rather than supplying arms to fight the drug lords in Latin America - a battle that all acknowledged has been an utter failure . 
It is also true that Latin American countries have pursued a massive expansion of economic ties beyond America &apos;s sway . 
China is now Latin America &apos;s second-largest trading partner and rapidly closing the gap with the US . 
India is showing keen interest in the region &apos;s energy industry , and has signed export agreements in the defense sector . 
Iran has strengthened its economic and military ties , especially in Venezuela . 
Similarly , in 2008 , Russia &apos;s then-President Dmitri Medvedev identified the US war on terror as an opportunity to create strategic partnerships with rising powers such as Brazil , and with the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas ( ALBA ) , a Venezuelan-inspired bloc opposed to US designs in the region . 
The energy giant Gazprom and the country &apos;s military industries have spearheaded the Kremlin &apos;s effort to demonstrate Russia &apos;s ability to influence America &apos;s neighborhood - a direct response to perceived American meddling in Russia &apos;s own &quot; near abroad , &quot; particularly Georgia and Ukraine . 
Yet it would be a mistake to regard Latin America &apos;s broadening international relations as marking the end of US preeminence . 
Unlike in the bygone era of superpowers and captive nations , American influence can no longer be defined by the ability to install and depose leaders from the US embassy . 
To believe otherwise is to ignore how international politics has changed over the last quarter-century . 
A continent once afflicted by military takeovers has slowly but surely implanted stable democracies . 
Responsible economic management , poverty-reduction programs , structural reforms , and greater openness to foreign investment have all helped to generate years of low-inflation growth . 
As a result , the region was able to withstand the ravages of the global financial crisis . 
The US not only encouraged these changes , but has benefited hugely from them . 
More than 40 % of US exports now go to Mexico and Central and South America , the US &apos;s fastest-growing export destination . 
Mexico is America &apos;s second-largest foreign market ( valued at $ 215 billion in 2012 ) . 
US exports to Central America have risen by 94 % over the past six years ; imports from the region have risen by 87 % . 
And the US continues to be the largest foreign investor on the continent . 
American interests are evidently well served by having democratic , stable , and increasingly prosperous neighbors . 
This new reality also demands a different type of diplomacy - one that recognizes the diverse interests of the continent . 
For example , an emerging power such as Brazil wants more respect on the world stage . 
Obama blundered when he dismissed a 2010 deal on Iran &apos;s nuclear program mediated by Brazil and Turkey ( despite having earlier endorsed the talks ) . 
Other countries might benefit from US efforts to promote democracy and socioeconomic ties , as Obama &apos;s recent trips to Mexico and Costa Rica show . 
Trade relations provide another all-important lever . 
President Sebastian Pi√±era of Chile visited the White House earlier this week to discuss , among other things , the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , an ambitious trade agreement that might encompass New Zealand , Singapore , Australia , Mexico , Canada , and Japan . 
President Ollanta Humala of Peru is expected in the White House next week , while Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit Latin America soon after . 
Language and culture matter , too . 
Given the extraordinary growth of Latinos &quot; influence in the US , it is almost inconceivable that America could lose its unique status in the region to China or Russia , let alone Iran . 
Gone are the days when military muscle and the politics of subversion could secure US influence - in Latin America or anywhere else . 
A world power today is one that can combine economic vigor and a popular culture with global outreach on the basis of shared interests . 
The US is better positioned than any other power in this respect , particularly when it comes to applying these advantages in its immediate vicinity .
