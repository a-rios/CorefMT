Europe &apos;s Pain without Gain 
VITORIA-GASTEIZ - In a recent interview , French President Fran√ßois Hollande made the crucial , but often forgotten , point that there are limits to the level of sacrifice that can be demanded of the citizens of southern Europe &apos;s financially distressed countries . 
To avoid turning Greece , Portugal , and Spain into collective &quot; correctional houses , &quot; Hollande reasoned , people need hope beyond the ever-receding horizon of spending cuts and austerity measures . 
Even the most rudimentary understanding of psychology supports Hollande &apos;s assessment . 
Negative reinforcement and delayed gratification are unlikely to achieve their goals unless there is a perceived light at the end of the tunnel - a future reward for today &apos;s sacrifices . 
Public pessimism in southern Europe is largely attributable to the absence of such a reward . 
As declining consumer confidence and household purchasing power deepen the recession , projections of when the crisis will end are repeatedly pushed back , and those bearing the brunt of austerity are losing hope . 
Throughout history , the concept of sacrifice has merged theology and economics . 
In the ancient world , people made often-bloody offeringsto divinities , whom they believed would reward them with , say , good harvests or protection from evil . 
Christianity , with its belief that God ( or the Son of God ) sacrificed Himself to expiate humanity &apos;s sins , inverted the traditional economy of sacrifice . 
In this case , divine suffering serves as an exemplar of the selflesshumility with which earthly misfortunes should be endured . 
Despite secularization , the belief that rewards , or achievements , require sacrifice has become an integral part of European cultural consciousness . 
The idea of a &quot; social contract &quot; - which arose during the Enlightenment in orderto address , without resort to divine right , the legitimacy of the state &apos;s authority over its citizens - rests on the premise that individuals surrender a certain degree of personal liberty in order to secure peace and prosperity for all . 
As a result , political leaders have often asked citizens to sacrifice personal freedoms and comforts in the name of secularized spiritual entities , such as the nation or the state - and citizens have eagerly obliged . 
In his first speech to the House of Commons as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Winston Churchill inspired hope in a beleaguered nation when he famously declared that he - and thus Britain - had &quot; nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears , and sweat . &quot; 
Given such countless precedents , it may be surprising that the rhetoric of sacrifice under the banner of austerity has proven so ineffective in Europe &apos;s current crisis . 
Some observers blame declining levels of commitment to anything that transcends the individual , including the political system . 
But resistance to austerity in southern Europe is not rooted in general hostility toward sacrifice . 
Rather , Europeans have come to believe that their leaders are demanding sacrifices that do not advance their interests . 
Churchill gave Britons something to look forward to : victory . 
Without a clear end that justifies it , sacrifice becomes meaningless . 
Prosperity was supposed to legitimize the European Union . 
After the period of rapid economic growth ended , Europe &apos;s leaders came to rely , instead , on the threat of an evil that is greater than austerity : further destabilization of debtor countries , leading to default , expulsion from the eurozone , and economic , social , and political collapse . 
But the rhetoric of fear is losing sway , because the &quot; new deal &quot; taking shape across southern Europe offers morerepression and less protection , thus violating the social contract &apos;s fundamental tenets . 
Indeed , while European citizens are being asked to sacrifice their standard of living - and even their livelihoods - for the sake of the &quot; national economy , &quot; transnational corporations are thriving . 
The conditions imposed by the &quot; troika &quot; - the European Commission , the European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund - amount to an indefinite delay in addressing the needs of those asked to sacrifice and in repairing tattered social safety nets . 
Yet national governments continue to implement policies that exacerbate injustice . 
For example , Portugal &apos;s 2013 budget reduces the number of tax brackets from eight to five - a move that will devastate the middle class . 
Sacrifice used to involve ransoming the body - its pleasures , basic needs , and even vitality - for the sake of the spirit . 
While the discourse of sacrifice persists , the logic that has shored it up for millennia has been abandoned . 
Europe &apos;s leaders must imbue their citizens with renewed hope . 
The legitimacy of &quot; post-national &quot; Europe - based on the EU &apos;s obligation , enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty , to promote &quot; the well-being of its people &quot; - is at stake .
