The Biofuels Trade Challenge 
There is rightly growing concern among the public and policymakers about climate change and its consequences . 
Combating climate change is an enormous and truly global challenge , requiring local , national , and international action . 
We must tackle it both effectively and urgently . A key part of meeting our climate objectives is to minimize the harmful effects of transport on the environment . 
So-called &quot; biofuels , &quot; such as bioethanol and biodiesel , as well as developing the next generation of biofuels , must play a part in this . 
After all , every liter of petrol that is replaced with a biofuel benefits the environment . 
Many countries around the world are producers or are emerging as producers of biofuels . 
World production of bioethanol , for example , doubled between 2000 and 2004 . 
A further doubling is expected by 2010 . 
As output of biofuels increases , policymakers must ensure that global supplies are allocated effectively and smoothly between countries that produce and consume them . 
Free and open conditions for international trade are the most efficient way to allocate global resources , fully exploiting individual countries &quot; comparative advantages . 
This principle also holds true for the emerging biofuels market . Today , however , trade in biofuels is limited . 
According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , global trade in bioethanol accounted for less than 10 % of global production in 2004 , suggesting a large untapped trade potential . 
Part of the explanation no doubt lies in the presence of significant trade barriers . 
For example , high tariffs are often placed on biofuels and biofuel feedstock - in some cases as high as 55 % for bioethanol . 
At the same time , subsidies are widely used to encourage domestic production . 
Tax incentives are employed to stimulate use , as are mandatory blending requirements . 
In addition , different standards and certification requirements are applied . While many of these measures are implemented for legitimate environmental policy reasons , they do pose challenges for trade in biofuels . 
As a first step toward eliminating unnecessary barriers , we must deepen our understanding of the effects on trade in biofuels of measures to promote their production and use . 
Sweden and the Netherlands recently took the initiative for further analysis of this issue by the OECD . 
Sweden &apos;s starting point is the conviction that a more liberal trade regime , coupled with global standards , is needed . 
As a first measure , Sweden argues for the elimination of all tariffs on ethanol . Apart from environmental considerations , there are other important benefits of expanding world trade in biofuels . 
Generally , international trade is a strong instrument for development . 
Several developing countries have a comparative advantage in producing ethanol - and other biofuels , for that matter . 
Brazil , which is now the world &apos;s largest producer and exporter of ethanol , is a case in point . 
But there are also other developing countries that are already exporters of biofuels , and still others that view it as an important source of future income . 
Trade policy should support , not undermine , these countries &quot; ambitions . Of course , some have raised concerns about the possible economic , social , and ecological repercussions , not least in developing countries , of a strong increase in demand for biofuels . 
For example , diverting too much land from food production to biofuel crops would risk sharp increases in food prices , while adequate environmental standards must accompany large-scale production use of biofuels . 
Such concerns also matter to consumers of biofuels , who will ultimately determine demand for them . 
Appropriate national policies , as well as strong international cooperation , will be necessary to minimize the risks and exploit the benefits that biofuels markets imply for developing countries . Creating an efficient market to expand world trade in biofuels is a policy for the future , one that is good for the environment and good for development . 
Increased trade , protection of the environment , and poverty reduction can , and must , go hand in hand .
