Slouching Towards Europe 
When communism in Eastern Europe collapsed , the region &apos;s new democratic leaders agreed that joining the European Union - fast - must be their priority . &quot; Back to Europe ! &quot; became the slogan , one enthusiastically backed by a majority of their populations . 
Yet eight months before that dream formally comes true , doubts in Eastern Europe about the benefits of EU membership are mounting . 
What has gone wrong ? 
For the new democracies in Europe &apos;s east , EU membership has five basic dimensions : historical symbolism , security , economic prosperity , political stability , and a guarantee of the rule of law . 
Each dimension has dominated at different times over the last fourteen years ; attached to each are different expectations in Eastern and Western Europe . 
The historical symbolism of the EU has always been more strongly felt in the East than in Western Europe . 
While Eastern Europe &apos;s peoples perceived membership as confirmation of their historical affiliation with the West and as another step away from Soviet rule , the EU seemed in no hurry to meet those expectations . 
Instead , the EU emphasized the technical criteria of membership . 
West Europeans did not seem concerned that early enlargement eastward might speed the consolidation of the region &apos;s democratic revolutions . 
Reduced to a highly technical and bureaucratic process , enlargement became almost totally devoid of any moral and political ethos . 
Meanwhile , the security dimension of EU membership diminished in importance when the US opted for rapid NATO enlargement . 
The fact that the Americans were quicker on their feet than the EU also helped to solidify a sense of loyalty that many people in the new democracies feel toward the US . 
Here , indeed , the EU missed a big opportunity to tie enlargement to a daring internal reform that would transform it into a superpower . 
Instead , enlargement was turned into a dull exercise , in which the ultimate benefits of EU membership became blurred in the minds of ordinary people by the complex process of adopting the acquis communautaire ( the body of EU law ) . 
Inevitably , for many the EU appeared to be a bureaucratic monster . 
In the end , Eastern Europe &apos;s pro-EU elites were left with only one means of stirring enthusiasm for EU membership : general pronouncements about how the EU delivered peace and stability to a notoriously war-prone continent , as well as the promises of economic prosperity . 
Going &quot; back to Europe &quot; was gone ; 
Now , unfortunately , even the economic benefits of EU membership seem unclear . 
Throughout the accession process , the EU made it clear that it could not and would not offer the same level of economic solidarity as it offered previous newcomers to the Union . 
The new members could , of course , benefit from investment pouring in from current EU countries . 
After all , for many West European companies the existence of a common economic area - and , eventually , an enlarged monetary union - will make it easy to relocate their operations to those parts of Europe with lower costs but identical legal standards . 
But even these benefits may be curtailed by the continuing economic downturn in much of Western Europe . 
A significant change in Europe &apos;s economic fortunes cannot be expected unless deep structural changes are introduced . 
But only tentative reforms have appeared so far . 
Slower growth in the new member states could also delay the planned introduction of the Euro , which in turn could deter many Western companies from investing in the region . 
There seems to be a Catch-22 at work here : introducing the common currency may prompt foreign investment , although this will depend on the ability of the new members to lower their public finance deficits . 
But fiscal consolidation requires strong economic performance , which depends on foreign investment . 
With the economic benefits of EU membership now seeming much less than expected , the intensity of pro-EU sentiments in the candidate countries has significantly declined . 
Although overwhelming majorities voted in favor of membership in virtually all candidate countries where membership referendums have taken place , many people did not turn out to vote . 
The best word to describe the referendums that have taken place so far is apathy . 
Eastern Europe &apos;s post-revolutionary enthusiasm for Europe has evaporated . 
To make matters even more complicated , East European countries will join the EU at a time when it has initiated a major internal reform embodied by a new European Constitution . 
Given their experiences with the drawn-out enlargement process , most candidate countries are leery about the motives of some large EU countries . 
If those countries have been egoistic in the past fourteen years , why should candidates believe they would not misuse new decision-making mechanisms to the detriment of small countries - hence the opposition of some candidate countries to creating the post of a European president . 
Such fears have also been strengthened by schizophrenic behavior , particularly French President Jacques Chirac &apos;s chastising candidate countries for voicing support for the US regarding Iraq . 
So on May 1 , 2004 , when the dream of expansion is fulfilled , there will likely be little jubilation on either side of Europe . 
Instead , apprehension and the desultory hope that it will all somehow work out in the end will dominate . 
Then again , given Europe &apos;s experience with revolution - in both the East and the West - perhaps that apathy should be welcomed .
