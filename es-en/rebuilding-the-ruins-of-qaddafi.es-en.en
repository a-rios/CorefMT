Rebuilding the Ruins of Qaddafi 
TRIPOLI - With the creation of a new government , Libya &apos;s leaders should finally be able to focus on organizing the transition from the authoritarian state that they inherited to the more pluralistic one they envisage . 
But are they really able and willing to achieve that goal ? 
In the United States , the debate on Libya has focused on what steps its government should take next . 
Senator Robert Menendez argues it &quot; must move quickly to embrace democratic reform , &quot; while international development specialists , such as Manal Omar of the US Institute for Peace , believe that success lies in the cultivation of a vibrant civil society . 
These views , however , overlook Libya &apos;s unique history , and treat Libya as though it were just another Third World country in need of generic solutions . 
In fact , remedying the country &apos;s ills requires building strong state institutions . 
Since Libya achieved independence in 1951 , it has been a fractured state . 
Rulers relied on loyal tribes and narrow cliques to prop up their regimes . 
Under a monarchy that led the country from 1951-1969 , King Idris &apos;s relatives and inner circle ran roughshod over fledgling state institutions . 
More interested in reigning than in governing , state institutions withered under Idris &apos;s neglect . 
These trends were exacerbated after Muammar el-Qaddafi overthrew the king in 1969 . 
Frustrated with a bureaucracy reluctant to implement his political vision , Qaddafi bypassed traditional institutions and claimed a direct dialogue with the country &apos;s population . 
The new Libyan leader created an intricate hierarchy of political organizations that were advertised as empowering citizens , but which in reality only reinforced their subservience to his autocratic regime . 
As Libyans tired of Qaddafi &apos;s revolutionary rhetoric , he decided that a new organization was needed to stir popular support . 
In 1977 , he established committees that he dubbed the &quot; watchdogs of the revolution . &quot; 
The committees formed their own courts , assumed sweeping arrest powers , took over the media , and purged officials who resisted Qaddafi &apos;s will . 
This led to a split between the state &apos;s official institutions and Qaddafi &apos;s shadow revolutionary apparatus . 
In 1979 , he resigned from his official posts to assume the vague role of &quot; Commander of the Revolution , &quot; explaining that &quot; the revolution must be separated from the authority of the state . &quot; 
This led to what the scholar Moncef Djaziri described as a division of formal and informal authority . 
Qaddafi &apos;s strategy stunted the growth of state institutions , because , like Mao Zedong &apos;s Cultural Revolution in China , it implied subordinating their development to the needs of an all-embracing vision of transformation . 
Economic planning reflected his populist policies and foreign adventures , rather than any focus on stability and sustainable growth . 
Instead of relying on state structures to govern , he leaned on a small coterie of minions and members of his tribe . 
As a result , state institutions decayed . 
Beginning in 1986 , the Libyan Central Bank ceased publishing the annual statistical reports that economists and specialists need to formulate coherent policies . 
Frustrated by his population &apos;s political apathy , Qaddafi frequently announced his intention to dissolve all government ministries and transfer their responsibilities to municipalities . 
Today , Libya &apos;s state institutions exist merely to extract the country &apos;s vast oil wealth and distribute it via subsidies . 
In a state that embodied the whim of its leader for 42 years , the rule of law does not exist . 
Explaining why he helped spearhead a 1993 military coup attempt , Air Force officer Muhammad Bashir Salah said , &quot; We have neither a state , nor laws , nor a constitution . &quot; 
Indeed , even the military , which in many Third World countries is the strongest state institution , was marginalized under Qaddafi . 
The revolutionary committees &quot; attacked it for being &quot; a traditional fascist institution . &quot; 
Qaddafi declared his desire to disband the army on several occasions , and its role was so insignificant that it played almost no part in defending the regime during the eight months of fighting that overthrew him . 
American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks noted that Libya has &quot; few formal decision-making structures , &quot; and called it an &quot; opaque regime in which lines of authority are deliberately blurred to obscure power structures and mitigate accountability . &quot; 
Today , Qaddafi &apos;s successors on the National Transitional Council ( NTC ) are perpetuating the dualistic authority that he created . 
Politically inexperienced and lacking strong leadership , they have proved unable to impose discipline on the myriad militias that sprang up during the revolution . 
These rogue units have exacted vengeance on Qaddafi supporters and alienated significant segments of society . 
If the NTC cannot assert its authority , the council risks the emergence of a movement nostalgic for Qaddafi and the security that his regime provided . 
Unlike their neighbors in Egypt , Libyans are not clamoring for the elections deemed by many Westerners to be of paramount importance . 
Instead , they have drawn on a patience rooted in their traditional political apathy . 
Few political parties have emerged , and there is little popular demand for them . 
Activists have instead focused on drafting a new constitution that would empower state institutions . 
Libyans understand that the NTC needs time to build a new country on the ruins of the one that Qaddafi destroyed . 
That daunting task begins by developing the state institutions required to respond to Libyans &quot; needs .
