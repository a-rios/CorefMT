Wanted : Chinese Leadership on Currencies 
WASHINGTON , DC - I share the growing concern around the world about the misalignment of currencies . 
Brazil &apos;s finance minister speaks of a latent currency war , and he is not far off the mark : it is in the currency markets that different economic policies and different economic and political systems interact and clash . 
The prevailing exchange-rate system is lopsided . 
China has essentially pegged its currency to the dollar , while most other currencies fluctuate more or less freely . 
China has a two-tier system in which the capital account is strictly controlled ; most other currencies don &apos;t distinguish between current and capital accounts . 
Most importantly , this arrangement allows the Chinese government to skim off a significant slice from the value of Chinese exports without interfering with the incentives that make people work so hard and make their labor so productive . 
It has the same effect as taxation , but it works much better . 
This secret of China &apos;s success gives the country the upper hand in its dealings with other countries , because the government has discretion over the use of the surplus . 
And it has protected China from the financial crisis , which shook the developed world to its core . 
For China , the crisis was an extraneous event that was experienced mainly as a temporary decline in exports . 
It is no exaggeration to say that since the financial crisis , China has been in the driver &apos;s seat of the world economy . 
Its currency moves have had a decisive influence on exchange rates . 
Its absence as a buyer contributed to the euro &apos;s decline . 
When the euro fell to $ 1.20 , China finally stepped in to preserve the euro as an international currency . 
Chinese buying reversed the euro &apos;s decline . 
More recently , when the United States Congress threatened legislation against Chinese currency manipulation , China allowed the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar by a couple of percentage points . 
Yet the rise in the euro , yen , and other currencies compensated for the fall in the dollar , preserving China &apos;s advantage . 
China &apos;s dominant position is now endangered by both external and internal factors . 
The impending global slowdown has intensified protectionist pressures . 
Countries such as Japan , South Korea , and Brazil are intervening unilaterally in currency markets . 
If they start imitating China by imposing restrictions on capital transfers , China will lose some of its current advantages . 
Moreover , global currency markets would be disrupted , and the global economy would deteriorate . 
China expert Michael Pettis has shown that consumption as a percentage of Chinese GDP has fallen from an already low 46 % in 2000 to 35.6 % in 2009 . 
Additional investments in capital goods offer very low returns . 
From now on , consumption must grow much faster than GDP . 
External considerations , too , cry out for allowing the renminbi to appreciate . 
The imbalances in the US are the mirror image of China &apos;s . 
Whereas China is threatened by inflation , the US faces the risk of deflation . 
At nearly 70 % of GDP , consumption in the US is too high . 
The US needs fiscal stimulus to enhance competitiveness , rather than so-called &quot; quantitative easing &quot; in monetary policy , which puts upward pressure on all currencies other than the renminbi . 
The US also needs the renminbi to rise in order to reduce the trade deficit and alleviate the burden of accumulated debt . China , in turn , could accept a stronger renminbi and a lower overall growth rate as long as the share of consumption in its economy was rising and the improvement in living standards continued . The public in China would be satisfied ; only exporters would suffer , and the surplus accruing to the Chinese government would diminish . 
A large appreciation would be disastrous , as Premier Wen Jiabao says , but 10 % a year should be tolerable . 
Since the Chinese government is the direct beneficiary of the currency surplus , it would need to have remarkable foresight to accept this diminution in its power and recognize the advantages of coordinating its economic policies with the rest of the world . 
China &apos;s leaders need to recognize that their country cannot continue rising without paying more attention to the interests of its trading partners . 
Only China is in a position to initiate a process of international cooperation , because it can offer the enticement of renminbi appreciation . 
China has already developed an elaborate mechanism for building consensus at home . 
Now it must go a step further and engage in consensus-building internationally . 
The reward would be acceptance by the rest of the world of China &apos;s rise . 
Whether it recognizes it or not , China has emerged as a world leader . 
If it fails to live up to the responsibilities of leadership , the global currency system is liable to break down and take the world economy with it . 
Either way , the Chinese trade surplus is bound to shrink , but it would be much better for China if that happened as a result of rising living standards rather than global economic decline . 
The chances of a positive outcome are not good , yet we must strive for it , because , in the absence of international cooperation , the world is headed for a period of great turbulence and disruption .
