Reincarnating Evita 
If myths could come true through sheer willpower , Cristina Kirchner , the wife of Argentine President Néstor Kircher , would already be a 21st-century Evita Perón . 
But myths are a collective and mysterious construction . 
In Argentina &apos;s recent legislative election , Cristina Kirchner became a political force in her own right , making the Kirchners a ruling couple from now on - the second in the country &apos;s history after Juan Perón and Evita . 
Mrs. Kirchner was elected Senator for the province of Buenos Aires , where much of the country &apos;s economic might is based . 
It is also where most of Argentina &apos;s poor live . 
True , the Kirchner name helped , and perhaps tradition also played a part . 
After all , Isabelita - a very small woman in every sense and Perón &apos;s third wife after Evita - became the country &apos;s first female President only because she was Perón &apos;s widow . 
Cristina Kirchner , however , is no small woman . 
As a lawyer and legislator since 1989 , she enjoys a privileged role in developing the strategies of her husband &apos;s government . 
Yet myth-making was not absent on the night of her victory . 
Newspapers depicted her against the background of the Argentinean flag , with her head bathed in a halo of sunshine . 
The image seemed to evoke the Virgin of Luján ( the religious figure who attracts the most worshipers in Argentina ) , as well as that of the Evita who was sanctified by the poor while still alive . 
It also seemed like an illustration of her authorized biography , entitled Reina Cristina ( &quot; Queen Cristina &quot; ) . 
Argentina is a country of strong women - more than one has become a myth that transcends cultures . 
The most recent is a women &apos;s collective , the Madres y Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo ( Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo ) . 
These brave women constituted the only opposition that dared to confront the savage military junta in the late 1970 &quot; s , demanding to know the fate of their &quot; disappeared &quot; children . 
The other myth is , of course , Evita . 
But Cristina is no Evita . 
In the Argentina of the 1940 &quot; s and 1950 &quot; s , Evita gathered multitudes . 
In Cristina &apos;s victory , and that of her husband , there were no mass celebrations . 
Perhaps this is just politics in the era of modern media . 
But , where Evita &apos;s voice was full of the &quot; pathos &quot; of poverty and injustice , of passion and tenderness , Cristina evokes more anger and defiance . 
No compassion is heard . 
Instead , there is defiance and self-affirmation : &quot; They will not do that to me ... &quot; 
Evita was the wife who would intercede before her husband to defend her &quot; children , &quot; the crowds of &quot; descamisados , &quot; or shirtless people . 
Her powerful myth made her a sort of primal woman . 
The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo became the same : they would put their motherhood above their lives . 
Defenseless against the state &apos;s power , they were invincible because they had nothing else to lose . 
Cristina is partly a &quot; wife &quot; like Evita , but she doesn &apos;t portray herself as a mother figure . 
It is a very modern model , perhaps in transition to something else . 
But to what ? 
Perhaps the key difference between Evita and Cristina is the fact that Evita , the &quot; standard-bearer of the poor , &quot; was an actress hunting for her destiny when she met Perón . 
Cristina dreamed and built her project together with her husband from the start , acquiring more visibility every day . 
That makes her akin to Hillary Clinton . 
Like the Clintons , the Kirchners knew from early on in their marriage that they wanted to reach the top , and the best way to do it , they concluded , was together . 
They are political partners . 
Cristina loves being compared to Hillary . 
Bill Clinton &apos;s wife could run for president in 2008 , and Cristina could do the same in 2007 , if her husband doesn &apos;t pursue re-election , or in 2011 , if he does , according to government officials . 
If Néstor and Cristina alternate as heads of state , they could do so indefinitely , because Argentina &apos;s constitution allows for only one consecutive reelection but no limit on the total number of electoral terms . 
Marriage and political partnership can , in any case , keep the tandem intact . 
Few doubt that Bill Clinton will be a powerful force in America if his wife becomes president . 
Kirchner , too , is not going to retire and put his slippers on in 2007 or 2011 if Cristina heads the government . 
This new &quot; monarchical &quot; presidential model deserves study by political scientists and jurists . 
But , as the Kirchners dream their mythic dreams , they will also be confronted with reality . 
And reality is even harder to shape than a myth .
