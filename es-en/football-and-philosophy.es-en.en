Football and Philosophy 
Gooooal ! ! ! 
Heavenly bliss , or hellish pain , depending on which team has scored : ours , or theirs . 
How can the trajectory of a ball cause so much pain or bliss ? 
For weeks I have sat at my television watching the World Cup . 
My wife threatens me with divorce and other disciplinary measures . 
What is the source of this attraction , this magic ? 
The world of play is our permanent Garden of Eden . 
At any moment we may step from our real world into the freedom , innocence , and bliss of play . 
Football and the Garden of Eden ? 
What do they have to do with each other ? 
Each delineates a sacred sphere of freedom and order , innocence , spirituality and justice from our everyday world of chaos , bondage , injustice and guilt . 
The chessboard , the tennis court , the soccer field : within their boundaries we feel free because here it is we who make the rules and are not subjected to the iron laws of the outside world . 
We feel innocent too , because the world of play is also a world of innocence : a Garden of Eden before the Fall . 
Here we can be childishly selfish , we can gratify our thirst for success , power and domination - all without guilt . 
In the world of play freedom is generated , paradoxically , by restrictions . 
In soccer , the basic rule is simple : the ball is to be moved , from the central point , into one of the goals . 
If the ball would roll from the center point straight into one of the goals , its track would be , or would seem to be , strictly determined and the whole thing would be boring . 
To generate freedom , rules put obstacles in the way of the ball and complicate its movement . 
First , two teams of eleven players are put on the field with the task of getting the ball into the goal . 
Second , they are told to get the ball into opposite goals . 
With twenty-two players with their own wills and skills , with various movements of confrontation and cooperation , the number of possible combinations is increased almost ad infinitum . 
After this only one additional factor is needed to create a real world of happy surprises , freedom and bliss : the ball . 
Balls are among the most important &quot; freedom generators &quot; in our lives . 
A ball is freedom embodied . 
It may bounce in any direction . 
It seems to have its &quot; own will . &quot; 
It is an object and , nevertheless , it seems to be free . 
By introducing the factor of chance and unpredictability into the game , the ball transforms a bitter and down-to-earth human fight into an epiphany of spirituality and freedom . 
In its brisk movements chance and human will interact , dance , and somersault with each other . 
The ball flashes to and fro in happy irresponsibility - between human will and chance , freedom and limitation , success and failure , hope and the loss of hope - to bounce back into the world of hope in the next moment . 
It has its own universe . 
It moves in the sphere of the sacred . 
But that sacred does not exist without the profane . 
The football field is marked off and opposed to the surrounding world . 
The experience and the sacred ceremony remain incomplete if tension between the field and the grandstand is missing . 
The clean emerald field and freedom of the game must be opposed by the howling mob in the darkness of the stands , burning red torches and jerking between ecstatic joy and hellish misery . 
In our everyday lives , reason and passions are mixed . 
Soccer ( like some other games ) separates , and opposes to each other , these two realms . 
All passions , emotions and instincts are pushed over to the side of the spectators . 
They rage and love , prance and explode , and finally reach a catharsis ( if their team wins ) or to descend into hell ( if their team loses ) . 
At the same time , they watch , perceive , and experience the freedom of Apollonian or Platonic spirituality of the game going on in the field . 
Yes , players move in a world of spirituality . 
They act according to clear , sacred rules . 
While in play , they are supposed to act as pure rational beings who leave behind their everyday passions and emotions , personal wishes or fears . 
They move in the world of pure morality and justice . 
The player &apos;s world is one of justice and total impartiality ; of a perfect equality of opportunity , which is never achieved in our everyday lives . 
Even advantages deriving from the direction of the wind are balanced . 
The two teams change sides at the half . 
When and where do we , the privileged and the underprivileged , change sides in the real world ? 
Players , too , are not supposed to break the rules . 
If they do , they are punished and , if they relapse , excluded from play . 
They are expelled from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappearing into the chilly Hades of the locker room . 
The real expulsion from Paradise comes only if the sanctity of play is profaned , if the spell is broken : by players falling out of their angelic roles and starting a fight in the field ; by a cheating referee ; by people realizing that a match is rigged ; by spectators invading the field . 
Such events do lasting damage to people and to the community . 
It is a bitter shock to realize the fragility of our world of freedom , spirituality , and dignity and awaken again ( as we will when the Cup winner is decided ) in our less hospitable everyday world .
