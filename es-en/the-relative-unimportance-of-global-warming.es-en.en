The Relative Unimportance of Global Warming 
Global warming has become the preeminent concern of our time . 
Negotiating a follow-up treaty to the Kyoto Protocol , they argue , requires that we seek even deeper cuts in the pollution that causes global warming . 
But they are wrong about our priorities , and they are advocating an inefficient remedy . 
As a result , we risk losing sight of tackling the world &apos;s most important problems first , as well as missing the best long-term approach to global warming . 
To be sure , global warming is real , and it is caused by CO2 . 
The Kyoto Protocol will cut CO2 emissions from industrialized countries by 30 % below what it would have been in 2010 and by 50 % in 2050 . Yet , even if everyone ( including the United States ) lived up to the protocol &apos;s rules , and stuck to it throughout the century , the change would be almost immeasurable , postponing warming for just six years in 2100 . 
Likewise , the economic models tell us that the cost would be substantial Â­ - at least $ 150 billion a year . 
In comparison , the United Nations estimates that half that amount could permanently solve all of the world &apos;s major problems : it could ensure clean drinking water , sanitation , basic health care , and education for every single person in the world , now . 
Global warming will mainly harm developing countries , because they are poorer and therefore more vulnerable to the effects of climate change . 
However , even the most pessimistic forecasts from the UN project that by 2100 the average person in developing countries will be richer than the average person in developed countries is now . 
So early action on global warming is basically a costly way of doing very little for much richer people far in the future . 
We need to ask ourselves if this should , in fact , be our first priority . 
Of course , in the best of all worlds , we would not need to prioritize . 
We would have enough resources to win the war against hunger , end conflicts , stop communicable diseases , provide clean drinking water , broaden educational access , and halt climate change . 
But we don &apos;t . 
So we have to ask the hard question : if we can &apos;t do it all , what should we do first ? 
Some of the world &apos;s top economists - including four Nobel laureates - answered this question at the Copenhagen Consensus in 2004 , listing all major policies for improving the world according to priority . 
They found that dealing with HIV / AIDS , hunger , free trade , and malaria were the world &apos;s top priorities . 
This was where we could do the most good for our money . 
On the other hand , the experts rated immediate responses to climate change at the bottom of the world &apos;s priorities . 
Indeed , the panel called these ventures - including the Kyoto Protocol - &quot; bad projects , &quot; simply because they cost more than the good that they do . 
The Copenhagen Consensus gives us great hope because it shows us that there are so many good things that we can do . 
For $ 27 billion , we could prevent 28 million people from getting HIV . 
For $ 12 billion we could cut malaria cases by more than a billion a year . 
Instead of helping richer people inefficiently far into the future , we can do immense good right now . 
This does not mean losing sight of the need to tackle climate change . 
But the Kyoto approach focuses on early cuts , which are expensive and do little good . 
Instead , we should be concentrating on investments in making energy without CO2 emissions viable for our descendants . 
This would be much cheaper and ultimately much more effective in dealing with global warming . 
The parties in Montreal should rule out more Kyoto-style immediate cuts , which would be prohibitively expensive , do little good , and cause many nations to abandon the entire process . 
Rather , they should suggest a treaty binding every nation to spend , say , 0.1 % of GDP on research and development of non-carbon-emitting energy technologies . 
This approach would be five times cheaper than Kyoto and many more times cheaper than a Kyoto II . 
It would involve all nations , with richer nations naturally paying the larger share , and perhaps developing nations being phased in . 
It would let each country focus on its own future vision of energy needs , whether that means concentrating on renewable sources , nuclear energy , fusion , carbon storage , or searching for new and more exotic opportunities . 
Such a massive global research effort would also have potentially huge innovation spin-offs . 
In the long run , such actions are likely to make a much greater impact on global warming than Kyoto-style responses . 
In a world with limited resources , where we struggle to solve just some of the challenges that we face , caring more about some issues means caring less about others . 
We have a moral obligation to do the most good that we possibly can with what we spend , so we must focus our resources where we can accomplish the most first . 
By this standard , global warming doesn &apos;t come close . 
Rather than investing hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term , ineffective cuts in CO2 emissions , we should be investing tens of billions in research , leaving our children and grandchildren with cheaper and cleaner energy .
