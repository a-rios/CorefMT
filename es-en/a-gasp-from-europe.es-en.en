A Gasp from Europe 
French President Jacques Chirac has alarmed the EU candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe . 
The French president has accused them of being &quot; childish &quot; and &quot; irresponsible &quot; in voicing their pro-US stance on the Iraq issue , and warned that their position could be &quot; dangerous , &quot; as the decision to let them into the EU has not yet been ratified . 
Quite a salvo . 
Then the French president assumed the role of kindergarten instructor vis-à-vis what he called &quot; badly brought up &quot; candidate countries , telling them that they were &quot; ill-behaved &quot; and that &quot; they missed a great opportunity to shut up . &quot; 
To anyone who remembers that 40 years ago President Charles de Gaulle slammed Europe &apos;s door shut in the face of Britain &apos;s request to join the European community - the General thought the British too tied to the US to enter the European family - these remarks are worrying . 
But put things in perspective : Jacques Chirac is not Charles de Gaulle ; and Europe has moved far beyond the time when its agenda was unilaterally written by France . 
President Chirac &apos;s self-appointed role as an expert in diplomatic good behavior cannot be taken seriously , even by those of us who know ( and love ) France . 
Instead , his outburst is best explained as a sign of frustration over the fact that French influence in the EU is being diluted . 
Like King Lear after he lost his kingdom , there is nothing France can do about its lost influence but rage impotently . 
But this dispute within Europe goes deeper than the matter of France &apos;s lapsed primacy . 
I have always been skeptical about the rhetoric of a &quot; common &quot; foreign policy for the EU . 
How can you possibly expect a country such as , say , France to accept being voted down by its EU partners on vital foreign and security policy issues ? 
At best , Europe should hope for a &quot; more common &quot; foreign and security policy , even though this fails to answer Henry Kissinger &apos;s old question : If you want to speak to &quot; Europe , &quot; whom do you call ? 
I have long worked to secure a &quot; much more common &quot; foreign policy within the EU . 
Therefore I am worried by today &apos;s split within the EU as well as between some member countries and the US over Iraq . 
When eight European leaders published their appeal to heal the growing transatlantic rift , they were accused of undermining European unity . 
Nothing could be more incorrect . 
They were only exposing the lack of unity that already existed . 
It all began last autumn when German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , desperate to hold on to power , made Iraq an issue in the German election campaign . 
He played on Germany &apos;s well-known and respectable pacifist feelings . 
But by declaring that he would not , under any circumstance , participate in military actions against Iraq , he undermined the efforts at the UN to put maximum pressure behind the demands that Iraq disarm . 
Then France embraced Germany . 
French ways in foreign policy are often murky and difficult to decipher , unless it is crystal clear where France regards its interests to lie . 
Usually France likes to keep its options open . 
But when the French and German governments celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Elysée Treaty last month , France seemed to paint herself into a corner by supporting the German view . 
All this was done without consultations between the French and German governments and their partners within the EU . 
It was a demonstration of the special relationship between France and Germany that has for so many years been the driving force in European integration . 
The history of Franco-German reconciliation is impressive indeed . 
But it can no longer be taken for granted that other EU countries will automatically ratify the agreements that they reach between themselves as the lodestar for common policies . 
This is particularly true when their objective is to establish an &quot; alternative &quot; to American leadership in security policy . 
Enlargement of the EU with a number of Central and Eastern European countries will strengthen resistance to Franco-German initiatives in this direction . 
The letter from the eight European leaders - and the later statement from the &quot; Vilnius Ten &quot; group of Central and Eastern European countries - demonstrated that France ( and Germany ) cannot dictate a European agenda that creates transatlantic rifts . 
This has obviously caused frustrations . 
The split within the EU and NATO has increased the risk of armed conflict with Iraq because the pressure on Iraq to comply with the UN resolutions was weakened . 
Chirac and Schröder do not seem to grasp this . 
So this has not been one of Europe &apos;s finest hours , especially not while the EU &apos;s institutional convention is discussing a text that calls for EU governments to &quot; actively and unreservedly support the Union &apos;s common foreign policy . &quot; 
The German acronym for the EU &apos;s &quot; common foreign and security policy &quot; is GASP . 
That seems an entirely appropriate expression for what we have been witnessing .
