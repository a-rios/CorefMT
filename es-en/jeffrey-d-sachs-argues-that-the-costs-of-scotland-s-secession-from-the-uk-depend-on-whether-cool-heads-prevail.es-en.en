The Price of Scottish Independence 
NEW YORK - Though the world &apos;s eyes now are on Scotland &apos;s referendum on independence from the United Kingdom , Scotland is not alone in seeking to redraw national boundaries . 
There are independence movements in many other parts of the world ; indeed , 39 new states have joined the United Nations since 1980 . 
Many more aspirants are waiting in the wings , and would likely be encouraged by a Scottish &quot; Yes &quot; vote . 
The Scottish pro-independence campaign is based on four claims . 
The first is cultural : to protect and strengthen the identity of the Scottish people . 
The second is ideological : to move Scotland toward a Scandinavian-style social democracy . 
The third is political : to bring democratic governance closer to the people . 
And the fourth is economic : to lay claim to a larger share of North Sea oil and gas . 
UK political leaders and many European governments are strongly urging the Scots to vote against independence . 
Scottish independence , the &quot; No &quot; campaign argues , would bring few if any of the claimed benefits ; on the contrary , it would cause many economic calamities , ranging from financial panics to the flight of jobs and industry from Scotland . 
Moreover , an independent Scotland might be excluded from the European Union and NATO . 
What should the rest of the world think about this debate ? 
Should the Scottish independence campaign be hailed as a breakthrough for claims to cultural identity and self-governance ? 
Or should it be viewed as yet another source of instability and weakness in Europe - one that would increase uncertainty in other countries and parts of the world ? 
Secession movements can , no doubt , cause great instability . 
Consider the regional and even global turmoil over Kosovo , South Sudan , Kurdistan , and Crimea . 
Yet national independence can also be handled peacefully and smoothly . 
The 1993 division of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia - the famed &quot; velvet divorce &quot; - imposed no significant or lasting costs on either successor state . 
Both accepted the division , and , knowing that their future lay within the EU , focused their attention on accession . 
Here , then , is a plausible and positive scenario for an independent Scotland . 
The rest of the UK ( called the &quot; RUK &quot; in the current debate ) , including England , Wales , and Northern Ireland , would quickly and efficiently negotiate the terms of independence with Scotland , agreeing how to share the UK &apos;s public debt and public assets , including offshore oil and gas . 
Both sides would be pragmatic and moderate in their demands . 
At the same time , the EU would agree immediately to Scotland &apos;s continued membership , given that Scotland already abides by all of the required laws and democratic standards . 
Similarly , NATO would agree immediately to keep Scotland in the Alliance ( though the Scottish National Party &apos;s pledge to close US and British nuclear-submarine bases would be a complication to be overcome ) . 
Both Scotland and the RUK might agree that Scotland would temporarily keep the British pound but would move to a new Scottish pound or the euro . 
If such monetary arrangements are transparent and cooperatively drawn , they could occur smoothly and without financial turmoil . 
But if the RUK , the EU , and NATO respond vindictively to a Yes vote - whether to teach Scotland a lesson or to deter others ( such as Catalonia ) - matters could become very ugly and very costly . 
Suppose that a newly independent Scotland is thrown out of the EU and NATO , and told that it will remain outside for years to come . 
In this scenario , a financial panic could indeed be provoked , and both Scotland and the RUK would suffer economically . 
The key point is that the costs of separation are a matter of choice , not of inevitability . 
They would depend mainly on how the RUK , the EU , and NATO decided to respond to a Yes vote , and how moderate a newly independent Scotland would be in its negotiating positions . 
If cool heads prevail , Scottish independence could proceed at a relatively low cost . 
The dangers of national secession are much greater in places without overarching entities like the EU and NATO to constrain the situation among the successor states . 
In such circumstances , unilateral claims of independence opposed by the national government or a sub-national unit often lead to a breakdown of trade and finance - and often to outright war , as we saw in the breakup of the Soviet Union , Yugoslavia , and most recently , Sudan . 
In those cases , separation was indeed followed by deep economic and political crises , which in some ways persist . 
Indeed , in the case of ex-Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union , the EU and NATO absorbed some but not all of the successor states , thereby raising major geopolitical tensions . 
International politics in the twenty-first century can no longer be about nation-states alone . 
Most key issues that are vital for national wellbeing - trade , finance , the rule of law , security , and the physical environment - depend at least as much on the presence of effective regional and global institutions . 
Even if Scotland declares independence , it will - and should continue to be - bound by a dense web of European and global rules and responsibilities . 
I am personally sympathetic to Scotland &apos;s independence as a way to bolster Scottish democracy and cultural identity . 
Yet I support independence only on the assumption that Scotland and the RUK would remain part of a strong and effective EU and NATO . 
Certainly , a Yes vote would put an even higher premium on effective EU governance . 
But , if the EU and NATO were to &quot; punish &quot; a newly independent Scotland by excluding it , real disaster could ensue , not only for Scotland and the UK , but also for European democracy and security .
