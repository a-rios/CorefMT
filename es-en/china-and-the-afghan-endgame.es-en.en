China and the Afghan Endgame 
BEIJING - Ever since US President Barack Obama decided to begin withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan , global interest in what role ( if any ) China will play in determining that war-ravaged country &apos;s future has grown dramatically . 
After all , China is not merely a neighbor of Afghanistan , but the world &apos;s most important rising power - indeed , a &quot; world power , &quot; as Mike Mullen , Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff proclaimed in Beijing this past June . 
If China proves itself willing to help shore up Afghan President Hamid Karzai &apos;s administration , it will not seek to gain any immediate advantage from the withdrawal of US forces . 
But , despite the billions of dollars China has invested in developing Afghanistan &apos;s natural resources , it is hard to see it undertaking a policy of broader and proactive engagement there . 
One reason why China is wary of assuming a bigger role in Afghanistan , despite the country &apos;s undoubted importance for regional stability , is that America &apos;s war there has been controversial in China from the outset . 
Chinese nationalists believe that the war was undertaken by the US partly in order to place its military near one of China &apos;s most sensitive borders . 
Moreover , to supply its Afghan forces , the US deepened its military footprint in Central Asia by renting the Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan , which also shares a border with China . 
In the eyes of Chinese nationalists , these efforts were all the part of an American conspiracy to encircle China . 
Thus , Chinese nationalists can &apos;t wait to see the back of America &apos;s Afghan military presence . 
For Chinese strategic realists , any support for America &apos;s efforts to help end the Afghan insurgency should be part of a broader China-US bargain . 
China might agree not to undermine America as it withdraws only if the US agrees to rethink its arms sales to Taiwan , or to pull back from its commitment to support Japan &apos;s claims to the Diaoyu / Senkaku islands , the ownership of which China disputes . 
Obviously , such deals will be unwelcome in the US . 
Given that neither Chinese foreign-policy camp believes that it will get what it wants out of cooperating with the US , both simply want America &apos;s withdrawal to happen as soon as possible , without concern for what Afghanistan will look like afterwards . 
For both camps , only great-power politics matters for China &apos;s national security , and if diplomacy cannot influence the balance of power , there is little reason to engage with an issue . 
For Chinese liberals , Afghanistan is fraught with ethnic threats . 
By recklessly denying China &apos;s request to extradite Uighur extremists to China for trial , the US showed scant regard for an issue of paramount importance - the threat posed to China &apos;s hard-won unity by separatists . 
Muslim Uighurs from Xinjiang province were captured in Taliban training campus and jailed at Guantánamo Bay with other international terrorists from 2002 through 2009 . 
China thought their extradition necessary to undercutting international sympathy for Uighur independence seekers . 
Indeed , former President George W. Bush welcomed Rebiya Kadeer , a leader of the exiled Uighur independence movement , to the White House , embittering many Chinese . 
Of course , a stable , orderly , and secular Afghanistan serves China &apos;s interests as much as it benefits the rest of the world . 
Yet few Chinese are willing to confess that the US-led Afghanistan war , which removed the Taliban and Al Qaeda from their dominant roles in the country , improved China &apos;s domestic security . 
That refusal is clearly the result of the &quot; structural &quot; ambivalence that now exists between the US and China . 
The extent to which China will engage Afghanistan positively will depend in large part on whether China rids itself of the prevailing zero-sum mindset and facilitates America &apos;s military withdrawal by doing what it can to stabilize the country . 
China can help by stiffening the resolve of Pakistan &apos;s military to move more aggressively to contain Taliban extremists on its territory ; open border regions to help resupply NATO forces in Afghanistan ; and invest in the country &apos;s infrastructure . 
Indeed , China &apos;s relations with Pakistan have assumed greater importance recently , owing to the tensions that now exist between Pakistan and the US . 
The Obama administration &apos;s challenge nowadays is to calibrate its recent suspension of some military aid to Pakistan in order to maximize its leverage without pushing the government even closer to the extremists . 
By working with the US on Pakistan , China can help secure its own interest in a strong Pakistani campaign against the militants on its territory . 
Regardless of the Bush-era disputes with the US over the Uighur prisoners at Guantánamo , China is in a better position to tell its &quot; all-weather &quot; friends in Islamabad that stabilizing Afghanistan is not only an American objective , but a significant Chinese goal as well . 
China &apos;s cooperation may not be essential to defeating Al Qaeda and other militants in Afghanistan , but it will be if lasting peace and stability is to be realized . 
Chinese and US interests in Afghanistan are unlikely ever to be perfectly aligned , but the two sides can and must learn to cooperate for their own benefit , and that of the region . 
The challenge for China is to exert its power and influence in a way that harmonizes with the US , despite widespread displeasure among Chinese at America &apos;s position on a variety of issues , from Taiwan to the East and South China seas .
