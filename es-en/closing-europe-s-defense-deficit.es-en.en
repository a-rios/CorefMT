Closing Europe &apos;s Defense Deficit 
The gap between Europe &apos;s security needs and its military capacities is widening , and most European leaders lack the will to do what is necessary to close it . 
Forces built to defend the European heartland from a Soviet attack are unsuitable for the kinds of operations that define today &apos;s post-Cold War environment . 
Today , Europe needs improved capacity to combat terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , deal with failed or failing states , contend with regional conflicts , and respond to humanitarian crises . 
Yet defense spending across Europe remains flat or in decline . 
The problem is more than budgetary . 
Given these hurdles , the obvious way to improve European defense capabilities is by coordinating the efforts of individual countries , the European Union , and NATO to create a set of enhanced collective defense capacities . 
The overlap in membership between NATO and the EU makes such defense cooperation both possible and logical , if not unavoidable . 
Of course , difficult choices lay ahead . 
Political leaders must create incentives and financial headroom for their forces to undergo the necessary changes . 
First and foremost , savings generated from restructuring must be reinvested in transforming military forces . 
After all , generals will be more inclined to identify efficiencies if they believe that doing so will ultimately enable them to enhance their capabilities . 
Political leaders should also seek to stabilize defense budgets by creating separate funds for unforeseen multilateral peacekeeping operations , like the Balkans and Afghanistan , and by putting defense planning on a multi-year rather than an annual cycle . 
Such predictable budgets will better enable European leaders to establish defense planning targets that address the priorities of military transformation . 
At a minimum , 25 % of annual budgets should be allocated toward research , development , and procurement , with no more than 40 % spent on personnel . 
This won &apos;t be easy , because there is a basic conflict between modernizing an army and the political pressures to maintain military wages and jobs . 
At the most basic level , governments must take a hard look at conscription and territorial defense forces , which eat up far too much of Europe &apos;s military budgets . 
Because no European state can afford to &quot; go it alone , &quot; military reform demands greater integration and information sharing , as control of information will be key in future conflicts . 
Pooling of infrastructure ( bases and ports ) and logistical assets ( transport ) , including training facilities for common equipment , will generate big savings , as individual countries rationalize the long &quot; logistical tails &quot; of manpower and equipment that support armies in the field . 
Nations should forge partnerships across national lines with like-minded allies - a model exemplified by the new joint Spanish-Italian Amphibious Force . 
Nations that cannot afford to field expeditionary forces capable of performing the full spectrum of 21st-century missions should make greater use of specialization to enhance their contribution to Europe &apos;s collective defense . 
The EU can help by strengthening its defense planning . 
It should articulate more clearly Europe &apos;s future military roles and missions , determine the military capabilities required , identify shortfalls , and develop projects and initiatives to address the most critical gaps . 
The EU should also take steps to improve its ability to conduct operations . 
New EU &quot; Battlegroups &quot; should be strengthened through regular training and certification , preferably using NATO standards , and the EU Military Committee should hold regular Battlegroup conferences to solicit country contributions to future formations . 
For the EU to do its part , larger budgets appear unavoidable . 
Battlegroups should be expanded to include naval and air components for missions such as maritime interdiction and close support for ground troops . 
Common funding for operations should be increased , and member states should continue to be encouraged to make civilian and police forces as readily deployable in peacekeeping operations as their military . 
All of these reforms demand coordination with NATO . 
While NATO and the EU have improved their working relations , more steps need to be taken to eliminate mistrust , unhealthy competition , and information-sharing blockages . 
The two bodies must expand their strategic dialogue beyond their current focus on the Balkans and Afghanistan . 
To do this , the often pre-scripted and stale dialogue between the North Atlantic Council and the EU &apos;s Political and Security Committee should be opened up to include topics such as combating terrorism and the proliferation of WMD , or regions such as Ukraine or Moldova . 
European industry is also a vital factor in European defense integration , but it suffers from fragmented demand , counterproductive intra-European trade regulations , and a mostly outdated Cold-War military infrastructure . 
Specialization of military capabilities and industrial efforts by certain member states shows some promise , but needs to be coordinated to avoid redundancy and ensure interoperability . 
Moreover , transatlantic defense trade must be used to augment European capabilities at the lowest possible cost . 
Both NATO and the EU have roles to play in working with industry to enhance Europe &apos;s defense capabilities . 
Greater military integration in Europe will require sustained leadership by heads of government , military officials , and NATO and EU leaders . 
This is no small challenge , but there is no viable alternative . 
Greater defense integration in Europe is not just an appealing or interesting idea ; it is an imperative .
