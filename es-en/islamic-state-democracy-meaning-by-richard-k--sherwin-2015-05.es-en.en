Democracy &apos;s Missing Meaning 
NEW YORK - The decision to abandon relative peace and prosperity for brutal war and instability may seem irrational . 
Why has democracy lost the allegiance of these restless spirits , and how can it recapture the hearts and minds of others who would follow suit ? 
The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote that humans would rather will nothingness than not will anything at all . 
The leaden despair of lifelessness , impotence , and hopelessness is vastly less appealing than intensity - even if that intensity is found in violence , death , and destruction . 
In short , it is a matter of meaningfulness , the presence of which motivates us , connects us to one another , and orders our lives . 
If it is missing - if , say , democratic ideals and institutions are failing to provide a palpable enough sense of community and purpose - people seek a sense of meaning elsewhere , which in some cases leads them to malevolent causes . 
This is the cultural challenge facing democracy today , and those who wish to maintain the freedom and promise of democratic societies ignore it at their peril . 
It is a challenge that should be recognized not only for what it says about living conditions in advanced democratic countries worldwide , but also because any crisis is also an opportunity - in this case , to recapture the meaning that lies at the heart of democracy . 
The appeal of groups like the Islamic State to young people reared in democratic countries highlights these societies &quot; growing disparities in educational and economic opportunity , which are breeding cynicism , resignation , and anger among those who find themselves locked out of the social elite . 
Feelings of hopelessness and despair at the center incite extremism at the fringes . 
Elites in the advanced democracies - say , the top 1 % of income earners - can hardly take comfort from such conditions . 
Even the most insular globetrotter , flitting from one market or cultural playground to another , must consider their children . 
What culture will they absorb ? 
From where will they derive their sense of hope for the future ? 
Defenders of democracy must now determine not only how to create jobs and ensure material prosperity for today &apos;s young people , but also how to feed their souls on the way . 
If they fail , as we have seen , others will fill the void , potentially with a call for mayhem in the name of messianic futurity . 
To win this high-stakes contest , democratic societies must look beyond battlefield victory and focus on winning hearts and minds through the power of ideas and the promise of meaningfulness - just as the Islamic State has done . 
The notion that democracies can fend off such forces , with their well-resourced and media-savvy ideological apparatuses , with guns alone is a sure loser . 
This is a battle of meanings , and it can be won only with ideas that inspire hope , action , and coherence of self and community . 
The effort should begin with a publicly commissioned gathering of a broad cross-section of political scientists , anthropologists , theologians , philosophers , and artists , among others , from across the political spectrum , convened from universities and similar institutions around the world . 
Over a predetermined period , they would produce a clear , plainly written report to the public . 
The report should address , tenaciously and honestly , key questions about democracy &apos;s vitality today . 
What lies at the wellsprings of democratic life ? 
How is it best expressed , performed , instituted , and safeguarded ? 
What is democracy &apos;s best message of hope , and its most credible promise of future flourishing ? 
What are the deep cultural , intellectual , and spiritual sources for freedom , tolerance , and productivity ? 
We live in a dangerous time . 
With democratic ideals under threat around the world , including within democratic countries , their shared cultural and ideological foundations cannot be taken for granted . 
The meaning and vitality of life in a democracy cannot be allowed to fade . 
The challenge ahead demands a concerted response from our deepest thinkers and most creative artists . 
This is our purpose today ; we must commit ourselves to it as passionately as democracy &apos;s enemies pursue theirs .
