Hard to be Easing 
NEW YORK - The United States Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to undertake a third round of quantitative easing , or QE3 , has raised three important questions . 
Will QE3 jump-start America &apos;s anemic economic growth ? 
Will it lead to a persistent increase in risky assets , especially in US and other global equity markets ? 
Finally , will its effects on GDP growth and equity markets be similar or different ? 
Many now argue that QE3 &quot; s effect on risky assets should be as powerful , if not more so , than that of QE1 , QE2 , and &quot; Operation Twist , &quot; the Fed &apos;s earlier bond-purchase program . 
After all , while the previous rounds of US monetary easing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices , the size and duration of QE3 are more substantial . 
Consider , first , that the previous QE rounds came at times of much lower equity valuations and earnings . 
In March 2009 , the S P 500 index was down to 660 , earnings per share ( EPS ) of US companies and banks had sunk to a financial-crisis low , and price / earnings ratios were in the single digits . 
Today , the S P 500 is more than 100 % higher ( hovering near 1,430 ) , the average EPS is close to $ 100 , and P / E ratios are above 14 . 
Even during QE2 , in the summer of 2010 , the S P 500 , P / E ratios , and EPS were much lower than they are today . 
If , as is likely , economic growth in the US remains anemic in spite of QE3 , top-line revenues and bottom-line earnings will turn south , with negative effects on equity valuations . 
Moreover , fiscal support is absent this time : QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip , respectively , because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus . 
In contrast , QE3 will be associated with a fiscal contraction , possibly even a large fiscal cliff . 
Even if the US avoids the full fiscal cliff of 4.5 % of GDP that is looming at the end of the year , it is highly likely that a fiscal drag amounting to 1.5 % of GDP will hit the economy in 2013 . 
With the US economy currently growing at a 1.6 % annual rate , a fiscal drag of even 1 % implies near-stagnation in 2013 , though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing , together with QE3 , should keep US growth at about its current level in 2013 . 
But there is no broader rebound underway . 
In both 2010 and 2011 , leading economic indicators showed that the first-half slowdown had bottomed out , and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of monetary easing . 
Thus , QE nudged along an economy that was already recovering , which prolonged asset reflation . 
By contrast , the latest data suggest that the US economy is performing as sluggishly now as it was in the first half of the year . 
Indeed , if anything , weakness in the US labor market , low capital expenditures , and slow income growth have contradicted signals in the early summer that third-quarter growth might be more robust . 
Meanwhile , the main transmission channels of monetary stimulus to the real economy - the bond , credit , currency , and stock markets - remain weak , if not broken . 
Indeed , the bond-market channel is unlikely to boost growth . 
Long-term government bond yields are already very low , and a further reduction will not significantly change private agents &quot; borrowing costs . 
The credit channel also is not working properly , as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE , creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending . 
Those who can borrow have ample cash and are cautious about spending , while those who want to borrow - highly indebted households and firms ( especially small and medium-size enterprises ) - face a credit crunch . 
The currency channel is similarly impaired . 
With global growth weakening , net exports are unlikely to improve robustly , even with a weaker dollar . 
Moreover , many major central banks are implementing variants of QE alongside the Fed , dampening the effect of the Fed &apos;s actions on the dollar &apos;s value . 
Perhaps most important , a weaker dollar &apos;s effect on the trade balance , and thus on growth , is limited by two factors . 
First , a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities , which implies a drag on the trade balance , because the US is a net commodity-importing country . 
Second , any improvement in GDP derived from stronger exports leads to an increase in imports . 
Empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker US dollar on the trade balance is close to zero . 
The only other significant channel to transmit QE to the real economy is the wealth effect of an equity-market increase , but there is some circularity in the argument that QE3 will lead to a persistent rise in equity prices . 
If persistent asset reflation requires a significant GDP growth recovery , it is tautological to say that if equity prices rise enough following QE , the resulting increase in GDP from a wealth effect justifies the rise in asset prices . 
If monetary policy &apos;s transmission channels to the real economy are broken , one cannot assume that QE will have a significant effect on economic growth . 
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has recently emphasized the importance of an additional channel : the confidence channel , through which the Fed &apos;s commitment to maintaining generous monetary conditions for longer could improve private spending . 
The issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be . 
Confidence is fragile in an environment characterized by ongoing deleveraging , macro uncertainties , weak labor-market growth , and a fiscal drag . 
In short , QE3 reduces the tail risk of an outright economic contraction , but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful deleveraging process . 
In the short run , QE3 will lead investors to take on risk , and will stimulate modest asset reflation .
