Don \ u0027t Bet on a Quick US Recovery 
Whither the US economy ? 
Every piece of good news suggesting that America &apos;s recession is about to end is followed by bad news suggesting otherwise . 
The Federal Reserve Board &apos;s current monetary policy reflects this ambiguity : it is neither lowering nor raising interest rates . 
Instead , it maintains a &quot; neutral &quot; stance . 
The meanderings of the stock market are a similar indication of uncertainty . 
Much of the discussion of the US economy is of little help , for it is focused on the wrong question : when did the recession start and end ? 
Recessions typically are defined by whether GDP has fallen . 
But what is of real concern is the gap between the economy &apos;s potential and its actual performance . 
In these terms , the American economy &apos;s performance is likely to remain dismal . 
Increases in measured productivity mean that the economy &apos;s potential growth rate is now somewhere between 3.5-4 % annually . 
( There have been changes in the way we correct for price changes , so that what we measure today as 4 % actually represents what we used to measure as a substantially smaller number . ) 
Even when America grows at 0.5 % , a gap of 3 % in a $ 10 trillion economy means a loss of output of $ 300 billion - an enormous amount by any definition . 
The shortfall , in turn , implies rising unemployment . 
Given the huge gap , the US will have to grow in excess of its long run potential in order to get back to utilizing its resources fully . 
Even with the surprisingly strong growth numbers for the first quarter of the year , most forecasters see growth over 2002 as a whole falling short of its long run potential , and by a significant amount , implying that unemployment will rise . 
There is a simple interpretation of what has been happening to the US economy . 
The recession of 2001 combined an inventory downturn with an investment downturn . 
The first is now over ; the second - the result of overinvestment in high technology and telecommunications , the sectors that were so important in the boom of the late 90s - may last considerably longer . 
There remains a considerable capacity overhang - such as fiber optic lines that remain dark , having yet to see any light pass through them . 
Merely lowering interest rates did not , and will not , lead firms to invest more in these sectors . 
The good news - and the bad - is that the pace of technological change in these sectors is sufficiently fast that much of the equipment may become obsolete well before it is worn out , or even used , enabling new investment to start faster than it otherwise would . 
Meanwhile , the US cannot expect much relief from exports , given the global economic slowdown , or from consumer spending . 
Typically , a rebound in consumption helps to reinvigorate the economy ; but consumption has , almost miraculously , sustained the economy as investment has fallen , and thus there is little scope for a rebound . 
The risks are mainly on the downside . 
There is a significant chance that with Americans &apos; savings rate at dismally low levels - sustained last year by car purchases and home refinancing - consumer spending may moderate . 
Some of the sales in 2001 , moreover , reflected purchases that would have been postponed until this year were it not for special offers inducing consumers to buy cars earlier than they otherwise would . 
Even Americans can consume only so many new cars . 
On the contrary , a high level of indebtedness now afflicts US households . 
This sharp deterioration in the US fiscal position means that long-term interest rates have fallen little , even as short-term interest rates reached record lows . 
Rising unemployment adds to a sense of economic insecurity , and may further weaken consumption . 
Record levels of military expenditures are the only major source of expansion , and while such expenditures may be necessary and do stimulate the economy in the short run , they do not enhance its long-term competitiveness and strength . 
After initially believing that its economy was so strong that it would not only be unaffected by America &apos;s slowdown but also maintain robust growth , Europe has turned to looking to the US recovery to lift it out of its malaise . 
I think this is a risky strategy ; if a strong US recovery is not around the corner , then Europe needs to act on its own , using the standard counter-cyclical tools of monetary and fiscal policy . 
The threat today is not inflation , but unemployment . 
It is unemployment and economic insecurity that breed xenophobia and support for extreme rightist movements across the continent . 
Unfortunately , Europe &apos;s hands are partially tied by a central bank that focuses on capping inflation , and a Stability Pact that , as customarily interpreted , limits the use of deficit spending as an economic stimulus . 
The challenge going forward will be to reinterpret these strictures . 
The prospect of sustained long-term growth and social justice requires that Europe &apos;s new institutions retain sufficient flexibility to reshape themselves as they confront new problems .
