The Afghan Endgame Mirage 
STOCKHOLM - On a recent visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan , I could not fail to notice the increasingly frequent international calls for an &quot; endgame &quot; in Afghanistan . 
But an endgame for that country is a dangerous illusion : the game will not end , and neither will history . 
The only thing that could come to an end is the world &apos;s attention and engagement in Afghanistan , which could well lead to catastrophic consequences . 
Much international focus is now on the year 2014 , the target date for completion of the gradual transfer of responsibility for security from international forces to the Afghan government . 
This process is not without challenges , but there is no reason to believe that it could not be finalized more or less according to plan and the current timetable . 
My belief is that there is another , far more critical challenge facing Afghanistan in 2014 : the election of a new president . 
In a system where so much power - open and hidden , constitutional and traditional - is centered around the president , the election could well turn into an all-out battle for the country &apos;s future . 
The presidential election of 2009 - in which Hamid Karzai gained a second term - was a highly contentious affair , and neither the Afghan political system nor the international community came through it with flying colors . 
Together with the battle over the Taliban &apos;s future role in the country , the struggle for power in 2014 could reanimate divisions that take the country back to the brink of a wider civil war , with the liberal technocrats of Kabul crushed between a resurgent Northern Alliance and a wider &quot; Pashtun Pact . &quot; 
Such a scenario would , of course , spell disaster for Afghanistan . 
But the implications would be far broader . 
We must not ignore the grave dangers that it would pose for Pakistan , where a new round of jihadist rhetoric and mobilization could be fatal to hopes of building a stable and more secure country . 
We should have learned the lesson of the 1980 &quot; s : ignorance is not bliss . 
What , then , is the proper policy for the international community ? 
First , we must focus on what is most important - a transition to a post-Karzai system that is seen as reasonably legitimate by all parts of Afghanistan . 
This is primarily a question of making the elections as free and as fair as possible , and here the United Nations &quot; role will be critical . 
But it is also imperative to establish a wide national consensus on the rules of the game . 
Karzai can leave no better legacy than an orderly transition , and has no interest in seeing all that he has achieved go up in flames . 
Second , we must encourage a true regional dialogue that prevents Afghanistan from becoming a battleground for devastating proxy wars . 
Here , the key will be to bridge the gulf between Pakistan &apos;s government and the forces of northern Afghanistan . 
Pakistan must do whatever is necessary to convince everyone that it will not play a hidden game with the Taliban - assuming , of course , that it has no such intention . 
It is equally important that Pakistan and India engage in an open dialogue that can establish trust and transparency in their respective policies concerning Afghanistan . 
Today , this dialogue hardly exists , and their mutual maneuvering , fueled by mistrust , could easily destabilize their weaker neighbor . 
Finally , for reasons of history , geography , and culture , Iran &apos;s role in Afghanistan cannot and should not be ignored . 
There is no reason why the West &apos;s strategic objectives concerning Afghanistan should change fundamentally in the coming years . 
The key now is to get our priorities right . 
Securing an orderly political transition and encouraging a deep and broad regional dialogue should now be at the top of the international agenda for Afghanistan . 
Not only are these objectives important in themselves ; they are also central in creating the right framework for a settlement between the various Afghan parties and the Taliban . 
Some now argue that large-scale engagement in Afghanistan was a mistake . 
But , in the mirror of history , we can see that the greater mistake has been to abandon the country altogether . 
Afghanistan connects Central and South Asia , and a breakdown of order there would pose grave risks in both directions . 
Moreover , the world - not just the West , but Russia and China as well - would risk global proliferation of drugs , weapons , and terror . 
The task now is not to seek an illusory endgame . 
The book is not finished ; we are merely entering a new chapter . 
What we must do now is create the framework for a more stable Afghanistan , and for sustained international engagement in a region that is crucial for global stability .
