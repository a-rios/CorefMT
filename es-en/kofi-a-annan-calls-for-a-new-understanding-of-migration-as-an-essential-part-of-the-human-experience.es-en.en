Sympathy for the Migrant 
GENEVA - The tragic fate of the several hundred Africans who drowned near the Italian island of Lampedusa in October made international headlines , leading to a rare moment of compassion and reflection about the dangers facing many migrants . 
But the only exceptional aspect of this disaster was the magnitude of the death toll . 
For Lampedusa &apos;s residents , shipwrecks involving refugees and migrants are a common occurrence : a week later , a boat carrying Syrian and Palestinian refugees capsized off the shores of the island , leaving more than 30 people dead . 
The year 2013 demonstrated , as if any further demonstration were needed , that these catastrophes are not restricted to European shores or to the Mediterranean Sea . 
In November , nearly 30 Haitians perished when their boat ran aground on its way to the United States - the third case in the northern Caribbean since October . 
Along the Mexico-US border , the deployment of sophisticated border controls leads people to starve while attempting passage in the desert &apos;s remotest stretches . 
In the Asia-Pacific region , hundreds of migrants and refugees have drowned this year in the Bay of Bengal or while trying to reach Australia . 
Wealthy states and regions face the dilemma of designing border controls that reflect not only the needs and demands of their populations , but also their responsibility to those seeking to enter their territory . 
None of this is new : ever since national frontiers were invented , people have been crossing them , whether formally or under the radar . 
Whether they have done so in search of economic opportunities or to escape violence or environmental disasters , host countries have reacted with a mix of welcome and wariness . 
States that tighten their borders encourage desperate people , exploited by cynical smugglers and traffickers , to take greater risks to cross them . 
As the International Organization for Migration stated shortly after the Lampedusa tragedy , implementation of enhanced border controls &quot; did not have sufficient impact or decrease the number of arrivals to the South of Europe in the long run . 
On the contrary , migrants started to explore alternative and mostly dangerous routes with a frequent rate of deaths at sea . &quot; 
Of course , not all migrants are refugees or require protection . 
In fact , migrants on the same boat may have very different motives - what policymakers call &quot; mixed migration . &quot; 
But , faced with a complex picture , states have tended to address the flow of migrants they deem undesirable by saying , in effect , &quot; out of sight , out of mind . &quot; 
This is especially true when domestic anti-immigrant sentiment spikes , typically during economic downturns like the one that many regions currently are experiencing . 
A single-minded focus on sealing borders - a particularly worrying trend in states &quot; approach to migration controls today - tends to regard migrants as unwanted trespassers even before their status can be determined , their rights upheld , or their contributions acknowledged . 
It may also discourage people from helping the vulnerable : there are reports in the Mediterranean of private vessels avoiding migrant boats in distress for fear of being reprimanded by European border patrols . 
We must recognize the desperation of those who attempt these journeys . 
From friends or from the media , they know what awaits them . 
They are aware of the risks and have heard the horror stories . 
Seeing their options for passage narrowing , they put themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers , often at enormous expense . 
Equally important , governments should view migration as a profoundly binding dimension of the human experience . 
Through migration , human beings share an understanding of sorrow , hope , and compassion . 
Indeed , this understanding has inspired some of the international community &apos;s greatest feats of solidarity , such as the 1951 Refugee Convention , which defines a person &apos;s right to find safe havens across borders . 
The continuing rise in migrant deaths in transit poses a conundrum : as these migrants are pushed toward trafficking and smuggling networks , they are dragged further into the grey areas of the international community &apos;s response . 
For example , the European Union &apos;s border police do not have clear search-and-rescue guidelines for migrant ships in distress . 
Member states are divided on how to address this , and recent discussions in Brussels have only begun to make some progress . 
As 2014 begins , the world needs clearer lines of responsibility for averting further tragedies . 
As an international community , we owe migrants and refugees greater compassion . 
Otherwise , we will continue to wake , every so often , to find a graveyard on our shores .
