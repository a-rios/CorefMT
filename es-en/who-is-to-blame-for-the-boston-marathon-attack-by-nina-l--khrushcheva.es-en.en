The Boston Paradox 
MOSCOW - Whose fault is it that the Boston Marathon was bombed ? 
Is Russia to blame for 250 years of trying to incorporate the Muslim North Caucasus nations , like the Chechens and Dagestanis , first into the czars &quot; Christian Orthodox Empire , then into the Soviet Union , and now into President Vladimir Putin &apos;s all-controlling Russian state ? 
Or is radical Islam the only explanation we need , both in Russia and the West ? 
The attack by Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has invariably elicited comparisons to the Saudi-born terrorists who struck the United States on September 11 , 2001 , or to the Pakistani immigrant Faisal Shahzad , who attempted to set off a car bomb in Times Square in 2010 . 
Others have suggested that the 26-year-old Tamerlan , an ethnic Chechen , may have witnessed the Russian / Chechen war of 1999 , or Russia &apos;s brutal efforts to pacify insurgent fighting in the North Caucasus . 
Overwhelmed by the Russian Army &apos;s ruthlessness , it is said , he and his teenage brother chose to spread the violence to US soil . 
The problem with this explanation , of course , is that the Tsarnaev brothers were from Kyrgyzstan . 
They never lived in Chechnya , and only briefly passed through Dagestan in the early 2000 &quot; s . 
Their ties with the region are those of the diaspora . 
Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov , a former rebel , immediately said that the brothers had nothing to do with his republic . 
Dzhokhar , now 19 , was only eight years old when the family moved to the US - settling in Cambridge , Massachusetts - and by many accounts he was a reasonably well-adjusted American-immigrant . 
He recently began to identify with his religious and ethnic origins , and was experiencing academic difficulties at university , but he was well versed in multiple US subcultures . 
Tamerlan , a boxer almost good enough to turn professional , was married to an American Christian woman who converted to Islam and became observant with her husband . 
Patimat Suleimanova , the Tsarnaevs &quot; aunt in Dagestan , explained that her older nephew never prayed before he went to America at age 16 . 
&quot; He didn &apos;t even know what Islam was , &quot; she told CNN . 
In her view , Tamerlan &apos;s radicalization was made in America . 
Essentially , the young men &apos;s stories are not so different from America &apos;s home grown &quot; lone wolves , &quot; typically white and equally disenchanted , who have so often shed blood in the US . 
The difference is that white men are not collectively blamed for the atrocities . 
Adam Lanza in Newtown , Connecticut , or James Holmes in Aurora , Colorado , are not viewed as part of a &quot; suspicious &quot; religious or ethnic group . 
Even when non-Muslim white men launch explicitly terrorist attacks - for example , Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , who murdered 168 people in 1995 , or the &quot; Unabomber &quot; Theodore Kaczynski - their offenses are typically regarded as isolated law-enforcement issues , not as terrorism . 
By contrast , darker-skinned terrorism suspects , especially Muslims , are considered agents of larger conspiracies that require military involvement and justify human-rights violations . 
The initial call by various US congressmen to prosecute Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as an &quot; enemy combatant &quot; is a case in point . 
Never mind that Tsarnaev is a naturalized US citizen , and thus cannot be tried by military tribunals , or that he was captured on US soil , not on a battlefield . 
To President Barack Obama &apos;s credit , Tsarnaev will be tried in a civilian court . 
But that has not altered Americans &quot; tendency to generalize invidiously about peoples and countries . 
Indeed , so rapid was the vilification of Chechens that the Czech Republic &apos;s ambassador to the US felt compelled to issue a statement aimed at preventing any confusion among Americans about his country &apos;s involvement . 
In Russia , too , the fallout is pernicious . 
The Tsarnaevs &quot; attack superficially appears to justify Putin &apos;s nationalist politics in the North Caucasus , and to lend credence to his argument that Russia &apos;s two wars against Chechen independence - from 1994 to 1996 and in 1999 - were waged in the name of national security . 
In this sense , the Boston bombings have been a diplomatic gift to him . 
But just about the only thing that seems clear about this murderous affair is that utterly alienated young men of any religion or ethnicity might suddenly rebel violently . 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev &apos;s reluctant rejection of the materialistic American life - even after the bombing , he continued to tweet , attend campus parties , and go to the gym - appears to have been consolidated by what indeed could have been his older brother &apos;s resentment of Putin &apos;s brutal reassertion of control in the North Caucasus . 
In that case , however , the Boston bombings appear to present a paradox . 
While the Tsarnaev brothers may have objected to the supposed vanity of the secular state , there is another sense in which they might be right that Russia and the West are not so different from each other . 
Just as Russia must deal with a growing wave of fundamentalism that its own policies have fueled , the summary condemnation of Muslims in America will breed more alienation and retribution from within . 
After all , the attacks on the Madrid train system in 2004 , and on London &apos;s public-transport system in 2005 , were not carried out by Saudi or Taliban immigrants , but by young men born and raised in Spain and the United Kingdom . 
For years afterward , the US was held out as an exception - a country in which young men , whatever their background , felt truly at home . 
The Boston Marathon bombings , like so many acts of mass violence in America , should retire that view once and for all .
