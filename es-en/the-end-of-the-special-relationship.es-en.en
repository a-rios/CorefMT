The End of the Special Relationship ? 
TEL AVIV - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu &apos;s recent visit to Washington highlighted fundamental disagreements between Israel &apos;s current government and President Barack Obama &apos;s administration . 
Netanyahu persists in questioning Obama &apos;s infatuation with the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , and he refuses to see the link that Obama believes exists between an Israeli-Palestinian peace and his capacity to curtail Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Nor is Netanyahu especially happy with Obama &apos;s reluctance to set a firm deadline for talks with Iran . 
Israelis believe that Iran is galloping into the nuclear club , and will shrewdly use the prospect of talks with the US to pre-empt tougher sanctions or a military strike . 
Crises and profound disagreements are not new in the relations between these two unequal allies . 
But , however fundamental the current differences might be , it is the underlying suspicion that Obama is poised to shift America away from its unique relationship with the Jewish state that most worries Israelis . 
A convergence of interests and a profoundly emotional attitude to Israel &apos;s story and to the Jewish narrative since the Holocaust have been the motive forces behind what is perhaps one of the most intriguing alliances in international relations . 
In fact , there is no single , exclusive explanation for America &apos;s persistent vindication of its commitment to Israel , and for the uniquely vigorous resonance that Israel &apos;s cause has had in the United States . 
American presidents since Harry Truman , the first world leader to recognize Israel in 1948 ( against the advice of then Secretary of State General George C. Marshall ) , have embodied in varying degrees either the emotional or the realpolitik aspect - some represented both - of the relationship . 
The suspicion today is that Barack Obama is committed to neither . 
Obama is a revolutionary phenomenon in American history ; he certainly does not fit the traditional pattern of American presidents after World War II . 
He was far less shaped by religious and biblical teachings than all of them , and the narrative of Jewish history and of Israel &apos;s heroic emergence out of the ashes of the Holocaust is not the primordial sentiment in his attitude toward the Arab-Israeli conflict . 
The narrative of the Palestinian tragedy is certainly no less central in defining his view of the Middle East . 
But even when US administrations have not embodied an emotional attachment to Israel , they have still backed Israel &apos;s cause , provided that doing so can be sustained by considerations of realpolitik . 
That was clearly the case with Richard Nixon , who never suffered from an excess of love for Jews , but was nonetheless one of the staunchest allies that Israel ever had in the White House . 
Devoid of sentimental attachment to Israel &apos;s cause and deeply disturbed by its policies in the occupied territories , Obama represents the specter of a White House where neither love nor interests are shared with the Jewish state . 
The thrust of Obama &apos;s Middle East policy - reconciling America with the Arab and Muslim world - clashes with Netanyahu &apos;s strategy . 
For Obama &apos;s emerging policy assumes that the best way to address the challenge of Islamic terrorism and stop the region &apos;s decline into uncontrolled nuclear proliferation is to force Israel to stop building new settlements , withdraw from the occupied territories in order to allow the creation of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital , and make peace with Syria by giving back the Golan Heights . 
But this does not necessarily mean that we are witnessing the end of the US-Israel &quot; special relationship . &quot; 
Even a revolutionary president will not depart from America &apos;s core commitments to an Israel that fights for reasonable and morally defensible positions . 
So far , Obama has been careful not to depart from any of the traditional American positions pertaining to Israel &apos;s security . 
He has accepted the logic of Israel &apos;s special nuclear status and its position as a major recipient of American military aid . 
Moreover , the watchdog of Israel &apos;s interests , the US Congress , remains vigilant . 
Netanyahu knows that the daunting task of maintaining Israel &apos;s relationship with the US is as much a vital strategic necessity as it is a compelling domestic requirement . 
There is bound to be more convergence down the road , when he decides to define Israel &apos;s real , not ideological , red lines . 
It is because Netanyahu is driven by an almost Messianic determination to prevent Iran from acquiring the means to destroy Israel , that he might be amenable to a fundamental change in his position on Palestine , provided Obama makes visible headway in his drive to stop Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
In Netanyahu &apos;s view , solving the Palestinian problem would not remove the Iranian challenge ; rather , it is the neutralization of that existential threat that would pave the way to the creation of a Palestinian state . 
Netanyahu also knows that the Arab side &apos;s failures have nurtured radical Zionism . 
As John Kerry , the Chairman of the US Senate &apos;s Foreign Affairs Committee , put it , &quot; this peace process is not a one way street &quot; in which the onus is put exclusively on Israel . 
It remains to be seen if the abysmally dysfunctional Arab world and the powerful non-state agents in its midst , such as Hamas and Hezbollah , will respond the way Obama expects . 
More importantly , the Palestinian leadership must reshape and reunite its polity to face the challenge of statehood . 
So far , the task of reconciling Hamas and Fatah seems to be no less daunting than that of striking a peace deal with Israel .
