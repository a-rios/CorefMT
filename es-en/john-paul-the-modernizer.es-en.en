John Paul the Modernizer 
The death of Pope John Paul II was not unexpected , and his immense influence on the modern world will be judged and commented on by everybody who thinks that he has something to say . 
Before explaining one of the less known aspects of his teaching , it should be emphasized that one of the comments that is now being heard repeatedly is based either on stupidity or on a lack of understanding of what the Catholic Church is about : the charge that the Pope was and is &quot; conservative &quot; is nonsense . 
John Paul II was undoubtedly conservative when he commented on Catholic dogma , but the institution of the Catholic Church is based on the Ten Commandments and dogmas which cannot be changed . 
Being truthful and faithful to what is the bedrock of Church teaching cannot be deemed conservative . 
In reality , John Paul II was called &quot; conservative &quot; because he was against abortion and some other progressive ideas . 
But if you want a Pope who is for abortion , then you want a different Church . 
Some things , some values that constitute both the faith and membership in the Catholic Church , are neither conservative nor liberal or progressive ; they are fundamental , inevitable and immutable . 
John Paul II had a specific task that he implemented during his nearly 27-year papacy : following through on the changes in the teaching and behavior of the Catholic Church that were started by the Second Vatican Council over forty years ago . 
Before then , the Catholic Church had lost almost two centuries ( XVIII and XIX ) because it refused to accept that the world had changed , that social and economic issues are among the most important , that modernity happened . 
Only with the Second Vatican Council did things begin to change in the Church , and the impact of John Paul II was immense . 
One of the questions that the Church could not answer in a satisfactory way for nearly three centuries concerned its attitude towards the economy and society . 
The Church tried everything possible to avoid an unequivocal approval of capitalism . 
After Leo XIII stated for the first time - in the famous encyclical 
So when , a hundred years after Leo XIII , John Paul II issued his encyclical 
That encyclical also contained a second fundamental statement concerning the idea of profit . 
&quot; The Church acknowledges the legitimate role of profit as an indication that a business is functioning well . 
When a firm makes a profit , this means that productive factors have been properly employed and corresponding human needs have been duly satisfied . &quot; 
Once again , the Pope added a caveat : &quot; But profitability is not the only indicator of a firm &apos;s condition . 
It is possible for the financial accounts to be in order , and yet for the people - who make up the firm &apos;s most valuable asset - to be humiliated and their dignity offended . 
Besides being morally inadmissible , this will eventually have negative repercussions on the firm &apos;s economic efficiency . &quot; 
John Paul II was no follower of neo-liberalism . 
For him , markets and profits were not a solution to human problems , but a mechanism to be used for moral purposes . 
Indeed , we often forget that both Adam Smith and Herbert Spencer &apos;s reasoning are very similar . 
Both of them - the two greatest thinkers that promoted the idea of the free market - were also moral philosophers . 
For them , as for John Paul II , the free market and profits were ways to improve humanity . 
They were sometimes naive , as when Spencer hoped that rich citizens would nearly automatically be good citizens and thus find it natural to help those who were not so successful . 
John Paul II might have been naive , too , but only up to a point . 
Everything depends on our idea of human nature . 
If we believe , as the Catholic Church believes , that human beings bear the burden of original sin , but are perfectible ; that human beings can understand what is good and bad and can choose between them because we have free will , then approval of the free market is understandable and not naive . 
By this one encyclical , John Paul II moved Church teaching from the Middle Ages to modernity . 
The debate the Pope began on the relationship between the free market and moral problems remains unfinished . 
Eliminating the abuses that accompany capitalism and harnessing it for the benefit of society and human morals still needs to be tackled . 
John Paul II had the courage to raise the fundamental questions that needed asking . 
We will continue to ask them without his leadership and prompting ?
