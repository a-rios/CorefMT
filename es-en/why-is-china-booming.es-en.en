Why is China Booming ? 
Providence , R.I. - China is now celebrating the 30th anniversary of the period officially known as &quot; reform and opening . &quot; 
Labeling time in this way echoes China &apos;s imperial history . 
During moments of political transition - a military victory , for example - the emperor might designate a special &quot; era name &quot; to help celebrate the good news . 
Or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle , in an effort to wipe the slate clean . 
The last emperor of the Tang Dynasty proclaimed seven era names in fourteen years , as he sought in vain to &quot; re-brand &quot; his reign and avoid his regime &apos;s demise . 
Deng Xiaoping began to champion &quot; reform and opening &quot; in 1978 . 
&quot; Reform &quot; suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life , undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism , as an antidote to Mao Zedong &apos;s ideology of &quot; revolution . &quot; 
Similarly , &quot; opening &quot; heralded the PRC &apos;s integration into the world community - especially the capitalist West . 
Deng &apos;s principles still guide policy today . 
One must go back to the Qing Dynasty ( 1644-1912 ) and its 60-year era of &quot; heavenly flourishing &quot; ( Qianlong ) in the eighteenth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy . 
The era of &quot; reform and opening &quot; has outlived its &quot; emperor &quot; by more than a decade , and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from Deng to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao . 
Even the largest popular challenge the Chinese Communist Party ever faced , the demonstrations of 1989 , now looks like a blip that helped Deng consolidate support for his model of development . 
If one factor undergirds China &apos;s commitment to &quot; reform and opening , &quot; it is the extraordinary macroeconomic changes of the past 30 years . 
In China , people call it fazhan , or &quot; development , &quot; but in much of rest of the world , it is more commonly described simply as the &quot; China Boom , &quot; or the &quot; China Miracle . &quot; 
The boom began in the countryside in the late 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , and was followed by today &apos;s urban , industrial-led growth . 
Indeed , there have been many smaller &quot; booms &quot; - in consumption , foreign direct investment , domestic stock markets , trade , travel , overseas study , military modernization , and international diplomacy . 
There is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste , and booming interest in religion - from Buddhism to Pentecostal Christianity - and in Confucian philosophy . 
Little in China today speaks of moderation . 
A leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influx of women into the workforce , particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south . 
Another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits Chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives , he believes , from the fact that Chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise . 
High tolerance for failure keeps everybody striving to succeed . 
Whatever the cause , the boom seems an unlikely capstone to a century of war , ferment , and revolution , and only adds to the sense of discontinuity that characterizes modern China . 
Certainly , few observers looking in 1978 at the smoldering embers of the Cultural Revolution , or at the seeming ruination of the post-1989 years , thought China would emerge as the lightning rod of the world &apos;s developmental hopes . 
Paradoxically , the apparently discontinuous and contradictory nature of the &quot; era of reform and opening &quot; may actually help explain how China &apos;s boom came about . 
The tumult of the Maoist period instilled in a broad cross-section of people a profound appreciation for stability , and a yearning to be left alone . 
Deng capitalized on this revolution-weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people &apos;s private lives and freeing them to release their pent-up energy to pursue their own goals . 
Revolutionary communism may well have cleared the path for the boom in other ways as well , suggesting that the shift from socialist utopianism to capitalist pragmatism was less a U-turn than a sequential process of &quot; creative destruction . &quot; 
After all , Mao &apos;s Cultural Revolution against &quot; feudal society &quot; did raze much of the cultural landscape , denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions , but also of failed socialist efforts , leaving China ready for the seeds of capitalist development . 
Mao &apos;s revolution fueled countless rectification movements and campaigns that inverted the once-inviolate primacy of ruler over ruled , scholar over worker , husband over wife , father over son , and family over individual . 
By the time of the reforms of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , bonds tying individuals to culture , the state , the work unit , and household-registration systems , for example , had largely unraveled . 
The path had been cleared for a vast new population of atomized entrepreneurs and laborers , freed from fealty to family and Party , to storm the marketplace with newly liberated individual energy . 
Of course , the boom &apos;s costs should not be discounted . 
Environmental damage has been staggering , the gap between rich and poor has been growing , and urbanization - with all its attendant problems - has surged . 
And , at least so far , the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped . 
But still , a key question remains unanswered : why did China &apos;s boom happen ? 
This is one of the great questions of our time , relevant not only to China &apos;s future , but to scores of other developing countries enthralled by China &apos;s extraordinary , but still largely unexplained , success .
