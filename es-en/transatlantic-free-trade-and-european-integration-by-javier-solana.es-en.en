The European-American Dream 
MADRID - Today , three European countries are among the world &apos;s seven largest economies . 
Ten years from now , only two will remain . 
By 2030 , only Germany will still be on the list , and by 2050 , none will remain . 
Indeed , by then , the United States will be the only representative of the West in the top seven . 
What this means is that the European states are too small to compete separately in the world of the twenty-first century . 
It &apos;s as simple as that . 
By 2030 , according to the World Bank , there will be two billion more people , mainly Asians , in the middle class . 
The pressure on the planet &apos;s resources , commodities , water , and food will be huge , making a global rebalancing practically inevitable . 
And in a world marked by interdependence and constant change , Europe will find that unity is strength . 
Indeed , unless Europeans work toward integration , they may find themselves surpassed by emerging countries in terms of technological development , job creation , production costs , talent , and creativity . 
The European Union is still the place where economic and social institutions assure a better quality of life . 
In this sense , the demand for a European voice in the world is clear - Brazil &apos;s former president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , spoke of the EU as a &quot; singular international heritage &quot; - because it guarantees the values that represent humanity at its best . 
Those values are embodied partly in Europe &apos;s well-developed welfare states , which are an important component of Europeans &quot; collective identity and a principal point of pride . 
True , in terms of economic equality , there is only a two-to-one difference in per capita GDP between the richest US state and the poorest ( excluding the District of Columbia ) , while in the EU the ratio is 6.5 to one . 
But , in terms of conditions within US states and EU countries , things are very different . 
The average Gini coefficient ( where zero is absolute equality and one is absolute inequality ) in Europe is 0.30 , compared to 0.45 in the US . 
China &apos;s coefficient is 0.47 . 
American society is very unequal ( and China &apos;s is slightly more so ) . 
In Europe , the opposite is true . 
Its societies are much more egalitarian , while convergence among them is still a long way off ( this is , indeed , the great task that Europe faces ) . 
From this perspective , it is not difficult to comprehend Europe &apos;s international appeal . 
Consider the following thought experiment ( a variation on the &quot; veil of ignorance &quot; conjured by the philosopher John Rawls in his effort to design a just society ) : Taking into account the level and quality of social protection , public education , and health care in the EU and the US , and without knowing beforehand what your social position would be in either society , where would you prefer to be born ? 
But , if Europe wants to maintain its prosperity-sharing institutions , it must generate economic growth in order to pay for them . 
That means raising productivity and strengthening competitiveness - and , equally important , asserting Europe &apos;s place in the world . 
Europeans have a new reason for hope as they seek to achieve these goals : a transatlantic free-trade agreement . 
Not long ago , in the 1980 &quot; s , Europe was dismissed ( by conservative Americans in particular ) with the term &quot; eurosclerosis . &quot; 
The decade following the oil crisis of 1979 was marked by a spike in unemployment , fiscal paralysis , and , indeed , frozen accession negotiations for Spain and Portugal . 
European economies were stagnating , while the US and Japan were growing . 
At the time , Europe &apos;s common market was not yet a single market . 
Then , a historic convergence of national interests and ideological positions ( from François Mitterrand &apos;s Socialists to Margaret Thatcher &apos;s Conservatives to Helmut Kohl &apos;s Christian Democrats ) occurred . 
With great foresight , Europe &apos;s leaders concluded that it was their economies &quot; lack of integration that was keeping Europe from growing as strongly as the US and Japan . 
The solution was to create a much larger market : a single market . This effort culminated in the Single European Act of 1986 , which laid the foundation for the virtuous circle of strong growth and lower unemployment in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Today , the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) is finally on the table , promising to boost growth in the EU and the US alike . 
In 2012 , US exports to the EU totaled roughly € 206 billion ( $ 272 billion ) , while EU exports to the US amounted to nearly € 300 billion . 
Thirty million jobs in Europe ( about 10 % of the total work force ) depend on foreign trade . 
The quantities are huge , which suggests that the TTIP could have an effect comparable to that of the single market for Europe . 
That process is long and slow , but it is the only way to maintain Europe &apos;s relevance as an international actor , with something to say and to offer . 
Indeed , it has been this process - now in its seventh decade - that has enabled Europeans to enjoy the highest standard of living in the world .
