All Stimulus Roads Lead to China 
BEIJING - Now that the &quot; green shoots &quot; of recovery have withered , the debate over fiscal stimulus is back with a vengeance . 
In the United States , those who argue for another stimulus package observe that it was always wishful thinking to believe that a $ 787 billion package could offset a $ 3 trillion fall in private spending . 
But unemployment has risen even faster and further than expected . 
Combine this with the continued fall in housing prices , and it is understandable that consumer spending remains depressed . 
The banks , having been recapitalized only to the extent necessary to keep them afloat , still have weak balance sheets . 
Their consequent reluctance to lend constrains investment . 
Meanwhile , state governments , seeing revenues fall as a result of lower taxable incomes last year , are cutting back like mad . 
If there was a case for additional stimulus back in February , that case is even stronger now . 
But the case against additional stimulus is also strong . 
The US federal deficit is an alarming 12 % of GDP , and public debt as a share of national income is already projected to double , to 80 % of GDP . 
The idea that the US can grow out of its debt burden , as did Finland and Sweden following their financial crises in the 1990 &quot; s , seems unrealistic . 
Given all this , more deficit spending will only stoke fears of higher future taxes and inflation . 
It will encourage the reemergence of global imbalances . 
And it will not reassure consumers or investors . 
It is possible to argue the economics both ways , but the politics all point in one direction . 
The US Congress lacks the stomach for another stimulus package . 
It has already faced intense criticism for its failure to get the country &apos;s fiscal house in order . 
The slowness with which the first stimulus has been rolled out , and the fact that it will take even more time for its full effects to be felt , provides more fodder for the chattering classes . 
Disappointment over the effects of the TARP has already destroyed popular - and Congressional - support for more public money to recapitalize the banks . 
So , even those who find the economic logic of arguments for fiscal activism compelling must acknowledge that the politics are not supportive . 
A second stimulus simply is not in the cards . 
If there is going to be more aggregate demand , it can come from only one place . 
That place is not Europe or Japan , where debts are even higher than in the US - and the demographic preconditions for servicing them less favorable . 
Rather , it is emerging markets like China . 
The problem is that China has already done a lot to stimulate domestic demand , both through government spending and by directing its banks to lend . 
As a result , its stock market is frothy , and it is experiencing an alarming property boom . 
Through May , property prices were up 18 % year on year . 
Understandably , Chinese officials worry about bubble trouble . 
The obvious way to square this circle is to spend more on imports . 
China can purchase more industrial machinery , transport equipment , and steelmaking material , which are among its leading imports from the US . 
Directing spending toward imports of capital equipment would avoid overheating China &apos;s own markets , boost the economy &apos;s productive capacity ( and thus its ability to grow in the future ) , and support demand for US , European , and Japanese products just when such support is needed most . 
This strategy is not without risks . 
Allowing the renminbi to appreciate as a way of encouraging imports may also discourage exports , the traditional motor of Chinese growth . 
And lowering administrative barriers to imports might redirect more spending toward foreign goods than the authorities intend . 
But these are risks worth taking if China is serious about assuming a global leadership role . 
The question is what China will get in return . 
And the answer brings us back , full circle , to where we started , namely to US fiscal policy . 
China is worried that its more than $ 1 trillion investment in US Treasury securities will not hold its value . 
It wants reassurance that the US will stand behind its debts . 
It therefore wants to see a credible program for balancing the US budget once the recession ends . 
And , tough talk notwithstanding , the Obama administration has yet to offer a credible roadmap for fiscal consolidation . 
Doing so would reassure American taxpayers worried about current deficits . 
Just as importantly , it would reassure Chinese policymakers . 
We live in a multipolar world where neither the US nor China is large enough to exercise global economic leadership on its own . 
For China , leadership means assuming additional risks . 
But for this to be tolerable , the US needs to relieve China of existing risks . 
Only by working together can the two countries lead the world economy out of its current doldrums .
