The Global Economy &apos;s Chinese Headwinds 
BEIJING - Last year , the global economy was supposed to start returning to normal . 
Interest rates would begin rising in the United States and the United Kingdom ; quantitative easing would deliver increased inflation in Japan ; and restored confidence in banks would enable a credit-led recovery in the eurozone . 
Twelve months later , normality seems as distant as ever - and economic headwinds from China are a major cause . 
To spur economic growth and achieve prosperity , China has sought to follow the path forged by Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan , but with one key difference : size . 
With populations of 127 million , 50 million , and 23 million , respectively , these model Asian economies could rely on export-led growth to lift them to high-income levels . 
But the world market is simply not big enough to support high incomes for China &apos;s 1.3 billion citizens . 
To be sure , the export-led model did work in China for some time , with the trade surplus rising to 10 % of GDP in 2007 , and manufacturing jobs absorbing surplus rural labor . 
But the flip side of China &apos;s surplus was huge credit-fueled deficits elsewhere , particularly in the US . 
When the credit bubble collapsed in 2008 , China &apos;s export markets suffered . 
In order to stave off job losses and sustain economic growth , China stimulated domestic demand by unleashing a wave of credit-fueled construction . 
As commodity imports soared , the current-account surplus fell below 2 % of GDP . 
China &apos;s own economy , however , became more unbalanced . 
Investment rose from 42 % of GDP in 2007 to 48 % in 2010 , with property and infrastructure projects attracting the most funding . 
Likewise , credit swelled from 130 % of GDP in 2007 to 220 % of GDP in 2014 , with 45 % of credit extended to real estate or related sectors . 
This property boom resembled Japan &apos;s in the late 1980s , which ended in a bust that led to a protracted period of anemic growth and deflation from which the country is still struggling to escape . 
With China &apos;s per capita income amounting to only a quarter of Japan &apos;s during its boom , the risks the country faces should not be underestimated . 
The rejoinder is that China is relatively safe , because its per capita capital stock also remains far below Japan &apos;s in the 1980s , and much more investment will be needed to support its rapidly expanding urban population ( set to increase from 53 % of the total in 2013 to 60 % by 2020 ) . 
But counting on this investment may be excessively optimistic . 
Though China will indeed need more investment , its capital-allocation mechanism has produced enormous waste . 
In fact , by establishing urbanization as an explicit objective - something that Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan never did - China has embedded a structural economic bias toward construction . 
With hundreds of cities competing with one another through infrastructure development , &quot; ghost towns &quot; will proliferate . 
Making matters worse , China &apos;s local-government financing model could hardly be more effective at producing overinvestment and excessive leverage . 
Local governments use land as collateral to take out loans to fund infrastructure investment , then finance repayment by relying on revenues from subsequent land sales . 
As the property boom wanes , their debts become increasingly unsustainable - a situation that has already reportedly compelled some local governments to borrow money for land purchases to prop up prices . 
In the economist Hyman Minsky &apos;s terminology , simple &quot; speculative &quot; finance has given way to completely circular &quot; Ponzi &quot; activity . 
As a result , though total credit in China continues to grow three times faster than nominal GDP , a major downturn is now underway . 
Property sales have fallen , particularly outside the largest cities , and slower construction growth has left heavy industry facing severe overcapacity . 
The latest survey data indicate a major slowdown in industrial activity . 
Last month , producer prices were down 4.3 % year on year . 
The resulting decline in demand has caused commodity prices to fall considerably , undermining the growth prospects of other major emerging economies . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s current-account surplus has again soared . 
Though it seems significantly smaller than pre-crisis levels as a share of GDP - almost 4 % , at the latest monthly rates , compared to 10 % in 2007 - it has returned to its peak in absolute terms . 
And it is the absolute size of China &apos;s external surplus that determines the impact on global demand . 
In short , China is back to where it started , with its growth dependent on export demand , which is now severely constrained by debt overhangs in advanced countries . 
As a result , China &apos;s downturn has intensified the deflationary headwinds holding back global recovery , playing a major role ( along with increased supply ) in driving down oil prices . 
Though lower oil prices will be a net boon for the world economy , the decline reflects a serious dearth of demand . 
China now must find the solution to a problem that Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan never had to face : how to boost domestic demand rapidly and sustainably . 
Fortunately , 2014 brought some progress on this front , in the form of a slight uptick ( albeit from a very low base ) in household consumption as a percentage of GDP . 
To accelerate consumption growth , China &apos;s leaders must implement a stronger and more comprehensive social safety net , thereby reducing the need for high precautionary savings . 
Higher dividends from state-owned enterprises could help to finance such an initiative , while removing incentives for overinvestment . 
Demographic change - with the number of 15-to-30-year-olds , in particular , falling by 25 % over the next decade - could also help . 
Though population stabilization could exacerbate the dangers of excessive property investment today , it will also tighten labor markets and stimulate wage increases . 
China may well be able to meet the challenge ahead . 
But , as the investment-led phase of its development ends , a significant growth slowdown is certain - and will inevitably intensify deflationary forces in the world economy . 
Given this , 2015 may well prove to be another year in which hopes of a return to normality are disappointed .
