Europe &apos;s Trial by Crisis 
BERLIN - Some 2,500 years ago , the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus concluded that war is the father of all things . 
He might have added that crisis is their mother . 
Fortunately , war between world powers is no longer a realistic option , owing to the threat of mutual nuclear destruction . 
Just as in war , crises fundamentally disrupt the status quo , which means that they create an opportunity - without war &apos;s destructive force - for change that in normal times is hardly possible . 
To overcome a crisis requires doing things that previously were barely conceivable , let alone feasible . 
That is what has happened to the European Union over the last three years , because the global financial crisis has not only shaken Europe to its foundations ; it has assumed life-threatening proportions . 
Compared to the beginning of 2009 , we are now dealing with a significantly different EU - one that has become divided between a vanguard of member states that form the eurozone and a rearguard , consisting of member states that remain outside it . 
The reason is not evil intent , but rather the pressure of the crisis . 
If the euro is to survive , eurozone members must act , while other EU members with various levels of commitment to European integration remain on the fringe . 
Indeed , almost all taboos that existed after the eruption of the crisis have now been abolished . 
Most were established at German instigation , but now they have been removed with the German government &apos;s active support . 
It is an impressive list : national responsibility for bank rescues ; the sanctity of the EU treaty &apos;s proscription of bailouts for governments ; rejection of European economic governance ; the ban on direct government financing by the European Central Bank ; refusal to support mutual liability for debt ; and , finally , the transformation of the ECB from a copy of the old Bundesbank into a European Federal Reserve Bank based on the Anglo-Saxon model . 
What remains is the rejection of Eurobonds , but that , too , will ultimately disappear . 
The only question is whether that taboo will fall before or after next year &apos;s German general election . 
The answer depends on the future course of the crisis . 
Germany , Europe &apos;s largest economy , is playing a strange , sometimes bizarre , role in the crisis . 
At no point since the founding of the Federal Republic in 1949 has the country been so strong . 
It has become the EU &apos;s leading power ; but it is neither willing nor able to lead . 
Precisely for this reason , many of the changes in Europe have occurred despite German opposition . 
In the end , the German government has had to resort to the art of the political U-turn , with the result that Germany , though economically strong , has grown institutionally weaker - a dynamic exemplified by its reduced influence in the ECB &apos;s Governing Council . 
The old Bundesbank was laid to rest on September 6 , when the ECB adopted its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program - unlimited purchases of distressed eurozone countries &quot; government bonds - over the objections of a lone dissenter : Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann . 
And the undertaker was not ECB President Mario Draghi ; it was German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
The Bundesbank did not fall victim to a sinister southern European conspiracy ; rather , it rendered itself irrelevant . 
Had it gotten its way , the eurozone would no longer exist . 
Placing ideology above pragmatism is a formula for failure in any crisis . 
Currently , the eurozone is on the threshold of a banking union , with a fiscal union to follow . 
With 27 members ( 28 with the approaching addition of Croatia ) , EU treaty amendments will be impossible , not only because the United Kingdom continues to resist further European integration , but also because popular referenda would be required in many member states . 
These plebiscites would become a reckoning for national governments on their crisis policies , which no sound-minded government will want . 
This means that intergovernmental agreements will be needed for some time to come , and that the eurozone will develop in the direction of inter-governmental federalism . 
In the end , former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has prevailed , because the eurozone today is led by a de facto economic government that comprises member countries &quot; heads of state and government ( and their finance ministers ) . 
European federalists should welcome this , because the more these heads of state and government turn into a government of the eurozone as a whole , the faster their current dual role as the EU &apos;s executive and legislative branch will become obsolete . 
The European Parliament will not be able to fill the emerging vacuum , as it lacks fiscal sovereignty , which still lies with national parliaments and will remain there indefinitely . 
Only national parliaments can fill the vacuum , and they need a common platform within the eurozone - a kind of &quot; Euro Chamber &quot; - through which they can control European economic governance . 
Federalists in the European Parliament , and in Brussels generally , should not feel threatened . 
On the contrary , they should recognize and use this unique opportunity . 
National MPs and MEPs should come together quickly and clarify their relationship . 
In the medium term , a European Parliament with two chambers could emerge . 
This crisis offers a tremendous opportunity for Europe . 
It has defined the agenda for years to come : banking union , fiscal union , and political union . 
What remains missing is an economic-growth strategy for the crisis countries ; but , given mounting unrest in southern Europe , such a strategy is inevitable . 
Europeans have reason to be optimistic if they recognize the opportunity that their crisis has created - and act boldly and decisively to seize it .
