Elections are Not Enough 
There can be no liberal order without political democracy , but today we are frequently reminded that political democracy alone does not guarantee a liberal order . 
Free and fair elections may lead to the ascendancy of a president of Iran who wants to &quot; wipe Israel off the map of the Middle East . &quot; 
Less damaging , yet problematic , is the election - as in Poland - of a minority government that ruthlessly pursues its members &quot; personal interests and breaks all promises of cooperation made before the polls . 
In other words , elections are not enough if one wants to bring democracy to the world . 
Elections can lead to illiberal democracies and worse . 
They must be embedded in a much more complex institutional framework , which I would describe as the liberal order . 
The first feature of the liberal order is that democracies must not tolerate those who set out to destroy democracy . 
Some countries , like Germany , have laws that make it possible to ban political parties whose programs are recognizably anti-democratic . 
In the past , the law has been used to curb parties of both the extreme left and the extreme right . 
However , it is not always evident when people and parties stand for election what they are going to do if they win . 
This is where rules that impose term limits on officeholders , such as the Twenty-Second Amendment of the United States Constitution , have their place . 
Many constitutions contain such a rule , and even President Vladimir Putin of Russia has stated that he will abide by it . 
Let us hope that this will in fact be the case . 
Elsewhere , notably in many of the Soviet Union &apos;s other successor states and in Latin America , those in power have often simply changed the constitution - including rules on term limits - to their advantage . 
This is where the second pillar of a liberal order comes into play : the rule of law . 
It cannot be said too often that democracy and the rule of law are not the same thing . 
There are lawless democracies and undemocratic &quot; states of law &quot; ( Rechtsstaat ) . 
The constitution of liberty requires both , and the rule of law is the more difficult of the two to establish and maintain , for it requires not just a constitution but , almost more importantly , an independent judiciary that is sensitive to violations of constitutional and other legitimate rules . 
It is extremely important that Iraq held elections to a constitutional assembly . 
This has produced - albeit with a certain amount of external pressure notably on behalf of the Sunnis - a document that may provide the basis for the rule of law . 
But the task of finding , appointing , and accepting independent judges remains . 
It will be particularly difficult in an environment in which the sharia - that is , Islamic religious law administered not by judges but by priests - is never far away . 
The rule of secular law is the most delicate prerequisite of a liberal order . 
Even then , we know from history that it takes but one Enabling Law to unhinge the rule of law and replace it by an ideological tyranny , as happened when Hitler came to power in Germany . 
This is where the third element of a liberal order comes into play : civil society . 
A plurality of civic associations and activities - regulated but not controlled by the state , and free to express its views and even to demonstrate its ( diverse ) sentiments publicly - is the most powerful pillar of a liberal order . 
A vibrant civil society will mobilize when the rule of law is violated , and it can also check the illiberal inclinations of democratic majorities . 
The near-universal availability of information makes it much easier than it was in earlier times for the voluntary non-governmental organizations that form civil society to emerge . 
However , there is no ultimate guarantee against the abuse of power , especially if that power is democratically gained . 
The international community must therefore recognize that it is not enough to promote , organize , or monitor elections in hitherto undemocratic countries . 
The program of spreading the liberal order requires a much more sophisticated approach . 
Above all , it requires international agencies and groupings that remain alert to the risks of illiberal democracies .
