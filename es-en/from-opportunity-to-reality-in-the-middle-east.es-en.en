From Opportunity to Reality in the Middle East 
It has been a long time since the words &quot; opportunity &quot; and &quot; Middle East &quot; appeared in the same sentence . 
Even better , this optimism may have some basis in reality . 
One important reason for this change in attitude is , of course , Yasir Arafat &apos;s disappearance from the scene . 
Like the Thane of Cawdor in Shakespeare &apos;s Macbeth , &quot; Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it . &quot; 
Arafat never grew beyond the man who appeared at the United Nations decades ago with both an olive branch and a gun . 
His unwillingness to jettison terror and choose diplomacy proved his undoing , as he lost legitimacy in the eyes of both Israel and the United States . 
The result was the failure to create a Palestinian state . 
But it is not simply Arafat &apos;s passing that provides cause for optimism . 
We now have a Palestinian leadership legitimized by elections , one that appears to be opposed to using terrorism as a tool to achieve political aims . 
Mahmoud Abbas ( Abu Mazen ) has a good record of questioning the wisdom of the intifada that has taken too many lives and caused only misery and destruction on all sides of this enduring conflict . 
Changes in Israel are also contributing to the mood swing . 
There is a growing awareness in Israel that the current situation - one of open-ended Israeli occupation of lands mostly populated by Palestinians - is inconsistent with Israel &apos;s determination to remain a secure , prosperous , Jewish , and democratic state . 
The formation of a new Israeli government , one more centrist in its composition and support , is another positive development . 
Israel is now led by a prime minister who has the ability to make historic choices and a government inclined to support him . 
But opportunity is just that . 
Middle East history is replete with examples of missed and lost chances to make peace . 
The challenge now is to break this pattern and turn today &apos;s opportunity into reality . 
This requires that the promised Israeli disengagement from Gaza and parts of the West Bank succeed . 
But &quot; success &quot; entails more than departing Israelis . 
It also requires that Palestinians demonstrate that they can govern responsibly and that they can put an end to terrorist violence emanating from Palestinian soil . 
What happens in Gaza after Israel leaves will have a profound impact on Israeli politics . 
If Gaza turns into a lawless failed state , one that is a base for attacks on Israelis , it will be extremely difficult to persuade Israel to withdraw from other areas that it now occupies . 
Palestinians will need help if things are to turn out right in Gaza . 
The US , Europe , and Arab states such as Egypt , along with Russia and the UN , all have a responsibility to assist Abu Mazen . 
Palestinians need financial and technical help to build up a unified and capable security establishment , to revive a moribund economy , and to build a modern , transparent political system . 
It is also important that the Gaza withdrawal be a beginning , not an end , to the political process . 
There must be a link between what takes place in Gaza and a comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian question if Mazen is to persuade a majority of his people that diplomacy and compromise deliver more than violence and confrontation . 
Here , too , there is an important role for America to play . 
In fact , the US has already begun to do what is required . 
In a September 2004 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , President George W. Bush reassured Israelis that it was &quot; unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 . &quot; 
The framework for a solution to the Palestinian refugee issue &quot; will need to be found through the establishment of a Palestinian state , and the settling of Palestinian refugees there , rather than in Israel . &quot; 
These promises meant a great deal to Sharon as he faced domestic political challenges . 
What is needed now is a parallel letter from Bush to Abu Mazen . 
Such a letter could spell out the US commitment to a viable , contiguous , sovereign , and independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines , with compensation provided by Israel wherever territorial adjustments are agreed . 
The US would also commit itself to provide resources to help construct a modern society and economy . 
Help would also be extended to settle the Palestinian refugees , whether in Palestine , other Arab countries , or , in special cases where Israel agrees for humanitarian reasons , in Israel itself . 
In return , Palestinians would need to pledge to reject the use of violence and terror once and for all . 
The US should not , however , make the establishment of a full Palestinian democracy a prerequisite for territorial return and peace . 
To delay negotiations until Palestinian democracy matured would only persuade Palestinians that diplomacy was a ruse and give many a reason to turn to violence . 
After more than a half-century of Israeli-Palestinian conflict , translating opportunity into reality will be difficult enough without introducing new requirements that , however desirable , are not essential .
