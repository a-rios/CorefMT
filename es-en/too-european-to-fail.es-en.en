Too European to Fail 
BERLIN - Among investment bankers , there is renewed speculation about the possibility of a country leaving European Monetary Union - or being pushed out . 
Rating agencies have downgraded Portugal , Greece , and Spain , owing to their poor prospects for economic growth and weak public finances . 
Ireland has been assigned a negative outlook and could soon suffer a downgrade as well . 
With fears mounting that one or another euro-zone country may default , yield spreads on government bonds between EMU countries have reached record highs . 
For some time now , Greek ten-year government-bond yields have been about 300 basis points above German yields . 
This is a sign that investors now see a significant risk of a Greek default or of Greece exiting from EMU and redenominating its government bonds . 
But the panic that EMU may disintegrate is overdone . 
Rather than a default and subsequent exit from the euro zone , the member states are more likely to overrule a fundamental principle of EMU and bail out a fellow member state . 
Leaving EMU would be a costly option for weak-performing countries . 
Of course , regaining the exchange rate as an instrument for competitive devaluation could help overcome competitiveness losses due to soaring unit-labor costs . 
As Argentina showed after its default and devaluation in the winter of 2001 / 2002 , such a move can reignite exports and economic growth . 
But Greece , Portugal , Italy , and Ireland are not Argentina . 
The European Union treaty does not provide for an exit from EMU . 
As a default would demand a change in the currency involved in private contracts , business partners from other EU countries would surely sue , legal uncertainties would drag on and on , and an exiting country &apos;s trade with its main trading partners would be impaired for years to come . 
So none of the countries at risk would seriously consider reintroducing a national currency . 
It is possible that an EMU government will come close to insolvency or illiquidity . 
Indeed , even something like a self-fulfilling debt crisis is thinkable : if market participants believe that a default or an exit from EMU is imminent , this would drive up government bond yields for the country in question . 
At some point , yields might become so high that the government concerned could not refinance its maturing debt or finance its current expenses . 
In this situation , a country would be faced with the sole option of default . 
But even if this scenario is possible in theory , it is unlikely to occur in practice . 
Letting one member fail would create speculative pressure on other EMU governments with weak fiscal positions or shallow domestic bond markets . 
A widespread default of several countries in EMU would lead to serious disruptions of trade within the EU and to new problems in the banking system , which would have to write down their holdings of government bonds . 
The large EU governments are well aware of this problem and would act accordingly . 
With its loans to Hungary and Latvia , the European Commission has already revived a credit facility which was dormant since the European Monetary System crisis in 1992 - and for countries outside EMU . 
The support is huge . 
Together with the International Monetary Fund &apos;s contribution , the EU loan to Latvia amounts to more than 33 % of Latvian GDP . 
By supporting to such a degree two new EU members that are not part of EMU , the EU countries have demonstrated a much greater commitment to mutual aid than was thinkable only a few years ago . 
And more is expected to come : in November 2008 , the Ecofin Council increased the ceiling for possible balance-of-payment loans to non-EMU countries to â‚¬ 25 billion . 
Against this background , it seems inconceivable that the EU should refuse to support an EMU member in a situation similar to that of Hungary and Latvia , especially as all the countries that are currently on market watch lists are long-time EU members . 
In case of real distress , the rest of the EU will offer a bailout package . 
Indeed , the no-bailout clause in Article 103 of the EU Treaty - according to which neither the European Central Bank , the EU , nor national governments &quot; shall &#91; ... &#93; amp # 160 ; be liable for or assume the commitments &quot; for other national governments - has lost its credibility . 
The political and economic costs of letting a fellow member government fail are simply too high in the closely interconnected EMU . 
Because there is no current blueprint for this move , one can only speculate about what it would look like . 
One option is for large EU countries to construct a bailout package . 
Alternatively , the EU could create a special facility through which it borrows money in the bond market to help the member in trouble - an arrangement similar to the bonds that the European Commission has already issued for the emergency facility from which Hungary and Latvia have been borrowing . 
The EU is good at circumventing treaty obligations in times of real crisis . 
There is no reason to expect this skillfulness to desert it this time around .
