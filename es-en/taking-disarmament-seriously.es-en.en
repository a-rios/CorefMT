Taking Disarmament Seriously 
MELBOURNE - People sometimes forget that the boy who cried wolf ended up being eaten . 
True , nobody has been killed by a nuclear weapon since the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , 65 years ago this month . 
But the truth is that it is sheer dumb luck - not statesmanship , good professional management , or anything inherently stable about the world &apos;s nuclear weapon systems - that has let us survive so long without catastrophe . 
With 23,000 nuclear weapons ( equivalent to 150,000 Hiroshimas ) still in existence , more than 7,000 of them actively deployed , and more than 2,000 still on dangerously high launch-on-warning alert , we cannot assume that our luck will hold indefinitely . 
We know now - with multiple revelations about human error and system breakdown on both the American and Russian sides during the Cold War years and since - that even the most sophisticated command and control systems are not foolproof . 
We know that some of the newer nuclear-armed states start with systems much less sophisticated than these . 
So it should be obvious that maintaining the status quo is intolerable . 
Moreover , there is the real risk of proliferation , especially in the Middle East , multiplying the dangers that nuclear weapons will be used by accident or miscalculation as well as design . 
There is also the sometimes exaggerated but unquestionably non-negligible risk of non-state terrorist actors getting their hands on insufficiently secured weapons or fissile material and exploding a bomb in a major population center . 
President Barack Obama came to office alert to all these threats and determined , as no other US president - and almost no other world leader - has been , to eliminate them . 
His leadership inspired hope that more than a decade of sleepwalking was behind us , and brought some modest gains over the last 18 months . 
They include the conclusion of the US-Russia new START treaty , which would reduce deployed strategic weapons ; some modest limitations on the role of nuclear weapons in US nuclear doctrine ; a Washington summit that reached useful agreement on the implementation of improved nuclear-security measures ; and hard-to-achieve consensus at the recently concluded pentannual Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) Review Conference on useful steps forward , including a 2012 conference on achieving a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East . 
But START treaty ratification is going nowhere fast in the US Senate and progress on other key issues has been slow or shaky : bringing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into force ; starting negotiations on a new treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ; strengthening the non-proliferation regime with effective measures to detect violations and deter treaty walk-outs ; reaching agreement on some form of international management of the most sensitive aspects of the fuel cycle ; and , above all , starting new rounds of serious disarmament talks , involving not just the two nuclear superpowers , but all eight nuclear-armed states . 
Arms control and disarmament is a grinding , unglamorous business that brings few quick returns . 
With domestic issues and re-election anxieties now dominating most political agendas , it will be all too easy for commitment to wane . 
If that is to be avoided , continued leadership from the top - above all from Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev - will be indispensable . 
But there are a number of major contributions that less powerful states and leaders , as well as civil-society organizations , can make . 
The most immediately important task is for those with credible voices to take every opportunity to bridge the complacency gap . 
Carbon dioxide can also kill us , but not as quickly as bombs . 
The second major task is to set a clear global disarmament action agenda - with credible timelines and milestones . 
It is probably too difficult right now to set a reliable target date for getting all the way to &quot; global zero &quot; : there are still too many difficult technical problems of verification and enforcement to be worked through , as well as the obvious geopolitical and psychological ones . 
Nor is it too early to begin work on crafting a new Nuclear Weapons Convention that provides a workable framework for multilateral negotiations , and on devising an independent high-level monitoring mechanism that would spell out clear benchmarks for progress , track how they are being met , and create real pressure for change . 
These are all recommendations of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament . 
As the world commemorates the 65th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki this August , we should recognize that our luck is running out - and take them seriously .
