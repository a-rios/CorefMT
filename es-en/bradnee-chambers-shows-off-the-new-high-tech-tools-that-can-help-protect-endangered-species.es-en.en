Cutting-Edge Conservation 
BONN - A small airplane makes its final approach to land . 
This is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle returning from its mission : not hunting down terrorists or spying on foreign lands , but monitoring populations of rhinos and scouting for tiger poachers . 
This drone is not fitted with turbo Rolls Royce jet engines or aperture radar ; instead , it features a Google Map interface , cameras , and simple infrared sensors . 
And it is no more expensive than an average laptop computer . 
Such cheap new technologies are changing the face of conservation ; and , for the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) , which administers the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals , these new conservation tools cannot come soon enough . 
They fill the gaps in our knowledge about long-distance migration by species such as turtles , sharks , elephants , and birds . 
The data gathered are then used to develop tailored conservation strategies for these different species . 
Because species that migrate across oceans and continents tend to be the most endangered , owing to the threats that such long journeys involve , they benefit from any technologies that allow scientists to learn about their behavior . 
For example , an ultra-light band that acts as a geo-locator now allows scientists to track small land birds during their incredible journeys . 
Scientists recently discovered that the red-necked phalarope starts its migration from Scotland &apos;s Shetland Islands , crosses the Atlantic via Iceland and Greenland , flies south along the United States &quot; eastern seaboard to the Caribbean and Mexico , and ends its journey off the coast of Ecuador or Peru . 
The International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space ( ICARUS ) is developing a remote sensing platform that will orbit the earth , allowing scientists worldwide to track small organisms and carry out observations and experiments over large areas . 
As a result , scientists will soon be able to track and better understand extraordinary journeys such as those of loggerhead sea turtles , which are hatched in Australia , where they remain for a few years before migrating across the Pacific Ocean to Chile , Ecuador , or Peru . 
Thirty years later , they return to their birthplace . 
New technologies are also proving invaluable for combating illegal poaching . 
In addition to the use of drones , conservation rangers are now equipped with heat-detecting thermal cameras and military helicopters , and can track elephant and rhino poachers , who reportedly use similar technologies ( as well as automatic weapons ) in pursuing their prey . 
Rangers are also using heat-seeking motion detectors and night-vision goggles to take on illegal bird trappers , who ensnare small songbirds using mobile phones that emit electronic bird calls , and 4x4 vehicles to check hundreds of kilometers of netting . 
Moreover , Germany &apos;s Federal Ministry of Nature Conservation and the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , in collaboration with Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz , have developed a way to measure the isotope in ivory samples to trace their provenance . 
This will allow customs officials and police to ascertain the origins of confiscated ivory so that they can pinpoint trafficking locations . 
Another important use of technology is in reducing the frequency of &quot; human-animal conflict &quot; - inadvertent harm such as the unintended trapping of sharks , manta rays , marine turtles , dolphins , whales , and sea turtles in fishing nets . 
Conservationists have long sought to protect marine life in ways that do not create problems for fishermen . 
Recent tests have shown that shining ultraviolet lights against the submerged nets deters these species without affecting the fishing catch . 
Other forms of human-animal conflict can be avoided with simple , mobile-phone apps . 
The US Fish and Wildlife Service , for example , uses a GPS tracking system to alert boaters on Florida &apos;s inland waterways to potential collisions with manatees . 
In Western Australia , an app now warns swimmers of nearby sharks . 
Similarly , better tracking of migration routes and the use of sensors could teach us more about sharks &quot; movements and habitats , and thus help us to avoid them . 
Although technology alone may not be able to protect all precious migratory species , it can provide vital knowledge and help to enforce important international laws and regulations , such as the Convention on Migratory Species , and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species . 
Moreover , technology can improve our understanding and appreciation of our planet &apos;s fragility , and allow humans and animals to coexist more harmoniously .
