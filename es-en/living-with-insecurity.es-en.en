Living with Insecurity 
I have often wondered why Karl Popper ended the dramatic peroration of the first volume of his Open Society and Its Enemies with the sentence : &quot; We must go on into the unknown , the uncertain and insecure , using what reason we have to plan for both security and freedom . &quot; 
Is not freedom enough ? 
Why put security on the same level as that supreme value ? 
Then one remembers that Popper was writing in the final years of World War II . 
Looking around the world in 2004 , you begin to understand Popper &apos;s motive : freedom always means living with risk , but without security , risk means only threats , not opportunities . 
Examples abound . 
Things in Iraq may not be as bad as the daily news of bomb attacks make events there sound ; but it is clear that there will be no lasting progress towards a liberal order in that country without basic security . 
Afghanistan &apos;s story is even more complex , though the same is true there . 
In Europe and the West , there is the string of terrorist acts - from those on the US in 2001 to the pre-election bombings in Madrid - to think about . 
London &apos;s Mayor and police chief have jointly warned that terrorist attacks in the city are &quot; inevitable . &quot; 
Almost every day there are new warnings , with heavily armed policemen in the streets , concrete barriers appearing in front of embassies and public buildings , stricter controls at airports and elsewhere - each a daily reminder of the insecurity that surrounds us . 
Nor is it only bombs that add to life &apos;s general uncertainties . 
Gradually , awareness is setting in that global warming is not just a gloom and doom fantasy . 
Social changes add to such insecurities . 
All at once we seem to hear two demographic time-bombs ticking : the continuing population explosion in parts of the third world , and the astonishing rate of aging in the first world . 
What will this mean for social policy ? 
How will mass migration affect countries &apos; cultural heritage ? 
There is also a widespread sense of economic insecurity . 
No sooner is an upturn announced than it falters . 
At any rate , employment seems to have become decoupled from growth . 
Millions worry about their jobs - and thus the quality of their lives - in addition to fearing for their personal security . 
Such examples serve to show that the most disquieting aspect of today &apos;s insecurity may well be the diversity of its sources , and that there are no clear explanations and simple solutions . 
Even a formula like &quot; war on terror &quot; simplifies a more complex phenomenon . 
So what should we do ? 
Perhaps we should look at Popper again and remember his advice : to use what reason we have to tackle our insecurities . 
In many cases this requires drastic measures , particularly insofar as our physical security is concerned . 
Checks on security measures that curtail the freedoms that give our lives dignity are as imperative as protection . 
Such checks can take many forms . 
One is to make all such measures temporary by giving these new laws and regulations &quot; sunset clauses &quot; that limit their duration . 
Security must not become a pretext for the suspending and destroying the liberal order . 
A second requirement is that we look ahead more effectively . 
It is not necessary for us to wait for great catastrophes to occur if we can see them coming . 
Holland does not have to sink into the North Sea before we do something about the world &apos;s climate ; pensions do not have to decline to near-zero before social policies are adjusted . 
A third need is to preserve , and in many cases to recreate , what one might call islands of security . 
Globalization must become &quot; glo c alization &quot; : there is value in the relative certainties of local communities , small companies , human associations . 
Such islands are not sheltered and protected spaces , but models for others . 
They prove that up to a point security can be provided without loss of freedom . 
There remains the most fundamental issue of attitude . 
It is debatable whether governments should ever frighten their citizens by painting the horror scenario of &quot; inevitable &quot; attack . 
The truth - to quote Popper again - is that &quot; we must go on into the unknown , the uncertain and insecure , &quot; come what may . 
Today &apos;s instabilities may be unusually varied and severe , but human life is one of ceaseless uncertainty at all times . 
Such uncertainty can lead to a frozen state of near-entropy . 
More frequently , uncertainty leads to someone claiming to know how to eliminate it - frequently through arbitrary powers that benefit but a few . 
False gods have always profited from a widespread sense of insecurity . 
Against them , an active effort to tackle the risks around us is the only answer . 
Perhaps we need a new Enlightenment to spread the confidence we need to live with insecurity in freedom .
