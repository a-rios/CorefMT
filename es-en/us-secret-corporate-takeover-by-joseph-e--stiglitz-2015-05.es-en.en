The Secret Corporate Takeover 
NEW YORK - The United States and the world are engaged in a great debate about new trade agreements . 
Such pacts used to be called &quot; free-trade agreements &quot; ; in fact , they were managed trade agreements , tailored to corporate interests , largely in the US and the European Union . 
Today , such deals are more often referred to as &quot; partnerships , &quot; as in the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) . 
But they are not partnerships of equals : the US effectively dictates the terms . 
Fortunately , America &apos;s &quot; partners &quot; are becoming increasingly resistant . 
It is not hard to see why . 
These agreements go well beyond trade , governing investment and intellectual property as well , imposing fundamental changes to countries &quot; legal , judicial , and regulatory frameworks , without input or accountability through democratic institutions . 
Perhaps the most invidious - and most dishonest - part of such agreements concerns investor protection . 
Of course , investors have to be protected against the risk that rogue governments will seize their property . 
But that is not what these provisions are about . 
There have been very few expropriations in recent decades , and investors who want to protect themselves can buy insurance from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency , a World Bank affiliate ( the US and other governments provide similar insurance ) . 
Nonetheless , the US is demanding such provisions in the TPP , even though many of its &quot; partners &quot; have property protections and judicial systems that are as good as its own . 
The real intent of these provisions is to impede health , environmental , safety , and , yes , even financial regulations meant to protect America &apos;s own economy and citizens . 
Companies can sue governments for full compensation for any reduction in their future expected profits resulting from regulatory changes . 
This is not just a theoretical possibility . 
Philip Morris is suing Uruguay and Australia for requiring warning labels on cigarettes . 
Admittedly , both countries went a little further than the US , mandating the inclusion of graphic images showing the consequences of cigarette smoking . 
The labeling is working . 
So now Philip Morris is demanding to be compensated for lost profits . 
In the future , if we discover that some other product causes health problems ( think of asbestos ) , rather than facing lawsuits for the costs imposed on us , the manufacturer could sue governments for restraining them from killing more people . 
The same thing could happen if our governments impose more stringent regulations to protect us from the impact of greenhouse-gas emissions . 
When I chaired President Bill Clinton &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers , anti-environmentalists tried to enact a similar provision , called &quot; regulatory takings . &quot; 
They knew that once enacted , regulations would be brought to a halt , simply because government could not afford to pay the compensation . 
Fortunately , we succeeded in beating back the initiative , both in the courts and in the US Congress . 
But now the same groups are attempting an end run around democratic processes by inserting such provisions in trade bills , the contents of which are being kept largely secret from the public ( but not from the corporations that are pushing for them ) . 
It is only from leaks , and from talking to government officials who seem more committed to democratic processes , that we know what is happening . 
Fundamental to America &apos;s system of government is an impartial public judiciary , with legal standards built up over the decades , based on principles of transparency , precedent , and the opportunity to appeal unfavorable decisions . 
All of this is being set aside , as the new agreements call for private , non-transparent , and very expensive arbitration . 
Moreover , this arrangement is often rife with conflicts of interest ; for example , arbitrators may be a &quot; judge &quot; in one case and an advocate in a related case . 
The proceedings are so expensive that Uruguay has had to turn to Michael Bloomberg and other wealthy Americans committed to health to defend itself against Philip Morris . 
And , though corporations can bring suit , others cannot . 
If there is a violation of other commitments - on labor and environmental standards , for example - citizens , unions , and civil-society groups have no recourse . 
If there ever was a one-sided dispute-resolution mechanism that violates basic principles , this is it . 
That is why I joined leading US legal experts , including from Harvard , Yale , and Berkeley , in writing a letter to congressional leaders explaining how damaging to our system of justice these agreements are . 
American supporters of such agreements point out that the US has been sued only a few times so far , and has not lost a case . 
Corporations , however , are just learning how to use these agreements to their advantage . 
And high-priced corporate lawyers in the US , Europe , and Japan will likely outmatch the underpaid government lawyers attempting to defend the public interest . 
Worse still , corporations in advanced countries can create subsidiaries in member countries through which to invest back home , and then sue , giving them a new channel to bloc regulations . 
If there were a need for better property protection , and if this private , expensive dispute-resolution mechanism were superior to a public judiciary , we should be changing the law not just for well-heeled foreign companies , but also for our own citizens and small businesses . 
But there has been no suggestion that this is the case . 
Rules and regulations determine the kind of economy and society in which people live . 
They affect relative bargaining power , with important implications for inequality , a growing problem around the world . 
The question is whether we should allow rich corporations to use provisions hidden in so-called trade agreements to dictate how we will live in the twenty-first century . 
I hope citizens in the US , Europe , and the Pacific answer with a resounding no .
