From Cairo to California 
SINGAPORE - Egypt and California are headed in opposite directions politically . 
Egypt has had too little democracy and is moving towards more . 
California has had too much democracy and is moving towards less . 
The common mean point they should arrive at is democracy that delivers good government - and I mean &quot; government , &quot; not mushy &quot; governance . &quot; 
For decades , &quot; government &quot; has been demonized . 
Ronald Reagan famously said that &quot; government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . &quot; 
But Reagan was only the most eloquent spokesman for this Zeitgeist . 
He did not manufacture it ; decades of laissez-faire theory and proselytizing did . 
Following an explosion of government programs in the 1960 &quot; s , a belief developed in the minds of key American opinion leaders and policymakers that the best government is the least government . 
Reagan captured this assumption well , recalling the sixth-century BC Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu &apos;s famous words : &quot; Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish : too much handling will spoil it . &quot; 
Two dangerous corollaries emerged from this view . 
The first was the belief that taxes are inherently bad , and thus that reducing them is the only solution to any public problem . 
In California , many taxes were reduced by voter initiatives , demonstrating the damaging consequences of too much democracy . 
Indeed , such direct democracy helped make California ungovernable . 
For example , direct ballots on hot-button issues made prison sentencing mandatory , while simultaneously reducing taxes and funding for prisons . 
In 1978 , Proposition 13 capped California property taxes - the main source of public-school funding . 
School revenues slumped , and from 1974 to 1979 , California fell from ninth place to 44th among the 50 US states in per capita spending on public high schools , with California &apos;s students soon slipping down the rankings as well . 
The second dangerous corollary was that markets know best . 
Former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , the world &apos;s leading financial regulator of the past quarter century , seemed to have little faith in either regulators or the need for regulation . 
In an April 2008 article in The Financial Times , he wrote , &quot; Bank loan officers , in my experience , know far more about the risks and workings of their counterparties than do bank regulators . &quot; 
Similarly , when asked whether he should regulate the market in derivatives , he replied , &quot; These derivative transactions are transactions among professionals . &quot; 
Deep down , Greenspan must have believed that he was allowing Adam Smith &apos;s &quot; invisible hand &quot; to deliver the public good . 
But Smith stressed that private interests always pursue selfish interests : 
&quot; To widen the market and to narrow the competition , is always the interest of the dealers .... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order , ought always to be listened to with great precaution , and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined , not only with the most scrupulous , but with the most suspicious attention . 
It comes from an order of men , whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public , who have generally an interest to deceive and even oppress the public , and who accordingly have , upon many occasions , both deceived and oppressed it . &quot; 
Egypt &apos;s problems are , of course , vastly different from those of California . 
Despite the economic growth resulting from reforms undertaken by Hosni Mubarak &apos;s regime in recent years , unemployment and poverty remained at high levels . 
With a heavy and stifling bureaucracy and the prospect of a dynastic political succession , sheer lack of hope drove hundreds of thousands of Egyptians onto the streets . 
But , with the dictator driven from power , Egyptians , too , must redefine government . 
People in both Cairo and California should look to East Asia . 
Despite their ideological differences , governments throughout the region have delivered rapid economic growth and improved their populations &quot; livelihoods . 
Nowhere in East Asia has &quot; government &quot; been demonized . 
Despite the fact that most leading East Asian policymakers were trained in American universities , none were seduced by Reagan &apos;s belief that &quot; government is the problem . &quot; 
Millennia-old cultural beliefs in East Asia underpin the view that if government is not part of the solution , no public good can be achieved . 
Confucius , for example , said : &quot; the man who uses his brain should govern ; the man who uses his strength should be governed . &quot; 
The quality of American public services has deteriorated steadily over the past few decades , while that of Chinese public services has improved dramatically . 
Ironically , the Chinese government has been strengthened without oppressing the growth and dynamism of the Chinese economy . 
There must be some principles of good government that China has developed . 
Of course , neither Egyptians nor Americans would ever allow a communist party to rule them . 
But both must find the right principles of good government to resolve their very different public-policy challenges . 
Abandoning the Reaganesque ideology that government is inherently bad is a necessary first step . 
The bottom line is that the commodity in greatest demand by people all over the world is good government , which provides the best means of improving living standards , especially for those at the bottom . 
Unfortunately , good government is in limited supply , in part because there is no global consensus about what constitutes it - to the detriment of people from Cairo to California and beyond .
