Making Sense of China &apos;s Growth Model 
SHANGHAI - Although China &apos;s economy has expanded at a staggering pace over the last three decades , its growth model is now widely agreed to be exhausted . 
Even China &apos;s top leadership acknowledges the need for change - a belief that culminated in the far-reaching reform agenda presented two months ago at the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s 18th Central Committee . 
While not everyone agrees on exactly what the new growth model should look like , proposals do not differ drastically , given the prevailing consensus that the current model rests on an unsustainable foundation . 
On the demand side , many economists endorse a shift from investment-led to consumption-driven growth . 
Even more popular is the supply-side recommendation of a shift from extensive to intensive growth - that is , from a model based on capital accumulation to one propelled by gains in efficiency , measured by total factor productivity ( TFP ) . 
These recommendations are presumably influenced by Paul Krugman &apos;s criticism in 1994 of Soviet-style extensive growth in East Asian economies ( especially Singapore ) . 
At the time , Jeffery Sachs disagreed , asserting that the East Asian model included far more efficient market-based investment allocation than the Soviet model did , and thus was unique ; nonetheless , the criticism stuck . 
It was not long before some Chinese economists began to categorize the growth pattern brought about three decades ago by Deng Xiaoping &apos;s reforms as &quot; extensive &quot; - and thus problematic . 
A consensus has gradually emerged around this idea , with calls for a shift toward intensive , efficiency-driven growth intensifying since China &apos;s GDP growth began to slow in 2011 . 
But empirical research reveals a fundamental problem with this argument : China &apos;s TFP has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 4 % since Deng &apos;s reforms began . 
If the United States &quot; economy , with a TFP growth rate of only 1-2 % annually , is considered efficiency-driven , why is China &apos;s not ? 
More important , if China &apos;s TFP growth is expected to slow , as major drivers like the convergence effect wane , what does it mean to say that efficiency gains should propel China &apos;s future growth ? 
Consider the facts . 
A conservative assessment by Louis Kuijs , working with the World Bank , shows that , from 1978 to 1994 , China &apos;s GDP grew by an average of 9.9 % annually , labor productivity increased by 6.4 % , TFP rose by 3 % , and the capital-labor ratio increased by 2.9 % . 
In the period from 1994 to 2009 , annual GDP growth averaged 9.6 % , labor productivity increased by 8.6 % , TFP increased by 2.7 % , and the capital-labor ratio rose by 5.5 % . 
Similarly , Dwight Perkins and Tom Rawski found that from 1978 to 2005 , China &apos;s GDP grew by 9.5 % , while capital investment grew by 9.6 % , contributing 44.7 % to GDP . 
The share of tertiary graduates in the labor force rose to 2.7 % by 2005 , accounting for 16.2 % of GDP growth . 
And TFP grew by 3.8 % , adding 40.1 % to GDP growth . 
While capital has been the largest contributor to China &apos;s GDP , the economy &apos;s TFP performance has been impressive - something that cannot be explained by an extensive growth pattern . 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s rate of TFP growth never reached such high levels , even at the country &apos;s economic peak . 
Even Hong Kong - the East Asian economy with the best TFP performance - registered only 2.4 % average annual TFP growth from 1960 to 1990 . 
But annual TFP growth is not the only relevant figure . 
China &apos;s TFP has contributed 35-40 % to GDP growth , compared to an estimated 20-30 % in East Asia &apos;s &quot; four tigers &quot; ( Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , and Taiwan ) . 
As for the Soviet Union , even in its best years , TFP accounted for only about 10 % of GDP growth . 
Though China &apos;s TFP contribution to GDP growth is much greater than in the other so-called &quot; extensive &quot; economies , it remains well below levels in the intensive US economy , where the figure exceeds 80 % - a divergence that some might use to justify their refusal to define China &apos;s economy as &quot; efficiency-driven . &quot; 
But this argument ignores the fact that China has been experiencing double-digit annual GDP growth , owing largely to capital expansion , while America &apos;s annual GDP growth has averaged only 2-3 % . 
If transforming China &apos;s growth pattern were simply a matter of increasing TFP &apos;s contribution to GDP to US levels , China &apos;s annual GDP growth would have to drop to below 5 % - three percentage points lower than its potential growth rate . 
Given 8 % GDP growth , TFP would have to grow 6.4 % annually . 
This is almost certainly impossible , owing to the gradual diminution of the major drivers - including market-oriented economic reforms , the convergence effect on per capita income , and the adoption of foreign technologies - of China &apos;s extraordinary TFP growth over the last 30 years . 
All of this raises a simple question : Do extensive- or intensive-growth models really exist ? 
Perhaps there is only fast versus slow , or extraordinary versus ordinary . 
According to this view , if a developing economy can realize extraordinary growth , it must be because it offers greater opportunities for capital expansion than a developed economy . 
After all , investment opportunity is inversely proportional to per capita capital stock . 
On this point , Krugman is right : such investment-fueled growth is achieved largely through perspiration , rather than inspiration . 
But so what ? 
The fact that some of Asia &apos;s most dynamic economies - including China , Japan , and the four tigers ( Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , and Taiwan ) - have experienced investment-propelled growth and improvements in TFP simultaneously can be explained by the fact that TFP gains increase investment returns , accelerating capital expansion further . 
Though further analysis is needed to elucidate the long-term relationship between capital expansion and TFP , it is clear that the long-accepted theory that they cannot co-exist is seriously flawed . 
In short , when it comes to Asian economies , the dichotomy of extensive and intensive growth is a red herring . 
A far more meaningful consideration is what drove these TFP gains ; understanding that would enable China &apos;s leaders to design a more effective plan for strengthening the economy &apos;s long-term growth prospects .
