The EU &apos;s Global Mission 
In some quarters , pessimism , sad to say , dominated the recent celebrations marking the European Union &apos;s 50th birthday . 
Unease about the EU &apos;s future is , of course , understandable , especially given the uncertainty surrounding efforts to revive the Constitutional Treaty . 
Europeans should not be dismayed by comparisons of GDP growth in Europe and , say , the United States . 
Of course , Europe faces great challenges in perfecting its economic union , including the need to reduce unemployment and boost the economy &apos;s dynamism . 
An economy that , year after year , leaves most of its citizens worse off is not a success . 
More importantly , the EU &apos;s success should not be measured only by particular pieces of legislation and regulation , or even in the prosperity that economic integration has brought . 
After all , the driving motivation of the EU &apos;s founders was long-lasting peace . 
Economic integration , it was hoped , would lead to greater understanding , underpinned by the myriad interactions that inevitably flow from commerce . 
Increased interdependence would make conflict unthinkable . 
The EU has realized that dream . 
Nowhere in the world do neighbors live together more peacefully , and people move more freely and with greater security , than in Europe , owing in part to a new European identity that is not bound to national citizenship . 
This stands as an example that the world should emulate - one of shared rights and responsibilities , including the obligation to help the less fortunate . 
Here , too , Europe has led the way , providing more assistance to developing countries than anyone else ( and at a markedly higher fraction of its GDP than the US ) . 
The world has faced a difficult period during the past six years . 
The commitment to democratic multilateralism has been challenged , and rights guaranteed under international conventions , such as the Convention Against Torture , have been abrogated . 
Many lessons have emerged , including the dangers of hubris and the limits of military power , and the need for a multi-polar world . 
Europe , with more people than any nation except China and India , and the largest GDP in the world , must become one of the central pillars of such a world by projecting what has come to be called &quot; soft power &quot; - the power and influence of ideas and example . 
Indeed , Europe &apos;s success is due in part to its promotion of a set of values that , while quintessentially European , are at the same time global . 
The most fundamental of these values is democracy , understood to entail not merely periodic elections , but also active and meaningful participation in decision making , which requires an engaged civil society , strong freedom of information norms , and a vibrant and diversified media that are not controlled by the state or a few oligarchs . 
The second value is social justice . 
An economic and political system is to be judged by the extent to which individuals are able to flourish and realize their potential . 
As individuals , we are part of an ever-widening circle of communities , and we can realize our potential only if we live in harmony with each other . 
This , in turn , requires a sense of responsibility and solidarity . 
The transition from Communism to the market has not been easy , but Europe &apos;s unprecedented generosity has paid off : the countries that have joined the EU have outperformed all the others , and not just because of access to Europe &apos;s markets . 
Even more important was the institutional infrastructure , including the binding commitment to democracy and the vast array of laws and regulations that we too often take for granted . 
Europe has succeeded in part because it recognizes that the rights of individuals are inalienable and universal , and because it created institutions to protect those rights . 
America , by contrast , has witnessed a massive assault on those rights , including that of habeas corpus - the right to challenge one &apos;s detention before an independent judge . 
Fine distinctions are made , for example , between the rights of citizens and non-citizens . 
Today , only Europe can speak with credibility on the subject of universal human rights . 
For the sake of all of us , Europe must continue to speak out - even more forcibly than it has in the past . 
Likewise , while the European project sought to bring about the &quot; harmony &quot; of people living together in peace , we also must live in harmony with our environment - the scarcest of all of our resources . 
In this area , too , Europe has taken the lead , especially concerning global warming , showing that petty selfishness can be put aside to achieve a common good . 
In today &apos;s world , too , there is much that is not working well . 
While economic integration helped achieve a broader set of goals in Europe , elsewhere , economic globalization has contributed to widening the divide between rich and poor within countries and between rich and poor countries . 
Another world is possible .
