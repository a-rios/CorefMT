Reforming the UN The UN is in the midst of a serious , long-term crisis . 
That crisis will not go away unless its sources are understood and the organization reformed . 
But a new form of political correctness is making reform difficult . 
One major cause of the UN crisis is the change in the international situation after the demise of the Soviet Union and the proliferation of what I call &quot; incompetent states . &quot; 
Many countries that achieved independence as a result of the national liberation movements of the 1940 &apos;s-1990 &apos;s have proved themselves incapable of creating the conditions of normal life within their territories . 
In the age of globalization , they are also hopelessly and increasingly lagging behind developed states . Moreover , many of these regimes are simply ineffectual and will collapse or dramatically change in the foreseeable future . 
This will inevitably prove to be the source of long-term political and military instability in large parts of Africa , the Middle East , Central and South Asia , as well as a number of former Soviet republics . 
The rise of incompetent states brings about huge challenges : proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , terrorism , religious and ethnic strife , rivalry for natural resources , waves of migration , drug trafficking , and deterioration of the environment . 
Such states call into question our traditional attitude towards national sovereignty . 
Tolerating them , as was done until recently , is increasingly dangerous . 
The politically correct policy of affirming each nation &apos;s right to self-determination , including the establishment of an independent state , leads to the emergence of more incompetent regimes . 
Indeed , incompetent states now comprise almost a majority in the UN , which undermines that body &apos;s moral legitimacy in the eyes of many in the developed world . 
It also impairs the UN &apos;s ability to deal with the most important problems of today &apos;s international environment . 
The second cause at the root of the UN crisis is the fact that the US is no longer interested in observing the old rules of international relations . 
Indeed , America &apos;s superpower status makes it increasingly disadvantageous for its leaders to play by rules that , while repeatedly violated in the past , are now viewed as preventing the US from assuming a new role in international affairs . 
The new role the US envisages is closely tied to the profound destabilization brought about by the proliferation of incompetent states . 
In fact , America has been eager for some time to &quot; establish order &quot; in the world and modernize particularly troublesome regimes in highly strategic regions of the world . 
In the Middle East and Central Asia , this policy seems at times to have assumed predominance comparable to that of the former doctrine of deterrence deployed against the Soviet Union and its Communist allies . 
It was the desire to counter this destabilization and to consolidate its superpower status that was the primary reason for America &apos;s actions in Iraq . 
The world might not support the US in its unilateral attempts to become the world &apos;s policeman , especially because they may well bring more instability . 
Nevertheless , it is important to realize why the US is undertaking them and that they respond to a core problem of today &apos;s international order . 
If Russia and the other countries that opposed America &apos;s Iraq policy in the Security Council really wanted to convince the US not to attack Iraq and to defend international law , it was a naive policy doomed to failure . 
If we sought to preserve the UN Security Council and the position of the present permanent members , then those actions were more likely to produce the opposite effect . 
Similarly , rearguard efforts to prove that those who opposed war in Iraq were right and that the Americans and the Britons wrong , together with demands for &quot; proof &quot; that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction , are unconstructive and only cause mutual irritation . 
The UN cannot be preserved and reformed without cooperation from the US , however distressful this may be to some . 
By making the UN an instrument of struggle against America , the UN will only be weakened or written off altogether . 
What is needed is a reform that responds to today &apos;s international order and updates the increasingly obsolete and ignored body of international law to today &apos;s new economic and political realities . 
Restructuring must start with the UN Security Council , whose 1945 mandate is no longer viable . 
The most obvious solution is to increase the number of permanent members from five to eight or nine ( including Germany , Japan , India and possibly Brazil ) and to change the voting rules , so that two or three permanent members - rather than just one - are needed to block an action . 
But the UN is not likely to reform itself from within . 
Institutionalizing the G-8 and providing it with executive functions could best provide the external impetus that is needed . 
If , as is likely , increasing the number of permanent Security Council members lacks sufficient support , developed countries should revert to the idea , circulating in foreign policy circles for several years , of establishing a new G-8-based organization ( but including China and India ) to counter new threats to global security . 
Such proposals might spur further reform of the UN itself . 
In any case , one thing seems certain : in the absence of a sweeping overhaul , the UN may quickly follow in the footsteps of other institutional relics of the Cold War , such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and NATO .
