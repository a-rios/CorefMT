Secular Stagnation Heads South 
SANTIAGO - As commodity prices come back to earth and the Federal Reserve &apos;s gradual exit from quantitative easing leads to higher interest rates in the United States , Latin America &apos;s economies face the challenge of sustaining growth . 
The region &apos;s main economies recorded slower GDP growth in 2013 , and much the same is being forecast for 2014 . 
It is pretty clear by now that an extraordinarily benevolent external environment , not a revolutionary policy shift , underpinned Latin America &apos;s rapid growth in the years following the 2008-2009 global economic crisis . 
As long as the price of soy , wheat , copper , oil , and other raw materials remained stratospheric , commodity-rich countries like Brazil , Chile , and Peru got a tremendous boost ; even Argentina grew rapidly , despite terrible economic policies . 
But now &quot; secular stagnation &quot; - the concept du jour in US policy debates since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers argued last November that the US ( and perhaps other advanced economies ) has entered a long period of anemic GDP growth - may also be coming to Latin America . 
The argument goes like this : high consumer debt , slowing population growth , and rising income inequality have weakened consumer demand and stimulated savings , while slowing growth in productivity and output itself has discouraged investment . 
So the &quot; natural &quot; rate of interest - the rate at which the demand for investment equals the supply of savings - has fallen , and arguably has become negative . 
But , because real interest rates cannot be strongly negative unless inflation is high ( which it is not ) , there is a savings glut . 
With consumption and investment lagging , the US economy is bound to stagnate . 
But how could such a situation apply to Latin America , where GDP growth is faster , interest rates are higher , and domestic demand is stronger than in the US ? 
Consider the region &apos;s history . 
Until the recent commodity-driven boomlet , growth in Latin America was mediocre . 
The 1980 &quot; s are known as the &quot; lost decade , &quot; owing to a debt crisis and massive recessions , while the market-based reforms of the 1990 &quot; s did little to reignite short-run growth . 
From 1960 to 2007 , only four countries in Latin America and the Caribbean - Brazil , Chile , the Dominican Republic , and Panama - grew faster than the US . 
So meager growth in the coming years would be a return to Latin America &apos;s historical pattern , not a deviation from it . 
That brings us back to secular stagnation . 
Yes , Latin American countries &quot; average per capita GDP is only one-quarter that of the US , so they should be growing faster than their rich northern neighbor . 
The question is how much faster . 
Stagnation in this context means a growth rate that is too low to ensure convergence toward US living standards within a reasonable period of time . 
Unlike the US , Latin American economies &quot; actual output is at or near potential , so growing more means investing more . 
And the region &apos;s problem is not too much domestic savings , but too little . 
Latin American countries save 18 % of GDP , on average , compared to 30 % in fast-growing East Asia . 
As a result , every time investment picks up in Latin America , it has to be financed with loans from abroad . 
Foreign investors are willing to live with the resulting current-account deficits , but only up to a point . 
It took only a few words from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last May - announcing the eventual end of quantitative easing - for markets to lose confidence in emerging economies with current-account deficits near or above 4 % of GDP . 
Brazil was the most prominent among the Latin American economies under attack , but analysts worried about similar vulnerabilities elsewhere in the region . 
As a result , now , as in the recent past , whenever foreigners get jittery , financing and investment in Latin America are curtailed , and growth suffers . 
The scarcity of savings in the region reflects the weak incentives embedded in poorly designed tax and pension systems . 
But savings performance is also related to long-standing fiscal problems . 
To be sure , the fiscal stance improved in many Latin American economies in the years leading up to 2007 , so countries like Chile were able to mount a strong anti-crisis fiscal response . 
But , as a 2013 Inter-American Development Bank ( IADB ) report makes clear , the fiscal stimulus was not always withdrawn in time when the crisis abated , so the fiscal position across the region today is weaker than it was in 2007 . 
The composition of government spending is also a problem . 
According to the same IADB report , investment accounts for only 16 % of fiscal outlays , less than half the share in emerging Asia . 
So Latin America suffers from a longstanding infrastructure deficit , which acts as a drag on growth . 
Even abundant domestic savings in the future would not guarantee higher investment . 
Firms &quot; eagerness to invest depends on how much additional output they can get out of that investment , and recent productivity growth in Latin America - as in the US - has been disappointing . 
Lagging productivity has many causes , but one is the failure to diversify local economic structures . 
Economies become more productive either by doing what they do more efficiently , or by shifting resources into new sectors in which productivity is higher - a process that can be observed ( or not ) by looking at export diversification . 
And the sad fact is that today most Latin American countries - Mexico being a notable exception - export pretty much the same goods that they exported a generation ago . 
That is yet another big difference between the region and East Asia . 
So , can Latin American economies keep growing once commodity prices and world interest rates edge back toward normality ? 
We in the region hope they can . 
But a return to stagnation is also a possibility - one that can be minimized only if policymakers acknowledge it and begin taking preventive action right away .
