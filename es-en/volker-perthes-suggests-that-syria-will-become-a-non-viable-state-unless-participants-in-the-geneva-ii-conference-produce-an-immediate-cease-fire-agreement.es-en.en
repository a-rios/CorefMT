A Syrian Farewell to Arms 
BERLIN - The Geneva II conference on Syria , set to begin in Montreux , Switzerland , on January 22 , is unlikely to achieve its goal of forming a transitional governing authority with full executive powers . 
But what it can do is launch a much-needed political process and , more important , produce a ceasefire agreement between government and opposition forces . 
Only when the fighting has stopped can Syria make genuine progress toward a political transition . 
Of course , Al Qaeda-linked jihadist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , which has become a potent force on the ground , and the Nusra Front will not and should not be represented in Montreux - not least because they will not feel bound by any agreement . 
But this should not serve as an excuse not to pursue a ceasefire . 
After all , even stopping the fighting between regime forces and some armed groups - that is , those that associate themselves with the Syrian National Coalition , or are at least willing to coordinate with the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) and the partly Saudi-sponsored Islamic Front - would be a major achievement . 
A ceasefire is critical , because the fighting serves the interests of the most brutal elements on both sides of the conflict . 
This includes the core leadership of President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , which is now supported by Hezbollah and Iraqi militias , as much as the ISIS , which is composed largely of non-Syrian fighters who are unconcerned about rebuilding the country or safeguarding its people &apos;s future . 
As in any civil war , such entrepreneurs of violence become increasingly likely to carry the day the longer the conflict endures . 
They feed on their own atrocities or on those of their opponents to win support through fear rather than conviction - using videos to raise funds and recruit new members . 
With skilled fighters and plenty of money and arms , the ISIS and the Nusra Front thrive amid persistent war and anarchy . 
Meanwhile , the Assad regime benefits from the fact that parts of the country that it no longer controls cannot be called &quot; liberated zones , &quot; given the prevailing chaos and extremism in these areas . 
A ceasefire would initiate a shift in this dynamic , allowing humanitarian supplies to reach the areas where they are needed most urgently , while halting the country &apos;s gradual &quot; Somalization . &quot; 
This would help to stem the flow of refugees - and the spillover of violence - to neighboring countries , particularly Lebanon and Iraq . 
Furthermore , if the ceasefire held , it would facilitate economic reconstruction , while enabling moderate political actors and civil society to win back some power from the extremists - a shift that ordinary Syrians would welcome . 
Indeed , people in jihadist-controlled areas are deeply unhappy with Al Qaeda thugs terrorizing them and trying to enforce their version of Islamic mores - so much so that the Assad regime increasingly appears to be a better alternative to continued warfare or an Al Qaeda takeover . 
The problem is that , as long as violence prevents moderate forces from restoring local services and administrative structures , people &apos;s capacity for resistance will remain weak . 
International organizations could treat such structures as de facto authorities , supplying them directly with aid and also giving NGOs or United Nations investigators an opportunity to collect evidence of war crimes for future judicial or truth-commission proceedings . 
To be sure , fears that a ceasefire could lead to a stabilization of the conflict &apos;s frontlines , turning them into semi-permanent lines of division , are not without merit . 
After all , a ceasefire is not a peace agreement ; it would , for the time being , leave regime and opposition forces in their respective positions . 
But having different authorities administer different parts of Syria is preferable to the absence of any responsible governance across large swaths of the country . 
Moreover , a ceasefire would enable the FSA and its allies to coordinate action with units of the regular army against Al Qaeda bands , which would undoubtedly try to sustain the violence . 
Even such limited cooperation would advance the &quot; Geneva process &quot; - especially negotiations aimed at establishing a transitional authority that would command the armed forces . 
Given that the Assad regime has overwhelming firepower , its consent is vital to achieving a ceasefire agreement . 
Responsibility for convincing Assad to stop bombing and shelling opposition-held areas would fall primarily on his international allies , Russia and Iran . 
In doing so , they should bear in mind that it was Assad who led the country into civil war by choosing a military solution when high-level members of his own government and political party argued for a negotiated settlement . 
Neither Russia nor Iran has an interest in prolonging a war that is destabilizing the Middle East and fostering the spread of Al Qaeda-style extremism . 
Indeed , both have already helped to bring the Syrian regime to Geneva . 
Now , they must make their support for Assad &apos;s delegation conditional upon his acceptance of a ceasefire . 
Otherwise , prospects for an outcome that leaves Syria intact and viable will only become bleaker .
