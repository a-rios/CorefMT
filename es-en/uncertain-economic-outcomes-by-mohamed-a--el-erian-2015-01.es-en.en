What Are We Betting On ? 
LAGUNA BEACH - When I consider the prospects for the global economy and markets , I am taken aback by the extent to which the world has collectively placed a huge bet on three fundamental outcomes : a shift toward materially higher and more inclusive global growth , the avoidance of policy mistakes , and the prevention of market accidents . 
Though all three outcomes are undoubtedly desirable , the unfortunate reality is that they are far from certain - and bets on them without some hedging could prove exceedingly risky for current and future generations . 
The first component of the bet - more inclusive global growth - anticipates continued economic recovery in the United States , with a 3 % growth rate this year bolstered by robust wage growth . 
It also assumes China &apos;s annual growth rate will stabilize at 6.5-7 % , thereby enabling the risks posed by pockets of excessive leverage in the shadow-banking system to be gradually defused , even as the economy &apos;s growth engines continue to shift from exports and public capital spending toward domestic consumption and private investment . 
Another , more uncertain assumption underpinning the bet on more inclusive growth is that the eurozone and Japan will be able to escape the mire of low growth and avoid deflation , which , by impelling households and businesses to postpone purchasing decisions , would undermine already weak economic performance . 
Finally , the bet assumes that oil-exporting countries like Nigeria , Venezuela , and especially Russia will fend off economic implosion , even as global oil prices plummet . 
These are bold assumptions - not least because achieving these outcomes would require considerable economic reinvention , extending far beyond rebalancing aggregate demand and eliminating pockets of excessive indebtedness . 
While the US and China are significantly better placed than others , most of these economies - in particular , the struggling eurozone countries , Japan , and some emerging markets - would have to nurture entirely new growth engines . 
The eurozone would also have to deepen integration . 
That adds up to a tough reform agenda - made all the more challenging by adjustment fatigue , increasingly fragmented domestic politics , and rising geopolitical tensions . 
In this context , a determined shift toward markedly higher and more inclusive global growth is far from guaranteed . 
The second component of the collective bet - the avoidance of policy mistakes - is similarly tenuous . 
The fundamental assumption here is that the untested , unconventional policies adopted by central banks , particularly in advanced countries , to repress financial volatility and maintain economic stability will buy enough time for governments to design and deliver a more suitable and comprehensive policy response . 
This experimental approach by central banks has involved the conscious decoupling of financial-asset prices from their fundamentals . 
The hope has been that more buoyant market valuations would boost consumption ( via the &quot; wealth effect , &quot; whereby asset-owning households feel wealthier and thus more inclined to spend ) and investment ( via &quot; animal spirits , &quot; which bolster entrepreneurs &quot; willingness to invest in new plant , equipment , and hiring ) . 
The problem is that the current economic and policy configuration in the developed world entails an unusual amount of &quot; divergence . &quot; 
With policy adjustments failing to keep pace with shifts on the ground , an appreciating dollar has assumed the role of shock absorber . 
But history has shown that such sharp currency moves can , by themselves , cause economic and financial instability . 
The final element of the world &apos;s collective bet is rooted in the belief that excessive market risk-taking has been tamed . 
But a protracted period of policy-induced volatility repression has convinced investors that , with central banks on their side , they are safe - a belief that has led to considerable risk-positioning in some segments of finance . 
With intermediaries becoming reluctant to take on securities that are undesirable to hold during periods of financial instability , market corrections can compound sudden and dramatic price shifts , disrupting the orderly functioning of financial systems . 
So far , central banks have been willing and able to ensure that these periods are temporary and reversible . 
But their capacity to continue to do so is limited - especially as excessive faith in monetary policy fuels leveraged market positioning . 
The fact is that central banks do not have the tools to deliver rapid , sustainable , and inclusive growth on their own . 
The best they can do is extend the bridge ; it is up to other economic policymakers to provide an anchoring destination . 
A bridge to nowhere can go only so far before it collapses . 
The nature of financial risks has morphed and migrated in recent years ; problems caused by irresponsible banks and threats to the payment and settlement systems have been supplanted by those caused by risk-taking among non-bank institutions . 
With the regulatory system failing to evolve accordingly , the potential effectiveness of some macro-prudential policies has been undermined . 
None of this is to say that the outlook for markets and the global economy is necessarily dire ; on the contrary , there are notable upside risks that could translate into considerable and durable gains . 
But understanding the world &apos;s collective bet does underscore the need for more responsive and comprehensive policymaking . 
Otherwise , economic outcomes will remain , as former US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put it in 2010 , &quot; unusually uncertain . &quot;
