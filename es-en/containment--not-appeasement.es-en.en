Containment , not Appeasement 
America and the world are focused on whether the Bush administration will adopt the Iraq Study Group &apos;s recommendations for an exit strategy from Iraq . 
That is the most pressing immediate question , but America &apos;s leaders should also be thinking ahead . 
America needs a post-occupation strategy for Iraq and the Middle East , one grounded in a viable national security strategy for the twenty-first century . 
That strategy is containment . 
In the run-up to the Iraq invasion , the Bush administration rejected containment as an obsolete Cold War hangover . 
The weapons inspectors were pulled out , and America opted for preemptive war . 
Bush was portrayed as facing down a new Hitler with Churchillian resolve , and advocates of containment were accused of appeasement . 
But now we know that the containment regime worked . 
Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq was in no position to threaten anyone , let alone the United States . 
This was not the first time that containment - a strategy devised by George Kennan , the director of the US State Department &apos;s Policy Planning Staff under President Harry Truman , in response to the Soviet threat after World War II - has been rejected as appeasement . 
In the 1952 presidential election campaign , Dwight Eisenhower and his future secretary of state , John Foster Dulles , heaped scorn on containment , calling instead for a &quot; rollback &quot; of the Soviets in Eastern Europe . 
Fortunately , once in office , the Eisenhower administration had the sense to stick with containment in Europe , continuing a policy that is widely credited for winning the Cold War . 
President John F. Kennedy &apos;s insistence , against much advice , on containment during the Cuban missile crisis saved the world from nuclear war . 
This was calculated resolve , not appeasement . 
Containment &apos;s goal was to prevent Soviet expansion without saddling the US with unsustainable military obligations . 
So long as the USSR did not stage a military attack , containment &apos;s reliance on economic sticks and carrots , competition within the world communist movement , intelligence and diplomacy , and promoting the vitality of the capitalist democracies would guarantee security . 
Kennan was right : the dysfunctional features of Soviet system , and its over-extension internationally , would lead to its demise . 
When containment has been abandoned , America has paid a high price . 
The Eisenhower administration toppled Iran &apos;s elected government in 1953 believing it to be too pro-Soviet . 
The hugely unpopular Shah they installed was swept away in the Islamic revolution in 1979 . 
America made comparable errors in Guatemala and elsewhere in Latin America . 
Vietnam was America &apos;s costliest departure from containment . 
As Kennan explained , when America goes to war over something less than a vital interest , the adversary - for whom vital interests are at stake - will fight long after the war has become too unpopular at home to sustain . 
Bush repeated this mistake in Iraq . 
Containment is hardly a relic of the Cold War . 
It worked against Libya , leading Muammar Khadafi in the late 1990 &quot; s to stop sponsoring terrorism , turn over the Lockerbie bombers for trial , and pay compensation to British and French victims of Libyan-sponsored terrorism . 
Claims that he abandoned his nuclear program in response to the US-led invasion of Iraq have been refuted by Flynt Leverett , director for Middle Eastern affairs at the US National Security Council from 2002 to 2003 . 
According to Leverett , Khadafi &apos;s decision predated the invasion and was a response to an explicit quid-pro-quo to end international sanctions against Libya . 
Containment against Libya was not appeasement . 
It should have been the model in Iraq , as it now should be the model in Iran . 
Instead , defenders of the contemporary equivalent of &quot; rollback &quot; advocate attacking Iran because it is developing nuclear weapons . 
One of Kennan &apos;s great insights was that the US is well served by conflict among America &apos;s adversaries . 
He welcomed Tito &apos;s rise in Yugoslavia as an internal challenge to Moscow &apos;s hegemony that he hoped others would emulate . 
This lesson is lost on the Bush administration , which senselessly alienated Iran in 2002 , when moderates had the upper hand there and were cooperating in Afghanistan , and reversed decades of US policy by insisting that any Middle East settlement must accept changed &quot; realities on the ground &quot; in the West Bank . 
The administration seems bent on herding adversaries together - transforming Samuel Huntington &apos;s &quot; clash-of-civilizations &quot; dystopia into a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
Kennan maintained that the US should work to create a world that no one can dominate , and that the best way to spread democracy is to demonstrate its superiority . 
Ramming democracy down people &apos;s throats is self-defeating . 
Just as it produced a potent fusion of communism and anti-American nationalism in Southeast Asia and Latin America , it is now producing a similar combination of radical Islam and anti-American nationalism across the Middle East . 
Terrorist groups can be minimized if their enabling states are contained . 
Defenders of the Bush doctrine claim that this is impossible when they operate out of failed states that cannot police their borders . 
But , given that the Bush doctrine has compounded the failed-state problem , this is a bogus argument . 
However many failed states there were in the world before America invaded Iraq , there is one more now . 
To build a containment regime against terrorism emanating from the Middle East , a date for America &apos;s departure from Iraq must be set . 
There is no other way to reverse the widespread perception across the region that the US has imperial ambitions . 
The other essential step is to place resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict at the center of America &apos;s foreign policy agenda . 
That is the surest means of protecting and promoting democracy .
