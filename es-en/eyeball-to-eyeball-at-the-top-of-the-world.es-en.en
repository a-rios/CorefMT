Eyeball to Eyeball at the Top of the World 
NEW DELHI Â­ - When a foreign minister goes out of his way to assure reporters that there is no tension on his country &apos;s borders with a powerful neighbor , the logical tendency is to wonder whether &quot; the lady doth protest too much . &quot; 
After all , you don &apos;t hear Canada &apos;s foreign minister denying tension on his country &apos;s American frontier , because the truth of that proposition is self-evident . 
The claim by Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee on a June visit to Beijing that the Sino-Indian border is tension-free has prompted cynical observers to assume the opposite . 
They are right to do so . 
The last six months have witnessed a proliferation of incidents along the 2,520-mile ( 4,057-kilometer ) Sino-Indian frontier . 
Nearly a hundred have been recorded , including no fewer than 65 incursions by China &apos;s People &apos;s Liberation Army in just one sector - the evocatively-named Finger Area , a 2.1-square-kilometer salient in the Indian state of Sikkim , which shares a 206-kilometer border with Tibet . 
While India seeks to downplay such reports , one incident that did make it into the Indian press occurred inside the &quot; Line of Actual Control &quot; ( LAC ) on the western sector of the border at Demchok , in India &apos;s Ladakh district . 
A mixed civilian-military team investigating reports of Chinese incursions were , on May 16 , threatened and forced to retreat by a PLA formation in three armored vehicles . 
The Chinese soldiers allegedly assumed firing positions , leading the Indians to withdraw in order not to provoke a shooting match . 
The previous month , there were reports of an armed Chinese probe 12 kilometers into the north-eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh . 
Intensified Chinese patrolling has been observed at Demchok and Pangong Tso in Ladakh , and in the West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh , a state to which the Chinese Ambassador in New Delhi went so far as to lay claim in a media interview . 
With China having established four new airbases in Tibet and three in its southern provinces bordering India , the Indian Air Force is reportedly augmenting its own presence near the Chinese border by deploying two squadrons of Sukhoi-30MKI fighters . 
What is going on ? 
Are China and India bracing for war ? 
Fears of imminent major hostilities are clearly overblown . 
China , with the Olympics looming , is unlikely to initiate a clash , and India has no desire to provoke its neighbor , which humiliated it in a brutal border war in 1962 that left China in possession of 23,200 square kilometers of Indian territory . 
At the same time , China has taken pains to remind India that it still claims a further 92,000 square kilometers , mainly in Arunachal Pradesh . 
It doesn &apos;t help that the two countries share the longest disputed frontier in the world , since the LAC has never been formally delineated in a manner accepted by both sides . 
India &apos;s borders were defined by British imperial administrators in 1913 - the MacMahon Line , which China rejects ( though it accepts that line as its frontier with Burma , which was then part of British India ) . 
With the LAC coming into being in the wake of China &apos;s victory in 1962 , the situation is even more unclear . 
Whenever troops from either side build roads , construct or repair bunkers and other fortifications , or conduct patrols close to the LAC , tensions can flare . 
When the two sides are anxious to avoid provoking each other , such activities are kept to a minimum , but it would seem that China has taken a conscious decision in recent months to keep the Indians on their toes . 
The reasons are not hard to identify . 
China &apos;s recent troubles over Tibet have brought with them unwelcome reminders of India &apos;s hospitality to the Dalai Lama and his government-in-exile . 
The fact that Tawang , the birthplace of the sixth Dalai Lama and a major monastery of Tibetan Buddhism , lies in Arunachal , deprives China of a vital asset in its attempts to assert total control over Tibet . 
Reminding India of China &apos;s claims is therefore all the more urgent for China . 
Foreign Minister Mukherjee was treated rudely on his recent visit , with Premier Wen Jiabao cancelling a previously-scheduled appointment and the Governor of Sichuan Province failing to show up to receive a donation of Indian humanitarian aid for China &apos;s earthquake victims . 
At his meeting with his Chinese counterpart , Yang Jiechi , Mukherjee was told what his hosts thought of the Dalai Lama &apos;s activities and statements in India , and was reminded that the border incidents reflected different perceptions of where the border lies . 
The Chinese demanded a resumption of talks on the unsettled border , though there seems little prospect of either side making new concessions . 
Behind the unpleasantness may lie a broader strategic calculation . 
With the end of the Cold War , China had two options concerning India : to regard it as a natural ally , together with Russia , in building up an alternative to American dominance in the region , or to identify it as a potential adversary . 
The recent emergence of a United States-India partnership appears to have convinced China &apos;s rulers that India has become an instrument for the &quot; containment &quot; of China . 
Such a perception may have been reinforced by India &apos;s frequent military exercises with the US , Japan , and Australia and its cultivation of former Soviet Central Asia ( including the establishment of a military base in Tajikistan ) . 
Moreover , India has attempted to establish strategic ties with countries that China sees as falling within its own sphere of influence ( from Mongolia to Vietnam , including direct competition over Myanmar ) . 
So the Sino-Indian frontier is unlikely to remain quiet . 
Needling an eager-to-please India on its troubled northern borders helps China to keep India guessing about its intentions , exposes the giant democracy &apos;s vulnerabilities in an election year , and cuts a potential strategic rival down to size . 
Look for China to provoke more incidents once the Olympics are over .
