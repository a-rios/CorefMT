Four Fallacies of the Second Great Depression 
LONDON - The period since 2008 has produced a plentiful crop of recycled economic fallacies , mostly falling from the lips of political leaders . 
Here are my four favorites . 
The Swabian Housewife . 
&quot; One should simply have asked the Swabian housewife , &quot; said German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 . 
&quot; She would have told us that you cannot live beyond your means . &quot; 
This sensible-sounding logic currently underpins austerity . 
The problem is that it ignores the effect of the housewife &apos;s thrift on total demand . 
If all households curbed their expenditures , total consumption would fall , and so , too , would demand for labor . 
If the housewife &apos;s husband loses his job , the household will be worse off than before . 
The general case of this fallacy is the &quot; fallacy of composition &quot; : what makes sense for each household or company individually does not necessarily add up to the good of the whole . 
The particular case that John Maynard Keynes identified was the &quot; paradox of thrift &quot; : if everyone tries to save more in bad times , aggregate demand will fall , lowering total savings , because of the decrease in consumption and economic growth . 
If the government tries to cut its deficit , households and firms will have to tighten their purse strings , resulting in less total spending . 
As a result , however much the government cuts its spending , its deficit will barely shrink . 
And if all countries pursue austerity simultaneously , lower demand for each country &apos;s goods will lead to lower domestic and foreign consumption , leaving all worse off . 
The government cannot spend money it does not have . 
This fallacy - often repeated by British Prime Minister David Cameron - treats governments as if they faced the same budget constraints as households or companies . 
They can always get the money they need by issuing bonds . 
But won &apos;t an increasingly indebted government have to pay ever-higher interest rates , so that debt-service costs eventually consume its entire revenue ? 
The answer is no : the central bank can print enough extra money to hold down the cost of government debt . 
This is what so-called quantitative easing does . 
With near-zero interest rates , most Western governments cannot afford not to borrow . 
This argument does not hold for a government without its own central bank , in which case it faces exactly the same budget constraint as the oft-cited Swabian housewife . 
That is why some eurozone member states got into so much trouble until the European Central Bank rescued them . 
The national debt is deferred taxation . 
According to this oft-repeated fallacy , governments can raise money by issuing bonds , but , because bonds are loans , they will eventually have to be repaid , which can be done only by raising taxes . 
The more the government borrows to pay for its spending today , the more the public saves to pay future taxes , canceling out any stimulatory effect of the extra borrowing . 
The problem with this argument is that governments are rarely faced with having to &quot; pay off &quot; their debts . 
They might choose to do so , but mostly they just roll them over by issuing new bonds . 
The longer the bonds &quot; maturities , the less frequently governments have to come to the market for new loans . 
More important , when there are idle resources ( for example , when unemployment is much higher than normal ) , the spending that results from the government &apos;s borrowing brings these resources into use . 
The increased government revenue that this generates ( plus the decreased spending on the unemployed ) pays for the extra borrowing without having to raise taxes . 
The national debt is a burden on future generations . 
This fallacy is repeated so often that it has entered the collective unconscious . 
The argument is that if the current generation spends more than it earns , the next generation will be forced to earn more than it spends to pay for it . 
But this ignores the fact that holders of the very same debt will be among the supposedly burdened future generations . 
Suppose my children have to pay off the debt to you that I incurred . 
They will be worse off . 
This may be bad for the distribution of wealth and income , because it will enrich the creditor at the expense of the debtor , but there will be no net burden on future generations . 
The principle is exactly the same when the holders of the national debt are foreigners ( as with Greece ) , though the political opposition to repayment will be much greater . 
Economics is luxuriant with fallacies , because it is not a natural science like physics or chemistry . 
Propositions in economics are rarely absolutely true or false . 
What is true in some circumstances may be false in others . 
Above all , the truth of many propositions depends on people &apos;s expectations . 
Consider the belief that the more the government borrows , the higher the future tax burden will be . 
If people act on this belief by saving every extra pound , dollar , or euro that the government puts in their pockets , the extra government spending will have no effect on economic activity , regardless of how many resources are idle . 
The government must then raise taxes - and the fallacy becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
So how are we to distinguish between true and false propositions in economics ? 
Perhaps the dividing line should be drawn between propositions that hold only if people expect them to be true and those that are true irrespective of beliefs . 
The statement , &quot; If we all saved more in a slump , we would all be better off , &quot; is absolutely false . 
We would all be worse off . 
But the statement , &quot; The more the government borrows , the more it has to pay for its borrowing , &quot; is sometimes true and sometimes false . 
Or perhaps the dividing line should be between propositions that depend on reasonable behavioral assumptions and those that depend on ludicrous ones . 
If people saved every extra penny of borrowed money that the government spent , the spending would have no stimulating effect . 
But such people exist only in economists &quot; models .
