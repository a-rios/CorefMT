The Post-Crisis Global Economy in Three Words 
PARIS - Five years have passed since the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers triggered financial mayhem and marked the onset of the Great Recession . 
Though the dust may not have fully settled , three catchwords sum up what we have learned so far - and what remains to be done . 
The first word that comes to mind is resilience . 
Five years ago , many feared a repetition of the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Indeed , as Barry Eichengreen and Kevin O &apos;Rourke have shown , the collapse of world industrial production in 2008-2009 initially tracked that of 1929-1930 very well . 
The fall in world trade volume and equity indices was even faster . 
Fortunately , the historical paths subsequently diverged . 
Five years after the 1929 crash , the world was still in depression and trade had contracted sharply . 
Today , the United States is still going through its worst employment recession since World War II , and Europe &apos;s GDP has not returned to pre-crisis levels , but global output has grown 15 % since 2008 , and world trade is up more than 12 % . 
The world avoided a Great Depression II mainly because there was no global financial crisis this time . 
What occurred in 2008 was a US crisis that contaminated Europe , because the two financial systems were almost completely integrated . 
The rest of the world , however , was largely immune . 
China and other emerging countries were hit by a severe demand shock that affected their exports , but not by the financial turmoil . 
On the contrary , the value of US government bonds that China and others held rose in response to the drop in interest rates . 
Another reason for the rebound was the well-timed response engineered in 2009 by the G-20 . 
For the first time , emerging and developing countries participated in a coordinated reflation effort , and , alongside their advanced-country counterparts , promised to resist trade protectionism . 
The recovery soon demonstrated that the global economy had more than one engine . 
This gave the US economy time to heal , and even made it possible for Europe to experience its own crisis without triggering a generalized downturn . 
The second word that characterizes the last five years is acceleration . 
In 2008 , everyone knew that the rise of emerging and developing countries was redrawing the global economic map . 
But this was thought to be a gradual , long-term trend . 
In reality , what was supposed to take one or two decades took just five years . 
A simple statistic illustrates the point : in 2007 , the advanced countries accounted for almost three-quarters of the G-20 &quot; s combined GDP . 
By 2012 , their share had fallen to 63 % . 
The combination of growth differentials and high oil and raw-materials prices has resulted in a massive shift in the distribution of world income . 
Furthermore , all advanced countries have experienced rapid deterioration in their public finances . 
Whereas ten years ago public-debt crises were considered a plague that afflicts developing countries , the malady is now the advanced economies &quot; curse . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , the average debt / GDP ratio at the end of 2012 was 110 % in the advanced countries , but just 35 % for emerging countries and 42 % for low-income countries . 
Of course , such statistics can be misleading . 
The US and Europe still enjoy the services of a vast capital stock - machines , buildings , and public infrastructure built over decades or even centuries . 
Furthermore , immaterial capital increasingly matters , too : US authorities recently revised GDP upward by $ 400 billion after recognizing that research and development spending should be categorized as investment . 
Emerging countries may be growing faster , but their per capita capital stock still does not match that of advanced countries ( in fact , this is precisely what development is largely about ) . 
Nonetheless , global politics is one field in which relative income changes and the poor state of rich countries &quot; public finances matter . 
When the US and Europe threatened to withdraw financial support from Egypt in order to influence the behavior of the country &apos;s military leadership , they soon realized that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states could be much more convincing , because they had much deeper pockets . 
This leads to the third catchword of the last five years : rebalancing . 
Globalization 1.0 was built around US consumers and Chinese producers . 
The next phase should be built around consumers and producers the world over . 
According to projections by Homi Kharas and Geoffrey Gertz of the Brookings Institution , there now are 700 million more people with $ 10-100 per day to spend than there were in 2003 . 
Moreover , what they call the global middle class is expected to grow by another 1.3 billion over the next ten years . 
So there is obvious potential for a major rebalancing toward consumption-led growth in the emerging and developing world . 
This new phase of globalization portends major benefits for the global economy . 
Instead of the somewhat one-sided trade pattern of the last two decades , it means greater well-being for households in developing countries and opportunities for more producers in the advanced economies . 
At the same time , consumption habits will need to change everywhere : the middle class cannot triple in size and continue to rely on the same energy- and carbon-intensive spending patterns . 
But we are not there yet . 
Partly owing to government stimulus measures , China &apos;s growth since 2008 has been driven more by investment than by consumption , which has impeded the economy &apos;s much-needed demand rebalancing . 
Economic performance has been sustained by a partly artificial investment boom , which is now petering out - raising concerns about China &apos;s ability to maintain sufficiently rapid growth . 
And demand is still much too energy- and carbon-intensive . 
So a transition remains to be managed , and recent foreign-exchange turmoil in several emerging countries indicates that it is bound to be a delicate one . 
The resilience that the world economy has shown since 2008 provides reason to rejoice , and the acceleration of changes in the global balance of economic and financial strength is reason to reflect . 
But the remaining challenge of rebalancing demand ( in both quantitative and qualitative terms ) remains a major one . 
Until progress toward meeting it is further advanced , it will be too early to claim victory .
