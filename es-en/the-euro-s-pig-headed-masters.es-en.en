The Euro &apos;s PIG-Headed Masters 
CAMBRIDGE - Europe is in constitutional crisis . 
No one seems to have the power to impose a sensible resolution of its peripheral countries &quot; debt crisis . 
Instead of restructuring the manifestly unsustainable debt burdens of Portugal , Ireland , and Greece ( the PIGs ) , politicians and policymakers are pushing for ever-larger bailout packages with ever-less realistic austerity conditions . 
Unfortunately , they are not just &quot; kicking the can down the road , &quot; but pushing a snowball down a mountain . 
True , for the moment , the problem is still economically manageable . 
Eurozone growth is respectable , and the PIGs account for only 6 % of the eurozone &apos;s GDP . 
But by stubbornly arguing that that these countries are facing a liquidity crisis , rather than a solvency problem , euro officials are putting entire system at risk . 
Major eurozone economies like Spain and Italy have huge debt problems of their own , especially given anemic growth and a manifest lack of competitiveness . 
The last thing they need is for people to be led to believe that an implicit transfer union is already in place , and that reform and economic restructuring can wait . 
European Union officials argue that it would be catastrophic to restructure any member &apos;s debts proactively . 
It is certainly the case that contagion will rage after any Greek restructuring . 
It will stop spreading only when Germany constructs a firm and credible firewall , presumably around Spanish and Italian central-government debt . 
This is exactly the kind of hardheaded solution that one would see in a truly integrated currency area . 
So , why do Europe &apos;s leaders find this intermediate solution so unimaginable ? 
Perhaps it is because they believe they do not have the governance mechanisms in place to make tough decisions , to pick winners and losers . 
The European Union &apos;s weak , fractured institutions dispose of less than 2 % of eurozone GDP in tax revenues . 
Any kind of bold decision essentially requires unanimity . 
It is all for one and one for all , regardless of size , debt position , and accountability . 
There is no point is drawing up a Plan B if there is no authority or capacity to execute it . 
Might Europe get lucky ? 
Is there any chance that the snowball of debt , dysfunction , and doubt will fall apart harmlessly before it gathers more force ? 
Amidst so much uncertainty , anything is possible . 
If eurozone growth wildly outperforms expectations in the next few years , banks &quot; balance sheets would strengthen and German taxpayers &quot; pockets would deepen . 
The peripheral countries might just experience enough growth to sustain their ambitious austerity commitments . 
Today &apos;s strategy , however , is far more likely to lead to blowup and disorderly restructuring . 
Why should the Greek people ( not to mention the Irish and the Portuguese ) accept years of austerity and slow growth for the sake of propping up the French and German banking systems , unless they are given huge bribes to do so ? 
As Stanford professor Jeremy Bulow and I showed in our work on sovereign debt in the 1980 &quot; s , countries rarely can be squeezed into making net payments ( payments minus new loans ) to foreigners of more than a few percent for a few years . 
The current EU / International Monetary Fund strategy calls for a decade or two of such payments . 
It has to , lest the German taxpayer revolt at being asked to pay for Europe in perpetuity . 
Perhaps this time is different . 
Perhaps the allure of belonging to a growing reserve currency will make sustained recession and austerity feasible in ways that have seldom been seen historically . I doubt it . 
True , against all odds and historical logic , Europe seems poised to maintain the leadership of the IMF . 
Remarkably , in their resignation to the apparently inevitable choice for the top position , emerging-market leaders do not seem to realize that they should still challenge the United States &quot; prerogative of appointing the Fund &apos;s extremely powerful number-two official . 
The IMF has already been extraordinarily generous to the PIGs . 
Once the new bailout-friendly team is ensconced , we can only expect more generosity , regardless of whether these countries adhere to their programs . 
Unfortunately , an ultra-soft IMF is the last thing Europe needs right now . 
With its constitutional crisis , we have reached exactly the moment when the IMF needs to help the eurozone make the tough decisions that it cannot make on its own . 
The Fund needs to create programs for Portugal , Ireland , and Greece that restore competitiveness and trim debt , and that offer them realistic hope of a return to economic growth . 
The IMF needs to prevent Europeans from allowing their constitutional paralysis to turn the eurozone &apos;s debt snowball into a global avalanche . 
Absent the IMF , the one institution that might be able to take action is the fiercely independent European Central Bank . 
But if the ECB takes over entirely the role of &quot; lender of last resort , &quot; it will ultimately become insolvent itself . 
This is no way to secure the future of the single currency . 
The endgame to any crisis is difficult to predict . 
Perhaps a wholesale collapse of the euro exchange rate will be enough , triggering an export boom . 
Perhaps Europe will just boom anyway . 
But it is hard to see how the single currency can survive much longer without a decisive move towards a far stronger fiscal union .
