Europe &apos;s Vital French Connection 
PARIS - In the debates raging over the future of the European Union and the eurozone , Germany always takes center stage . 
It has the largest economy , accounting for 28 % of eurozone GDP and 25 % of the eurozone &apos;s population . 
It is running a current-account surplus that is now larger than China &apos;s - indeed , the largest in the world in absolute value . 
And , while weighted majorities can overrule it on some issues , everyone acknowledges that little can be done in the eurozone unless Germany agrees . 
But the emphasis on Germany , though justified , should not lead to an underestimation of France &apos;s critical role . 
France not only accounts for roughly 22 % of eurozone GDP and 20 % of its population - behind only Germany - but also has the healthiest demography in the eurozone , whereas the German population is projected to decline over the next decade . 
At the same time , France &apos;s critical role reflects more than its size . 
Indeed , in terms of influencing outcomes in Europe , France is as important as Germany , for three reasons . 
First , France is an indispensable link between southern and northern Europe at a time of growing economic and financial division between creditors and debtors ( a fissure that has begun to assume a cultural dimension ) . 
An active France can play a bridging role , leveraging its strong relationship with Germany ( a friendship that is a pillar of the EU ) and its proximity and cultural affinities to the Mediterranean . 
France is &quot; southern &quot; in its current-account deficit , but &quot; northern &quot; in its borrowing costs ( slightly above Germany &apos;s ) , owing partly to inflows of capital fleeing the south , as well as to modest but positive economic growth . 
Moreover , there is no perceived &quot; re-denomination &quot; risk affecting French assets , given markets &quot; confidence that France will retain the euro . 
So , while France faces huge economic challenges , its northern and southern features permit it to play a proactive role in the European project &apos;s survival . 
French President François Hollande has already given a rather successful preview of this role , meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on his first day in office , and , a month later , participating in a high-profile meeting with the Italian and Spanish prime ministers in Rome . 
Indeed , he took the lead in adding a &quot; growth pact &quot; to the &quot; stability pact &quot; that had been negotiated under Merkel &apos;s leadership . 
Second , France , under its new center-left government , must demonstrate that the &quot; European model &quot; of a market economy coupled with strong social solidarity can be reformed and strengthened , rather than abandoned - not just in Europe &apos;s more pragmatic north , but also in its more ideological south . 
French Socialists will not renounce their traditional commitments ; nor should they . 
But they now have the opportunity to contribute to the European model &apos;s renewal . 
Under Hollande , France &apos;s Socialists favor achieving that renewal through a process of social dialogue that convinces rather than imposes , that focuses both on revenue measures and on boosting government efficiency , and that may adopt some of northern Europe &apos;s more successful &quot; flexicurity &quot; policies , which combine greater labor-market flexibility with strong social protection . 
The reforms should also introduce much greater individual choice , permitting solutions to retirement , education , health , and lifestyle issues that can be more easily tailored to citizens &quot; specific circumstances and needs . 
The government of Hollande and Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has strong majorities at all executive and legislative levels , giving it a rare opportunity to act . 
If it can renew the European model at home , it will be able to project that success much more widely , particularly in southern Europe , in turn reinforcing confidence and belief in the EU , particularly among the young generation . 
The French center-left must lead in conceiving a vision for Europe in which solidarity and equity reinforce long-term economic strength . 
Finally , along with the United Kingdom among European countries , France retains more of a global role than Germany has yet acquired . 
While the United Nations Security Council is outdated in its structure , it still plays a crucial legitimizing role ; and France , not Germany , is a member . 
In many other international organizations as well , France punches above its weight . 
Similarly , while France exports much less than Germany outside the EU , many large French enterprises rival Germany &apos;s in global reach and technical know-how . 
And French is still a global language . 
In other words , France not only is a link between Europe &apos;s north and south , but also contributes substantially to linking Europe to the rest of the world . 
Europe needs a renewed vision and effective policies to realize that vision . 
France &apos;s Socialist-Green government can play a critical unifying role as Europeans confront their biggest challenge in decades . 
Its success will be highly consequential - not least for the political debate that will inform the outcome of Germany &apos;s elections in 2013 .
