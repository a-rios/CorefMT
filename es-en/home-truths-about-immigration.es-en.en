Home Truths about Immigration 
Something strange happened in Europe &apos;s election campaigns this year . 
In France and Germany , Holland and Sweden the subject uppermost on many people &apos;s minds - immigration - was either ignored or exaggerated . 
Established parties seem almost to have an unwritten pact to play down the significance of immigration . 
&quot; We must keep this sensitive subject out of the campaign &quot; seemed to be the prevailing attitude , as if the period of heightened political awareness that elections provide should not be used to debate serious controversies . 
As a result , fringe parties stepped in with slogans about countries being &quot; swamped &quot; by immigrants and the need to preserve the &quot; purity &quot; of nations . 
Can one blame voters for being suspicious of the silence of the political majority , and even for being taken in by the fringe &apos;s blustering ? 
It is high time - indeed , past time - for those who believe in liberal and enlightened political discourse to present their case . 
Some home truths about the migration of people need to be remembered and the necessary consequences drawn . 
Here are five such truths , or at any rate , five issues for debate : 
First , emigration is no fun . 
As a rule , people do not leave their homes on a whim or out of adventurousness . 
Typically , they want to escape conditions of hopelessness , as many Europeans did when they left their homes in the 19 th and 20 th centuries , usually for America . 
Whether migrants are responding to political oppression or economic destitution , it is important to understand that the price they are prepared to pay is as high as the push to leave is strong . 
Second , immigration is a great compliment to those countries that migrants choose as their final destination . 
The answer to the question , &quot; Where do we go if we have to leave ? &quot; is not usually China or some African country , nor is it any longer much of Latin America . 
Countries that are magnets for migrants tend to be rich and free . 
Canada has become a dream for many , but so are the countries of Europe . 
They should be proud - and a little humble - about their magnetic quality , as the US was for a long time . 
Third , it is misleading to argue for a certain amount of immigration in terms of the need to fill certain high-tech or other positions . 
Gaining a few Indian computer specialists is a bad reason for allowing &quot; green card &quot; access , if only because such migrants are likely to remain a tiny minority of newcomers . 
Rich countries need immigrants nowadays in order to fill the jobs that Adair Turner , in his book Just Capital , calls &quot; high-touch &quot; jobs . 
Getting your hands dirty is what most people in rich countries no longer want to do . 
From restaurant kitchens to care for the elderly , from harvesting cotton to laboring on building sites , people in rich countries want to consume services that they are no longer willing to provide themselves . 
It may not be dignified to expect immigrant workers to do these &quot; dirty &quot; jobs , but to these workers such jobs offer a step on the ladder of hope as they help to keep advanced economies and societies functioning . 
Fourth , no one has yet thought through the full implications of today &apos;s demographic and attendant social changes , but the fact is that without immigrants the welfare state in advanced countries will become unaffordable . 
This is not pleasant to say . 
Using migrants to provide for the needs of natives , but without letting the migrants share all the benefits , is morally unattractive . 
There may be ways to mitigate the result , but without immigration social benefits across Europe will have to be reduced massively within a generation . 
Fifth , immigration can be treated either as a step towards the full integration of migrants , or as a transitional phase in their lives . 
Both possibilities need to be on offer , but there is a lot to be said for the second . 
Italians ( and later Turks ) who worked in Northern Europe and then returned home with sufficient assets to start small businesses made a double contribution ; they helped their host countries and then helped their home countries . 
The fact that countries can be turned around is a reason for hope . 
Portugal , and above all Ireland , are prime examples . 
For more than a century , Ireland was an emigration country par excellence . 
Now Ireland is so prosperous that it attracts immigrants even from Britain . 
This is not the only way forward . 
Integration of immigrants makes much sense ; but it is desirable to help create sustainable conditions in troubled countries with the help of a generation of emigrants who first transfer resources and then return themselves . 
Many consequences follow from such home truths about immigration , not least a more rational debate . 
Viewed from the perspective such truths provide , the European Union &apos;s eastward enlargement , for example , is highly desirable not despite but because it may lead to migration from the new member states to the old . 
In this way , more Portugals and Irelands can be created as the wealth of already prosperous regions is sustained .
