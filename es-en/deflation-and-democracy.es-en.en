Deflation and Democracy 
PRINCETON - The history of finance is partly the history of a struggle for a stable , secure way to measure value . 
And , like any quest for certainty in our unpredictable world , it was doomed to failure . 
The latest financial crisis powerfully highlights this vulnerability , as it destroys any sense that we can put an accurate price on assets . 
Most people are now convinced that this shortcoming is inherent in the financial system . 
But uncertainties about value also expose deep problems in the political order . 
In the past , metallic money provided an inconvenient and unsatisfactory solution to the question of value . 
It was inconvenient because gold was awkward for everyday transactions , and silver had too little value for major transfers . 
Moreover , metallic money was prone to unpredictable shifts in value with the discovery of new supplies . 
The arrival of silver from the New World in the sixteenth century triggered sustained inflation . 
The discovery of gold in California in the mid-nineteenth century , and in Alaska , South Africa , and Australia 50 years later , also produced mild inflation , while the absence of such new discoveries in the 1870 &quot; s and 1880 &quot; s led to mild deflation . 
Consequently , many economists and politicians concluded that paper money could be more easily controlled and more stable . 
This innovation , which was dependent on high-security paper-making and printing techniques , transformed the twentieth century . 
But it initially produced a much less stable outcome , because of the strong temptation of political abuse . 
Instead of moderate inflation , most of the twentieth century was wildly inflationary , as governments over-issued currency . 
In the last two decades of the twentieth century , however , an intellectual revolution occurred . 
Entrusting monetary policy to an independent central bank promised to be a perfect way to counter the political pressure to print money . 
At the United States Federal Reserve , Paul Volcker engineered a sustained and successful process of disinflation beginning in 1979 . 
Europe learned the same lesson with the move to monetary union and the creation of the European Central Bank to manage its new currency , the euro . 
As a result , people assumed that the problem of monetary stability had been solved , and that they could pile up assets and then use them as collateral to borrow ever-larger sums . 
But the large-scale destruction of financial assets because of underlying uncertainty about the extent of losses in the wake of the sub-prime crisis , and especially after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , shook that assumption . 
Deflation that emanates from the financial sector is lethal . 
It is more difficult to deal with than inflation , in part for the technical reason that interest rates can be reduced only to zero . 
The closer to zero they fall , the more problematic monetary policy becomes . 
The policy instruments no longer work . 
Central banks have expanding balance sheets , but prices continue to fall and uncertainty rises . 
There is a further reason why deflation is such a threat , and why policymakers setting out to eliminate it have a much tougher task than inflation fighters : all prices do not move down ; in particular debts do not adjust because they are fixed in nominal terms . 
Inflation and deflation of debts produce very different outcomes . 
Inflation reduces the value of debt , which for many people and companies feels like slowly sipping champagne , producing a nice buzz of light-headed excitement as they are unburdened . 
Deflation , on the other hand , increases debt , and feels like being smothered by a lead blanket . 
In the interwar Great Depression , the economist Irving Fisher accurately described the process of debt deflation , in which lenders , worried by the deterioration of their asset quality , called in their loans , pushing borrowers to liquidate assets . 
That , in turn , merely drove down prices further , leading to more credit rationing , bankruptcies , and bank failures . 
The political response to deflation is to call for a stronger state . 
Dealing with deflation is impossible within the bounds of normal market operations . 
Only the state is reliable enough to take on all debt , which private institutions are too risk-intolerant to hold . 
But economists &quot; abstract description of the resulting state intervention as an expansion of &quot; aggregate demand &quot; conceals the fact that the government conducts specific expenditures and makes political decisions that rescue specific businesses and individuals . 
In the climate of scarcity that characterizes debt deflations , the specificity of bailout operations inevitably leads to intense political debate . 
We see this in the current discussion about the distributional effects of rescuing the automobile industry ; or the worry that hedge funds , which are widely blamed for today &apos;s financial malaise , should have access to the Fed &apos;s emergency credit lines . 
Currently , parallels are being drawn to Japan &apos;s experience in the 1990 &quot; s - a &quot; lost decade &quot; in economic terms that also undermined the legitimacy of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party . 
The Great Depression produced more alarming outcomes , as the political response to deflation throughout Central Europe and Latin America destroyed the prevailing order , including several democracies . 
Statism has been a characteristically twentieth-century response to new uncertainty . 
Its inadequacy may lead to the formulation of a much older answer : revulsion against the market economy , accompanied by indiscriminate condemnation of debt and debt instruments . 
Indeed , as governments scramble to respond to the current crisis , we should remember that deflation tends to produce not only radical anti-capitalism , but also a profound hostility to any kind of economic or political organization .
