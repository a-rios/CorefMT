Hunting the Higgs 
CAMBRIDGE - Fifty years ago , particle physicists faced an unexpected challenge . 
Their best mathematical models could account for some of the natural forces that explain the structure and behavior of matter at a fundamental level , such as electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force responsible for radioactive decay . 
But the models worked only if the particles inside of atoms had no mass . 
How could huge conglomerations of such particles - proteins , people , planets - behave as they do if their constituent parts weighed nothing at all ? 
Some physicists invented a clever workaround . 
For a half-century , physicists searched for the elusive &quot; Higgs particle . &quot; 
Now , following research conducted at CERN , the sprawling particle-physics laboratory near Geneva , the hunt may soon be over . 
At first blush , the idea behind the Higgs particle sounds outlandish . 
Higgs and his colleagues suggested that every elementary particle really is massless , just as the mathematical models require , and hence all particles would ordinarily zip around at the speed of light . 
But suppose that everything around us - every single particle in the universe - is immersed in a huge , unseen vat of Higgs particles . 
Whenever most kinds of particles move from point A to point B , they continually bump into Higgs particles , slowing their motion . 
When we observe them , they appear to lumber along like holiday shoppers in a crowded store . 
From their slow motion , we infer that they have mass . 
While a 50-year search for a hypothetical particle reminiscent of a bizarre fairytale might seem quixotic , the Higgs particle stands at the center of the &quot; Standard Model &quot; of particle physics . 
Every experimental test of the model so far has matched theoretical expectations . 
In some striking examples , the agreement between prediction and measurement has stretched out to twelve decimal places , making the Standard Model the most accurate scientific theory in human history . 
The model successfully accounts for three of the four basic forces of nature ; only gravity remains beyond its purview . 
Higgs particles might have played an even more substantial role at earlier moments in cosmic history . 
My own research , along with that of physicists around the world , has focused on what effects Higgs particles might have had just fractions of a second after the big bang - effects that could explain the shape and fate of the universe . 
And yet , for all that , we still have no direct evidence that Higgs particles even exist . 
According to the Standard Model , Higgs particles scatter off each other , so they , too , should have mass . 
The latest research indicates that Higgs particles ( if they exist ) should be among the most massive critters of the subatomic realm , more than 120 times as massive as the familiar proton . 
To produce such a particle in the laboratory requires revving up protons to nearly the speed of light and smashing them together , which the Large Hadron Collider at CERN accomplishes trillions of times per second . 
The energetic collisions produce all manner of debris , which physicists carefully track with huge detectors and sift with sophisticated computer algorithms . 
Physicists confront two major hurdles in their hunt for the Higgs . 
First , they must identify patterns in the debris that could have come from the production and rapid decay of a Higgs particle . 
The sought-after signal is well understood in principle , given what we know about the Standard Model . 
So is the background noise from all of the other junk that comes flying out when two protons collide with colossal energy . 
Physicists searching for a few Higgs-like needles in a mind-bogglingly large haystack must comb their data for anomalies in the debris that cannot be accounted for by known processes . 
The second difficulty concerns statistics . 
The rules of quantum theory , on which the Standard Model is built , are at root probabilistic . 
There will always be statistical flukes in the data , just as any series of coin tosses can produce an unexpected string of seven heads in a row . 
To know with confidence that the coin is ordinary , with no hidden features , one must log a sufficiently large number of coin flips and check whether the data include equal numbers of heads and tails over the long run . 
After thousands of coin tosses , if the data still show a bias toward heads , one may be justified in thinking that the coin has some unusual properties . 
The same holds true for all of the chaff from the protons &quot; collisions . 
Before physicists can claim that their anomalies really come from Higgs particles , they must gather enough data to rule out flukes . 
At CERN , two independent teams of physicists recently announced that their data were consistent with detection of a Higgs particle , though there remained a 1-in-2,000 chance that the signal came from mundane , non-Higgs processes . 
So the teams will continue smashing protons together , gathering more data , and sifting for signs of a Higgs . 
We might not have the Higgs in hand right now . 
But the latest news is the strongest indication yet that the 50-year hunt for one of the most fundamental bits of matter might well be coming to a successful conclusion . 
The next time the CERN teams call a press conference , it could be weighty news indeed .
