The Other War That Should Be Stopped 
The world &apos;s attention has been focused on the war on Iraq . 
But another war - this one UN-sanctioned - has been going on simultaneously : the war on drugs . 
In my view , every sensible person should want this largely ignored war to end as well . 
While the UN should play a role in leading Iraq toward a free and democratic society , it must also change dramatically its own course in the war on drugs and lead the world to a saner policy . 
In 1998 , to celebrate the 10 th anniversary of the adoption of the third Convention on Narcotic and Psychotropic substances , the United Nations convened a special General Assembly session to discuss the issue of illicit drugs . 
At the end of that forum , UN member states adopted a political declaration that mandated the UN Drug Control Programme ( UNDCP ) &quot; to develop strategies with a view to eliminating or significantly reducing the illicit cultivation of the coca bush , the cannabis plant , and the opium poppy by the year 2008 . &quot; 
On April 16 th -17 th , the international community will re-convene in Vienna to reckon with the results of the policies the UN has pursued . 
But five years into the program , one thing is clear : the results are grim . 
According to a UNDCP report issued in 2002 called Illicit Drug Trends , new markets for narcotics are expanding faster than old ones are being shut down . 
Drug dealers , like sharp businessmen everywhere , have gone out and found new markets . 
Eastern countries ( the postcommunist world in Europe and the richer countries of Asia ) are consuming more and more drugs , because the older markets of Western Europe and North America are saturated . 
Across the world , narcotics trafficking is on the increase , not only because new markets are coming online , but also because new countries have taken up production . 
Moreover , new synthetic and chemical substances , which are more potent and often less expensive than the &quot; classic &quot; ones , are being invented . 
It is time to acknowledge that the &quot; war on drugs &quot; is lost - indeed , a monumental failure - and that hostilities should end . 
Every aspect of the war strategy has failed . 
Harsh new domestic laws in many countries have not only failed to control the spread of drugs throughout the world , but have delivered a vast new source of state intrusiveness into the lives of millions of people . 
Prohibition created a pretext for authoritarian regimes to resist the abolition of death penalty ; yet even states that execute people for drug-related crimes have not been able to stem the tide . 
To circumvent the harsh legal regime now in place narcotics mafias have forged ever-tighter alliances with terrorist networks . 
Can the world afford to continue subsidizing this failure ? 
Can our money be wasted for much longer on fumigating Colombian valleys or arresting non-violent drug offenders ? 
Can we - including those of us who are elected officials - pretend that prohibitions on illicit drugs will one day prove effective ? 
The answer to all these questions , of course , is : &quot; No , we cannot . &quot; 
Instead , we must recognize that prohibition , rather than curtailing use , generates crime , because it makes trading in illicit drugs a lucrative business . 
As politicians everywhere remain loath to be seen as &quot; soft on drugs , &quot; something must be done to call attention to this remorseless failure . 
One ploy taken up by some members of my Transnational Radical Party in France , Belgium , the UK , and Italy has been to &quot; denounce themselves &quot; to their national authorities and then to disobey the prohibitionist laws by distributing drugs to passers-by during political demonstrations . 
By openly inviting the police to jail otherwise respected members of the community , these activists hope to show the absurdity of harsh anti-drug laws . 
These Gandhian acts of non-violent civil disobedience have had an effect . 
Recently , 109 members of the European Parliament introduced a recommendation calling for reform of the UN Conventions on drugs . 
An &quot; International Anti-Prohibitionist League &quot; is now at work , calling for repeal or amendment of the UN treaties in order to allow for experimentation with legalization by individual nations . 
At the upcoming Commission on Narcotics meeting in April , UN member states will have an opportunity to reassess the effectiveness of the 1998 Plan of Action . 
Sadly , however , the reality of its failure to come anywhere close to achieving its stated goals has not dented the minds of national governments : not one state has voiced its opposition to current strategies . 
But turning a blind eye to failure only increases its cost . 
So long as the UN anti-drug mandates remain in place , legalization of treatments , cures , and drugs that today are illicit - and recall that it was the end of prohibition alone that ended the reign of gangsters like Al Capone in the 1920s - will remain impossible . 
The Vienna meeting offers a rare opportunity to change course . 
Instead of insisting on replicating our failures , the world needs to adopt new approaches that treat the disease of drug use , instead of criminalizing it . 
Otherwise , we will all remain addicted to a failed drug war .
