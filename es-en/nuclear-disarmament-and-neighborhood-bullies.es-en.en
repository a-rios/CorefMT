Nuclear Disarmament and Neighborhood Bullies 
MADRID - Twenty-five years ago , at a summit in Rejkjavik , Iceland , US President Ronald Reagan stunned the world and his Soviet counterpart , Mikhail Gorbachev , by proposing global and comprehensive elimination of all nuclear weapons . 
Unfortunately , the skepticism of the United States &quot; defense establishment , together with Reagan &apos;s adamant refusal to abandon his Strategic Defense Initiative nipped this bold move in the bud . 
That was a tragic missed opportunity , for a US-Soviet agreement , reached in what was still an essentially binary international system , might have had truly global meaning . 
Although US and Russian stockpiles still account for more than 90 % of the world &apos;s nuclear warheads , US President Barack Obama &apos;s disarmament goal , Global Zero , is proving far harder to accomplish now , given how much the world has changed since the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Not only has the number of nuclear states increased , but the so-called &quot; nuclear renaissance &quot; - the revival of nuclear power , owing to rising oil prices and environmental concerns - has put nuclear technologies into growing use . 
This revival holds important implications for nuclear proliferation . 
More importantly , China , India , Pakistan , Iran , and Israel might not be particularly impressed by Russian and American assumptions that they can meet their defense needs with far smaller nuclear arsenals . 
Nuclear disarmament must therefore focus not only on a truly total elimination of stockpiles by the major powers , but also on regional powers &quot; concerns . 
Global Zero must go hand in hand with a robust strategy of conflict resolution and confidence-building in trouble spots such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East . 
All the nuclear-weapon-free zones that were created in the last decades - for example , by the Tlatelolco Treaty for Latin America or the Treaty of Rarotonga for the South Pacific - were made possible by understandings that were reached freely by regional powers in an atmosphere of multilateral confidence . 
Conspicuously , the 1992 Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula remains to this day a dead letter simply because of the latent state of war between the two Koreas . 
Another case in point is the Middle East . 
Unless conditions in the region change dramatically for the better , the creation of a WMD-free zone ( WMDFZ ) in the Middle East - an idea launched at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2010 - might prove a stillborn initiative . 
How can a meeting be convened in 2012 , as stipulated by the 2010 NPT conference &apos;s final document , &quot; on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by the states of the region , &quot; when many of those states are in turmoil , inter-state relations are strained , and the threat of conflict is mounting ? 
The Middle East has already had its own missed opportunity , the 1992-1995 Arms Control and Regional Security multilateral working group , which was launched within the Madrid peace process . 
Conceived as a confidence-building endeavor and accompanied by a robust peacemaking track , ACRS was interrupted by the difficulties in the peace process , by Arab states &quot; insistence that Israel &apos;s nuclear capabilities be addressed before anything else , and by the underlying struggle for mastery in the region . 
If the 2012 conference is conceived as yet one more opportunity to pressure Israel to join the NPT - possibly in exchange for the Arabs joining the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention - the conference might soon reach an impasse . 
But the same outcome is assured if the US and Israel conceive the conference solely as a way to isolate and force NPT compliance on Iran and Syria . 
The nuclear deadlock in the Middle East can be resolved only if all of the regional players are ready to change old patterns of behavior . 
The Arab position has traditionally been that Israel cannot be offered the fruits of peace , such as recognition and normal relations , before it has paid its full territorial price - that is , a complete withdrawal from occupied Arab lands and the creation of a Palestinian state . 
But the Arab states nonetheless insist that , even before the end of conflict , Israel unilaterally must give up its ( undeclared ) nuclear capabilities . 
This is a futile exercise , not only because Israel would never disarm unilaterally , but also because without normal inter-state relations in the region it is impossible to engage seriously in an effective dialogue on such vital issues . 
Indeed , Israel &apos;s concept of &quot; peace first and denuclearization last &quot; was vindicated in the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty , which speaks of a WMDFZ as a goal &quot; to be achieved in the context of a comprehensive , lasting and stable peace . &quot; 
Nor can Israel expect to have the best of all worlds - making nuclear disarmament conditional on a comprehensive peace , while simultaneously conducting a policy aimed at stalling the peace process . 
There might be no better formula for progress towards a WMDFZ in the Middle East than a return to the ACRS concept , whereby two parallel tracks move toward a comprehensive Israeli-Arab peace along the lines of the Arab Peace Initiative , and to the establishment of a WMDFZ in the region . 
To work , the Arabs must accord to Israel key benefits of peace before peace has been formally achieved . 
Israel , for its part , must recommit itself to the late Yitzak Rabin &apos;s doctrine that only a comprehensive regional peace agreement can prevent the Middle East from declining into nuclear chaos .
