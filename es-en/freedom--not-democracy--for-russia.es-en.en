Freedom , Not Democracy , For Russia 
Twenty years ago this month , Mikhail Gorbachev began his policies of perestroika and glasnost , which led to the end of the Cold War . 
Now , however , a new chill has entered relations between Russia and the West . 
President Vladimir Putin is frequently criticized for taking Russia in the wrong direction . 
The very people who in 2000 called Putin a man they could do business with are having second thoughts . 
People once fascinated by Putin now publicly rebuke him . 
Putin is shooting back , accusing the West of trying to weaken and dismember Russia . 
As politicians in the West compare him to Mugabe or Mussolini , Putin &apos;s Kremlin aides invoke the Munich appeasers who tried to push Hitler eastward . 
Putin himself once blamed the West for trying to channel Muslim radicalism toward Russia . 
Why this sharp change in tone ? 
Initially , most nations exiting from Communism reached out , almost instinctively , to their immediate pre-Communist period . 
The Baltic states revived their constitutions of the 1930 &quot; s , the Armenians and the Azeris revived their political parties of the late 1910 &quot; s , and Eastern Europe , with the exception of East Germany , which reunited with the Federal Republic , suddenly became once again Mitteleuropa . 
This revival of the past was a big worry for West Europeans and Americans , who feared the re-emergence of historical enmities and tensions , which did indeed come to the fore in the former Yugoslavia . 
These fears underpinned the dual enlargement of NATO and the European Union . 
Russia , for its part , also went backwards , to tsarism . 
Initially , this was not obvious to all . 
Boris Yeltsin was friendly to the West , tolerated open debate , and appointed a few individuals as oligarchs . 
He was given the benefit of the doubt , and his anti-Communism was elevated to a surrogate of democracy . 
Russia was doubtless freer than ever before , in virtually all respects , good and bad . 
But the picture Russia presented to others and to itself was massively distorted . 
Parliament was lively , but essentially powerless . 
The electronic media were routinely critical of the authorities , but were owned by a handful of people and depended on their owners &quot; taste , interests , and fate . 
Yeltsin &apos;s handover of power to Putin , like a king with his dauphin , tells us more about his regime than almost anything else . 
Putin &apos;s regime is openly tsarist . 
His Duma is much like the Duma of Nicholas II , docile and acquiescent . 
His governors are also like Nicholas &apos;s ; many are governor-generals . 
The capitalism now being practiced is dependent on the authorities , and plays no independent role in politics . 
Of course , this does not mean that there is no difference between the Russia of Vladimir Putin and Nicholas Romanov . 
What it means is that Russia is back on its historical path of development , back at the point where things started to go wrong . 
The domestic situation , the global environment , and the historical memory of its people all militate against Russia being bound to relive its own tragic history . 
It is not like Central Europe , which could leapfrog over some of them by jumping on the NATO / EU springboard . 
This means that we need to be more careful in using the language of democracy when talking about Russia . 
Democracy almost everywhere has been a fairly late child of capitalism , for it requires a self-conscious middle class to take root and flourish . 
Russia is generating it , but the process will take time . 
Meanwhile , politics belongs to the elites . 
If Russia is to move forward , its high and mighty must agree about who owns what , who makes the rules , and how to change the rules . 
Rather than calling for democracy , this calls for a genuine constitutional rule of law . 
In other words , the task is to turn tsarist Russia into a version of the Kaiser &apos;s Germany . 
This won &apos;t be easy , but there are good reasons for optimism . 
With so much being written about Putin &apos;s Russia , the rest of the country is often overlooked . 
Putin &apos;s Russia is essentially about the Kremlin and the bureaucracy . 
They are dominant , no doubt , but they are not Russia in its entirety . 
The millions of consumers exercising their right to choose in the rapidly growing supermarket chains ; the planeloads of business travelers converging on London , Zurich , and Frankfurt daily ; the holiday-makers who , having lost the Crimea , have rediscovered the Mediterranean - all are part of a Russia beyond Putin &apos;s Russia , one that will grow and develop even when Putin is history . 
So Russia &apos;s current agenda must be more about freedom than democracy . 
Even now , Russia , though undemocratic , is largely free . 
What it needs is to institutionalize that freedom by building a modern state to replace the antiquated tsarist system . 
It also needs a modern civil society to consolidate its multi-ethnic post-imperial population . 
This calls for a kind of liberalism that is now lacking in Russia , one that stands for freedom , reform , and the nation-state . 
Neither the government nor the current opposition possesses it , which means that Russians must look beyond Putin &apos;s Russia . 
As for the West , it is fruitless to try to bring Putin and his team back to democracy , where Russia does not belong , or to punish Russia with sanctions , which won &apos;t work . 
The West must recognize where Russia stands on history &apos;s timeline and not seek to wish this away . 
The political gap can be narrowed only by indigenous capitalist development . 
In the meantime , America and Europe should base their policies toward Russia on mutual interests , not the expectation of mutual values .
