Debt Déjà Vu 
NEW YORK - For two years , financial markets have repeated the same error - predicting that US interest rates will rise within about six months , only to see the horizon recede . 
This serial misjudgment is the result not of unforeseeable events , but of a failure to grasp the strength and global nature of the deflationary forces now shaping the economy . 
We are caught in a trap where debt burdens do not fall , but simply shift among sectors and countries , and where monetary policies alone are inadequate to stimulate global demand , rather than merely redistribute it . 
The origin of this malaise lies in the creation of excessive debt to fund real-estate investment and construction . 
During Japan &apos;s 1980s boom , real-estate loans quadrupled in just four years , and land prices increased 2.5-fold. 
After the property bubble burst in 1990 , over-leveraged companies were determined to pay down their debts , even when interest rates fell close to zero . 
While large fiscal deficits partly offset the demand-suppressing effects of private deleveraging , the inevitable consequence was rising public debt . 
Corporate debt slowly fell ( from 140 % of GDP in 1990 to about 100 % today ) ; but public debt rose relentlessly , and now exceeds 230 % of GDP . 
Since the financial crisis of 2008 , that pattern has been repeated elsewhere . 
In the United States and several European countries , excessive debt creation before 2008 was followed by efforts at private deleveraging , initially offset by large government budget deficits . 
Advanced economies &quot; cumulative private debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen slightly - from 167 % to 163 % , according to a recent report ; but public debt has grown , from 79 % to 105 % of GDP . 
Fiscal austerity has therefore seemed essential ; but it has exacerbated the deflationary impact of private deleveraging . 
Before 2008 , China &apos;s economy was highly dependent on credit expansion , but not within the country itself . 
Rather , it ran large current-account surpluses - 10 % of GDP in 2007 - with credit-fueled consumption growth in the US and elsewhere powering its export-led economy . 
Collapsing external demand in late 2008 therefore threatened Chinese growth and employment . 
In response , China &apos;s government unleashed a massive credit-fueled construction boom , with investment rising from 42 % of GDP to 48 % , and total credit growing from around 140 % of GDP to more than 220 % . 
That boom has now ended , leaving apartment blocks in second- and third-tier cities that will never be occupied , and loans to local governments and state-owned enterprises that will never be repaid . 
Growth in China &apos;s industrial production may be close to zero , even if the official figures suggest a less dramatic decline . 
Within China , the consequences for growth may be less dire than some commentators fear : a rapidly tightening labor market is boosting real wages ; household consumption is growing strongly ; and a buoyant services sector is helping to create ten million new jobs per year . 
Singapore &apos;s economy recorded negative growth in the second quarter ; 
Even before China &apos;s slowdown , Japan was making limited progress toward its target of 2 % inflation in 2016 . 
With the country &apos;s second-quarter GDP falling and August core inflation negative , that target is no longer credible . 
As a result , the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) may increase its already massive quantitative-easing operations . 
Faced with mediocre growth and near-zero inflation , the eurozone may also now consider yet more QE . 
The fact is that QE alone cannot stimulate enough demand in a world where other major economies are facing the same challenges . 
By boosting asset prices , QE is meant to spur investment and consumption . 
The European Central Bank &apos;s QE program , for example , has so far produced no significant increase in corporate investment . 
Given this , central bank governors like the ECB &apos;s Mario Draghi and the BOJ &apos;s Haruhiko Kuroda often emphasize QE &apos;s ability to deliver competitive exchange rates . 
At the global level , exchange-rate devaluation must be a zero-sum game , with the depreciation of the yen and the euro balanced by appreciation of the US dollar , which is up by more than 15 % on a trade-weighted basis since May 2014 . 
Buoyant domestic demand might offset the deflationary impact on the US economy , but only if interest rates stay low enough to stimulate a resurgence of private credit growth , potentially taking us full circle , to the kind of run-up in leverage that preceded the 2008 crisis . 
The United Kingdom has also faced exchange-rate appreciation , with the erosion in export competitiveness reflected in a current-account deficit of around 4 % of GDP . 
The Office of Budget Responsibility suggests , meanwhile , that robust growth will be possible only if household leverage , having fallen slightly since 2008 , rises to an all-time high by 2020 . 
Seven years after 2008 , global leverage is higher than ever , and aggregate global demand is still insufficient to drive robust growth . 
More radical policies - such as major debt write-downs or increased fiscal deficits financed by permanent monetization - will be required to increase global demand , rather than simply shift it around .
