Can We Insure against Tsunamis ? 
Most of the discussion surrounding how to respond to Asia &apos;s tsunami disaster has focused on government relief programs and official schemes to implement early warning systems . 
Little discussion has focused on the promotion of private risk management institutions , notably insurance . 
This is unfortunate . 
Insurance companies provide professional , finely detailed risk management that respects the complexity of the dangers to be hedged and responds creatively to individual needs . 
Promoting private insurance may seem an indirect response to the tsunami disaster , but it is a rational - and powerful - response . 
Insurance companies have not penetrated many of the regions that suffered the greatest losses . 
According to a study by the Insurance Information Institute , expenditures on non-life insurance in 2003 amounted to only 0.83 % of GDP in Indonesia , 1.19 % of GDP in Thailand , and 0.62 % of GDP in India , compared with 5.23 % of GDP in the United States . 
Foreign aid is no substitute for insurance . 
Charity inspires , reassuring us of our humanity , but it is often capricious . 
You wouldn &apos;t want to rely on it . 
Indeed , when deciding how much disaster aid to offer , countries often seem to be influenced mainly by their leaders &quot; concerns about how others will view them . 
Charity responds to attention-grabbing events , often neglecting less sensational disasters . 
Insurance , on the other hand , is a reliable and venerable institution , its modern form dating back to the seventeenth century . 
But insurance and other risk management institutions have been slow to develop , even in advanced countries . 
In the US , most people still do not have flood or earthquake insurance . 
A fundamental problem is that insurance is not a concept that comes naturally to most people . 
In fact , as psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have shown , there is a systematic human tendency to downgrade the perceived probability of low-probability events , so that people go about their lives as if the probability of these events &quot; occurrence is zero . 
Similarly , humans tend to accept large downside risks in order to avoid small certain losses , such as insurance premiums . 
Insurance companies have faced a slow and difficult process in weaning the public from these tendencies . 
Moreover , designing new risk-management products is not easy . 
Insurance companies face inherent difficulties in measuring risks , and they must tailor their policies creatively around the human foibles that limit uptake . 
Insurers must also be attentive to a wide array of possible moral hazards - perverse incentives to risky behavior - and to problems of selection bias in attracting clients . 
To deal with disasters more effectively , countries must find the will to create an environment in which a much more developed private insurance industry can flourish . 
In the US , the National Flood Insurance Program of 1968 made it mandatory for those financing construction or improvement of structures within Special Flood Hazard Areas to buy flood insurance . 
If not made mandatory , insurance must at least be promoted effectively . 
Otherwise , people will build on flood plains in the belief that their government , or the governments of the world , will feel obligated to bail them out , thereby insuring , in effect , bad risks that should not be taken . 
Many of the worst outcomes in Asia occurred in tsunami-prone areas , such as the low-lying coastal areas of Sri Lanka . 
Private insurance would discourage construction in the most dangerous locations , owing to prohibitively high premiums , while encouraging the adoption of tsunami-resistant building standards in marginal areas . 
Fortunately , our international risk-management institutions are steadily improving . 
Various catastrophe bonds , covering earthquakes and other disasters , and weather derivatives have begun trading on financial markets in recent years . 
The Kyoto Protocol created a mechanism for trading carbon dioxide emissions , which promises to manage the risks of an even bigger potential disaster : global warming . 
The markets for these products are still small , but they have strong growth potential , and their further development would enhance insurance companies &quot; ability to cover risks of major international disasters . 
Consider the absence of an early tsunami warning system in the worst affected countries . 
It is easy to blame people for lack of foresight , but none of the nine hardest hit countries had developed one . 
They can &apos;t all be bunglers . 
The problem is not individual error . 
The failure was caused by the absence of appropriate international institutions that would be alert to the broad spectrum of potential disasters . 
Discussion of early warning systems for tsunamis has focused on government programs . 
These are normal activities of insurance companies . 
Indeed , one of the more striking features of the tsunami disaster was that it caught some of the most glamorous vacation resorts completely unprepared . 
The lesson is clear : even high-class businesses are only as professional as the existing institutional infrastructure permits them to be . 
The ultimate reason for their lack of preparation is that our insurance industry was not covering their tsunami risks , and hence not offering up-to-date disaster-prevention guidance . 
The insurance industry can , and should , respond to the tsunami disaster by accepting the moral imperative to take concerted action to expand risk coverage . 
To the extent that governments are involved , they can promote better risk management through responsive regulation and even subsidization of experiments with new private insurance products .
