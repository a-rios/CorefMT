The Asian Power Squeeze 
CANBERRA -As China gets closer to overtaking the United States as the world &apos;s largest economic power , and its disinclination to accept US military dominance of the Western Pacific grows more obvious , America &apos;s Asia / Pacific allies and friends are becoming increasingly anxious about their longer-term strategic environment . 
The nightmare scenario for policymakers from Seoul to Canberra is a zero-sum game in which they are forced to choose between their great economic dependence on China and their still-enormous military reliance on the US . 
No one believes that the US-China relationship will end in tears any time soon , not least because of the mutually dependent credit and consumption embrace in which the two countries are currently locked . 
But the outlook a decade or two from now is already generating a mass of analysis and commentary , focusing on the tensions that have long festered in the South China Sea , bubble up from time to time in the East China Sea , and are forever lurking in the Taiwan Strait . 
What , if anything , can those regional countries with competing interests and loyalties do to avoid the pain that they would certainly face if US-China competition turned violent ? 
Probably no single one of us can do very much to influence the larger picture . 
But there are several messages - some accommodating , but others quite tough - that could very usefully be conveyed collectively by Japan , South Korea , the major ASEAN players , and Australia to China and the US , spelling out how each could best contribute to keeping the region stable . 
Giants are not always especially tolerant of lesser mortals , but in my experience the US tends to listen most and respond best to its friends when its policy assumptions are being challenged and tested , while China has always respected strength and clarity of purpose in its partners and interlocutors . 
And messages coming in convoy are harder to pick off than those offered in isolation . 
The first set of messages to China should be reassuring . 
We accept that it has always been more serious than most about achieving a nuclear weapons-free world , and we understand its need to ensure the survivability of its minimum nuclear deterrent so long as such weapons exist . 
We understand its interest in having a blue-water navy to protect its sea-lanes against any contingency . 
We acknowledge that it has maritime sovereignty claims about which it feels strongly . 
And we recognize the strength of national feeling about Taiwan &apos;s place in a single China . 
But these messages need to be matched by others . 
As to its nuclear and other military capability , mutual confidence can be based only on much greater transparency - not only about doctrine , but numbers and deployment - than China has traditionally been willing to offer . 
Any increase in China &apos;s nuclear arsenal is destabilizing and utterly counterproductive to its stated goal of global nuclear disarmament . 
If other countries in the region are to diminish their reliance on the US nuclear deterrent ( and not acquire any nuclear capability of their own ) , they must be confident in their ability to deal with any conceivable threat by conventional means . 
In this context , China should expect no diminution in the commitment of America &apos;s traditional allies in the region to that relationship , and to the US support that might be expected to continue to flow from it . 
And while the defense planning of others in the region assumes no malign intent by China , such planning must be conducted - as evident in Australia &apos;s recent Defence White Paper - with the capability of major regional players squarely in mind . 
Likewise , any aggression by China in pursuing its territorial claims , including on Taiwan , would be disastrous for its international credibility , for regional peace , and for the prosperity on which the country &apos;s internal stability is premised . 
In the South and East China Seas , competing sovereignty claims should optimally be litigated in the International Court of Justice ; failing that , they should be frozen , and arrangements for mutual access and joint resource exploitation peacefully negotiated . 
The region &apos;s messages to the US need to combine traditional sentiment with some equivalent hard-nosed realism . 
Our appreciation for the security support given to us in the past , and which we hope will continue in the future , remains undiminished . 
But , paradoxical as it might seem , the Asia / Pacific region &apos;s stability could well be put more at risk by America &apos;s continuing assertion of absolute primacy or dominance than by a more balanced distribution of conventional military power . 
The wisest single message that its regional allies and friends could now give the US is one that I heard former President Bill Clinton articulate in a private gathering in Los Angeles ten years ago : 
&quot; We can try to use our great and unprecedented military and economic power to try to stay top dog on the global block in perpetuity .... But a better choice would be for us to try to use that primacy to create a world in which we will be comfortable living when we are no longer top dog on the global block . &quot;
