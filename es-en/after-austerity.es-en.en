After Austerity 
NEW YORK - This year &apos;s annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund made clear that Europe and the international community remain rudderless when it comes to economic policy . 
Financial leaders , from finance ministers to leaders of private financial institutions , reiterated the current mantra : the crisis countries have to get their houses in order , reduce their deficits , bring down their national debts , undertake structural reforms , and promote growth . 
Confidence , it was repeatedly said , needs to be restored . 
It is a little precious to hear such pontifications from those who , at the helm of central banks , finance ministries , and private banks , steered the global financial system to the brink of ruin - and created the ongoing mess . 
Worse , seldom is it explained how to square the circle . 
How can confidence be restored as the crisis economies plunge into recession ? 
How can growth be revived when austerity will almost surely mean a further decrease in aggregate demand , sending output and employment even lower ? 
This we should know by now : markets on their own are not stable . 
Not only do they repeatedly generate destabilizing asset bubbles , but , when demand weakens , forces that exacerbate the downturn come into play . 
Unemployment , and fear that it will spread , drives down wages , incomes , and consumption - and thus total demand . 
Decreased rates of household formation - young Americans , for example , are increasingly moving back in with their parents - depress housing prices , leading to still more foreclosures . 
States with balanced-budget frameworks are forced to cut spending as tax revenues fall - an automatic destabilizer that Europe seems mindlessly bent on adopting . 
There are alternative strategies . 
Some countries , like Germany , have room for fiscal maneuver . 
Using it for investment would enhance long-term growth , with positive spillovers to the rest of Europe . 
A long-recognized principle is that balanced expansion of taxes and spending stimulates the economy ; if the program is well designed ( taxes at the top , combined with spending on education ) , the increase in GDP and employment can be significant . 
Europe as a whole is not in bad fiscal shape ; its debt-to-GDP ratio compares favorably with that of the United States . 
If each US state were totally responsible for its own budget , including paying all unemployment benefits , America , too , would be in fiscal crisis . 
The lesson is obvious : the whole is more than the sum of its parts . 
If Europe - particularly the European Central Bank - were to borrow , and re-lend the proceeds , the costs of servicing Europe &apos;s debt would fall , creating room for the kinds of expenditure that would promote growth and employment . 
There are already institutions within Europe , such as the European Investment Bank , that could help finance needed investments in the cash-starved economies . 
The EIB should expand its lending . 
There need to be increased funds available to support small and medium-size enterprises - the main source of job creation in all economies - which is especially important , given that credit contraction by banks hits these enterprises especially hard . 
Europe &apos;s single-minded focus on austerity is a result of a misdiagnosis of its problems . 
Greece overspent , but Spain and Ireland had fiscal surpluses and low debt-to-GDP ratios before the crisis . 
Giving lectures about fiscal prudence is beside the point . 
Taking the lectures seriously - even adopting tight budget frameworks - can be counterproductive . 
Regardless of whether Europe &apos;s problems are temporary or fundamental - the eurozone , for example , is far from an &quot; optimal &quot; currency area , and tax competition in a free-trade and free-migration area can erode a viable state - austerity will make matters worse . 
The consequences of Europe &apos;s rush to austerity will be long-lasting and possibly severe . 
If the euro survives , it will come at the price of high unemployment and enormous suffering , especially in the crisis countries . 
And the crisis itself almost surely will spread . 
Firewalls won &apos;t work , if kerosene is simultaneously thrown on the fire , as Europe seems committed to doing : there is no example of a large economy - and Europe is the world &apos;s largest - recovering as a result of austerity . 
As a result , society &apos;s most valuable asset , its human capital , is being wasted and even destroyed . 
Young people who are long deprived of a decent job - and youth unemployment in some countries is approaching or exceeding 50 % , and has been unacceptably high since 2008 - become alienated . 
When they eventually find work , it will be at a much lower wage . 
Normally , youth is a time when skills get built up ; now , it is a time when they atrophy . 
So many economies are vulnerable to natural disasters - earthquakes , floods , typhoons , hurricanes , tsunamis - that adding a man-made disaster is all the more tragic . 
But that is what Europe is doing . 
Indeed , its leaders &quot; willful ignorance of the lessons of the past is criminal . 
The pain that Europe , especially its poor and young , is suffering is unnecessary . 
Fortunately , there is an alternative . 
But delay in grasping it will be very costly , and Europe is running out of time .
