Listening to Arsonists 
BERKELEY - I had always thought that Barack Obama made a significant mistake in naming the Republican ex-senator Alan Simpson to co-chair the president &apos;s deficit-reduction commission . 
Simpson was a noted budget arsonist when he was in the Senate . 
Indeed , he never met a budget-busting , deficit-increasing initiative from a Republican president that he would not lead the charge to pass . 
Nor did he ever meet a sober deficit-reducing initiative from a Democratic president that he did not oppose with every fiber of his being . 
You don &apos;t pick an arsonist to head the fire department , I thought when Obama named him co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform . 
But perhaps I am ungenerous . 
Perhaps Simpson has had a change of heart . 
Perhaps he has traveled his own road to Damascus , come face-to-face with what he had done and who he was , repented , and wanted to repair some of the damage to America and its long-run economic growth prospects that he had caused . 
Even in that case , however , naming those who misbehave to important positions of high trust and acclaiming them as bipartisan statesmen gives the next generation really lousy incentives . 
And it &apos;s not as though Congressional Republicans think they owe enough to Simpson for him to swing a single vote in either chamber of the legislature . 
Obama officials assured me that Simpson had , indeed , had a change of heart ; that he was a smart man with a sophisticated understanding of the issues ; that he could sway reporters and get them to describe the commission &apos;s advice as &quot; bipartisan &quot; ( even though he could not sway actual legislators ) ; and that he would be a genuine asset to the substantive work of the commission . 
John Berry recently wrote in the online journal The Fiscal Times that not even that is true . 
Simpson is &quot; condescending and derisive - and wildly wrong about important parts of the Social Security system &apos;s past . &quot; 
Moreover , Simpson apparently does not understand that , as commission co-chair , his job is to build a broad coalition for necessary and mutually beneficial policy changes . 
Indeed , Berry reports that Simpson now believes that it would be unfair to use general revenues to pay for any portion of Social Security benefits . 
In other words , the large surplus in the Social Security trust fund , which is made up of government bonds that general revenues are earmarked to pay for , does not really exist and cannot be drawn upon . 
&quot; Simpson maintained , &quot; according to Berry , that &quot; Social Security is already insolvent because it is paying out more than it is getting in tax revenue . &quot; 
Never mind that the plan since 1983 has been for Social Security to tax more than it spends for a full generation and then use the built-up surpluses to spend more than it taxes . 
It &apos;s a bunch of IOUs , &quot; Berry reports Simpson as having said . 
&quot; Listen . 
Simpson is not making sense . 
All investments are IOUs . 
A General Electric bond is just that - a promise by the General Electric Company to pay its creditors . 
A dollar bill is an IOU from the government , just like a Social Security Trust Fund bond is . 
Perhaps the most bizarre of Simpson &apos;s claims that are quoted by Berry is that the Social Security Commission of 1983 &quot; never knew there was a baby boom .... &quot; 
The baby boom , of course , started immediately after World War II and peaked in 1960 . 
As Berry writes : &quot; Alan Greenspan , who headed ... &#91; that &#93; commission ... would tell Simpson something different . 
The big demographic shift that began right after World War II was precisely why ... taxes were raised and benefits were cut &#91; in 1983 &#93; - to build up a trust fund surplus so benefits could be paid . &quot; 
Four centuries ago , the consensus , in Western Europe at least , was that good and even adequate government in this fallen world was inevitably a rarity . 
Democracy always degenerated into mob rule , monarchy into tyranny , and aristocracy into oligarchy . 
Even when well run , democracy took little interest in the distant future , aristocracy took little interest in the well-being of those whom Simpson calls the &quot; little people , &quot; and monarchy took little interest in anything other than legitimate succession . 
Then , at the end of the eighteenth century , the founders of the United States of America and their intellectual successors claimed that this pessimism about government was unwarranted . 
&quot; The science of politics ... like most other sciences , &quot; claimed Alexander Hamilton , &quot; has received great improvement .... The regular distribution of power into distinct departments ... legislative balances and checks ... judges holding their offices during good behavior ; the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election ... are means , and powerful means , by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided ... &quot; 
Perhaps Hamilton was too much the optimist . 
When I look at Barack Obama &apos;s deficit commission - indeed , look at governance worldwide - I see many imperfections , but few or no examples of excellence .
