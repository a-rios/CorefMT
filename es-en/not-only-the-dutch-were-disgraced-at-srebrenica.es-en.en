Not Only The Dutch Were Disgraced at Srebrenica 
Atrocities cast long shadows . 
The Dutch government has resigned over the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 , which occurred when the supposedly &quot; safe &quot; enclave of Srebrenica , supposedly defended by a battalion of Dutch UN troops , surrendered to heavily armed Serb militias . 
The massacre of at least 7,000 Bosnian boys and men followed . 
The Dutch government of Premier Wim Kok resigned after a report that it had commissioned accused the government of 1995 ( also headed by Mr. Kok ) of acting irresponsibly in underestimating the threats faced by Dutch peacekeepers . 
It is , of course , an honorable act for a government to take responsibility for so grave a failing and resign . 
Too few governments or politicians ever accept this debt to honor . 
But the resignation of the Kok government does not deal with the disgrace of Srebrenica . 
It only underlines the fact that the international community still has scores to settle with the largest massacre on European soil in the last half century . 
What we should have seen in The Hague was not only the resignation of a Dutch government - but more importantly the appearance of General Ratko Mladic and his accomplices to face the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia . 
So long as these men remain at large , the shame over Srebrenica will stick to the international community . 
Most people remember the televised images of General Mladic humiliating the Dutch commander of the &quot; safe &quot; Srebrenica enclave , Colonel Ton Karremans , offering him drinks and gifts for his family . 
Then the Dutch peacekeepers were sent on their way , as were women and children . 
Only the men and the boys remained , to be slaughtered . 
I retain not only these images forever in my head , but also the sights and smells of thousands of decayed corpses stacked in two mine tunnels near Tuzla . 
They were picked up from the mass graves that appeared around Srebrenica . 
They were in Tuzla awaiting the long and laborious process of identifying the remains . 
Many of Srebrenica &apos;s survivors were clinging to the desperate hope that a missing husband or son might still be alive in a remote camp . 
They needed to know what had happened before they could try to get on with their lives . 
After the Dayton Agreement of Bosnia an International Commission on Missing Persons ( ICMP ) was established to clarify what had happened to the more than 20,000 persons missing from the civil war in Bosnia . 
Another 10,000 missing were later added to this remit from Kosovo . 
That task seemed overwhelming . 
New DNA technology , combined with computer programs that match the findings with DNA from bereaved relatives , has led to increasing numbers of identifications . 
Every day names can be put on the anonymous body bags , and a decent burial can take place . 
Now survivors at least know that the dead are dead . 
So this sad chapter of Srebrenica is finally being told . 
But we still need to bring those who committed the crime to account . 
It is totally unacceptable that people like Ratko Mladic remain at large . 
The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( FRY ) could seize and extradite them - if it wished to . 
Until now it has not . 
The FRY wants to integrate with the Euro-Atlantic community . 
It pursues three goals : accession to the Council of Europe , membership in NATO &apos;s Partnership for Peace , and a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union . 
But the international community must hold the FRY to the same high standards for inclusion in intergovernmental structures that have been rightly required of Croatia and Bosnia since 1996 . 
So long as General Mladic and his henchmen do not join Mr. Milosevic in The Hague , we cannot believe that the FRY really belongs in the company of democratic European states in respect to the rule of law . 
If the FRY is not confronted with the same demands others had to meet , this will only strengthen obstructionist forces within Serbia and undermine the security of Serbia &apos;s neighbours . 
Membership in the international community cannot be given away at a discount .
