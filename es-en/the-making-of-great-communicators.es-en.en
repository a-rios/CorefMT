The Making of Great Communicators 
CAMBRIDGE - Perhaps the most impressive current example of leadership based on the ability to communicate is Barack Obama , who has given three times as many interviews as George W. Bush and held four times as many prime press conferences as Bill Clinton at this stage in their presidencies . 
Some critics are now wondering if all this talking is too much of a good thing . 
All inspirational leaders communicate effectively . 
Winston Churchill often attributed his success to his mastery of the English sentence . 
The ancient Greeks had schools of rhetoric to hone their skills for the assembly . 
Cicero made his mark in the Roman Senate after studying oratory . 
Good rhetorical skills help to generate soft power . 
Woodrow Wilson was not a gifted student as a child , but he taught himself oratory because he regarded it as essential for leadership . 
Martin Luther King , Jr. benefited from growing up in an African-American church tradition rich in the rhythms of the spoken word . 
Clinton was able to combine a sense of theater with narrative stories and an overall ability to convey an argument . 
According to his staff , he developed and improved this gradually over his career . 
Oratory and inspirational rhetoric , however , are not the only forms of communication with which leaders frame issues and create meaning for their followers . 
Alan Greenspan , the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , was hardly an inspirational speaker , but markets and politicians hung on his every word , and he tailored the nuances of his language to reinforce the direction in which he wanted to lead monetary policy . 
Unfortunately , as the financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated , it would have been better if Congressional committees had pressed him to communicate more clearly . 
Non-verbal signals are also an important component of human communications . 
Symbols and examples can be very effective . 
Some inspirational leaders are not great orators - witness Mahatma Gandhi . 
But the symbolism of Gandhi &apos;s simple dress and lifestyle spoke louder than words . 
If one compares those images with pictures of the young insecure Gandhi dressed as a proper British lawyer , one can see how carefully he understood symbolic communication . 
He ensured that actions such as the famous 1930 salt march to the sea maintained a slow pace that allowed the drama and tension to build . 
The march was designed for communication , not the ostensible reason of resisting the colonial government &apos;s prohibition on the fabrication of salt . 
T.E. Lawrence ( &quot; Lawrence of Arabia &quot; ) also understood how to communicate with symbols . 
When he went to the Paris Peace Conference at World War I &apos;s end , he wore Bedouin robes to dramatize the Arab cause . 
A year later , at a Cairo conference that negotiated borders in the region , he changed to a British officer &apos;s uniform as he engaged in hard transactional bargaining . 
Or , to take a contemporary example , the British entrepreneur Richard Branson overcame dyslexia and poor academic performance by using events and public stunts to promote his Virgin brands . 
In addition to communicating with distant audiences , leaders need the ability to communicate one-on-one or in small groups . 
In some cases , that close communication is more important than public rhetoric . 
Organizational skills - the ability to attract and inspire an effective inner circle of followers - can compensate for rhetorical deficiencies , just as effective public rhetoric can partly compensate for low organizational skills . 
Hitler was skillful at communicating with both distant and inner-circle audiences . 
Stalin relied primarily on the latter . 
Harry Truman was a modest orator , but compensated by attracting and ably managing a stellar set of advisers . 
A good narrative is a great source of soft power , and the first rule that fiction writers learn about good narrative is to &quot; show , not tell . &quot; 
Franklin Roosevelt used the fictional story of lending a garden hose to a neighbor whose house was on fire to explain his complex lend-lease program to the American people before World War II . 
Ronald Reagan was a master of the well selected anecdote . 
Setting the right example is another crucial form of communication for leaders . 
Anticipating a skeptical public reaction when Singapore raised the salaries of government officials in 2007 , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that he would forgo the raise himself . 
In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis , some business executives voluntarily reduced their salaries as a means of communicating concern for their employees and public opinion . 
During the 2008 presidential election campaign , Obama proved to be a talented communicator . 
Not only was his rhetorical style effective , but after inflammatory comments by his pastor threatened to derail his campaign , he produced one of the best speeches on race in America since the days of King . 
As president , Obama continues to communicate effectively , but an American president has a problem of dual audiences . 
Sometimes rhetoric that fares well at home - such as Bush &apos;s second inaugural address - sounds hypocritical to foreign ears . 
In contrast , Obama &apos;s inaugural address was well received both at home and abroad . 
In a series of foreign-policy speeches , most notably one delivered in Cairo and addressed to the Muslim world , polls show that Obama has been able to restore some of America &apos;s soft power . 
So far , so good , but effective leadership is also communicated by actions and policies . 
At this stage , it is too early to determine whether Obama &apos;s policies will reinforce or undercut the effects of his words . 
As we await the results , it helps to remember the complexity of the relation between effective leadership and communications .
