Limiting the Security Council Veto 
PARIS - Back in 2001 , France floated a proposal that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ( P5 ) should voluntarily refrain from using their veto power when dealing with mass-atrocity crimes . 
And now , in the lead-up to the commemoration of this year &apos;s 70th anniversary of the UN , French President Fran√ßois Hollande &apos;s government is actively pursuing the idea again . 
Could such an arrangement really work ? 
The predictable initial response is to dismiss the possibility out of hand . 
As Australia &apos;s wartime prime minister , Ben Chifley , once famously remarked , &quot; The trouble with gentleman &apos;s agreements is that there aren &apos;t enough bloody gentlemen . &quot; 
It is indeed hard to believe that Russia and China , in particular , would be accommodating . 
Russia , for example , has exercised vetoes more than 100 times since 1946 , most recently - and unhappily - four times since 2011 to block resolutions intended to halt the carnage in Syria . 
Nor has the United States , which has used its veto some 80 times ( most frequently , in recent years , on Israel-related issues ) , shown much enthusiasm , notwithstanding its generally strong stand on genocide and related cases . 
Only the United Kingdom ( which , like France itself , last resorted to the veto in 1989 ) has given any hint of support for the French initiative . 
The right to veto was the price demanded by China , France , Great Britain , Russia , and the US for joining the UN . 
No one believes that a formal Charter amendment to abolish or limit this right is remotely likely . 
But international pressure on the P5 has been mounting for the last 15 years - and especially since the General Assembly &apos;s unanimous embrace in 2005 of the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; ( R2P ) principle . 
Advocates of the French position want these countries to forswear their veto when a clear majority supports proposed action to mitigate the risk of a mass-atrocity crime . 
Distaste for the blocking of the Syrian resolutions has been particularly intense , and , at last count , 68 countries had given explicit support to the French proposal in various UN forums . 
The moral argument that the veto should not be used in cases of mass-atrocity crimes is overwhelming . 
The P5 have obligations under the UN Charter , as well as international humanitarian and human rights law , not to undermine the effectiveness of the UN or that body of law . 
And the political argument against using the veto in these situations - that it jeopardizes the credibility and legitimacy of the Security Council , whose structure is already seen as not reflecting the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century - should also weigh heavily on the P5 . 
But is it possible to craft a veto-restraint proposal to which all of the P5 can agree ? 
In January , at a conference I attended in Paris that brought together French policymakers and international experts , it became clear that a draft agreement could meet most , if not all , objections . 
But it would need to have at least three key elements . 
First , the agreement would have to define the relevant cases clearly - neither too widely nor too narrowly - and build on well-established R2P language . 
The definition might be something like &quot; situations where populations are suffering , or at imminent risk of , genocide , other crimes against humanity , or major war crimes . &quot; 
Second , an agreement would need to include a mechanism to determine when such cases had actually arisen . 
This would need to be speedy , provide some assurance of objective assessment , and ideally generate strong concern across a wide cross-section of the international community . 
One way to meet these needs would be to have a double trigger . 
The first requirement would be a certification , communicated to the Security Council by the UN Secretary-General and his Office of Special Advisers on the Prevention of Genocide and R2P ( which has the necessary resources , expertise , and credibility ) that the case meets the agreed definition . 
The other would be a request for veto-restraint by at least 50 member states , including at least five members from each of the recognized geographical groupings . 
A third key element , unattractive ethically but probably necessary politically to win the support of the US and others , would be a provision allowing any P5 member to veto when it claimed a &quot; vital national interest &quot; to be at stake . 
The consolation is that trying to rely on such an escape clause in most atrocity cases would not pass the laugh test . 
Could Russia and China really have used it to veto Security Council resolutions on Myanmar and Zimbabwe in , respectively , 2007 and 2008 ? 
Even given the intensity of Russia &apos;s political and military relationship with Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime in Syria , could it really claim that a resolution would place its own vital interests at risk ? 
Many kinds of pushback can be expected , not least the argument that the veto exists not to protect the P5 &quot; s interests , but to ensure unanimity of the major players ( conspicuously missing in the UN &apos;s ill-fated predecessor , the League of Nations ) in any action undertaken , in order to maintain international peace and security . 
We will be told that it is unconscionable to ask a P5 member to forgo a veto when it genuinely believes that a proposed resolution will cause more harm than good . 
One response is that it is almost impossible to find any such genuinely high-minded rationale for any veto ever cast in a mass-atrocity situation . 
Another is that any UN Security Council resolution requires at least nine affirmative votes ( in a Council of 15 ) . 
If there are genuine concerns on the merits , that requirement will prove a very high bar . 
The point of the veto restraint is , at minimum , to raise the political cost for those who would block action designed to ensure that there are no more Cambodias , Rwandas , Srebrenicas , or Syrias . 
The French proposal , though still evolving , has already struck a responsive chord internationally . 
The other P5 members will ignore it at their peril .
