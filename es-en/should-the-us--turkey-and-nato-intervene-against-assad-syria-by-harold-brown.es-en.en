Hands Off Syria ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - More than any of the previous events in the Arab Spring , Syria &apos;s turmoil has presented serious difficulties for Western policymakers . 
Just as Syria comprises a more complex society than the other Arab countries currently in the throes of political transition , so , too , are its external relations more complex . 
As a result , any attempt at decisive military intervention would be not only difficult , but also extremely risky . 
Syria &apos;s leading role in Lebanon , even after withdrawing its occupying forces there , is only one complication . 
Another is Alawite-minority rule in a Sunni-majority country , which makes Syria a proxy for Shia Iran in the Sunni Arab world . 
Still other Syrian minority groups - non-Alawite Shia , Orthodox and Catholic Christians , and Druze - are linked to neighboring countries and regional players , inviting intense external interest and even active support . 
Turkey , Saudi Arabia , and Russia all have strategic interests and factional connections to Syria . 
The United States and its NATO allies would , of course , prefer a democratic , Western-oriented regime to emerge in Syria . 
But , given the country &apos;s complex society and external ties , the West should happily settle for a stable government not dominated by Russia or Iran , and not in military conflict with its neighbors , including Israel . 
So what is the best US and Western policy ? 
A negotiated end to the current warfare could leave President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime in power , albeit with a different face in charge . 
Such an outcome would be a triumph for the cause of hardline dictatorship , suppression of human rights , and Iran and Russia . 
But it also becomes less feasible as the violence mounts . 
That leaves supporting the rebels , but which ones , and how ? 
Yet another factor militating against intervention is that the distribution of power resulting from the Arab Spring is leaving the US with limited influence and little intelligence . 
But the US and the West cannot leave the matter entirely to others or confine their efforts to the United Nations , where Russia and China prevent any effective action . 
So , what should be done ? 
In my view , the US could work with Turkey , Saudi Arabia ( taking care not to support Islamic extremists ) , and its NATO allies , especially France and Britain , to create a prospective successor government for Syria , and to arm its military element . 
Such a government would have to be representative and coherent . 
And Western powers would need to be sure that their weapons would not fall into potentially unfriendly hands . 
The fact that Iran is arming the Assad regime calls for countervailing action . 
Some have suggested a more active military role for the US , beginning with a no-fly zone . 
It may come to that . 
But the French and British , who urged that course in Libya , have made no such proposal for Syria . 
One reason is that Syria has a substantial air-defense system , which would have to be suppressed by a bombing campaign - causing significant civilian casualties and risking the loss of aircraft and crews . 
Before starting down that road , the US should be convinced that military action would not require US ground forces in Syria . 
It should also be confident ( which is impossible now ) about the nature of a successor government . 
To meet these criteria would require convening interested countries in order to gain greater insight into both internal Syrian and regional implications of military action . 
The attention devoted to the Syrian issue during the &quot; non-aligned &quot; countries &quot; recent Tehran summit was a parody of such an exercise . 
Holding such a conference is easier said than done . 
Merely finalizing the guest list would be a major diplomatic feat . 
Surely , Turkey , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Iraq must be invited . 
Russia , the US , and perhaps France and Britain should be present as well . 
But to omit a neighbor like Israel , a Syrian client like Lebanon , or a patron like Iran would be peculiar - and inviting all of them would be a formula for chaos . 
The uprising in Syria , the most violent of the Arab Spring rebellions , is playing out slowly and lethally . 
The estimated 10,000 deaths over the last 18 months equal the number killed in just a few days in 1982 in the city of Hama by Assad &apos;s father , Hafez al-Assad , whose scorched-earth policy strengthened his hold on power and incurred only rhetorical condemnation from the international community . 
The repercussions are likely to be all the more disruptive when , sooner or later , the regime falls . 
The Assads , like other authoritarian Arab leaders , kept a lid on internal violence and their own citizens &quot; aspirations . 
But the sheer complexity of conditions in Syria means that the regime &apos;s endgame could trigger a transition unlike any other in the Arab Spring , different in both its domestic course and in its effects on the region . 
Diplomats make careers of finding procedural solutions to insoluble dilemmas ; surely , they hope , there is a conference table with a shape that matches a given strategic configuration . 
So far , the US has handled the various forms of political transition in the Arab Spring without severely damaging missteps . 
Syria poses the toughest challenge yet .
