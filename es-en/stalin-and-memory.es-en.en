Stalin and Memory 
&quot; The duty we owe to history is to rewrite it , &quot; said Oscar Wilde . 
As a Russian , I am familiar with rewriting history . 
The Soviet Union spent a century touching up the warts on Lenin &apos;s nose , revising harvest statistics , and making the dying Yuri Andropov look less cadaverous . 
But in dealing with Stalin - dead 50 years today -  most of us now rewrite history by pretending that a chunk of it never happened . 
Don &apos;t get me wrong : Stalin has not disappeared like people sent to the gulag . 
He has not been blotted from our memories the way Trotsky and Bukharin were cropped out of official photographs . 
Once , as I was getting out of a Moscow taxicab , the driver lifted his scarf to show a Stalin photograph pinned to his jacket . 
I thought about this sly gesture . 
He seemed to represent a true underground , someone who felt shocked and betrayed by the world that arose out of Gorbachev &apos;s glastnost and perestroika . 
But clinging to the past uncritically is probably better than allowing the past to dominate the present . 
After all , it was history that incited Yugoslavs to turn their corner of Europe into a medieval slaughterhouse of rape , pillage , and siege . 
On June 28 th , 1989 , St Vitus &apos;s Day , while most Eastern Europeans were daring to dream of a non-communist future , a million Serbs prepared to leap into the past with Slobodan Milosevic , descending on the Field of Blackbirds in Kosovo to mark the 600th anniversary of Serbia &apos;s defeat by the Turks . 
History , of course , is not some medicine with a label cautioning about the proper dosage . 
History is what gives nations their character , their institutions , their identity . 
It can be misread or misused , but never rationed . 
Milosevic did not give the Serbs an overdose of history ; he simply administered it as they imagined it , undiluted by criticism . 
Plainly , the best thing is to confront history - and oneself - forthrightly , and to draw the most honest conclusions . 
But what are the right conclusions when you are dealing with history as bloodstained and corrupting as Stalin &apos;s era ? 
Some are ready to look at the past with an open mind , in pursuit , if you will , of self-improvement . 
Others are more concerned to use it to justify failure or even aggression ; this is history as self-pity . 
Still others indulge in simple self-delusion . 
Self-improvers are the rarest . 
Recently , only Germany , or rather West Germany , unambiguously confronted its past in order to remake itself . 
It took the enormity of the Holocaust to bring about the necessary self-examination . 
Anything less terrible might not have been enough . 
For Russians , long split between Slavophiles and westernizers , victimhood vies against self-examination where history is concerned . 
In 1989 and 1990 , as communism collapsed and glasnost took hold , many Russians hungrily sought the &quot; facts . &quot; 
What caused the famines of the 1930 &apos;s and were they planned ? 
How many people died in the purges ? 
What did Khrushchev actually say about Stalin in his secret speech of 1956 ? 
Historical facts became front-page news . 
For others , the demise of the political system meant the end not merely of the only historical narrative they knew , but of an empire and a sense of national identity as well . 
Into that void stepped right-wing politicians and historians portraying Russians as the victims of a &quot; false culture , &quot; with foreigners responsible for all problems . 
Many now find it difficult to know what to make of seven decades of communism . 
More have given up trying . 
It will never be easy to produce a version of Russian history that all Russians agree on ; competing conceptions of national identity militate against it . 
But some other countries sloughing off the skin of communism are only too ready to adopt a new history - even one based on fancy and invention - to suit current needs . 
Ukraine provides an example of this . 
Does Ukraine have a history ? 
Well , the place certainly does , but is the place a country ? 
Ukraine means , literally , &quot; on the edge . &quot; 
It is more a frontier than a region , let alone a country . 
So it is well suited to an invented history - and who better to supply it than a Ukrainian Diaspora eager to boost the land of their forefathers ? 
It may be no accident that independent Ukraine &apos;s first history textbook was written in Toronto , not Kiev . 
So far , Russia , a country of little moderation , has alternated between rampant discussion or absolute silence and self-deception about Stalin . 
These swings keep many people ( not only the elderly ) voting communist . 
German Gref , Russia &apos;s young minister of Trade and Economics , responded to a sympathetic question about his parents being prisoners in the Gulag by saying , &quot; So what , all were prisoners then . &quot; 
In truth , few people other than the Germans are ready to be honest in their Vergangenheitsbew√§ltigung , their coming to terms with the past . 
Most others dwell on the laudable , suppress the inglorious , and embellish the rest - or else pretend that the past doesn &apos;t exist at all . 
Before succumbing to pessimism , however , there is something else to consider . 
Although it is impossible to have too much history , it is possible to spend too much time looking into it . 
For like the past , the future also needs to be written . 
If Russians are silent about Stalin , it may be because we are busy writing that history of the future .
