Unleashing Africa &apos;s Girl Power 
MAPUTO - Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s economies have boomed in recent years . 
But the headline figures often mask longer-term problems - not least , an over-reliance on natural resources and chronic inequalities . 
Inclusive , sustainable growth is achievable , but only by tapping the continent &apos;s greatest reserve of energy and creativity : African women and girls . 
Health and development experts , economists , non-governmental organizations , United Nations agencies , and banks agree that the key to unlocking Africa &apos;s potential lies in expanding women &apos;s education , freedom , and job opportunities . 
Today , many African women are not only expected to fulfill traditional roles , such as raising children and caring for the elderly ; they also face legal and social discrimination regarding land and property ownership , inheritance , education , and access to credit and technology - in addition to oppressive sexual mores and violence . 
Yet gender equality is necessary for the continent &apos;s well-being . 
Consider the pressing issue of food security . 
Women comprise half of the agriculture sector &apos;s workforce , growing , selling , buying , and preparing food for their families . 
Studies suggest that equal access to resources would increase farm yields by 20-30 % , offsetting the effects of drought and climate change . 
Access to education , capital , markets , and technologies would allow women to process , package , and market their products , especially for Africa &apos;s growing middle class , bolstering both earnings and food supplies . 
Agriculture is but one example . 
Greater female participation in male-dominated occupations across the board would increase overall labor productivity by up to 25 % . 
The same is true of politics , where more female participation and leadership would improve governance and public services , as promising experiences in some parts of Africa and elsewhere have shown . 
The first step to improving conditions for women must be to strengthen their sexual and reproductive health and rights - an issue concerning which Africa has some of the world &apos;s worst indicators . 
Simply put , women must be allowed to decide , free of coercion or violence , about their sexuality and health ; if , when , and whom to marry ; and whether and when to become a parent . 
This cannot happen without providing women and girls with the information , education , and services they need to make their own decisions . 
Sexual and reproductive health issues exact a huge yet largely avoidable toll on African women , their families , and communities . 
The costs usually strike in the prime of women &apos;s economically productive lives , devaluing their future contributions to society . 
At the extreme , more than 400 African women and girls die every day during pregnancy or childbirth , scarring families and plunging surviving children into hardship . 
Many of these deaths are caused by the estimated five million unsafe abortions carried out annually in Sub-Saharan Africa . 
The cost to society in lost income from death and disability is nearly $ 1 billion . 
Almost all of these deaths occur in countries with restrictive abortion laws , which African leaders should consider reforming as a matter of common sense and social justice . 
A prime focus should be on protecting the most vulnerable - adolescent girls . 
More than one-third of African girls marry before the age of 18 , which threatens their health , truncates their education , and lowers their aspirations for the future . 
They are also more likely than older women to die of birth-related complications , and are more prone to abuse . 
Though most African states outlaw early or forced marriages , enforcement is weak . 
African girls are also disproportionately vulnerable to contracting HIV . 
Roughly 90 % of the world &apos;s pregnant women and children with HIV live in Africa , and , despite notable recent reductions in HIV transmission rates , adolescent girls are still more than twice as likely as boys of the same age to carry the virus . 
Yet barely a third of young Africans know how to prevent HIV - another reason for urgent and comprehensive sexuality education . 
Another epidemic afflicting African women is violence , all too often perpetrated with impunity . 
Sexual violence is used as a tactic of war . 
But it is also a disturbing feature of home life ; 37 % of African women report having been abused by their partner . 
In the case of female genital mutilation and child marriage , such violence is culturally sanctioned . 
We must change laws , judicial systems , and attitudes that exonerate the perpetrators , and we must provide help to victims . 
Attitudes can change . 
Contraception , for example , was once a contentious issue . 
Today , most African leaders accept it as an important , cost-effective investment and as part of their countries &quot; economic-development strategies . 
Basic family planning in 16 Sub-Saharan countries could save more than $ 1 billion in education costs alone . 
The number of maternal deaths could fall by one-third , saving millions ( in developing countries overall , maternal and new-born health-care savings could reach $ 5.7 billion ) . 
However , the sad reality is that , despite support from various development partners and donors , assistance for reproductive health care and family planning fell by half in the last decade . 
The compounding benefits of ending legal , economic , and gender discrimination are vast . 
Healthier , wealthier , and better-educated women tend to produce healthier , wealthier , and better-educated families , because women typically invest more of their earnings than men do in their children &apos;s wellbeing . 
With the continent &apos;s population forecast to double by 2050 , there is hardly a better time to invest in women and girls . 
It is as much an economic as an ethical argument .
