China &apos;s Losing Battle Against Corruption 
China &apos;s rulers rarely wash their dirty linen in public . 
Some speculate that the arrest is really part of a power struggle , with President Hu Jingtao demonstrating his authority against a local power broker who had thwarted national policy . 
Whatever the truth behind Chen &apos;s fall , and despite the widening corruption probe of other senior government officials , data and evidence recently released by the government and multilateral institutions suggest that the authorities are fighting a rearguard battle against a rising tide of graft . 
Consider the grim statistics recently released by the Supreme People &apos;s Procuratorate ( SPP ) . 
More than 42,000 government officials on average were investigated for corruption every year from 2002 to 2005 , with more than 30,000 per year facing criminal charges . 
These startling figures do not include economic crimes outside the public sector . 
For example , in 2005 alone , the China Banking Regulatory Commission ( CBRC ) unearthed irregularities involving misused funds of RMB767.1 billion ( $ 93.7 billion ) . 
The CBRC uncovered 1,272 criminal cases and disciplined 6,826 bank employees ( including 325 senior managers ) . 
According to Ye Feng , a SPP Director-General , &quot; &#91; a &#93; lmost every type of financial institution has seen the emergence of criminal cases involving the solicitation of bribes in return for loans . &quot; 
Despite the government &apos;s intermittent anti-corruption campaigns , progress has been slow . 
On the contrary , as Ye has candidly acknowledged , the number of corruption cases &quot; has continued to rise . &quot; 
Indeed , international measures of graft show that the authorities may be reaching a stalemate or even retreating in the fight . 
Transparency International &apos;s Corruption Perception Index , the most widely-used benchmark to gauge businessmen &apos;s and experts &quot; beliefs about the extent of corruption in various countries , ranked China 78th out of 158 countries in 2005 - not much improvement from 2000 . 
Indeed , among the World Bank &apos;s six &quot; Governance Indicators , &quot; China &apos;s scores on the &quot; Control of Corruption &quot; index have actually slipped in recent years , from -0.20 in 1998 to -0.40 in 2002 and -0.69 in 2005 . 
In 2005 , the World Bank ranked China 142nd out of 204 countries on the &quot; Control of Corruption &quot; index . 
While the economic toll of graft cannot be precisely quantified , indirect evidence suggests that the costs are significant . 
Multinational executives frequently cite China as their favorite investment destination , but many of them also complain about rampant graft . 
According to the World Bank &apos;s &quot; Investment Climate Surveys , &quot; 27 % of nearly 4,000 firms doing business in China in 2002-03 described corruption as a &quot; major constraint &quot; on their commercial operations , while 55 % reported that they had paid bribes to government bureaucrats and / or local business partners to get things done . 
Likewise , Hu Angang , an economics professor at Beijing &apos;s Tsinghua University , has estimated that corruption in 1999-2001 alone caused economic losses worth RMB1,293 billion ( $ 156 billion ) , or 13.2 % of GDP . 
Not surprisingly , the financial services sector suffered the most from corruption , losing RMB547 billion ( 6.25 % of GDP ) . 
Fraudulent public expenditure cost 2.4 % of GDP , siphoning off privatization proceeds amounted to almost 2.1 % of GDP , and smuggling caused losses of more than 1.1 % of GDP . 
The Chinese government has neither censored nor refuted Hu &apos;s dreadful findings . 
The biggest obstacle to fighting graft is the weakness of the judiciary , especially at sub-national levels . 
Since most government corruption occurs at the county , township and village levels , it usually involves abuses of power by local officials . 
However , since these petty bureaucrats &quot; power is almost absolute , they also control the channels for addressing grievances . 
Indeed , among the World Bank &apos;s six &quot; Governance Indicators , &quot; China &apos;s score on the &quot; Rule of Law &quot; index has also slid in recent years , from -0.28 in 1998 to -0.47 in 2005 , when China ranked 124th out of 208 countries in this category . 
With little recourse to legal means , an increasing number of frustrated victims of graft resort to extra-legal measures such as strikes , demonstrations , and sit-ins in order to gain media and public attention . 
Some even carry their fights to the provincial and central authorities , stoking a sharp rise in the incidents of &quot; public order disturbances &quot; nation-wide . 
Whereas the Ministry of Public Security reported only 8,700 such disturbances in 1993 , by 2005 the number had jumped ten-fold , to 87,000 . 
Needless to say , government mishandling of such disturbances , or a decision to repress them with force , would only fuel further social discontent . 
In fact , the government &apos;s success in clamping down on corruption , especially at sub-national levels , will be a litmus test of its legitimacy . 
To fail would risk igniting a severe political backlash , including a spontaneous escalation of anti-regime activities .
