Musharraf &apos;s Ambiguous Legacy 
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf &apos;s resignation brings to an end one of the more interesting curiosities of subcontinental politics : for more than four years , Pakistan had a president who was born in India , while India had a Prime Minister ( Manmohan Singh ) who was born in Pakistan . 
Since the two countries &quot; separation is now more than six decades old , that anomaly is unlikely to be repeated . 
But it is not the only reason Indians are greeting Musharraf &apos;s exit with mixed feelings . 
Musharraf was someone who was easy to hate across the border . 
He had , after all , risen to the top of the military on the back of the Pakistani army &apos;s Islamist elements , who came into their own ( in what had previously been a rather Anglophile , British- and American-trained officer corps ) during the decade-long reign of a fundamentalist military ruler , General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq . 
Indeed , though Musharraf displayed an urbane image , enjoyed his Scotch , and admired Turkey , he was not one of the Pakistani secularists so admired by Indian liberals . 
Instead , he cultivated a reputation as an anti-Indian hardliner . 
The fact that his family had fled India upon Partition gave him an additional chip on his shoulder : it was widely said that he saw relations with India as a series of opportunities to wreak vengeance for what his family had suffered in the refugee upheavals of 1947 . 
As Chief of the Army Staff , Musharraf directed the disastrous Kargil invasion of 1999 , when Pakistan sent its soldiers surreptitiously across the cease-fire lines to capture strategically vital heights overlooking a key Indian road . 
Musharraf was recorded by Indian intelligence boasting about the action on an open telephone line during a visit to Beijing . 
Because the invasion was manifestly illegal and provocative , Pakistan denied that official soldiers were involved , with the result that when they were repulsed , at great cost to both sides , Musharraf refused to accept his own soldiers &quot; bodies . 
It was a low point in Indo-Pakistan relations , and no one in Delhi was prepared to trust Musharraf ever again . 
Within months , however , Musharraf had conducted a coup against the hapless Nawaz Sharif , and a year later declared himself president , a title meant to enhance his stature when he visited India for peace talks in July 2001 . 
But Musharraf had come to power as the patron of the jihadi s his army was financing , equipping , and training for their forays into Indian territory , and few in New Delhi thought genuine peace could be made with such a duplicitous man . 
Then came 9 / 11 , when - under intense pressure from the United States to support American retaliation in Afghanistan or face the consequences - he was forced to disown his protégés . 
The Taliban , under whose rule Osama bin Laden had found a safe haven , had been created ( and , in crucial battles , led ) by Pakistan &apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) . 
Now , Musharraf , in order to preserve his country &apos;s alliance with the world &apos;s sole superpower ( and his country &apos;s largest donor ) , had to betray his own . 
For at least two years , though , Musharraf tried to have it both ways , cracking down at America &apos;s behest on the Islamists on Pakistan &apos;s western border with Afghanistan while sponsoring them on the eastern border with India . 
A Pakistani-sponsored jihadi attack on India &apos;s Parliament in December 2001 nearly provoked all-out war . 
But the double game proved unsustainable : the Islamists were less inclined than their now-ambivalent patron to draw sophistical distinctions between one kind of enemy and another . 
The result was two assassination attempts against Musharraf in December 2003 . 
If Musharraf had previously been unwilling to choose sides , the attempts to kill him finally showed him which side he had to be on . 
From then on , Musharraf seems genuinely to have tried to clamp down on the Frankenstein &apos;s monster that he had sustained as an instrument of Pakistani policy . 
For roughly four years , he represented the best that the West and India could hope for in a Pakistani leader - someone with military authority , who seemed convinced that his own survival , and the interests of his state , demanded a clampdown on terrorism . 
It could not last indefinitely . 
The first problems arose in the lawless &quot; federally administered tribal areas &quot; ( FATA ) in western Pakistan . 
Musharraf , concerned at all costs to avoid any military action that might provoke a tribal rebellion against his forces , tried to buy himself more political space by cutting deals with insurgent leaders in the FATA , signing peace agreements with the very chiefs his army should have been pursuing . 
Meanwhile , internal difficulties worsened . 
As anti-Musharraf sentiment grew within Pakistan , and repressive measures aimed at the judiciary and the press cost him ever more support among the intelligentsia , his hold on power began to slip . 
His effort to cut a deal with Benazir Bhutto was a final attempt to remain in office through the election of a civilian leader acceptable to the public ( and the West ) . 
Her assassination by Islamist elements foreclosed that option . 
Musharraf &apos;s fraying authority made him less effective and , indeed , less useful : the Taliban re-emerged in strength on Pakistan &apos;s Afghan border , and his own ISI was proved to have been involved in the bombing of India &apos;s embassy in Kabul . 
By the summer of 2008 , both the West and India were facing a Pakistan again in the grip of chaos , its border areas in Islamist hands and its ISI out of the control of the elected civilian government . 
The prospects of an implosion of effective governmental authority in Pakistan are strong , and the consequences would be dire . 
But , by the time Musharraf resigned , he had already lost the ability to do anything about it .
