From Lady Di to Michelle Obama 
NEW YORK- In one week , Michelle Obama sat for a formal White House portrait , dressed in somber , tailored clothes ; posed for a snazzy People magazine cover , dressed in a slightly down-market , hot-pink lace outfit that showed plenty of skin ; let the national media know that the First Family would be getting its new puppy from a rescue shelter ; and had her press office mention casually that &quot; secretaries and policy makers &quot; had been invited for popcorn and movies at the White House . 
That same week , in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the 1930 &quot; s , a national poll found that support for President Barack Obama was remarkably high , with respondents consistently saying that he &quot; cares about people like me . &quot; 
These two phenomena are closely related . 
Almost from her first appearance in the public eye , Michelle Obama has used clothing , etiquette , and such cues as where she shops and entertains to send out a subtle but radical message to American voters and to the world . 
For the first time since the days of Andrew Jackson , the White House is aggressively &quot; democratizing &quot; the highest office in the land , and symbolically inviting in the common man - and now the common woman . 
In other words , Mrs. Obama is managing to set herself up , unprecedentedly , as the &quot; people &apos;s First Lady . &quot; 
She has carefully studied not only Jackie Kennedy - a comparison obvious from her sheath dresses , boat collars , and page-boy haircut - but also the triumphs and failures of that other glamorous but underestimated stealth radical , Princess Diana . 
Princess Di &apos;s legacy in generating iconography that opened the way to tremendous social change is grossly underappreciated . 
In her brief lifetime , she was often lauded for qualities ( her beauty and style ) that were secondary to her life &apos;s work , and derided for other aspects of her character ( her emotionality and chaotic personal life ) that were equally beside the point . 
As a result , few people noticed how genuinely , powerfully transformative her agenda was , how well she had thought it out , and how audaciously she sought to manage it . 
Without a formal education , Diana self-consciously set about pushing open the doors of an encrusted monarchy , challenging the sanctities of a long-established class structure , and affirming the value and immediacy of a Britain that was more diverse and socially mobile than ever before . 
Sometimes her efforts were heavy-handed , as when she embraced AIDS victims physically as a metaphor for social inclusion ; sometimes they backfired , as when her shared intimacies with servants provided fodder for a flood of posthumous tell-all books . 
But , again and again , by showing up for Elton John and not just for the ballet , or by taking her sons away from the hunting preserve of Balmoral to careen down a waterslide at a tacky amusement park , she told ordinary Britons that their world was as important as any other . 
She told them that she wanted to know them , and that she wanted her sons to know them , too . 
It was this radical popularizing / democratizing mission - � not her knowledge of her former husband &apos;s secrets or her later intimate relationship with a Muslim - that made her such a threat to the British establishment . 
And she was successful : she taught leaders that they would have to invite the people in - and treat them with basic respect - if they were to maintain their position . 
So , what Michelle Obama is doing is not trivial . 
It was not an earth-shattering policy revelation when she astutely followed reports of Sarah Palin &apos;s $ 150,000 wardrobe by remarking casually on a late-night talk show that she was wearing a chain-store brand , and that &quot; you can get lots of cute things online . &quot; 
But it was nonetheless a powerful statement , especially to women , that said : I am not Nancy Reagan , dressed in Galliano , living in a gated community ; 
I am you - busy , on a budget , overworked , shrewd , cute , clever , finding a way . 
Who came over to watch the White House chef with Mrs. Obama ? 
Local cooking school students . 
Who sang at a White House event ? 
Local public high school students . 
Again , &quot; secretaries and policy makers , &quot; not &quot; policy makers and secretaries , &quot; are coming over for film night . 
She is deliberately , coolly signaling that secretaries are just as good and important as policy makers , if not more so . 
This is a guest list that says to an anxious electorate : I respect you , wherever you are on the socioeconomic scale . 
Many White House speechwriters have used that rhetoric , but almost no First Ladies have walked the talk and passed the popcorn . 
When I worked on messaging for Al Gore &apos;s 2000 presidential campaign , I often argued with white , older , affluent , male advisers who cared intensely about what was said in the elite media but ignored the popular venues to which most Americans pay attention . 
They had learned nothing from the right , whose candidates knew how powerful the right colors , clothing , imagery , and even lighting can be , and how strongly personal narratives - Ronald Reagan in riding boots , or George W. Bush in a flight suit - resonate with voters . 
Meanwhile , the nerdy , wonky left kept issuing data points , policy summaries , and white papers - � and generally , since Clinton , kept losing - until a young couple showed up and understood that Americans don &apos;t just read ; they watch . 
You can tell the nation more about your values by saying where you will seek a dog for your daughters than you can through reams of unread position papers . 
At a time of crisis , the Obamas are sending a powerful message , and Mrs. Obama , as the female archetype who has picked up Princess Di &apos;s dropped baton , is instrumental in crafting it : no matter who you are , how stressed , how broke , there is , figuratively speaking , a seat in the White House with your name on it .
