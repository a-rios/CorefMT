Clowns on the Campaign Trail 
NEW YORK - Donald Trump , the real-estate tycoon and reality-show host , also known as &quot; The Donald , &quot; is unlikely to be the next president of the United States . 
He is loud , crude , ignorant about most things , and looks absurd in his puffed up blond comb-over hairdo . 
Even ardent Republicans have dismissed him as a &quot; rodeo clown , &quot; and his campaign as a &quot; circus . &quot; 
The Huffington Post covers Trump &apos;s campaign strictly as entertainment news . 
Yet , for the moment , Trump is leaving all his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in the dust . 
Even in US politics , which can be very strange , this is extraordinary . 
What explains Trump &apos;s popularity ? 
Are all his supporters &quot; crazies , &quot; as Senator John McCain , perhaps unwisely , called them ? 
Trump &apos;s critics argue that he is playing to the basest instincts of disaffected voters , who hate foreigners ( especially Mexicans ) , distrust bankers ( or anyone with a higher education , for that matter ) , and still can &apos;t get over the election of a president whose father was black . 
Trump , in the comedian Jon Stewart &apos;s words , is &quot; America &apos;s id , &quot; or at least the id of a large number of mostly white , mostly older , mostly small-town Americans . 
Now , all this may be so . 
But Trump is part of a wider phenomenon throughout the democratic world . 
Disaffected voters can be found everywhere , whether in the US , Europe , or India . 
But they are not only turning away from mainstream political parties and following populists who promise to clean out the corrupt elites from the centers of power ; they also share a taste for political entertainers , or clowns if you like . 
Beppe Grillo , a real professional comedian , now leads the second largest political party in Italy . 
In a sense , of course , Italians already voted three times for a clownish figure as prime minister . 
Silvio Berlusconi , another real-estate billionaire , who began his career as a crooner on a cruise ship , was even more outrageous than Trump , as well as a master of the mass media - literally so , as he owned most of it in his country . 
As is true of The Donald , many people , especially men , liked him not despite his outrageous statements and behavior , but because of them . 
A television comic named Victor Trujillo , but better known as Brozo the Creepy Clown , became the most influential political commentator in Mexico . 
In the Netherlands , not normally a country known for clownish politicians , the surge of populism was first led by Pim Fortuyn , a flamboyantly gay man who staged provocative , and always richly entertaining , public appearances . 
Again , his talent for shocking statements was an asset , not a hindrance . 
After his violent death in 2002 , Geert Wilders , a former punk rocker with a pile of dyed platinum blond hair , shone brightest in the Dutch populist firmament . 
Apart from peculiar hairstyles ( the balding Berlusconi has his head painted ) , the new populists have several things in common . 
Whether billionaires or not , they share a prickly hostility to so-called elites , from whom they feel socially excluded . 
Wilders and Trump , among others of their ilk , also play on popular anti-immigrant sentiment . 
Trump called Mexicans in the US &quot; rapists . &quot; 
Wilders wants to ban the Koran and stop Muslims from moving to his country . 
But this , too , is part of the same resentment against elites , who are blamed for allowing foreigners to arrive in the first place . 
In Europe , antipathy to immigrants , or Islam , can quickly switch to hostility toward the European Union , which is seen as yet another bastion of entrenched elites . 
This is what Wilders and Grillo have in common . 
But I think there is a more basic reason why political clowns are doing so well . 
Many people are fed up with the professional political class . 
In the past , politicians of the left often came from the trade unions , while conservatives were rich businessmen or landowners . 
Social classes had their own interests , which were represented by parties divided by clear ideological differences . 
Increasingly , however , people see no difference between politicians from one party or another . 
They are lumped together under such rubrics as &quot; Washington , &quot; &quot; Brussels , &quot; or &quot; Wall Street . &quot; 
The country really would be a different place under a Republican president , especially with a Republican majority in both houses of Congress . 
But it is certainly true in many places that ideological differences have largely collapsed . Social democrats govern in coalition governments with laissez-faire conservatives . 
Neoliberalism reigns . 
More and more , politics looks like a rigged system whereby members of the same political class compete for jobs , rather than for the victory of ideas , or on behalf of larger collective interests . 
Trumpism , then , or Grilloism , is a revolt against the professional politicians . 
Trump is not just trying to run against a Democrat for the presidency ; he is running against his own party &apos;s establishment as well . 
His supporters are disgusted with the compromises made in Washington between leading Republicans and Democrats . 
That is why they voted five years ago for Tea Party politicians , who preferred a government shutdown to a negotiated deal with Democrats . 
And that is why they are cheering for a showy loudmouth like Trump . 
But , without compromise , a democracy becomes ungovernable . 
Even though Trump will not become the next president , the populist damage has already been done .
