Advanced Malaise 
NEW YORK - Economics is often called the dismal science , and for the last half-decade it has come by its reputation honestly in the advanced economies . 
Unfortunately , the year ahead will bring little relief . 
Real ( inflation-adjusted ) per capita GDP in France , Greece , Italy , Spain , the United Kingdom , and the United States is lower today than before the Great Recession hit . 
Indeed , Greece &apos;s per capita GDP has shrunk nearly 25 % since 2008 . 
There are a few exceptions : After more than two decades , Japan &apos;s economy appears to be turning a corner under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s government ; but , with a legacy of deflation stretching back to the 1990 &quot; s , it will be a long road back . 
And Germany &apos;s real per capita GDP was higher in 2012 than it was in 2007 - though an increase of 3.9 % in five years is not much to boast about . 
Elsewhere , though , things really are dismal : unemployment in the eurozone remains stubbornly high and the long-term unemployment rate in the US still far exceeds its pre-recession levels . 
In Europe , growth appears set to return this year , though at a truly anemic rate , with the International Monetary Fund projecting a 1 % annual increase in output . 
In fact , the IMF &apos;s forecasts have repeatedly proved overly optimistic : the Fund predicted 0.2 % growth for the eurozone in 2013 , compared to what is likely to be a 0.4 % contraction ; and it predicted US growth to reach 2.1 % , whereas it now appears to have been closer to 1.6 % . 
With European leaders wedded to austerity and moving at a glacial pace to address the structural problems stemming from the eurozone &apos;s flawed institutional design , it is no wonder that the continent &apos;s prospects appear so bleak . 
But , on the other side of the Atlantic , there is cause for muted optimism . 
Revised data for the US indicate that real GDP grew at an annual pace of 4.1 % in the third quarter of 2013 , while the unemployment rate finally reached 7 % in November - the lowest level in five years . 
A half-decade of low construction has largely worked off the excess building that occurred during the housing bubble . 
The development of vast reserves of shale energy has moved America toward its long-sought goal of energy independence and reduced gas prices to record lows , contributing to the first glimmer of a manufacturing revival . 
And a booming high-tech sector has become the envy of the rest of the world . 
Most important , a modicum of sanity has been restored to the US political process . 
Automatic budget cuts - which reduced 2013 growth by as much as 1.75 percentage points from what it otherwise would have been - continue , but in a much milder form . 
Moreover , the cost curve for health care - a main driver of long-term fiscal deficits - has bent down . 
Already , the Congressional Budget Office projects that spending in 2020 for Medicare and Medicaid ( the government health-care programs for the elderly and the poor , respectively ) will be roughly 15 % below the level projected in 2010 . 
It is possible , even likely , that US growth in 2014 will be rapid enough to create more jobs than required for new entrants into the labor force . 
At the very least , the huge number ( roughly 22 million ) of those who want a full-time job and have been unable to find one should fall . 
But we should curb our euphoria . 
A disproportionate share of the jobs now being created are low-paying - so much so that median incomes ( those in the middle ) continue to decline . 
For most Americans , there is no recovery , with 95 % of the gains going to the top 1 % . 
Even before the recession , American-style capitalism was not working for a large share of the population . 
The recession only made its rough edges more apparent . 
Median income ( adjusted for inflation ) is still lower than it was in 1989 , almost a quarter-century ago ; and median income for males is lower than it was four decades ago . 
America &apos;s new problem is long-term unemployment , which affects nearly 40 % of those without jobs , compounded by one of the poorest unemployment-insurance systems among advanced countries , with benefits normally expiring after 26 weeks . 
During downturns , the US Congress extends these benefits , recognizing that individuals are unemployed not because they are not looking for work , but because there are no jobs . 
But now congressional Republicans are refusing to adapt the unemployment system to this reality ; as Congress went into recess for the holidays , it gave the long-term unemployed the equivalent of a pink slip : as 2014 begins , the roughly 1.3 million Americans who lost their unemployment benefits at the end of December have been left to their own devices . 
Happy New Year . 
Meanwhile , a major reason that the US unemployment rate is currently as low as it is , is that so many people have dropped out of the labor force . 
Labor-force participation is at levels not seen in more than three decades . 
Some say that this largely reflects demographics : an increasing share of the working-age population is over 50 , and labor-force participation has always been lower among this group than among younger cohorts . 
But this simply recasts the problem : the US economy has never been good at retraining workers . 
American workers are treated like disposable commodities , tossed aside if and when they cannot keep up with changes in technology and the marketplace . 
The difference now is that these workers are no longer a small fraction of the population . 
None of this is inevitable . 
It is the result of bad economic policy and even worse social policy , which waste the country &apos;s most valuable resource - its human talent - and cause immense suffering for affected individuals and their families . 
They want to work , but the US economic system is failing them . 
So , with Europe &apos;s Great Malaise continuing in 2014 and the US recovery excluding all but those at the top , count me dismal . 
On both sides of the Atlantic , market economies are failing to deliver for most citizens . 
How long can this continue ?
