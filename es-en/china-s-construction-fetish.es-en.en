China &apos;s Construction Fetish 
NEW HAVEN - As we digest the implications of China &apos;s $ 586 billion stimulus plan , it is intriguing to ponder why China chooses infrastructure , buildings , and big projects every time growth needs a boost . 
Should , or can , China achieve long-term growth only by adding physical structures ? 
If and when the time comes to pause or change course , will China &apos;s existing political-economic institutions accommodate such a transformation ? 
During a recent trip to Brazil , my taxi driver complained about Sao Paulo &apos;s bumpy streets and highways . 
I responded , &quot; I thought the high oil and iron ore prices had made Brazil boom .... Why hasn &apos;t Brazil spent more on its infrastructure ? &quot; 
He replied , &quot; The Brazilian economy has been doing well . 
Why ? &quot; 
&quot; Well , &quot; I said , &quot; Brazil is a democracy . 
Imagine you were Lula and had $ 18 billion at your disposal . 
Would you rather spend it on highways , or give each Brazilian $ 100 ? &quot; 
&quot; Yes , give it to the people , just to win more votes . &quot; 
In China , the government is not elected , so winning more votes is not part of the calculation , and returning money to the people is never the choice . 
The government doesn &apos;t just spend it , but seems always to favor tangible things like skyscrapers , fancy government buildings , highways , and big industrial projects . 
This partly explains not only why democracies such as India and Brazil lag behind China in infrastructure , but also why China is focusing its new stimulus package on transport systems ( railroad projects alone will receive more than half of the $ 586 billion stimulus ) . 
In a non-democracy , officials are held accountable to their superiors , not to voters . 
And for one &apos;s superiors , tangible projects are the easiest to recognize . 
Indeed , while China &apos;s new stimulus plan overwhelmingly emphasizes infrastructure , it gives short shrift to social programs , such as health care and education , even though they can reduce household saving pressure and increase private consumption . 
This type of spending structure is nothing new to China . 
In 2007 , government expenditure on health care , social security , and unemployment welfare programs totaled about $ 88 billion , or 15 % of the fiscal budget and 2.4 % of GDP ( far below the typical percentage in both developed and developing democracies ) . 
Brazil &apos;s government spends 4.7 % of GDP on health care alone . 
China &apos;s government expenditure on education is approximately 3 % of GDP , compared to 5.4 % in Brazil . 
Due to the lack of public oversight on government budgeting , China &apos;s political system is especially biased to favor big physical projects , and , through taxation and state ownership , the government maintains almost full control over much national income and wealth , maximizing the impact of this bias . 
The wonderful Olympics sites in Beijing were no accident , but rather a result of the system . 
Taxation power is hardly checked by the National People &apos;s Congress or the media . 
As a result , from 1995 to 2007 , inflation-adjusted government fiscal revenue increased 5.7 times . 
In contrast , over the same period , the cumulative increase was 1.6 times for urban residents &quot; per capita disposable income and 1.2 times for rural peasants &quot; per capita income . 
So , China &apos;s &quot; socialism with Chinese characteristics &quot; is an economy where an increasing share of national income goes to the state . 
Despite privatization , there are roughly 119,000 state-owned enterprises today , with a book value of about $ 4 trillion . 
State-owned land is valued at more than $ 7 trillion . 
Combined , these state-owned assets total almost three-quarters of China &apos;s national productive wealth . 
With the state owning so much , most of the gains in asset values experienced over the past 30 years have gone into the government &apos;s coffers . 
When most households own no productive assets , they cannot share any of the asset appreciation or property income . 
For most citizens , wages are the only source of income . 
No wonder domestic consumption cannot grow in a manner commensurate with GDP . 
Transforming China from an export-driven economy to one that relies on domestic consumption requires two fundamental reforms . 
First , ownership rights to the remaining state assets should be distributed equally to China &apos;s 1.3 billion citizens . 
Second , the government budgeting process must be opened up through both public hearings in the national legislature and public participation via the media . 
Such increased accountability will shift government spending toward programs related to people &apos;s needs and away from physical structures . 
Without such structural reforms or returning fiscal surpluses to families through tax cuts and rebates , government investment-based stimulus efforts can provide , at best , a short-term economic boost . 
Indeed , even after the new stimulus package , China will still depend on investment and export for growth . 
For 30 years , concentrating resources in the government &apos;s hands through state ownership and taxes has served China well . 
Today , however , China has decent infrastructure , impressive buildings , and an excessive industrial base . 
What is missing is sufficient private consumption to power endogenous growth . 
To correct this , China needs to boost its people &apos;s sense of future financial security and affect a rise in private income commensurate with GDP growth . 
Building a nation demands more than steel and concrete .
