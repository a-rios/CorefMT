China &apos;s BRICS Balancing Act 
BEIJING - As much of the world focuses on Greece &apos;s travails , the BRICS countries - Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa - have been working to advance their own economic agenda , most recently at their seventh annual summit in the Siberian city of Ufa . 
But , though Russia hosted the meeting , it is China that was viewed as dominating the grouping . 
Indeed , the BRICS has already proved to be a force multiplier for Chinese diplomacy , and can remain so if China is careful not to push its national interests too hard . 
So far , China has played a pivotal role in driving progress toward real cooperation among the BRICS countries . 
In recent weeks , its members have each pledged $ 10 billion to their New Development Bank , which should start lending next year ; released a common strategy for economic and trade cooperation ; and agreed to a $ 100 billion contingency fund to provide temporary assistance to members facing balance-of-payments pressures . 
Brazil is wracked by corruption scandals and stagnating output . 
India has been suffering from a depreciating currency and soaring public debts . 
China &apos;s GDP grew by only 7.4 % last year , the lowest rate in 24 years . 
Given these developments , many Western observers have come to believe that the BRICS are broken . 
Morgan Stanley &apos;s Ruchir Sharma has emphasized that the winners of the last decade may not continue to win in this one . 
Even Jim O &apos;Neill , who coined the term &quot; BRIC , &quot; has turned his attention to the &quot; MINT &quot; economies - Mexico , Indonesia , Nigeria , and Turkey - the BRICS &quot; key emerging-country competitors . 
But not everyone is bearish about the BRICS &quot; prospects and global influence , whether taken individually or as a grouping . 
The journalist Gideon Rachman has suggested that &quot; the rise of non-Western economies is a deeply rooted historic shift that can survive any number of economic and political shocks . &quot; 
China seems to be counting on that being true . 
In fact , the BRICS countries remain an economic force to be reckoned with , accounting for 25.7 % of world GDP , 42 % of the global population , and 17 % of total trade . 
They attract more than 18 % of the global total of foreign investment , hold 40 % of all foreign-exchange reserves , and account for 30 % of total foreign holdings of US Treasury bonds . 
Moreover , the BRICS consumption markets are worth more than $ 4 trillion , equivalent to those of the eurozone . 
And , according to Goldman Sachs , about 85 % of the world &apos;s middle class will be living in the BRICS and other developing countries by 2030 . 
Moreover , with many of the factors that have fueled the BRICS &quot; rapid growth - including relatively low labor costs , rising productivity , trade liberalization , and the free flow of information and capital - still in play , writing off the BRICS would be premature . 
Still , the BRICS have work to do . 
In particular , the BRICS suffer from considerable income inequality , with their average Gini coefficient ( where zero signifies absolute equality and one is absolute inequality ) ranging from 0.37 to 0.50 in 2010-2013 . 
Working together , the BRICS have a better chance of implementing the reforms needed to boost their economies &quot; resilience - an opportunity that they have already identified . 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi &apos;s administration has sought massive support from China in implementing its national manufacturing policy and overcoming obstacles to developing infrastructure . 
The Chinese government is now going further , urging the rest of the BRICS to institutionalize their cooperation , not just pursue domestic reform . 
China contends that a stronger BRICS grouping would help to safeguard the interests of all developing countries . 
To that end , the country is also spearheading the effort to reform the global economic architecture , including by pushing for reforms to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s weighted voting system . 
But despite such efforts &quot; potential benefits for emerging and developing economies , they have provoked considerable anxiety among China &apos;s BRICS partners , which fear that its leadership could quickly morph into domination . 
Beyond fundamental differences in the BRICS &quot; countries political systems , social values , and cultural traditions - factors that undermine trust and cohesion - there is the obvious fact that China &apos;s economy ( not to mention its military ) dwarfs the others . &quot; 
Indeed , bilateral trade between China and the other four BRICS accounts for 85 % of total intra-BRICS trade . 
Furthermore , China &apos;s BRICS partners face keen competition from cheap Chinese-manufactured goods ( intensified by what many view as China &apos;s undervalued currency ) . 
Most trade-related complaints against China in the World Trade Organization in recent years were lodged by developing countries , including India and Brazil . 
China &apos;s relationship with India is particularly fraught , owing to their seemingly intractable territorial dispute , as well as disagreements over the reform of the United Nations Security Council . 
If China wants the BRICS to continue to deepen their ties , it should seek to act as a guiding hand within the grouping , adopting an approach that is more prudent than pushy . 
That means , above all , curbing its geopolitical competition with India and Russia . 
At the same time , in dealing with its advanced-country counterparts , it should be open and pragmatic , championing an inclusive global policy agenda that connects the developed and developing worlds . 
A united anti-West bloc would not serve China &apos;s interests any more than a grouping characterized by antagonism and divisions . 
What China - and the rest of the emerging and developing economies - needs is a nimble and cohesive BRICS grouping with a strong reputation as a leading provider of global public goods .
