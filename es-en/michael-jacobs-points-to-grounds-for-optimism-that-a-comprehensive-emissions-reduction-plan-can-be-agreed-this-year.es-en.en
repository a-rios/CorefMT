The Climate-Change Agenda Heats Up 
LONDON - For many people around the world this year , the weather has become anything but a topic for small talk . 
Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines , America &apos;s record-breaking freeze , California &apos;s year-long drought , and flooding in Europe have put the long-term dangers of climate change back on the political agenda . 
In response , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has sent an urgent letter to government , business , civil society , and finance leaders , urging them to attend a special Climate Summit in New York in September . 
The event will be the first time that world leaders have met to discuss global warming since the UN &apos;s fateful Copenhagen climate-change summit in 2009 . 
Amid high expectations - and subsequent recriminations - that meeting failed to achieve a comprehensive , legally-binding agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions . 
So , at September &apos;s summit , leaders will be asked to re-boot the diplomatic process . 
The goal is a new agreement in 2015 to prevent average global temperatures from rising by two degrees Celsius , the level that the international community has deemed &quot; dangerous &quot; to human society . 
At first sight , that looks like a hard task . 
Since Copenhagen , climate change has slipped down the global agenda , as the restoration of economic growth , voter concern about jobs and living standards , and violent conflict in key trouble spots have taken precedence . 
But the tide may be turning . 
More people are grasping the true extent of the dangers ahead . 
In its latest authoritative assessment , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) concluded last year that scientists are now 95 % certain that human activities are the principal cause of rising temperatures . 
Over the next two months the IPCC will release further reports detailing the human and economic impacts of probable climate change and the costs and benefits of combating it . 
US Secretary of State John Kerry recently described climate change as &quot; perhaps the world &apos;s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction , &quot; warning of &quot; a tipping-point of no return . &quot; 
Few serious commentators now dispute the science . 
So the key question now is how the world &apos;s leaders will respond . 
There are grounds for cautious optimism . 
First , New York will not be like Copenhagen . 
Leaders are not being asked to negotiate a new agreement themselves ; that job will remain with their professional negotiators and environment ministers . 
Moreover , the process will not be concluded this year but at the UN climate conference in Paris in December 2015 . 
That provides plenty of time to translate political commitments made in New York into a legally-binding accord . 
Second , the world &apos;s two largest greenhouse-gas emitters , the United States and China , are now more committed to action than they were five years ago . 
US President Barack Obama has announced a far-reaching plan that authorizes the Environment Protection Agency to take dramatic measures in the next few months to limit power-station emissions , virtually ending coal-fired electricity generation altogether . 
In China , worsening air pollution and growing concerns about energy security have led the government to consider a cap on coal use and an absolute reduction in emissions within the next 10-15 years . 
The government is experimenting with carbon pricing , and investing heavily in low-carbon wind , solar , and nuclear energy . 
Further , the two countries are actively cooperating . 
Last year Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to phase out hydrofluorcarbons , a potent greenhouse gas . 
In February , they announced their intention to work together on climate policy - a marked contrast to Sino-US tensions over Pacific security and trade issues . 
With the European Union also preparing to commit to new 2030 climate targets , hopes for a global deal are rising . 
A third cause for optimism is the re-appraisal of climate-change economics . 
Five years ago , policies aimed at cutting greenhouse-gas emissions were seen as a cost burden on the economy . 
Negotiations were therefore a zero-sum game , with countries seeking to minimize their obligations while asking others to do more . 
However , new evidence may be altering the economic calculus . 
According to research conducted by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate , far from hurting the economy , well-designed climate policy may actually boost growth . 
Chaired by former Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n and comprising former prime ministers , presidents , and finance ministers , the Commission is analyzing how investments in clean-energy infrastructure , agricultural productivity , and urban transport could stimulate sluggish economies . 
Its conclusions will be presented at September &apos;s summit ; if accepted , the Commission &apos;s work could mark a turning point , transforming the way in which climate policy is perceived by the world &apos;s economic policymakers . 
None of this guarantees success . 
Powerful vested interests - not least the world &apos;s fossil-fuel industries - will no doubt seek to limit progress , and most governments are not yet focused on the problem .
