A Roadmap to Peace that Can Work 
In the days after the so-called &quot; Roadmap for Peace between Israel and Palestine &quot; was unveiled , a new cycle of violence exploded between the warring parties . 
Palestinian suicide bombings and Israeli attacks against Palestinian leaders came with such speed and ferocity that determining who was striking first and who was counterattacking became impossible . 
Of course , recriminations also began immediately , with Israelis and Palestinians each accusing the other of deliberately destroying the peace process . 
The truth , as usual , is more complicated , and understanding it helps us to comprehend what will be needed if real peace is to be achieved . 
There are at least four sides to this conflict : moderate and extremist Israelis and moderate and extremist Palestinians . 
Complicated strategic interactions exist not only between Israelis and Palestinians , but also within the two sides . 
The extremist positions are clear . 
Extremist Palestinians vow to fight until Israel - viewed as a colonial imposition on the Islamic world - is destroyed . 
Extremist Israelis vow to fight to hold the entire West Bank , pushing out the Palestinians if necessary . 
For them , Israel &apos;s pre-1967 borders , the entire city of Jerusalem , and the West Bank of the Jordan River is land given to the Jewish people by God . 
No land-for-peace deal will satisfy either side . 
Large majorities on both sides - perhaps two-thirds or even three-fourths of each population - would accept a return by Israel to something like its pre-1967 borders in exchange for real peace . 
Of course , moderates on both sides would prefer as much land and room to maneuver as possible , but they prefer a negotiated compromise aimed at ending the violence . 
The moderates are understandably wary . 
Compromise on their side if met by extremism on the other would incite disaster . 
If Israel returns to its pre-1967 borders , only to find continuing hostility and terrorism among the Palestinians , Israel will have gravely weakened its security for nothing . 
If Palestinians disarm but still confront Israeli demands to keep West Bank settlements , then Palestine will never have a viable state . 
Compromise is therefore difficult even among moderates : it requires a belief that moderation on one side will be met by moderation on the other . 
The Oslo Peace Process was built on the premise that moderates on both sides would gradually gain each other &apos;s trust and move steadily towards compromise . 
But this largely ignored the role of extremists . 
Israeli extremists assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , lest he mobilize broad public support to make peace . 
Arab extremists launched attacks against Israelis civilians , in part to show moderates on both sides that compromise would not stick . 
That dynamic is still at work . 
Palestinian Prime Minister Abu Mazen has called on Palestinian extremists to disarm , or at least to accept a prolonged cease-fire , but they have responded with more terrorist attacks . 
Israel &apos;s government , meanwhile , has gone out of its way to attack Palestinian hard-line groups , causing more death , damage , and bitter feelings . 
Extremists on both sides &quot; win &quot; their battle to undermine the peace process . 
But all factions lose , because violence continues and none of them achieves its goals . 
Israelis and Palestinians cannot find the way out alone , because neither side would dare to forcibly disarm its own extremists without absolute proof that the other side will do the same . 
So it is fatuous for Israel &apos;s government to insist that the Palestinians disarm completely before the peace process can continue , when Palestinian moderates have no proof that Israel will withdraw to the pre-1967 boundaries . 
In these circumstances , gradual confidence building will not work . 
Extremists simply have enough power to undermine a process based on trust alone . 
Nor will one side &apos;s extremists defeat the other side &apos;s extremists . 
Israel &apos;s military has failed to destroy Palestinian terrorism through hard-line reprisals ; 
A solution is possible only if the outside world is prepared to police an agreement reached between the moderate majorities . 
A strong international peacekeeping force , agreed by the UN , and perhaps led by the US or NATO , must be placed between the warring sides , and must be prepared to suffer losses to terrorists in the service of peace . 
The roadmap is - so far - silent on this issue . 
When UN Secretary General Kofi Annan made such a proposal , extremists on both sides denounced the plan . 
But moderates raised red flags , too . 
Would a peacekeeping force truly serve the interests of the agreement , rather than one side or the other ? 
Would it have the firepower to hold back extremists ? 
Would it stick to its long-term mission in the face of inevitable attacks ? 
The Roadmap to Peace can work only if both sides are pressed to a real compromise , whose outline is clear : Israel &apos;s return to something like its pre-1967 borders ; financial compensation of Palestinians for losses of land in Israel , rather than a right to return ; and Jerusalem as a shared capital . 
But enforcement of this compromise against extremists will require putting credible and well-armed international peacekeepers in place to hold the parties to the deal . 
Designing such an international peacekeeping effort , one with the credibility and staying power , should now be a priority .
