Colombia &apos;s Modest Peace 
BOMBOLO , ANTIOQUIA , COLOMBIA - While Syria &apos;s civil war and political crises in Thailand and Ukraine continue to dominate the headlines , Colombia &apos;s government , led by President Juan Manuel Santos , and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) may be about to end the longest and most brutal conflict in Latin America &apos;s history . 
An agreement would enable Colombia - an important regional ally of the United States - to shift its attention and resources to economic and social development . 
The latest series of talks - held in Havana , and mediated by Cuba and Norway - was launched in November 2012 . 
Despite some setbacks , the process has raised hope of a permanent end to the 50-year conflict , which has displaced at least five million people and led to more than 200,000 deaths ( an estimated 85 % of them civilians ) , with 23,161 selective killings , 25,007 forced disappearances , 27,023 kidnappings , and 1,982 massacres . 
Of course , this is not the parties &quot; first attempt to forge a peace agreement . 
In the late 1990 &quot; s , President Andrés Pastrana &apos;s government met with the guerrillas - along with representatives from the United Nations and from Cuba , Spain , France , Switzerland , Brazil , and other countries - in a demilitarized area of Colombia to pursue an agreement . 
But the talks faced considerable headwinds . 
The United States never believed in the process , and undermined it at every opportunity . 
Moreover , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , who rose to power in 1999 , viewed the FARC as a natural partner in an eventual new alliance of left-wing forces in the Andes . 
With Europe offering only empty promises , and the UN unsure of how to catalyze progress on the talks &quot; ambitious 12-point agenda ( which included more than 100 items ) , the effort collapsed in 2002 . 
Fortunately , much has changed in the last decade . 
For starters , meeting outside of Colombia has enabled the parties to avoid the pressure and manipulation that contributed to the breakdown of talks the last time . 
Furthermore , the US - hesitant to face yet another foreign-policy disruption , much less offer assistance or deploy troops , and facing other hotspots where vital national interests are more at stake - has contributed , albeit discreetly , to a negotiated settlement . 
Likewise , since the final years of Chávez and during Nicolás Maduro tenure , Venezuela has played a far more constructive role in promoting peace , recognizing that the hostile neighborhood created by the Colombian conflict is impeding its own progress . 
( The UN , the European Union , and the Union of South American Nations , focusing on other priorities , have avoided becoming collectively involved . ) 
Finally , this time , the negotiations are more manageable in scope , focusing on five specific issues : an agrarian-development policy , the FARC &apos;s political participation , ending the conflict ( demobilization and transitional justice ) , reparations for the victims , and curbing the illicit drug trade . 
Any agreement must cover all five . 
So far , both sides have been realistic , avoiding ideological or formalist postures - in part , a reflection of the new balance of forces . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , the FARC was on the rise , and presented a maximalist list of demands . 
Today , the guerrillas are significantly weaker , allowing Santos &apos;s government to offer a minimalist agreement that can satisfy both the Colombian establishment , which backs the process but without much conviction , and a fatigued and mercurial public that wants peace but remains unwilling to accept too many concessions to the FARC . 
General agreements have already been reached on the first two issues - agrarian development and the FARC &apos;s political participation - though some key details have yet to be settled . 
To facilitate continued progress , the parties have delayed the more delicate issues - ending the conflict and the question of reparations - while focusing first on halting illegal drug production , an issue on which the two sides &quot; positions are much closer . 
Indeed , the FARC &apos;s proposal - centered on protecting the rural farmers who make their living cultivating illicit crops , including by establishing a legal market for such crops - is relatively moderate . 
In fact , the FARC &apos;s influence on drug trafficking has waned considerably in recent years , as the large cartels that once dominated Colombia &apos;s narcotics industry have given way to numerous smaller criminal organizations , led by warlords associated with far-right political forces . 
The result has been a sort of pax mafiosa : consolidated , regionally legitimized actors , with drug traffickers , old paramilitary groups , new criminal bands , large landholders , and political caciques reinforcing one another . 
Barring a major event - say , an assassination of a major figure , a large-scale military attack , or a significant split within the political elite or the FARC leadership - the negotiations are likely to continue . 
After all , a rupture would be extremely costly to both sides . 
But there is one potential obstacle that cannot be avoided : the May presidential election . 
Santos needs to be re-elected in order to sideline former President Álvaro Uribe , who , along with recalcitrant civilian and military elements , is trying to undermine the negotiations . 
That requires that the talks progress steadily , and that the FARC remains reliable and united . 
But the FARC will not hand Santos the speedy agreement that would ease his path to victory , and he knows that the flag of peace will not ensure his reelection . 
In the first round of the 2010 presidential election - in which only 49 % of the electorate participated - Santos obtained 47 % of the vote . 
Today , while Santos is ahead in the polls , a considerable share of voters remains undecided , with low expected turnout further clouding his prospects for re-election . 
Moreover , the talks &quot; outstanding issues are intricate , especially the question of compensating the conflict &apos;s victims . 
There is always the risk that the armed actors , both the guerrillas and the military , could obstruct progress on this crucial matter . 
Despite these challenges , there is much reason to hope that this time an agreement will be reached . 
Even a modest and fragile peace would represent a major advance for Colombia &apos;s democracy and economic prospects .
