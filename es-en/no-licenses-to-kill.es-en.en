No Licenses to Kill 
NEW YORK - In the last year , we endured a remarkable experience ; after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , financial markets actually collapsed and required artificial life support . 
Nothing like this had happened since the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
What made this collapse so remarkable is that it was not caused by some external factor , but originated within the financial system itself and spread from there throughout the global economy . 
This was almost completely unexpected , as the prevailing view was that financial markets are self-correcting . 
We now know that they are not . 
While markets are imperfect , regulators are not only human but bureaucratic and subject to political influence . 
Therefore , new regulations should be kept to a minimum . 
Three principles should guide reform . 
First and foremost , financial authorities must accept responsibility for preventing asset bubbles from growing too big . 
Former United States Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others have argued that if markets can &apos;t recognize bubbles , neither can regulators . 
Even so , financial authorities must accept the assignment : while they are bound to be wrong , feedback from the markets will tell them whether they have done too much or too little . 
They can then correct their mistakes . 
Second , controlling asset bubbles requires control not only of the money supply , but also of the availability of credit . 
The best-known tools for this are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements . 
Similarly , financial authorities should vary the loan-to-value ratio on commercial and residential mortgages for risk-weighting purposes in order to forestall real estate bubbles . 
For example , we had no financial crises when central banks instructed commercial banks to limit their lending to particular economic sectors that they believed were overheating , such as real estate or consumer loans . 
The Chinese authorities do it today , and they also set the minimum deposits banks must maintain with the central bank . 
Or consider the Internet bubble , which Greenspan recognized early but then did nothing to address . 
He rightly believed that reducing the money supply would have been too blunt an instrument to use . 
The Internet bubble was unusual in this regard . 
Usually , it is credit that provides the leverage , and credit is by nature reflexive . 
Bubbles recur , especially in real estate , because this reflexive relationship is repeatedly ignored . 
This brings me to my third point : we must reconceptualize the meaning of market risk . 
According to conventional theory , markets tend towards equilibrium , function without any discontinuity in the sequence of prices , and deviations occur in a random fashion . 
As a result , market risks can be equated with the risks confronting individual market participants . 
As long as they manage their risks properly , regulators should be happy . 
But markets are subject to imbalances that individual participants may ignore if they think they can offload their positions on someone else . 
Regulators , by contrast , cannot ignore these imbalances , because if too many participants are on the same side , positions cannot be liquidated without causing a discontinuity or , worse , financial collapse . 
Thus , there is systemic market risk , and unregulated securitization of banking assets , which was the main cause of the recent collapse , adds to it . 
To avert a repetition , securities held by banks must carry a much higher risk rating than they currently do . 
Banks must pay for their implicit government guarantee by using less leverage and accepting restrictions on how they invest depositors &quot; money . 
At a minimum , proprietary trading ought to be financed by banks &quot; own capital . 
If a bank is too big to fail , regulators should go even further , and regulate proprietary traders &quot; compensation packages to ensure that risks and rewards are properly aligned . 
Hedge funds and other large investors must also be closely monitored to ensure that they don &apos;t build up dangerous imbalances . 
Moreover , the issuance and trading of derivatives ought to be at least as strictly regulated as that of stocks . 
Regulators should insist that traded derivatives are homogenous , standardized , and transparent . 
Some derivatives , particularly credit default swaps should not be traded at all . 
To see why , note that being long and selling short in the stock market has an asymmetric risk / reward profile . 
Losing on a long position reduces one &apos;s risk exposure , while losing on a short position increases it , so one can be more patient being long and wrong than being short and wrong . 
Now , the CDS market offers a convenient way of shorting bonds , but the risk / reward asymmetry works in the opposite way . 
Shorting bonds by purchasing a CDS contract carries limited risk but almost unlimited profit potential , whereas selling a CDS contract offers limited profits but practically unlimited risks . 
The negative effect is reinforced by the fact that , because CDS contracts are tradable , they tend to be priced as warrants , which can be sold at any time , rather than as options , which would require an actual default to be cashed in . 
People buy CDS contracts not because they expect a default , but because they expect the CDS to appreciate in response to adverse developments . 
That is what destroyed AIG , and what led to the recent bankruptcy of Abitibi-Bowater and the pending bankruptcy of General Motors . 
In both cases , because some bondholders owned CDS contracts , they stood to gain more from bankruptcy than from reorganization . 
Purchasing CDS contracts is like buying insurance on someone else &apos;s life and owning a license to kill him . 
It is the job of regulators to ensure that no one is ever granted such a license .
