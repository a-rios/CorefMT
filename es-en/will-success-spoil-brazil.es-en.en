Will Success Spoil Brazil ? 
RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil has been making international headlines of late , but not for traditional stories about urban violence , natural catastrophes , political corruption , or deforestation in the Amazon . 
At the G-20 Summit in London last April , for example , US President Barack Obama called for the world to pay heed to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , the &quot; most popular politician on earth , &quot; and shook hands with him , saying : &quot; My man right here . 
I love this guy . &quot; 
In September , the ousted president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , reappeared in the country inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa after three months of exile . 
Although his presence dramatically fuelled the situation for a time , Brazilian diplomats , working with the US , were able to reach agreement with Honduran authorities to allow Manuel Zelaya to return to office . 
Then came the news that Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games - this coming on top of hosting the 2014 World Cup . 
As for the global - and fortunately now abating - economic crisis , Brazil has shined throughout , recording a fast and strong recovery . 
For these and other reasons , Brazil is gaining the world &apos;s attention . 
Brazilian democracy , at long last , is working well , following many years of military government , and its economy seems more robust than ever . 
As a result , many people are enthusiastically pointing to an increased international role for Brazil in the future . 
But two connected and major challenges lie ahead for Brazil and its government : the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nationalism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves . 
Brazil &apos;s current success is rooted not only in Lula &apos;s two terms , which must end in 2010 . 
The economic stabilization program enacted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso since 1994 ( the Real Plan ) , first as finance minister and then as president for two terms , solidified a structure that made it possible for Lula &apos;s tenure to be so prosperous . 
This is not meant to take anything away from Lula . 
His presidency has guaranteed political stability and strengthened social cohesion . 
Indeed , by managing the political process to make the government work for Brazil &apos;s people , Lula &apos;s administration has made Brazil a truly stable and consensual democracy . 
There is nothing modest about that achievement , given Brazil &apos;s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed Lula &apos;s government in 2005 and 2006 . 
Lula survived those scandals and did not move to amend the constitution in order to seek a third term , though some in Brazil pressed him to do so . 
Lula also enacted critically important social policies . 
Under his government , two million homes received electric power for the first time , 11 million very poor families gained the support of a minimum income ( the Bolsa Família ) , the minimum salary grew 45 % in real terms , thus benefiting 42 million people . 
Moreover , eight million jobs were created , 17 million people escaped poverty , and the income of the poorest 50 % grew 32 % - twice as fast as the income of the richest 10 % in the same period . 
This vast transformation has not only generated a virtuous circle that strengthened institutional stability and social capital . 
Yet the remaining challenges are huge , for Brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world - and severe violence persists . 
Sixty-four percent of Brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation , and only 22 % have electricity , a telephone , a computer , a refrigerator , a television , and a washing machine . 
In the poorest region , the North and Northeast , the numbers fall to 8.6 % and 8.3 % . 
Among the young , almost 37 % of 18-24-year-olds do not finish high school . 
Only half the population over age 25 has more than eight years of formal education . 
As for Brazil &apos;s international role , a subtle competition is emerging with the US . 
America wants to conclude as many free-trade agreements in the region as it can , while Brazil favors expanding its custom union , Mercosul / Mercosur . 
The entrance of Venezuela into the Brazilian bloc , Brazilian leadership at the United Nations mission in Haiti , and Brazil &apos;s role in the Honduran affair are all part of this emerging competition . 
If Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path , it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures . 
The construction of a major egalitarian , free , and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that Brazil can give to the world right now .
