Why Financial Pay Shouldn &apos;t be Left to the Market 
CAMBRIDGE - Although some financial firms are reforming how they pay their employees , governments around the world are seriously considering regulating such firms &quot; compensation structures . 
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has recently come out in favor of such regulations , and the United States House of Representatives has voted to require regulators to set compensation rules . 
Perhaps not surprisingly , many financial bosses are up in arms over such moves . 
They claim that they need the freedom to set compensation packages in order to keep their most talented people - the ones who will revive the world &apos;s financial system . 
So , should governments step back and let financial firms reform themselves ? 
The answer is clearly no . 
In the post-crisis financial order , governments must take on the role of monitoring and regulating pay in financial firms ; otherwise , the perverse incentives that contributed to the current crisis could easily recur . 
It is important to distinguish between two sources of concern about pay in financial firms . 
One set of concerns arises from the perspective of shareholders . 
Figures recently released by New York &apos;s attorney general , Andrew Cuomo , indicate that nine large financial firms paid their employees aggregate compensation exceeding $ 600 billion in 2003-2008 - a period in which their aggregate market capitalization substantially declined . 
Such patterns may raise concerns among shareholders that pay structures are not well designed to serve their interests . 
Even if financial firms have governance problems that produce pay decisions deviating from shareholder interests , however , such problems do not necessarily warrant government regulation of those decisions . 
Such problems are best addressed by rules that focus on improving internal governance processes and strengthening investors &quot; rights , leaving the choices that determine compensation structures to corporate boards and the shareholders who elect them . 
But pay in financial firms also raises a second important source of concern : even if compensation structures are designed in the interests of shareholders , they may produce incentives for excessive risk-taking that are socially undesirable . 
As a result , even if corporate governance problems in financial firms are fully addressed , a government role in regulating their compensation structures may still be warranted . 
Suppose that most financial firms could be relied upon by regulators to be run in the interest of their shareholders . 
Would this justify exempting these firms from existing regulations that constrain their decisions with respect to lending , investment , or capital reserves ? 
Clearly not , because shareholders do not bear the full costs of a firm &apos;s collapse , and , as the recent crisis demonstrates , the bill for such a downfall must be picked up , at least in part , by taxpayers and the economy . 
So shareholders &quot; interests might sometimes be served by business decisions that are too &quot; risky , &quot; and regulating such decisions is justified - indeed , necessary . 
Regulation of pay in financial firms is called for by the same reasons that justify the traditional regulations of the firms &quot; business decisions . 
The incentives generated by compensation structures determine how firms &quot; managers behave within the boundaries permitted by such traditional , direct regulations . 
And as traditional regulation of business decisions is bound to be imperfect , regulating compensation structures can be a useful additional tool to control the risks posed by financial firms &quot; behavior . 
If choices of compensation structures can be expected to affect financial firms &quot; stability , regulating these choices can also be useful for protecting this stability . 
Financial firms opposed to pay regulation will likely warn against &quot; micro-managing &quot; compensation , and argue that compensation choices must take into account information about each individual manager that regulators are almost certain to lack . 
But pay regulation can improve matters without micro-management by setting general standards from which firms may not deviate but that still leave them with significant freedom to account for the individual circumstances of managers . 
For example , regulatory standards could require equity-based plans to preclude managers from cashing out awarded shares and options during a certain minimum period after vesting . 
In such a case , firms could still remain free to choose the number of shares and options awarded to any given manager , as well as to adjust somewhat the length of the post-vesting period during which cashing out would be precluded . 
Finally , those opposing pay regulation are certain to warn us about &quot; unintended consequences . &quot; 
But this warning should not carry the day . 
We have experienced over the last several years the real and costly consequences of a compensation regime that left financial firms free to set their own pay structures . 
Are we to believe that those consequences are preferable to the unintended consequences of pay regulation ? 
The effort to avoid the harm of flawed compensation decisions in the future should not be deterred by speculative arguments about unintended consequences . 
Financial firms should not retain the freedom to create perverse incentives that put all of us at risk .
