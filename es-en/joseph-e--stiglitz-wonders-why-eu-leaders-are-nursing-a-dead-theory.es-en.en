Europe &apos;s Austerity Zombies 
NEW YORK - &quot; If the facts don &apos;t fit the theory , change the theory , &quot; goes the old adage . 
But too often it is easier to keep the theory and change the facts - or so German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other pro-austerity European leaders appear to believe . 
Though facts keep staring them in the face , they continue to deny reality . 
Austerity has failed . 
But its defenders are willing to claim victory on the basis of the weakest possible evidence : the economy is no longer collapsing , so austerity must be working ! 
But if that is the benchmark , we could say that jumping off a cliff is the best way to get down from a mountain ; after all , the descent has been stopped . 
But every downturn comes to an end . 
Success should not be measured by the fact that recovery eventually occurs , but by how quickly it takes hold and how extensive the damage caused by the slump . 
Viewed in these terms , austerity has been an utter and unmitigated disaster , which has become increasingly apparent as European Union economies once again face stagnation , if not a triple-dip recession , with unemployment persisting at record highs and per capita real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP in many countries remaining below pre-recession levels . 
In even the best-performing economies , such as Germany , growth since the 2008 crisis has been so slow that , in any other circumstance , it would be rated as dismal . 
The most afflicted countries are in a depression . 
There is no other word to describe an economy like that of Spain or Greece , where nearly one in four people - and more than 50 % of young people - cannot find work . 
To say that the medicine is working because the unemployment rate has decreased by a couple of percentage points , or because one can see a glimmer of meager growth , is akin to a medieval barber saying that a bloodletting is working , because the patient has not died yet . 
Extrapolating Europe &apos;s modest growth from 1980 onwards , my calculations show that output in the eurozone today is more than 15 % below where it would have been had the 2008 financial crisis not occurred , implying a loss of some $ 1.6 trillion this year alone , and a cumulative loss of more than $ 6.5 trillion . 
Even more disturbing , the gap is widening , not closing ( as one would expect following a downturn , when growth is typically faster than normal as the economy makes up lost ground ) . 
Simply put , the long recession is lowering Europe &apos;s potential growth . 
Young people who should be accumulating skills are not . 
There is overwhelming evidence that they face the prospect of significantly lower lifetime income than if they had come of age in a period of full employment . 
Meanwhile , Germany is forcing other countries to follow policies that are weakening their economies - and their democracies . 
When citizens repeatedly vote for a change of policy - and few policies matter more to citizens than those that affect their standard of living - but are told that these matters are determined elsewhere or that they have no choice , both democracy and faith in the European project suffer . 
France voted to change course three years ago . 
Instead , voters have been given another dose of pro-business austerity . 
One of the longest-standing propositions in economics is the balanced-budget multiplier - increasing taxes and expenditures in tandem stimulates the economy . 
And if taxes target the rich , and spending targets the poor , the multiplier can be especially high . 
But France &apos;s so-called socialist government is lowering corporate taxes and cutting expenditures - a recipe almost guaranteed to weaken the economy , but one that wins accolades from Germany . 
The hope is that lower corporate taxes will stimulate investment . 
This is sheer nonsense . 
What is holding back investment ( both in the United States and Europe ) is lack of demand , not high taxes . 
Indeed , given that most investment is financed by debt , and that interest payments are tax-deductible , the level of corporate taxation has little effect on investment . 
Likewise , Italy is being encouraged to accelerate privatization . 
But Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has the good sense to recognize that selling national assets at fire-sale prices makes little sense . 
Long-run considerations , not short-run financial exigencies , should determine which activities occur in the private sector . 
The decision should be based on where activities are carried out most efficiently , serving the interests of most citizens the best . 
Privatization of pensions , for example , has proved costly in those countries that have tried the experiment . 
America &apos;s mostly private health-care system is the least efficient in the world . 
These are hard questions , but it is easy to show that selling state-owned assets at low prices is not a good way to improve long-run financial strength . 
All of the suffering in Europe - inflicted in the service of a man-made artifice , the euro - is even more tragic for being unnecessary . 
Though the evidence that austerity is not working continues to mount , Germany and the other hawks have doubled down on it , betting Europe &apos;s future on a long-discredited theory . 
Why provide economists with more facts to prove the point ?
