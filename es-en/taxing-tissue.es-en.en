Taxing Tissue 
Today &apos;s biomedical research is a collaborative research enterprise , requiring the contributions of patients , universities and industry . 
Today &apos;s laws , however , allow only universities and industry , which supply basic knowledge and technology , to profit from their contributions ; patients , who supply tissue , may not be compensated . 
Some consider this unfair , as it allows tissue donated by patients to be wholly appropriated by universities and industry . 
Others consider this wise , as compensating individual tissue donors could block scientific progress and technological development . 
Is there a way to redress the double standard in biomedical research that is both fair and wise ? 
Ironically , the double standard has both a moral and an economic underpinning . 
European law solemnly declares that the human body and its parts shall not give rise to financial gain , for reasons of human dignity . 
American law denies patients a property right in their tissue for reasons of economic policy . 
Recognizing such a right would impose a duty on universities and industry to negotiate fair compensation with every donor of all tissue used in their research . 
Moreover , compared with the contributions of universities and industry to the end product , the importance of tissue contributed by patients is minimal . 
Finally , why should tissue donors be entitled to compensation , as they or their progeny may benefit in the long run from the technological advances to which they contribute ? 
Opponents of the double standard draw on principles of fairness , equity , and distributive justice . 
They view the double standard as a possible source of public distrust in the biomedical research enterprise . 
In fact , patients &quot; contributions to that enterprise are no longer minimal , as they supply university and industry with crucial compilations of tissue and associated medical data . 
Consequently , they have increasingly abandoned altruistic participation and are demanding compensation for their tissue . 
However , given current European and American law , these claims require a novel legal underpinning in order to be valid and enforceable . 
Various models have been proposed . 
Charitable trust model . 
Donors would transfer their tissue to a charitable trust , and would collectively appoint a trustee , who would have legal fiduciary duties to use the tissue for the benefit of the public . 
The trust agreement could allow the donor group to participate in the governance of the trust and thus have a say in the distribution of any benefits . 
But , while the model is fair in a number of ways , it implies that parts of the human body can give rise to financial gain . 
Moreover , the model is unwise to the extent that tissue donors could block the development of knowledge and applications . 
And , by definition , it would work only if the trust is funded on a public basis . 
Contract model . Tissue can be removed only with donors &quot; prior consent . 
Thus , prior to giving their consent , tissue donors can negotiate acceptable compensation . 
Patients suffering from rare disorders have adopted this approach . 
Prior to supplying their tissue to universities and industry , these patients negotiate ownership rights in any technology that arises from the research . 
This model seems fair enough : if people can exploit such natural endowments as their beauty or scientific genius , then why not their tissue ? 
It may be unwise , though , because the knowledge and applications over which they retain control may have implications for other diseases . 
In such circumstances , should they further their own interests by continuing to exploiting their control , or should they further the interests of those other patients by donating their tissue ? 
Global public good model . 
In this view , the human genome is a common heritage of humankind and a global public good whose benefits should be shared with all . 
Benefit-sharing may be fair in that it includes giving special assistance to research participants , such as access to medical care or to new treatments stemming from the research , but it may be unfair in failing to define the recipients of such benefits . 
In addition , the model bears an arbitrary element , as the sharing of benefits is not subject to control by the donors of tissue , much less to democratic control , and may prove self-serving for universities and industry . 
The unfair and unwise elements of these models nonetheless suggest a solution that is both fair and wise : a tissue tax . 
Instead of allowing donors to claim individual compensation for their tissue , a tax would be imposed every time a tissue-based application actually yields a profit . 
This would be fair , as it would ensure collective compensation for the use of tissue in general , rather than for individual tissue donors , and it would be wise in that it would not block scientific and technological progress . 
While universities and industry may be wary of taxation , they might prefer a tissue tax over endless negotiations with countless tissue donors over the sharing of uncertain future benefits . 
Moreover , unlike direct compensation schemes , a tissue tax does not exert undue influence on individuals or groups to donate tissue . 
And , instead of being arbitrary , a tissue tax would be subject to democratic control : no taxation without representation . 
In brief , the introduction of a tissue tax would be both a fair and a wise way to redress the double standard that currently governs the collaborative biomedical research enterprise .
