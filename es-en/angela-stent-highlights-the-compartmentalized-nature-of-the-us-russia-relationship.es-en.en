No More Resets 
WASHINGTON , DC - With Ukraine in turmoil and the United States and Russia warily eyeing each other &apos;s every move , the world seems to be on the brink of a prolonged confrontation similar to the Cold War . 
But is it ? 
Russia , accusing the West of supporting a coup d &quot; Ã©tat by &quot; fascists &quot; and &quot; terrorists &quot; in Kyiv , has annexed Crimea , tested an inter-continental ballistic missile , and reserved the right to intervene militarily in eastern Ukraine to protect the Russian population there . 
The US has sanctioned Russia and called Crimea &apos;s annexation illegal . 
But it has also called for cooperation to resolve the situation peacefully and declared that Ukraine should pursue productive ties with both Russia and the West . 
So far , the Russians have dismissed those sentiments . 
Yet this is not the start of Cold War II , and Russia is not America &apos;s antagonist . 
But nor is it an ally . 
The two sides disagree on a wide range of questions . 
Yet there are critical international issues - such as Iran and Syria - on which progress is not likely without some cooperation . 
The challenge is not to try again to &quot; reset &quot; bilateral relations , but rather to find - once the Ukrainian crisis abates - a basis on which the two sides can collaborate where their interests overlap . 
But we have to be realistic . 
Every US President since 1992 has sought to refashion the US-Russian relationship and move it beyond the ideological and military competition of the Cold War . 
But each attempt , while producing some results , ended in disappointment . 
A key reason is that the US and Russia have fundamentally different understandings of what an improved relationship would look like . 
In reviewing these efforts , one constant stands out : the US has made the most progress on issues where Russia has felt that America respected its interests . 
The first diplomatic reset , at the end of George H.W. Bush &apos;s presidency , took major steps toward defusing the nuclear dangers resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
As a result , Russia remained the only nuclear state in the post-Soviet space , while legislation pioneered by then-US Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar helped to secure nuclear sites , scientists , and materials . 
The second reset , under President Bill Clinton , was more ambitious : a full-fledged effort to create a partnership that promoted substantial US involvement in Russia &apos;s economy and evolving political system . 
It also involved persuading a reluctant Russia to support two NATO interventions in the Balkans . 
But the second war over Kosovo in 1999 led to the collapse of that reset . 
The third reset came at Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s initiative , when he offered Russian assistance in the campaign in Afghanistan after the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
But the expectations of George W. Bush &apos;s administration were very different from Putin &apos;s . 
Russia sought an &quot; equal partnership of unequals , &quot; especially US recognition of Russia &apos;s sphere of influence in its neighborhood . 
Instead , Russia had to deal with the Iraq war , NATO enlargement to the Baltic states , pro-Western revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia , and the Bush administration &apos;s &quot; Freedom Agenda &quot; aimed at global democratization . 
The Kremlin viewed with great apprehension the specter of regime change , especially in its neighborhood . 
By the time this reset ended in the rubble of the 2008 Russia-Georgia war , the US had come to view Russia as a global spoiler . 
The Obama administration &apos;s reset - the fourth since the Soviet collapse - was the most successful , at least during the president &apos;s first term in office . 
With more realistic expectations , it achieved results : the New START arms control treaty , tougher sanctions on Iran , cooperation on transportation to and from Afghanistan , and Russia &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization . 
But this reset was largely facilitated by the personal ties between Obama and Dmitri Medvedev , who served as President for four years before Putin returned in 2012 for a third term . 
When Putin blamed the US for the opposition demonstrations that accompanied his return , the relationship began to deteriorate . 
With the Kremlin &apos;s decision last August to grant temporary asylum to the former US intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden , the reset ended . 
The ideological antagonism of the Cold War may be gone , but Russia now defines itself as an alternative civilizational and social model . 
Pointedly , Russia claims that it is a status quo power , contrasting itself with the US , which it calls a &quot; revisionist &quot; power seeking to destabilize the world by promoting regime change , especially in the Arab world . 
The Kremlin also views the US as a source of instability in the former Soviet space and blames the West for the Ukrainian unrest . 
Nonetheless , the US-Russia relationship has always been compartmentalized , and there are pressing multilateral issues on which the US must work with Russia , particularly Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan ( where the US will withdraw its troops this year ) . 
Whereas the US and Russia disagree about how to end the Syrian civil war , they have cooperated in disarming Syria of its chemical weapons . 
Similarly , neither side wants to see Iran develop a nuclear-weapons capability . 
The past two decades of bilateral great expectations , followed by serial disappointments , suggest that , once the Ukraine crisis is resolved , more modest and realistic US goals toward Russia are in order . 
Unless and until both countries move beyond the legacies of the Cold War , the 1990 &quot; s , and today &apos;s crisis , any reset - regardless of whether it originates in the White House or the Kremlin - can at best manage more effectively what will remain a limited and trying relationship . 
For the US , this means recognizing Russia for what it is : a large , still-important country with a hybrid political system and serious domestic economic , demographic , and political challenges . 
Russia &apos;s post-Soviet evolution is a matter of many decades and will not occur in a linear fashion . 
Its worldview is sharply at odds with that of the US and will remain so for the foreseeable future . 
But a cold peace is preferable to a cold war .
