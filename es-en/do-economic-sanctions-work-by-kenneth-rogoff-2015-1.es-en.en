Do Economic Sanctions Work ? 
CAMBRIDGE - With Western economic sanctions against Russia , Iran , and Cuba in the news , it is a good time to take stock of the debate on just how well such measures work . 
The short answer is that economic sanctions usually have only modest effects , even if they can be an essential means of demonstrating moral resolve . 
If economic sanctions are to play an increasingly important role in twenty-first-century statecraft , it might be worth reflecting on how they have worked in the past . 
As Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott note in their classic book on the topic , the history of economic sanctions goes back at least to 432 BC , when the Greek statesman and general Pericles issued the so-called &quot; Megarian decree &quot; in response to the abduction of three Aspasian women . 
In modern times , the United States has employed economic sanctions in pursuit of diverse goals , from the Carter administration &apos;s efforts in the 1970s to promote human rights , to attempts to impede nuclear proliferation in the 1980s . 
During the Cold War , the US also employed economic sanctions to destabilize unfriendly governments , especially in Latin America , though they do not appear to have played more than a minor role , even where regime change eventually occurred . 
Economic sanctions on Serbia in the early 1990s did not deter the invasion of Bosnia . 
Certainly , the US government &apos;s symbolic punishment of chess legend Bobby Fischer ( for playing a match in Belgrade that violated sanctions ) provided no relief for the besieged city of Sarajevo . 
The old Soviet Union played the sanctions game as well - for example , against China , Albania , and Yugoslavia . 
It , too , did not have much success , except perhaps in the case of Finland , which ultimately bent its policies to gain relief from sanctions imposed in 1958 . 
Most modern cases of sanctions pit a large country against a small country , though there are a few cases involving countries of equal size , such as the long quarrel , from the 1950s to the 1980s , between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar . 
As Hufbauer and Schott , among others , have illustrated , the effects of sanctions are often fairly disappointing - so much so that many scholars have concluded that such measures often are imposed so that governments can appear to domestic audiences to be &quot; doing something . &quot; 
Certainly , severe US sanctions on Cuba failed to bring the Castro regime to heel ; indeed , President Barack Obama &apos;s move to reestablish full diplomatic relations may have more effect . 
But sometimes sanctions do work . 
The strong international consensus to impose sanctions on South Africa in the 1980s eventually helped bring an end to apartheid . 
Likewise , sanctions have helped bring Iran to the bargaining table , though it is not clear how long its government will be willing to defer its nuclear ambitions . And the Russian economy today is in big trouble , though this might be described as a lucky punch , with the real damage being done by an epic collapse in global oil prices . 
Some in Russia , where the price collapse has hit government revenues hard , claim that the US and Saudi Arabia are conspiring to bring Russia to its knees . 
But that gives US strategists far too much credit . 
China &apos;s slowdown has helped precipitate a broad-based fall in commodity prices that is having a devastating effect on countries like Argentina and Brazil , with which the US authorities presumably have little quarrel . 
One of the major reasons economic sanctions have fallen short in the past is that not all countries have complied . 
Indeed , significant differences of domestic opinion in the imposing country often undermine sanctions as well . 
Moreover , countries imposing sanctions must be prepared to address their own vulnerabilities . 
North Korea is perhaps the most noxious regime in the world today , and one can only hope that its cruel government collapses sometime soon . 
The Kim regime has clung to power despite being subject to severe economic sanctions , perhaps because China , fearing a united Korea on its border , has not yet been willing to withdraw its support . 
Yet it is easy to forget that there are different viewpoints in international relations , even in the most extreme situations . 
Though North Korea &apos;s alleged attack on Sony Pictures &quot; computers has been rightly condemned , it must be admitted that from the perspective of the North Korean elite , their country simply applied economic retaliation much like anyone else does . 
Sony Pictures had produced a satire poking fun at North Korea &apos;s leader , the &quot; Young General &quot; Kim Jong-un . 
This was an intolerable affront , to which the elite responded with economic sabotage rather than military action . 
Let us also not forget that Russia , too , has deployed cyber attacks in the service of foreign-policy goals . 
Indeed , Russia has far more formidable hackers than North Korea ( though much of the top talent currently is employed in mafia rings , rather than in strategic operations ) . 
In a world where nuclear proliferation has rendered global conventional war unthinkable , economic sanctions and sabotage are likely to play a large role in twenty-first-century geopolitics . 
Rather than preventing conflict , Pericles &apos;s sanctions in ancient Greece ultimately helped to trigger the Peloponnesian War . 
One can only hope that in this century , wiser heads will prevail , and that economic sanctions lead to bargaining , not violence .
