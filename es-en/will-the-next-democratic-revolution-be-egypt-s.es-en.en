Will the Next Democratic Revolution Be Egypt &apos;s ? 
Responses to America &apos;s call for democracy in the Middle East have been tepid at best . 
Arab governments feel provoked by President George W. Bush , particularly as he announced his initiative with little regional consultation . 
Seeking to pre-empt American action , Egypt backed a counter-proposal , the Alexandria Declaration , at an Arab League summit last May , and followed this with President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s recent announcement that he will allow opposition candidates to challenge him for the presidency . 
Is this just another stalling tactic , or an opening to real reform ? 
What is clear is that the recent elections in Iraq and Palestine , together with the swelling protests against Syria &apos;s distorting influence on Lebanon &apos;s democracy , have reinvigorated debate about political reform within Egypt . 
Members of the opposition have argued that the country is compelled to reform itself if it is not to have reform imposed from abroad . 
Going further , the managing director of one newspaper claims that delaying political and constitutional reform as if it were a grant to citizens - rather than their right - would invite outside intervention in Egypt &apos;s domestic affairs . 
Arab democracy , he claims , has now become a domestic concern in the United States , which will make it hard for American presidents to sweep the abuses of friendly Arab regimes under the rug , as they did in the past . 
In the Arab world , authoritarian governments have deprived people of political , civil , and intellectual freedoms for decades . 
For young citizens , particularly Islamists , normal channels of political participation have been closed off . 
As a result , they have gravitated towards underground extremist movements . 
Poverty , cronyism , and official corruption heighten this popular frustration . 
In this climate , the momentum for political and constitutional reform in Egypt is gathering pace . 
There is great nostalgia for the last liberal experiment ( from the 1920 &quot; s until the 1952 Revolution ) , which was a model for other Arab countries . 
Egypt &apos;s vibrant political life , press , and liberal culture were then supported by an ideology of secular nationalism and improved religious harmony . 
There was a vibrant multiparty parliamentary democracy , with an independent judiciary and one of the world &apos;s earliest movements for female emancipation . 
The achievements and aspirations of that liberal experiment today unite Egyptians who favor reform . 
They have even inspired the birth of a new political party , Hizb al ghad ( the Party of Tomorrow ) , founded by a young parliamentarian committed to democratic reform . 
The party denies the argument that democracy will foster Islamic extremism and claims that it is the delay of reform that presents a major source of danger . 
Hizb al ghad recently produced a 48-page draft constitution , aimed at reviving Egypt &apos;s stagnant political life . 
Its preamble , which opens with the phrase &quot; We , the Egyptian people , &quot; can be read as a scathing attack on Egypt &apos;s current political order , and calls for an end to fear and despotism . 
Among the document &apos;s proposals is an end to the emergency rule imposed since President Anwar Sadat &apos;s assassination in 1981 . 
That seemingly endless &quot; emergency &quot; has resulted in the severe restriction , or even suspension , of individual and political liberties . 
Other provisions include curbing the far-reaching powers granted to the President in the 1971 constitution and introducing direct presidential elections with multiple candidates . 
The draft constitution would transform Egypt into a parliamentary republic . 
The dominant National Democratic Party ( NDP ) takes a different view , arguing that political change can be achieved without constitutional reform . 
The NDP appears to believe that democratization must begin with changing the political culture and instilling democratic values . 
These steps would precede concrete legal and constitutional reforms , such as those proposed by Hizb al ghad . 
So far , however , the NDP has missed every opportunity imaginable to gain popular support by proposing a reform program designed to bring real increases in public participation . 
This is one reason why Mubarak &apos;s call to hold a multi-candidate presidential election failed to galvanize Egypt &apos;s electorate . 
The government , indeed , prefers to offer only hollow initiatives focused narrowly on the economy . 
The conflict between the two visions of reform should not obscure the fact that there is a general consensus in Egypt : substantial reform of some kind is necessary and long overdue . 
Most importantly , liberal voices in Egypt are not merely a response to US democratic initiatives . 
They are a homegrown challenge to an entrenched political order , and they are riding a powerful historical current .
