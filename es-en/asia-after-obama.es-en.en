Asia After Obama 
NEW DELHI - US President Barack Obama &apos;s 10-day Asian tour and the consecutive summit meetings of the East Asian Summit ( EAS ) , the G-20 , and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) have helped shine a spotlight on Asia &apos;s challenges at a time when tensions between an increasingly ambitious China and its neighbors permeate the region &apos;s geopolitical landscape . 
Significantly , Obama restricted his tour to Asia &apos;s leading democracies - India , Indonesia , Japan , and South Korea - which surround China and are central to managing its rise . 
Yet he spent all of last year assiduously courting the government in Beijing in the hope that he could make China a global partner on issues ranging from climate change to trade and financial regulation . 
The catchphrase coined by US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg in relation to China , &quot; strategic reassurance , &quot; actually signaled America &apos;s intent to be more accommodating toward China &apos;s ambitions . 
Now , with his China strategy falling apart , Obama is seeking to do exactly what his predecessor attempted - to line up partners as an insurance policy in case China &apos;s rising power slides into arrogance . 
Other players on the grand chessboard of Asian geopolitics also are seeking to formulate new equations , as they concurrently pursue strategies of hedging , balancing , and bandwagoning . 
A fast-rising Asia has , moreover , become the fulcrum of global geopolitical change . 
Asian policies and challenges now help shape the international economy and security environment . 
But major power shifts within Asia are challenging the continent &apos;s own peace and stability . 
With the specter of strategic disequilibrium looming large in Asia , investments to help build geopolitical stability have become imperative . 
China &apos;s lengthening shadow has prompted a number of Asian countries to start building security cooperation on a bilateral basis , thereby laying the groundwork for a potential web of interlocking strategic partnerships . 
Such cooperation reflects a quiet desire to influence China &apos;s behavior positively , so that it does not cross well-defined red lines or go against the self-touted gospel of its &quot; peaceful rise . &quot; 
But building genuine partnerships is a slow process , because it demands major accommodation and adjustment on both sides . 
The US , for example , has worked hard in recent years to co-opt India in a &quot; soft alliance &quot; shorn of treaty obligations . 
Yet , despite a rapidly warming bilateral rapport and Obama &apos;s recent statement calling India the &quot; cornerstone of America &apos;s engagement in Asia , &quot; conflicting expectations and interests often surface . 
The US is now courting Vietnam as well , and the two countries are even negotiating a civilian nuclear deal . 
The Cold War legacy , however , continues to weigh down thinking in Hanoi and Washington to some extent . 
Within Vietnam &apos;s ruling Communist Party , there are deep divisions over the country &apos;s relations with the US . 
Even as Vietnam moves closer to the US as a hedge against China &apos;s muscular strategy , some Vietnamese leaders fear that the Americans remain committed to regime change . 
After all , despite Burma &apos;s strategic importance vis-Ã -vis China and Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s release from house detention , the US continues to enforce stringent sanctions against that country , with the aim of toppling its government . 
In the process , Burma has become more dependent than ever on China . 
The US-China relationship itself is likely to remain uneasy , but overt competition or confrontation suits neither side . 
For the US , China &apos;s rising power actually helps validate American forward military deployments in the Asian theater . 
The China factor also helps the US to retain existing allies and attract new ones , thereby enlarging its strategic footprint in Asia . 
While the US is thus likely to remain a key factor in influencing Asia &apos;s strategic landscape , the role of the major Asian powers will be no less important . 
If China , India , and Japan constitute a scalene strategic triangle in Asia , with China representing the longest side , side A , the sum of side B ( India ) and side C ( Japan ) will always be greater than A. Not surprisingly , the fastest-growing relationship in Asia today is probably between Japan and India . 
If this triangle turned into a quadrangle with the addition of Russia , China would be boxed in from virtually all sides . 
Japan plus Russia plus India , with the US lending a helpful hand , would not only extinguish any prospect of a Sino-centric Asia , but would create the ultimate strategic nightmare for China . 
As recent developments show , however , a Russian-Japanese rapprochement remains far off . 
Against this geopolitical background , Asia &apos;s power dynamics are likely to remain fluid , with new or shifting alliances and strengthened military capabilities continuing to challenge the prevailing order . 
That befits the year of the tiger in Chinese astrology - a year in which China roared by ratcheting up tensions with neighbors from Japan to India by escalating territorial feuds . 
In fact , 2010 will be remembered as the year that Chinese leaders undercut their country &apos;s own interests by kindling fears of an expansionist China , thereby facilitating America &apos;s return to center stage in Asia .
