Speculators at the Pumps 
WASHINTGTON , DC - Until a few weeks ago , while oil prices were surging , debate raged about the relative roles of economic fundamentals and speculation in boosting oil prices . 
Although oil prices have now fallen back from their peak , that debate must not be forgotten , for it has profound policy implications that government officials would be derelict to ignore . 
Of course , if higher prices are due to fundamentals , oil markets are working as they should . 
But if they are due to speculation , then policymakers speculators must act to rein in behavior that has imposed huge and needless costs on the global economy . 
And , when the evidence is confronted , it points to speculation as a culprit . 
Whereas many oil market participants have blamed speculation , most economists defend how oil markets have performed and point to economic fundamentals . 
One argument that economists use is that higher prices are due to the weak dollar . 
Because oil is priced in dollars , a weak dollar makes oil cheaper to users in other countries , which increases global demand . 
A second argument is that higher oil prices are due to lower interest rates and anticipations of higher long-term prices . 
That supposedly reduced supply by encouraging producers to store oil in the ground and pump it later . 
A third argument is that if speculation were to blame for price increases , there should have been an increase in oil inventories , because speculators do not consume oil but instead store it for later sale . 
Since there has been no rise in inventories , there has been no speculation . 
All three arguments are weak . 
The price of oil has risen far more than the dollar has fallen . 
That means that oil prices have increased in other countries , which should have reduced , not increased , demand . 
Moreover , it is high oil prices that weakened the dollar , not vice versa . 
This is because high oil prices raised inflation in the United States , worsened the US trade deficit , and increased the likelihood of a US recession by acting as a tax on consumer spending . 
Nor have there been any reports of unusual production cutbacks - the linchpin of the second argument . 
Indeed , the spike in oil prices actually gives independent producers an incentive to boost production . 
The last time real oil prices reached current levels was 1980 , which shows that hoarding oil in the ground can be bad business . 
OPEC also has a strong interest in maintaining production . 
It wants to keep prices lower to maintain the global economy &apos;s oil addiction and deter technological substitution of alternative energy sources . 
Finally , the storage argument fails to recognize different types of inventory . 
Thus , record-high speculative prices have likely caused bunker traders to release inventory , but those releases may have been purchased by speculators who are now active lessees of commercial storage capacity . 
The implication is that speculators can drive up prices and increase their inventory holdings even as total commercial inventories remain little changed . 
Additionally , oil market speculation may have induced &quot; echo speculation , &quot; whereby ultimate users buy refined products in advance to protect against future price hikes . 
They then take delivery on their premises so that overall refined inventories rise , but that increase is not part of reported commercial inventories . 
Proving that speculation is responsible for higher prices is always difficult , because it tends to occur against a background of strong fundamentals . 
However , there is considerable evidence that strongly indicates rampant speculation in today &apos;s oil markets . 
One key sign is the documented change in the character of oil trading , with speculators ( i.e. , financial institutions and hedge funds ) now accounting for 70 % of trades , up from 37 % seven years ago . 
With regard to market fundamentals , there have been no changes in demand and supply conditions that explain the scale of the unanticipated jump in oil prices . 
Moreover , the actual behavior of oil prices is consistent with speculation . 
In June , oil prices leapt by $ 11 in one day , and in July they fell back by $ 15 in three days . 
Such volatility does not fit a fundamentals-driven market . 
Despite the oil market &apos;s size , speculation can move prices because of the inelasticity of demand and supply . 
Oil demand is slow to change because of behavioral inertia and fixed technology , while adjusting production takes time . 
These features make the oil market vulnerable to speculation . 
Such speculative purchases may barely register in inventories , because the purchases are small compared to the overall market , and because of the global storage system &apos;s many margins of accommodation . 
As a result , speculatively driven high prices can persist for a considerable time before economic fundamentals bring them down , as finally seems to be happening . 
With prices falling , the imperative to act inevitably tends to recede . 
That is the nature of the behavioral response to crisis and why a bad status quo can persist . 
But leaving the system unchanged will maintain the global economy &apos;s vulnerability to future bouts of speculation that we cannot afford . 
Just consider how the current bout has raised global inflation , lowered incomes of the global poor , weakened the dollar , deepened the US trade deficit , aggravated global financial instability , and increased the likelihood of a global recession . 
That is an overwhelming indictment that merits urgent policy action .
