Water Risk on the Rise 
WASHINGTON , DC - Water is never far from the news these days . 
This summer , northern India experienced one of its heaviest monsoon seasons in 80 years , leaving more than 800 people dead and forcing another 100,000 from their homes . 
Meanwhile , Central Europe faced its worst flooding in decades after heavy rains swelled major rivers like the Elbe and the Danube . 
In the United States , nearly half the country continues to suffer from drought , while heavy rainfall has broken records in the Northeast , devastated crops in the South , and now is inundating Colorado . 
Businesses are starting to wake up to the mounting risks that water - whether in overabundance or scarcity - can pose to their operations and bottom line . 
At the World Economic Forum in Davos this year , experts named water risk as one of the top four risks facing business in the twenty-first century . 
Similarly , 53 % of companies surveyed by the Carbon Disclosure Project reported that water risks are already taking a toll , owing to property damage , higher prices , poor water quality , business interruptions , and supply-chain disruptions . 
The costs are mounting . 
Deutsche Bank Securities estimates that the recent US drought , which affected nearly two-thirds of the country &apos;s lower 48 states , will reduce GDP growth by approximately one percentage point . 
Climate change , population growth , and other factors are driving up the risks . 
Twenty percent of global GDP already is produced in water-scarce areas . 
According to the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) , in the absence of more sustainable water management , the share could rise to 45 % by 2050 , placing a significant portion of global economic output at risk . 
Companies know that sound risk-management strategies depend on solid data . 
When it comes to financial risks , data crunchers have access to vast amounts of information . 
But that has not been the case with water - until now . 
The World Resources Institute has joined with companies like Goldman Sachs , General Electric , and Shell to develop an online platform , called Aqueduct , to help measure and map water risks . 
Aqueduct uses the latest data and state-of-the-art modeling techniques to offer a rich , granular picture of water risks worldwide . 
Empowered with this data , companies can make better and more informed decisions . 
For example , CERES , a non-profit organization , has combined Aqueduct &apos;s water-stress maps with hydraulic fracturing data ( from FracFocus.org ) to find that nearly one-half of shale oil and gas wells in the US are located in areas with high water stress . 
Early next year , Aqueduct will offer future projections of water stress based on the latest scientific analysis , including predicted effects of climate change . 
Major companies are already seizing on water-risk data . 
McDonald &apos;s , for example , has asked more than 350 of its top supply-chain facilities to report on their water-risk exposure , using data from the Aqueduct tool . 
Incorporating water risk into McDonald &apos;s Environmental Scorecard is an important step in engaging suppliers not only on water efficiency , but also in overall stewardship , including cooperation with local watershed stakeholders . 
The international clothing company H &amp; M is working to reduce water-quality risk in its supply chain . 
Through its Cleaner Production Program , the company works with NGOs in Bangladesh and China to implement cost-saving improvements that reduce their fabric mills &quot; impact on local water quality . 
Similarly , the beverage company SABMiller is targeting a 25 % reduction in the water intensity of its beer production between 2008 and 2015 , and is now enhancing its water resilience throughout its global operations . 
Through its Water Futures Partnership , the company has identified which of its facilities are located in areas facing water-security risks and has created partnerships in the local watersheds to address these risks . 
The message is clear : water-risk management is shifting into the mainstream of business practices . 
More than 90 signatories of the United Nations Global Compact &apos;s CEO Water Mandate have pledged to develop , implement , and report on water-sustainability policies and practices in both their own and their suppliers &quot; operations , and to work with stakeholders beyond their own operations to address water risk . 
Leading companies are showing that sustainable water management benefits all involved . 
While many executives have traditionally underappreciated the risks from climate change and resource degradation , understanding water risk - and acting to minimize it - is just one way that businesses are starting to incorporate natural-resource management into their core strategy and operations . 
Smart business leaders are investing in new tools that can provide comprehensive and up-to-date data , and companies are increasingly moving beyond recognition of natural risks to developing strategic responses to them . 
As more companies do so , laggards will be at a growing competitive disadvantage . 
They , too , will have to act before the next flood or drought strikes .
