The Disuniting Kingdom ? 
Three hundred years after the first Scottish Parliament voluntarily voted itself out of existence in 1707 , the Scottish National Party has won a plurality in the devolved Scottish parliament that is one of Tony Blair &apos;s great legacies . 
Does an SNP-led government herald the break-up of the United Kingdom ? 
More broadly , does nationalism , that product of nineteenth-century politics , still have a role to play in Europe ? 
The answer to the first question is almost certainly no . 
Nationalist polled only 31.9 % of the votes cast with parties supporting the union polling 59.6 % . 
Proof positive that proportional representation can produce strange outcomes . 
Back in 1957 , the motive for &quot; laying the foundations of an ever closer union of the peoples of Europe &quot; was to make war between European nations obsolete , and , in doing so , to bring internal stability to all European nations . 
For 50 years , the European Union was not much tested by this mission because nationalist impulses were crushed between the two great Cold War alliances . 
With those constraints gone , nationalism in both its Bismarckian state-making and ethnic state-breaking guises has gotten a second wind . 
When people nowadays speak of nationalism , sinister images from another era come to mind . 
The break-up of the Soviet Union and its satellite empire shows that the way to address such a legacy is not to force unhappy peoples to live together in one country . 
It is to recognize that in some places divorce is inevitable , and to ensure that it is as amicable as possible . 
The world could not have prevented Yugoslavia &apos;s spiral into civil war , but it might have made it less cruel by helping to negotiate terms of separation earlier . 
Some suggest that the SNP &apos;s accession to power in Scotland does herald the rebirth of a nation , many others regard that claim as rhetoric which ignores the tremendous advances made in the quality of life , opportunity and living standards . 
If the claim were true it is a rebirth that is coming about in an extraordinary way . 
Except for some odd and hapless individuals , there have been no underground armies , separatist terrorists , campaigns of civil disobedience aimed at unseating governments , or even any mass demonstrations . 
The establishment of a Scottish Parliament vested with powers devolved from the United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster has been perhaps the first revolution of the modern era that was conducted by committees of lawyers , clergymen , and accountants rather than cells of bearded radicals . 
Moreover , it was achieved without a shot being fired . 
So it is not surprising that it has also been a revolution that - unlike that which divided Czechoslovakia 14 years ago - falls well short of achieving full statehood for Scotland . 
The Parliament at Westminster , to which Scots continue to elect MP &apos;s , still controls defense and foreign affairs , macroeconomic policy , taxation , and social security . 
The Scottish Parliament , however , is able to legislate over health services , education , local government , housing , criminal and civil justice , and economic development . 
It can also raise or lower the basic rate of income tax - though by no more than 3 % - and levy charges , such as road tolls . 
This semi-independence partly reflects the absence of linguistic motives in Scottish nationalism , unlike the Quebecois of Canada or Flemish nationalism in Belgium . 
Gaelic is spoken by only about 80,000 of Scotland &apos;s 5.1 million inhabitants . 
Nor does religion play a discernible role ; while Roman Catholics used to fear independence as being liable to result in Protestant hegemony , today Catholics and Protestants are roughly equal in their support of Scotland &apos;s institutions . 
Moreover , unlike East European or Balkan nationalism , the Scottish variety has little to do with ethnicity or religion . 
Thus , in Scotland today there are none of the conditions that fomented rebellion in Ireland and led to Irish independence in 1922 , the last great rupture in the political union of the British Isles . 
Scottish nationalists do look longingly at Ireland , but for its recent phenomenal economic growth . 
For most Scots , however , the Irish experience is not an appealing model - perhaps because it is associated with terrorism . 
They also know that the huge financial assistance which Ireland received form the European Union will never be repeated 
What motivates Scottish nationalism is the strong attachment to Scotland &apos;s civic institutions . 
In this respect , Scotland differs from Wales , which was forcibly incorporated into England more than 400 years before the Scots signed the voluntary Act of Union in 1707 . 
Distinctive Welsh institutions , apart from those concerned with the Welsh language , are difficult to identify . 
By contrast , Scotland &apos;s institutional landscape - schools and universities with their own curriculum and exam structures , a legal system with its own codes and rules , a church independent of the state , and a distinctive system of local government - were left untouched by the union . 
Today &apos;s Scottish parliament helps to dissipate Scottish discontents because it is revitalizing those institutions . 
Westminster &apos;s writ no longer runs north of the border , at least as far as things like education and health are concerned . 
Equally , it is now far harder for Scots to blame a distant government in London for their problems , although the SNP will now try to make blaming Westminster for all ills even more of an art form . 
So , far from being a harbinger of the break-up of Britain , devolution has brought fresh vitality to national life outside London . 
The new confidence in Edinburgh , which is experiencing an economic boom , is self-evident . 
What is arising is a different Scotland , and a different Britain , and this is Scotland &apos;s lesson for Europe . 
Britain &apos;s highly centralized political culture has been irreversibly changed . 
It is being replaced by a more diverse sort of politics , in which different regional and national identities gain encouragement and expression . 
By cooperating with the rest of the United Kingdom , rather than clashing , Scotland is giving new meaning to the phrase &quot; ever closer union . &quot;
