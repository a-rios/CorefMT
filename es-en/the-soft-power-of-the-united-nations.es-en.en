The Soft Power of the United Nations 
Joseph Stalin once dismissed the relevance of &quot; soft power &quot; by asking , &quot; How many troops does the Pope have ? &quot; 
Today , many self-styled realists dismiss the United Nations as powerless , and argue that it can be ignored . 
They are mistaken . 
Power is the ability to affect others to produce the outcomes one wants . 
Hard power works through payments and coercion ( carrots and sticks ) ; soft power works through attraction and co-option . 
With no forces of its own and a relatively tiny budget , the UN has only as much hard power as it can borrow from its member states . 
It was created in 1945 to be the servant of its member states , and Article 2.7 of its charter protects the sovereign jurisdiction of its members . 
After the failure of the League of Nations in the 1930 &quot; s , the UN was designed to have the Security Council &apos;s permanent members act as policemen to enforce collective security . 
When the great powers agreed , the UN had impressive hard power , as demonstrated in the Korean War and the first Gulf War . 
But such cases were exceptional . 
During the Cold War , the Council was divided . 
As one expert put it , its permanent members &quot; veto was designed to be like a fuse box in an electrical system : better that the lights go out than that the house burn down . 
Despite those limits , the UN has considerable soft power that arises from its ability to legitimize the actions of states , particularly regarding the use of force . 
People do not live wholly by the word , but neither do they live solely by the sword . 
For example , the UN could not prevent the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , but the absence of its imprimatur greatly raised the costs to the American and British governments . 
Some American leaders then tried to de-legitimize the UN and called for an alternative alliance of democracies . 
But they missed the point : Iraq policy had divided allied democracies , and , with its universal membership , the UN remained an important source of legitimacy in the eyes of most of the world . 
The greatest damage to the UN &apos;s legitimacy has been self-inflicted . 
For example , in recent years the internal bloc politics among its member states produced a Human Rights Council with little interest in fair procedures or the advance of human rights . 
Likewise , administrative inefficiency has led to poor performance of high-profile efforts like the oil-for-food program . 
The job of UN Secretary General involves very little hard power , but some people have filled the post with great effect , using their soft power resources to leverage the hard power of governments . 
For example , Dag Hammarskjold seized the opportunity of the Suez Crisis created by Britain and France &apos;s invasion of Egypt in 1956 to persuade governments to create peacekeeping forces - an institution that is not mentioned in the UN original charter . 
In the wake of the UN &apos;s failures to prevent genocide and ethnic cleansing in Rwanda and Kosovo in the 1990 &quot; s , Kofi Annan worked with others to persuade governments to recognize a new responsibility to protect endangered peoples . 
But such innovations have their limits . 
In the aftermath of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War , states turned once again to UN peacekeepers , as they have in dealing with the problems in the Congo and Darfur . 
But , while there are currently more than 100,000 troops from various nations serving in UN peacekeeping missions around the world , member states are not providing adequate resources , training , and equipment . 
Moreover , governments have found ways to delay effective international action , as has been the case in Sudan . 
It remains to be see whether China , concerned that its oil trade with Sudan might jeopardize the 2008 Olympics , will decide to exert more pressure . 
Similarly , while the General Assembly may have agreed that states have a &quot; responsibility to protect , &quot; many members agreed only in a very limited sense . 
Many developing countries , in particular , remain jealous of their sovereignty and fear that the new principle could infringe it . 
For example , in the aftermath of the recent government crackdown in Myanmar ( Burma ) , the Secretary General was able to send a representative to the country , but with powers limited to reporting and attempted mediation . 
That may be enough to influence some governments , but the Burmese junta recently expelled the UN &apos;s representative after he warned of &quot; a deteriorating humanitarian situation . &quot; 
The UN has impressive power - both hard and soft - when states agree on policies under Chapter 7 of the Charter . 
It has modest but useful soft power when great powers disagree but are willing to acquiesce in a course of action . 
And it has very little power when the great powers oppose an action , or repressive member governments ignore the claims of the new &quot; responsibility to protect . &quot; 
In such cases , it makes no sense to blame the UN . 
Soft power is real , but it has its limits . 
The fault lies not with the UN , but with the lack of consensus among member states .
