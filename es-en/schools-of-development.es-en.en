Schools of Development 
On September 21 , 1832 , in Boston &apos;s Franklin Hall , the first American woman to deliver a public lecture , Maria Stewart , shocked the town when she stood and spoke . 
What cause compelled her to abandon social norms and decorum so brazenly ? 
&quot; Daughters of Africa , awake ! 
Arise ! , &quot; she cried , as she demanded that the United States provide education for black girls . 
As so often turns out to be the case , our forebears were right . 
If Mrs. Stewart , herself an African-American , knew what we know about development today , her demand would be the same now as it was then . 
Every shred of evidence we &apos;ve accumulated over the past 30 years of academic and policy research , all the experience of our development efforts , confirm what our pioneering ancestors knew innately : education for all our children - poor , rich , white , black , boys , girls - means healthier babies , stronger families , wealthier economies , and more vibrant democracies . 
Ask leaders of the &quot; tiger &quot; economies of Southeast Asia their secret for rapid development , and they &apos;ll all tell you the same thing : first and foremost , we invested in our people . 
In its most basic form , that &apos;s what development is : investing in people and their welfare . 
So , where does the world stand now ? 
Roughly speaking , almost everyone in the rich countries , the formerly communist countries , and the Asian tigers is educated , with adult literacy rates approaching 100 % , as are people of means in the poor countries . 
The poor in poor countries , however , fare worse , as do some poor people in rich countries . 
With half of the world &apos;s 6 billion people living on $ 2 per day or less , the education gap remains stark . 
Indeed , reasonable estimates put the number of school-age children who are not attending school at 113 million , with 97 % living in developing countries . 
These numbers are bad , and they &apos;re getting worse . 
According to the UN &apos;s Human Development Report , one in five children in the world &apos;s poorest countries does not go to school , including a staggering 40 % of school-age kids in sub-Saharan Africa . 
In addition , the Human Development Report notes that 24 countries around the world are making insufficient or no progress - if not actually backsliding - in achieving the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education . 
One can only imagine how dire conditions may be in the 93 countries for which no data on the topic even exist . 
In the words of Mark Malloch-Brown , Administrator of the UN Development Program , &quot; We &apos;re losing the battle for primary education . &quot; 
In the 1990 &apos;s , we in the development community made a serious and costly blunder by pressuring national governments in developing countries to impose school fees in order to help achieve balanced budgets . 
Some research suggested that fees might be useful in decentralizing education - a laudable goal - and in helping poor countries to &quot; live within their means &quot; ( a nasty requirement in an age of global prosperity ) . 
In fact , the policy was a disaster for the world &apos;s most vulnerable children : any out of pocket costs for schooling meant no schooling at all . 
Recent evidence from Uganda and Kenya show just how costly this error was . 
In 2000 , upon receiving debt alleviation , Uganda chose to eliminate all school fees and says its number of schoolchildren nearly doubled thereafter . 
The new government of President Mwai Kibaki in Kenya announced his country would eliminate school fees , and within days an additional 1.2 million kids showed up for class . 
We know what to do to educate our children . 
We know that basic education should be a free public good . 
We know that school meals programs are a development marvel that do as much as anything else to increase enrollment while providing nutrition to the hungriest youngsters , markets for their fathers &apos; produce , and often jobs for village mothers . 
Innovative initiatives providing rural child care mean that girls can go to school , and basic public health provision - such as de-worming - attracts chronically sick children to the classroom for both learning and healing . 
Serious , exemplary work has already been done to outline local , national , and global solutions . 
The Dakar Education Forum , the World Bank &apos;s Education for All initiative , and the UN Millennial Development Program &apos;s Education Task Force all provide tremendous policy detail , with budgets , for those interested in action . 
Education ministries in Brazil , Uganda , and throughout many parts of the developing world know what works . 
What they all lack is dedicated political support from the world &apos;s powerful in government . 
The leaders of the G-7 will gather in Evian in a matter of days , looking for common cause and ways to heal a world rent by unspeakable violence . 
In a proud moment for Americans , last week President George W. Bush provided an example of strong leadership by demanding of Congress and US taxpayers significantly more money -  $ 15 billion to start - for health care for the poor . 
His counterparts in Europe and Japan should follow suit . 
The G-7 - representing the most empowered people in the world today - should decide that education will be the next international priority . 
President Bush and his wife Laura , herself a lover of books , have declared this US administration to be one devoted to education . 
Let them assume the leadership that we all see is possible , inspired anew by the opening words of Maria Stewart &apos;s historic speech : &quot; Oh , do not say you cannot make anything of your children ; but say , with the help and assistance of God , we will try . &quot;
