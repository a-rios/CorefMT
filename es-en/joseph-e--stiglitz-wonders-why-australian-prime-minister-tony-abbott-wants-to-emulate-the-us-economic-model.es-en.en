American Delusions Down Under 
NEW YORK - For better or worse , economic-policy debates in the United States are often echoed elsewhere , regardless of whether they are relevant . 
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott &apos;s recently elected government provides a case in point . 
As in many other countries , conservative governments are arguing for cutbacks in government spending , on the grounds that fiscal deficits imperil their future . 
In the case of Australia , however , such assertions ring particularly hollow - though that has not stopped Abbott &apos;s government from trafficking in them . 
Even if one accepts the claim of the Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff that very high public debt levels mean lower growth - a view that they never really established and that has subsequently been discredited - Australia is nowhere near that threshold . 
Its debt / GDP ratio is only a fraction of that of the US , and one of the lowest among the OECD countries . 
What matters more for long-term growth are investments in the future - including crucial public investments in education , technology , and infrastructure . 
Such investments ensure that all citizens , no matter how poor their parents , can live up to their potential . 
There is something deeply ironic about Abbott &apos;s reverence for the American model in defending many of his government &apos;s proposed &quot; reforms . &quot; 
After all , America &apos;s economic model has not been working for most Americans . 
Median income in the US is lower today than it was a quarter-century ago - not because productivity has been stagnating , but because wages have . 
The Australian model has performed far better . 
Indeed , Australia is one of the few commodity-based economies that has not suffered from the natural-resource curse . 
Prosperity has been relatively widely shared . 
Median household income has grown at an average annual rate above 3 % in the last decades - almost twice the OECD average . 
To be sure , given its abundance of natural resources , Australia should have far greater equality than it does . 
After all , a country &apos;s natural resources should belong to all of its people , and the &quot; rents &quot; that they generate provide a source of revenue that could be used to reduce inequality . 
And taxing natural-resource rents at high rates does not cause the adverse consequences that follow from taxing savings or work ( reserves of iron ore and natural gas cannot move to another country to avoid taxation ) . 
But Australia &apos;s Gini coefficient , a standard measure of inequality , is one-third higher than that of Norway , a resource-rich country that has done a particularly good job of managing its wealth for the benefit of all citizens . 
One wonders whether Abbott and his government really understand what has happened in the US ? 
Does he realize that since the era of deregulation and liberalization began in the late 1970s , GDP growth has slowed markedly , and that what growth has occurred has primarily benefited those at the top ? 
Does he know that prior to these &quot; reforms , &quot; the US had not had a financial crisis - now a regular occurrence around the world - for a half-century , and that deregulation led to a bloated financial sector that attracted many talented young people who otherwise might have devoted their careers to more productive activities ? 
Their financial innovations made them extremely rich but brought America and the global economy to the brink of ruin . 
Australia &apos;s public services are the envy of the world . 
Its health-care system delivers better outcomes than the US , at a fraction of the cost . 
It has an income-contingent education-loan program that permits borrowers to spread their repayments over more years if necessary , and in which , if their income turns out to be particularly low ( perhaps because they chose important but low-paying jobs , say , in education or religion ) , the government forgives some of the debt . 
The contrast with the US is striking . 
In the US , student debt , now in excess of $ 1.2 trillion ( more than all credit-card debt ) , is becoming a burden for graduates and the economy . 
America &apos;s failed financial model for higher education is one of the reasons that , among the advanced countries , America now has the least equality of opportunity , with the life prospects of a young American more dependent on his or her parents &quot; income and education than in other advanced countries . 
Abbott &apos;s notions about higher education also suggest that he clearly does not understand why America &apos;s best universities succeed . 
It is not price competition or the drive for profit that has made Harvard , Yale , or Stanford great . 
None of America &apos;s great universities are for-profit-institutions . 
They are all not-for-profit institutions , either public or supported by large endowments , contributed largely by alumni and foundations . 
There is competition , but of a different sort . 
They strive for inclusiveness and diversity . 
They compete for government research grants . 
America &apos;s under-regulated for-profit universities excel in two dimensions : the ability to exploit young people from poor backgrounds , charging them high fees without delivering anything of value , and the ability to lobby for government money without regulation and to continue their exploitative practices . 
Australia should be proud of its successes , from which the rest of the world can learn a great deal . 
It would be a shame if a misunderstanding of what has happened in the US , combined with a strong dose of ideology , caused its leaders to fix what is not broken .
