Democratic Hysteria 
BERKELEY - In the political impasses that recently paralyzed the world &apos;s two largest democracies , India and the United States , both countries &quot; usually clear-sighted leaders , to paraphrase William Butler Yeats , lacked all conviction , while the misguided and the shallow were full of passionate intensity . 
Indeed , that passion shows little sign of waning . 
In the US , the economically illiterate , seeing misery all around from lost jobs , foreclosed homes , and the ever more apparent decline in America &apos;s international status , are distilling their frenzy from obsolete advocates of fiscal rectitude , while clutching their Bibles and espousing a juvenile understanding of the US constitution . 
But their efforts are only digging a bigger hole for the US economy , making recovery much more difficult . 
Even their tax-averse sponsors , while appreciative of the rabble &apos;s efforts to protect their wealth , are now fearful of the impact of these wayward ideas on the investment climate and equity prices . 
President Barack Obama , elected with a great deal of goodwill and hope in 2008 , is now caught like a deer in the headlights . 
He knows that what the economy needs in the short run is different from what needs to be done to manage public debt in the long run , but he is unable to provide decisive leadership . 
His misguided efforts at compromise only fuel his opponents &quot; frenzy . 
In India , Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , who once enjoyed a strong reputation for integrity and intelligence , has been similarly paralyzed , acting erratically in the face of an equally demagogic populist movement - the anti-graft crusade led by a fasting activist , Anna Hazare - which just ended in a frantic and uneasy compromise . 
Hazare , egged on by a flag-waving and indignant urban middle class and sensation-seeking media , tries mightily to claim Mahatma Gandhi &apos;s mantle ; he is good at mimicking Gandhi &apos;s piety , but lacks his root wisdom . 
Low-level corruption ( the police , courts , and government clerks ) has always been widespread in India . 
The type of corruption that has increased in recent years is partly a consequence of rapid economic growth . 
Public resources , like land , minerals , and hydrocarbons , and the telecommunications spectrum , have shot up in value , and in the scramble to control them , businessmen seek shortcuts . 
Another reason for rising corruption is the soaring expense of elections , with politicians raising money from business as part of a quid pro quo . 
Both India and the US have little public financing of elections , and large business donations that are legal in the US are often illegal ( and hence given underhandedly ) in India . 
But , instead of addressing the structural causes of rising corruption , India &apos;s anti-graft movement bemoans a supposed weakening of ethical values and demands additional agencies with draconian powers to monitor and punish . 
The urban middle classes , impatient with the slow processes of democracy , latch on to holy men and their magic potions . 
Just as in the US , public rage is somehow directed away from the rich bribe-givers and onto venal politicians . 
In both countries , the long-run implications of such angry populist movements for the health of democratic institutions need to be pondered . 
This is particularly true for India , where elections are vigorous and common people participate in them more enthusiastically than in the US , but other democratic institutions remain weak and sometimes dysfunctional , and the judiciary is too slow and occasionally corrupt . 
To loud cheers from the crowds , the populists damn elected politicians as thieves and looters , but in the process disparage the institutions and processes of representative government . 
In the not-too-distant past , widespread denigration of this sort in Africa , Latin America , and other parts of South Asia often made it easier for populist authoritarianism to take hold . 
Indeed , the widely heard slogan &quot; Anna is India , India is Anna &quot; reminds some of the dark days of Indira Gandhi &apos;s emergency rule in 1975-1977 , when her followers raised the slogan of &quot; Indira is India . &quot; 
But the slogan-mongers overlook India &apos;s extreme diversity . 
Many members of ethnic minorities , including the country &apos;s 150 million Muslims , openly oppose the Hazare movement . 
One Dalit ( the lowest level of India &apos;s old caste system ) leader expressed his fear that Anna &apos;s success might inspire some majoritarian leader to rouse an even larger movement to rescind the protective rights and affirmative-action policies that have brought the lower castes some dignity . 
And some NGO leaders object that their own , very different anti-corruption agenda is being pre-empted by Hazare &apos;s demands . 
In a populous country , it is not difficult to attract a large crowd . 
The electronic media are particularly attracted to colorful crowds waving flags and espousing nationalist causes . 
As one journalist pointed out , when 400,000 people ( far more than Hazare &apos;s followers in Delhi ) marched in Kolkata in May 1998 to protest against the government &apos;s nuclear tests , the media barely noticed . 
Even when movements have near-universal support ( which is not the case with the recent political movements in the US or India ) , there is a fundamental tension between democracy &apos;s procedural and participatory aspects . 
Apart from electoral reform , outlets for political participation and expression of public grievances must be balanced by institutions and procedures that are partly insulated from the rough-and-tumble of politics . 
Of course , representative government does sometimes become unresponsive , particularly between elections , but direct democracy is not the solution . 
The US state of California , which has become increasingly dysfunctional since a 1978 popular referendum capped property taxes , can attest to that . 
Nor is it an answer to demand hasty enactment of legislation in the face of a threat to cause public disorder by starving oneself to death , as Anna Hazare has done . 
Most citizens in the world &apos;s two largest democracies understand that democracy does not offer magic solutions . 
One of the most lamentable developments of our time is that so many are now prepared to try unhealthy palliatives and short cuts .
