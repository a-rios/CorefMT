Saving France , Saving Europe 
PARIS - The face of French politics changed dramatically in May and June . 
First , after 17 years of center-right presidents , François Hollande , a Socialist , was elected . 
Then , a month later , a center-left majority took control of the National Assembly , too , after ten years of right-wing domination . 
Meanwhile , the Senate , the French parliament &apos;s upper house , a conservative bastion between the two world wars and ever since , swung to a Socialist majority for the first time in history at the end of 2011 . 
The Socialists also control 20 of France &apos;s 22 regional governments , a majority of the presidencies of the Departments , and most cities with more than 30,000 inhabitants . 
In short , we are now witnessing a stunning concentration of power that is unprecedented in French republican history . 
All of this occurred very peacefully , with no wave of triumphalism , or even much enthusiasm . 
Indeed , the abstention rate for a presidential election had never been higher before the contest between Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy . 
France &apos;s profound political shift reflects the persistence of the economic crisis that began in 2008 . 
French electors did not vote for a dream . 
The Socialist Party &apos;s program and its presidential candidate &apos;s campaign promises were considerably less ambitious than they were in 1981 , when François Mitterrand was elected . 
As a result , the campaign was quiet , almost cautious . 
Indeed , most candidates , notably Sarkozy and Hollande , might have been too cautious : the current crisis and possible future threats received little emphasis , which means that it may be difficult for Hollande to claim a mandate for any painful reforms that he will have to propose . 
And now there is no escape from the difficult reality that the budget deficit remains massive , at more than 4 % of GDP in 2011 . 
Except for creating 60,000 new jobs in education ( following controversial cuts last year ) and restoring the right ( rescinded under Sarkozy ) to retire at 60 for roughly 200,000 individuals , Hollande &apos;s administration has barely any room to maneuver , and severe economic measures will have to be introduced in the 2013 budget . 
Moreover , France &apos;s rapidly worsening foreign-trade deficit is boosting already-excessive debt levels , while output is falling and unemployment is rising . 
Unfit for modern markets , France &apos;s tax system actually stifles the country &apos;s businesses , reflected in a disturbing increase in bankruptcies among small and medium-size companies . 
In such conditions , France urgently needs to restore and maintain economic growth , and should seek to coordinate its policies with those of other eurozone member countries . 
After all , because most of the eurozone &apos;s 17 member states suffer from heavy debt burdens , they are all anxious to find fiscally responsible ways to promote growth . 
Unfortunately , the eurozone &apos;s institutions lack the powers needed to defend the monetary union effectively . 
Greek debt amounts to less than 2 % of European GDP . 
Had the European Central Bank been entitled to deploy enough firepower when the Greek crisis first erupted , the threat would have lasted only two hours . 
Instead , it took three weeks to grant the ECB only partial authorization to act , causing speculation to take hold and spread to Portuguese , Spanish , and Italian debt , thereby jeopardizing the euro &apos;s survival . 
Removing the risk of a euro implosion - which , given massive global imbalances , derivatives markets run amok , and the colossal scale of America &apos;s budget deficit , could catalyze a major international crash - presupposes two fundamental changes in Europe . 
The first is political and involves sovereignty : Full European solidarity can be achieved only through stronger fiscal and monetary federalism , which would enable the eurozone to act , despite minority dissent . 
Europe has succeeded in missing this goal for a half-century ; now it has no choice but to shoot straight . 
The second change involves economic doctrine . 
If markets self-correct , they do so only when defaults are registered and punished . 
But countries and their public services cannot default without inflicting severe pain on entire populations . 
Europe urgently needs an economic doctrine that , despite today &apos;s deficits , preserves funding for the investments and research that promote growth . 
Here , Germany &apos;s leaders , in particular , need convincing . 
Hollande , backed by Spain and Italy , accomplished a small step in that direction at June &apos;s European Union summit , which finally endorsed the idea of a banking union . 
It is only the beginning , but Europe must start somewhere . 
So must France , whose great concerns can be resolved solely within the EU - and only if the EU carries out the essential political and economic changes that all of its members need .
