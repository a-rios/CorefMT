America and Europe 
Deeply frustrated by the Bush administration &apos;s policies , many people and governments in Europe hope for a fundamental change in American foreign policy after the upcoming presidential election . 
But it would take a medium-sized political miracle for these hopes not to be disappointed , and such a miracle will not happen - whoever is elected . 
The Bush administration made numerous foreign-policy blunders with far-reaching consequences . 
But Bush neither invented American unilateralism nor triggered the transatlantic rift between the United States and Europe . 
To be sure , Bush reinforced both trends , but their real causes lie in objective historical factors , namely America &apos;s being the sole world power since 1989 and Europe &apos;s self-inflicted weakness . 
As long as America remains the sole world power , the next US President will be neither able nor willing to change the basic framework of America &apos;s foreign policy . 
It will , of course , be important who wins the presidency : a candidate expected to continue Bush &apos;s foreign policy or someone ready for a new beginning . 
In the former case , the transatlantic rift will deepen dramatically . 
Four , or even eight , more years of US policy Ã  la Bush would inflict such damage on the substance of the transatlantic alliance as to threaten its very existence . 
But if America &apos;s next president is committed to a new direction , US foreign policy might again become more multilateral , more focused on international institutions and alliances , and willing to bring the relationship between military force and diplomacy back to within its historical proportions . 
That is the good news . 
The bad news is that , even under such auspicious conditions , the US , as a world power , will not relinquish its &quot; free-hand &quot; policy or forget its strength and its claim to preeminence among nations . 
Another piece of bad ( or good ? ) news is that a more multilateral American policy will increase the pressure on Europeans to take on more responsibility for international crisis management and conflict resolution - in Afghanistan , Iran , Iraq , the Middle East , Transcaucasia , and Russia , and with respect to Turkey &apos;s future . 
To this common agenda , the Europeans should add Africa , climate change , and reform of the United Nations and the world trading system . 
For a long time , Europe has underestimated its weight and importance . 
Europe &apos;s geopolitical , economic , and social weight is quite obvious . 
But Europe &apos;s integration of sovereign states &quot; interests by means of common institutions could also be an example for much of the world . 
In particular , the way Europe , in the process of its enlargement , has projected its power to achieve lasting peace across the whole continent , and fostered development by integrating entire economies , states , and societies within its institutional framework , could become a model for shaping a cooperative world order in the twenty-first century . 
This modern , progressive , and peaceful model is unique and superior to all other currently available approaches to the fundamental questions of political order . 
But could doesn &apos;t mean will . 
Europe &apos;s global influence is feeble because of its internal quarrels and lack of unity , which render the European Union weak and limit its ability to act . 
Objectively strong , subjectively infirm - that is how the EU &apos;s present condition can be described . 
The current moment of American weakness coincides with a substantially changed international political environment , defined largely by the limits of US power , Europe &apos;s ineffectiveness , and the emergence of new global giants like China and India . 
In light of these developments , does it still make sense to speak of &quot; the West &quot; ? 
I believe it does , more than ever , because the rift between Europe and America leaves both sides substantially weaker in global terms . 
The unilateral overstretching of American power offers a chance for a new beginning in US-European relations . 
America , more than in the past , will depend on strong partners and will seek such partnerships . 
So what are the Europeans waiting for ? 
Why not start now to overcome the traditional tension between NATO and the EU - especially as French policy toward NATO under President Nicolas Sarkozy has been moving in the right direction ? 
A regular mutual presence of the Secretary General of NATO and of the head of EU foreign policy in the councils of both organizations doesn &apos;t require much time and effort . 
Why not initiate EU-US consultations at a high political level ( with the Secretary-General of NATO participating in security matters ) - for instance , by inviting the US Secretary of State and other members of the administration , such as the Treasury Secretary or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , to sit several times a year on the appropriate EU Council meetings ? 
Why not have routine annual meetings between the European Council and the US President ? 
Periodic meetings between the appropriate committees of the US Congress and the European Parliament would also be of great importance , as ultimately both bodies will have to ratify any international treaties . 
The fate of the Kyoto Protocol should be a lesson to all parties involved . 
No such US-EU consultations would require any new agreements , so they could start without any further preliminaries . 
There is one certainty that Europeans can take home from the US election campaign even today : with a more multilaterally oriented US foreign policy , Europe won &apos;t be riding comfortably in the US world-political slipstream much longer . 
And that is a good thing . 
The new transatlantic formula must be greater say in decision-making in exchange for a greater share of responsibility .
