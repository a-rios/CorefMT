Cuba Comes in from the Cold 
WASHINGTON , DC - A few years ago , it would have been difficult to imagine Cuba knocking at the doors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 
Now , with the United States having just restored diplomatic ties with the island after more than a half-century of enmity , it seems to be only a matter of time before it joins both institutions - to the benefit of all involved . 
Membership in the IMF is a precondition for joining the World Bank , and the advantages that Cuba could gain from membership in the latter are easy to see . 
Cuba is rightly proud of its social achievements , but ensuring that they remain sustainable will require that its economy continues to grow . 
All of this requires raising capital . 
And , though Cuba could ( and possibly should ) seek financial support from sources other than the World Bank , there are problems with many of the multilateral alternatives . 
The Andean Development Corporation &apos;s financial support could be limited . The procedures for accession to the BRICS countries &quot; New Development Bank are not yet established . 
But state-to-state loans usually include conditions that are less transparent than those attached to funds from rules-based international financial institutions . 
Moreover , none of these other potential sources of financing would match the World Bank &apos;s technical support . 
Likewise , joining the IMF could yield tangible benefits for Cuba . 
The country &apos;s balance of payments is under chronic strain , and attracting foreign direct investment - including from the Cuban diaspora - would be easier if the country could bring its reforms to fruition and rationalize its complex exchange rates . 
Cuba prints two currencies , the convertible peso ( paired one-to-one with the US dollar ) and the Cuban peso ( pegged at 24 to the dollar ) . 
In addition , there are also several special exchange rates - for things like oil purchases , imports for hotels , and export revenues . 
Rationalizing its exchange rates would strengthen Cuba &apos;s competitiveness and increase its exports . 
Prices and salaries would be significantly affected , and the authorities would need to make the case that the long-term gains will eventually outweigh the intermediate hardships . 
Persuasion alone , however , will not suffice . 
Preserving social consensus for economic reforms will also require active fiscal policies . 
It takes more time to build up skills and open trade opportunities than it does to lay off workers and shut down inefficient firms . 
Cuba could use the IMF &apos;s financial assistance and technical advice as it compensates short-term losers , retrains the unemployed , and supports new businesses . 
The World Bank and the IMF would also benefit from admitting Cuba - which currently is the most conspicuous exception to both institutions &quot; near-universal membership . 
Given that combating poverty is its overarching goal , the World Bank should be interested in helping Cuba preserve its social achievements and supporting its transition from a centralized planned economy to one with an entrepreneurial private sector . 
For the IMF , Cuba &apos;s membership would fit squarely into its mission of facilitating international trade and eliminating the foreign-exchange restrictions that hamper it . 
Cuba may or may not be politically ready to join the international financial institutions , but it clearly meets the conditions needed to apply for accession to the IMF . 
Cuba is a &quot; country , &quot; with the attributes of statehood as defined by international law . 
Its government should have no problem demonstrating that it is willing and able to fulfill the obligations of membership contained in the IMF &apos;s articles of agreement . 
Indeed , Cuba was one of the IMF &apos;s founding members , before voluntarily leaving the organization in 1964 . 
The process for accession is relatively simple . 
Determining Cuba &apos;s quota is the crux of the accession process , and the country will need to choose an executive director to represent its interests during that discussion . 
Theoretically , Cuba could choose any of the current 24 executive directors , though it is likely to prefer one from Latin America . 
Cuba &apos;s application will require the support of a simple majority of the IMF &apos;s executive board . 
Although the US does not have enough votes to block Cuba &apos;s admission on its own , it wields enough influence to derail the process . 
So Cuba will need to obtain , at the very least , American acquiescence . 
Assuming the US raises no objections , the board &apos;s decision to proceed with Cuba &apos;s application will be followed by the establishment of an ad hoc committee of executive directors , including the one chosen by Cuba to represent its interests . 
This committee will use the background paper prepared by the IMF to determine Cuba &apos;s initial quota , as well as the other terms and conditions of membership . 
If Cuba agrees with the committee &apos;s proposal , the chairman will submit its recommendation for Cuba &apos;s accession to the board , where once again a simple majority is required . 
The last hurdle would be a resolution that obtains the support of the majority of the IMF &apos;s board of governors . 
Arrangements would then be made to sign the IMF &apos;s Articles of Agreement . 
In the case of Cuba , this ceremony would have special resonance , as it normally takes place at the US Department of State , where the original document is held . 
Having signed , Cuba would once again formally become a member of the IMF , at which point it would be automatically entitled to membership in the World Bank .
