Trust Negotiations , Not Iran 
North Korea &apos;s agreement to give up its military nuclear programme was a huge success for the international community . 
Admittedly , the country &apos;s dire economic condition and its urgent need for energy made the agreement venal in a way . 
French President Jacques Chirac recently implied that we should not overestimate the seriousness of Iran &apos;s possessing nuclear weapons . 
I disagree . 
It is true that possessing does not mean using ; that for 15 years the world has had eight nuclear powers ; and that nuclear force has not been used since 1945 . 
So , what can we do ? 
First , resorting to force is simply not realistic . 
A nuclear strike would have incalculable consequences , and the Muslim world would in this case stand together . 
Nor is a conventional attack possible , as Israel has no common border with Iran and most of the American army is tied down in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Exploring diplomatic avenues is therefore absolutely necessary . 
Success would be guaranteed if the international community , especially the United States , clearly understands and admits its necessity , and supports it firmly and completely . 
For example , economic sanctions , to which Iran is very sensitive , could be tightened , with a commitment not to resort to military force facilitating Russian and Chinese approval . 
The only possible framework for negotiations is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , concluded in 1968 . 
Iran was one of the first countries to sign , and it cooperated with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) for more than 30 years - a relationship that deteriorated only in the last three years . 
The West &apos;s aim , announced by the US and followed by the triad , is to force Iran to give up uranium enrichment . 
Yet the NPT is clear : any signatory country that gives up nuclear weapons and accepts the IAEA &apos;s absolute and unconditional control is entitled to produce electric energy from civil nuclear sources , and to receive from the international community , if necessary , technical and financial support . 
Iran &apos;s oil resources are not infinite , and it wants to have complete control over the civil nuclear field - a basic right as an NPT signatory . 
I cannot see how a negotiation aimed at getting Iran to renounce unilaterally a right recognized for all NPT signatories simply in order to build confidence in the West could be successful . 
Uranium enrichment is certainly the first condition for making bombs , but the level of enrichment must reach about 95 % , compared to 3.5 % for energy production . 
Are the international scientific community and the IAEA really incapable of providing indicators and criteria that would allow the international community to differentiate between two types of industrial operations ? 
For example , forty years ago , when fear of nuclear proliferation was new , my teacher and friend Vassili Leontief , who invented the macroeconomic table of inter-industrial flows , argued that the best indicator of an illegal arms program is massive electricity consumption . 
Nor has the Iranian government ever publicly expressed a will to possess nuclear weapons . 
In fact , it has offered several times to accept IAEA monitoring and has suggested that its civil nuclear program would be carried out with international cooperation . 
So far , the West has rejected everything , on the pretext that any uranium enrichment would indicate a military program . 
Although this stance is technically wrong , it is strategically rational , given the West &apos;s wariness regarding Iran &apos;s true intentions . 
I recently met in Paris with Iran &apos;s ambassador to France , and I began brusquely : &quot; So , you really want this bomb , Ambassador ? &quot; 
His answer deserves consideration . 
If we had the bomb , the relationships with all our neighbors would immediately deteriorate . &quot; 
As everybody knows , ambassadors are paid to lie . 
The West &apos;s wariness is well founded , and we have no reason to renounce our mistrust . 
If we interpret the NPT correctly , we can launch negotiations with Iran that would carefully explore the potential sincerity or not of its official stance .
