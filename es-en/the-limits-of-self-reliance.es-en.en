The Limits of Self-Reliance 
Being President of an African nation isn &apos;t easy . 
Fifteen months ago , my government was freely elected to office . 
No honeymoon period greeted us . 
Instead , we faced a catastrophic economic situation : runaway inflation , unsustainably high interest rates , a collapsed currency , and a general loss of confidence . 
Under the circumstances , my government took hard decisions and took them quickly . 
We committed ourselves to spending only what we have or can reasonably expect to have . 
We proceeded with caution and pragmatism in the management of the exchange rate of our currency and our monetary affairs , leading to a measure of stability . 
I can claim credit for modest successes , but Ghana needs more than modest successes . 
Ghana was the first sub-Saharan nation to win its independence from a colonial power , in 1957 . 
Yet the average per capita income of my people is lower now than in the 1960s , a decade after independence . 
Many of our families subsist on less than one dollar a day . 
Our galloping rate of population growth overwhelms our schools and hospitals . 
Endemic diseases threaten us all , but especially our children . 
Some of the blame for this we Ghanaians must accept . 
My country must acknowledge that corruption has been a canker on our public and economic life and must be contained . 
Corruption distorts the truth and saps the confidence and enthusiasm of Ghana &apos;s friends . 
We know that the fight against corruption is no easy battle , but we have joined that battle and will do our best to minimize corruption as much as possible . 
As a country , Ghana needs more trade , but the truth is that we do not have much to trade with . 
There has been no diversification in our economy over the years . 
One hundred years ago , our trading was limited to the supply of raw materials , mainly gold , timber and cocoa . 
One hundred years later , our trading consists of raw materials , mainly gold , timber and cocoa . 
Even though we have fertile land , water and hardworking people , somehow we have not managed to master the process of adding value to what we produce and have , as a consequence , been reduced to being at the whim of the world &apos;s unpredictable and capricious commodity markets . 
Our agricultural practices are ancient and require urgent and wholesale modernization . 
We pay $ 100 million a year to import rice we do not grow . 
Irrigation should be the key to growing all the rice we need and yet we lose opportunities to irrigate . 
One of our dams , the Kpong , each day sends 5 million gallons of fresh water into the Atlantic despite the fact that on one side of the river the land lies arid and the people are mired in poverty . 
The same situation applies to other rivers in our country . 
The reality of our situation can be spelt out in even more graphic terms . 
In a globalized world where instant communications drives economic success , Ghana a nation of 19 million people has only 250,000 fixed phone lines . 
My point is not only to advertise our backwardness , but to explain that at Ghana &apos;s current rate of development it is almost impossible to generate the necessary revenues from our own resources to finance our plans and needs . 
That is not because my government is not willing or able to do what is required of it . 
Costs are rising for consumers . 
Electricity , water , petroleum products and many other consumer basics are seeing double-digit increases , partly as a result of a decrease in government subsidies . 
Electricity prices , for instance , have doubled , while fuel for cars has risen 64 % . 
My government is looking for ways to raise revenue to pay for services , but it is unrealistic and even negative to exact more taxes from an already overburdened people . 
Ghana needs foreign donors to plug the gap in its finances and assist us in standing on our own two feet . 
To adapt the Chinese proverb , we want help to learn how to fish , rather than to be given fish for food . 
We want Ghana to become a beacon in West Africa . 
We want to show that good governance and growth will help to eradicate poverty and the instability that has characterized our region for so long . 
We believe the Ghana story can become an example of how , with inspired leadership , a determined people in Africa can transform their country within one generation . 
I must admit that Ghana &apos;s path towards self-reliance has not been smooth . 
I am painfully aware that our past can be characterized by one step forward and two steps backward . 
This time , however , we are determined not to slip up .
