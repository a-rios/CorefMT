The End of German Hegemony 
BRUSSELS - Without anyone quite noticing , Europe &apos;s internal balance of power has been shifting . 
Germany &apos;s dominant position , which has seemed absolute since the 2008 financial crisis , is gradually weakening - with far-reaching implications for the European Union . 
Of course , from a soft-power perspective , the mere fact that people believe Germany is strong bolsters the country &apos;s status and strategic position . 
But it will not be long before people begin to notice that the main driver of that perception - that Germany &apos;s economy continued to grow , while most other eurozone economies experienced a prolonged recession - represents an exceptional circumstance , one that will soon disappear . 
In 12 of the last 20 years , Germany &apos;s growth rate been lower than the average of the other three large eurozone countries ( France , Italy , and Spain ) . 
Although German growth surged ahead during the post-crisis period , as the graph shows , the International Monetary Fund predicts that it will fall back below that three-country average - and far below the eurozone average , which includes the smaller high-growth countries of Central and Eastern Europe - within five years . 
To be sure , Germany still has some apparent advantages . 
But a closer examination shows that they are not quite as positive as they seem . 
For starters , Germany is close to full employment - in sharp contrast to the double-digit unemployment rates that prevail in much of the eurozone . 
But the combination of full employment and low growth rates actually points to an underlying problem : very slow productivity growth . 
Add to that a shrinking pool of workers capable of meeting the needs of Germany &apos;s labor market - the country &apos;s population is aging , and the arriving refugees lack the needed skills - and the German economy seems set for a protracted period of sluggish performance . 
Another apparent advantage is Germany &apos;s large financial reserves , which not only cushioned it from the crisis , but also conferred upon it considerable political sway . 
Indeed , because German funds were indispensable in bailing out the eurozone &apos;s deeply stressed periphery , the country became central to all efforts to address the crisis . 
Germany &apos;s consent was needed to create Europe &apos;s &quot; banking union , &quot; which entailed the transfer of supervisory powers to the European Central Bank and the creation of a common fund to resolve failing banks . 
And German resistance contributed to a delay in the ECB &apos;s intervention in bond markets ; when the ECB finally did launch its bond-buying program , it did so with Germany &apos;s tacit approval . 
But now that interest rates are at zero , Germany &apos;s large savings are no longer doing it much good . 
And with the financial storm having largely abated , Germany lacks new opportunities to demonstrate its political clout , both within and outside the eurozone . 
Indeed , whereas Germany , owing to its deep involvement in Central and Eastern European economies , was a key player in the Minsk agreements that were meant to end the conflict in Ukraine , it has little influence in the Middle Eastern countries that are occupying the world &apos;s attention today . 
While many have highlighted Germany &apos;s political leadership in the refugee crisis , the reality is that being thrust into the front line of that crisis , without having much influence over the factors that are driving it , is placing considerable strain on the country . 
Germany is now , for the first time , in the position of having to ask its EU partners for solidarity , as it cannot absorb all the newcomers alone . 
As usual , however , perceptions are lagging behind reality , which means that Germany is still widely viewed as the eurozone &apos;s most powerful force . 
But , as the global business cycle accelerates Germany &apos;s return to the &quot; old normal , &quot; the power shift within Europe will become increasingly difficult to ignore . 
Germany , which exports a large volume of investment goods , benefited more than other eurozone member countries from the investment boom in China and other emerging economies . 
But emerging-economy growth is now slowing considerably , including in China , where demand is shifting from investment toward consumption . 
This tends to undermine German growth and benefit southern European countries , which export more consumer goods . 
The ongoing shift in Europe &apos;s economic and political power dynamics is likely to have a major impact on the EU &apos;s functioning - and especially that of the eurozone . 
For example , without a strong Germany to enforce the eurozone &apos;s fiscal strictures and urge the implementation of difficult but necessary structural reforms , countries may lose their motivation to do what is needed to ensure fairness and stability in the long term . 
If inflation remains low , the ECB might feel freer to pursue further rounds of monetary stimulus , undermining fiscal objectives further . 
In short , we may be headed toward a less &quot; Germanic &quot; economic policy in the eurozone . 
While that might enhance the EU &apos;s popularity in the periphery , it could increase resistance to EU membership in Germany - a country that , despite its waning economic strength , remains an important piece of the integration puzzle .
