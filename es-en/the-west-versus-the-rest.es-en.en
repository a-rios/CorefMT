The West Versus the Rest ? 
The Madrid bombings have made Europeans feel the scourge of terrorism in their bones . 
March 11 is now Europe &apos;s version of September 11 in America . 
Yet America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same glasses : Spain &apos;s response to the terrorist attacks - a threat common to all democracies - was to vote in a government promising an end to pro-US policy on Iraq . 
Does this mean that Europe and the US have dramatically different visions ? 
Part of the seeming disconnect on foreign policy emerges from a misunderstanding about what &quot; Europe &quot; is about . 
The European project is a realist &apos;s response to globalization and its challenges . 
It was initiated to create &quot; solidarités de fait , &quot; promote political stability , and consolidate democracy and Europe &apos;s social model . 
Having achieved these goals , Europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments . 
This is not nostalgia for past glory . 
An unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across Europe , as was apparent in the collective mourning and outpouring of sympathy towards Spain ; we must build on that huge potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world . 
The US , also victim of a horrendous attack , feels drawn to the world but not to promote a similar model of cooperation . 
Rather , in defending their values and security , Americans strive to defend the world , especially the Western world , from dark new threats . 
The messianic idealism that liberated Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies . 
With all the attention devoted to strained transatlantic relations , it is easy to overlook how often our preoccupations overlap . 
On issues such as terrorism , weapons proliferation , Iran , Afghanistan ( where we jointly train the country &apos;s future army ) , and Africa ( where French initiatives with American support recently succeeded in stabilizing Côte d &apos;Ivoire and Congo ) , Europe and the US speak with a common voice . 
But on some issues , such as the Iraq war , Europeans are not all ready to follow America blindly . 
The world - Europe in particular - has fascination and admiration for the US . 
But today we must move away from fascination and gratitude and realize that the pursuit of European integration remains in the best interest of the US , which has supported it for 50 years . 
In today &apos;s world , there is clearly work for two to bring about stability and security , and in promoting common values . 
In particular , the Franco-German &quot; engine &quot; of Europe should not be seen as a potential rival to the US . 
France and Germany are not an axis aspiring to be some sort of an alternative leadership to the US . 
Rather , the two countries form a laboratory needed for the internal working of the EU . 
Anyone who thinks we are building a European rival to America has not looked properly at the facts . 
Indeed , France and Germany do not get along naturally . 
Much sets us apart : EU enlargement , agriculture , and domestic market issues . 
So it is not the sum of the two that matters , but the deal between the two , which should be viewed as a prototype of the emerging Europe . 
It is in that process , mostly inward looking , that France and Germany claim to make Europe advance . 
So I do not believe that a lasting rift looms . 
Most Americans still see in Europe a partner with largely the same aims in the world . 
Most Europeans see in America a strong friend . 
We are all allies of the US ; our draft constitution restates the importance of the NATO link ; our strategy for growth and our contribution to global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relationship with America . 
This is why the US should encourage the development of a common European security and defense policy , which is merely the burden sharing that America has been pressing on Europe for decades . 
We must forge greater European military capacities simply to put in place a mechanism that allows us to stand effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies , as just happened . 
But we must also establish an autonomous European military planning capacity , because the EU might need to lead its own operations , perhaps because NATO is unwilling to . 
We French are opposed to building a &quot; two-speed &quot; Europe . 
But we want structured co-operation - meaning that some European states may press ahead in defense capacity - because we are not prepared to let the more cautious and hesitant dictate a recurrence of the Balkan tragedy of the 1990 &apos;s , when Europeans couldn &apos;t act and Americans wouldn &apos;t ( for a while ) . 
The creation of such a capacity will make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner . 
So it is hard for Europeans to understand why plans for closer European integration should be seen as anti-American . 
The only way to arrest such fears is through closer and more frequent dialogue . 
On defense and security matters , the EU &apos;s security doctrine provides a great opportunity to build on our common worries : terrorism and non-proliferation , but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all quarters of the world . 
Europe and the US must pursue their aims in cooperation , while ensuring that such cooperation never becomes an alliance of the &quot; West against the Rest . &quot; 
Some in the West have tried to conjure a &quot; Clash of Civilizations &quot; out of our troubled times . 
Our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against anybody in particular .
