Japan &apos;s Obama Problem 
TOKYO - When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Tokyo &apos;s controversial Yasukuni Shrine last month , Chinese leaders predictably condemned his decision to honor those behind &quot; the war of aggression against China . &quot; 
But Abe was also sending a message to Japan &apos;s main ally and defender , the United States . 
Faced with US President Barack Obama &apos;s reluctance to challenge China &apos;s muscle-flexing and territorial ambitions in Asia - reflected in Japan &apos;s recent split with the US over China &apos;s new Air Defense Identification Zone ( ADIZ ) - an increasingly desperate Abe was compelled to let both countries know that restraint cannot be one-sided . 
For China and South Korea , the Yasukuni Shrine &apos;s inclusion of 14 Class A war criminals who were executed after World War II has made it a potent symbol of Japan &apos;s prewar militarism , and Abe had long refrained from visiting it - including during his previous stint as prime minister . 
He may well have maintained that stance had China not established the ADIZ , which set an ominous new precedent by usurping international airspace over the East China Sea , including areas that China does not control . 
( Abe does not appear to have considered the possibility that his pilgrimage to Yasukuni might end up helping China by deepening South Korea &apos;s antagonism toward Japan . ) 
The Obama administration had been pressing Abe not to aggravate regional tensions by visiting Yasukuni - an entreaty reiterated by Vice President Joe Biden during a recent stopover in Tokyo on his way to Beijing . 
In fact , Biden &apos;s tour deepened Japan &apos;s security concerns , because it highlighted America &apos;s focus on balancing its relationships in East Asia , even if that means tolerating an expansionist China as the strategic equivalent of an allied Japan . 
Instead of postponing Biden &apos;s trip to Beijing to demonstrate disapproval of China &apos;s new ADIZ , the US advised its commercial airlines to respect it , whereas Japan asked its carriers to ignore China &apos;s demand that they file their flight plans through the zone in advance . 
By calling for Japanese restraint , the US stoked Japan &apos;s anxiety , without winning any concessions from China . 
Now , the widening rift between the US and Japan has become starkly apparent . 
Abe feels let down by Obama &apos;s decision not to take a firm stand on the ADIZ - the latest in a series of aggressive moves by China to upend the status quo in the East China Sea . 
For its part , the US government openly - and uncharacteristically - criticized Abe &apos;s Yasukuni visit , with its embassy in Japan releasing a statement saying that the US was &quot; disappointed that Japan &apos;s leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan &apos;s neighbors . &quot; 
Such recriminations do not mean that the US-Japan alliance - the bedrock of America &apos;s forward military deployment in Asia - is in immediate jeopardy . 
Japan remains a model ally that hosts a large US troop presence , even paying for the upkeep of American forces on its soil . 
Indeed , Abe &apos;s visit to Yasukuni came only a day after he completed a long-elusive , US-backed bilateral deal to relocate America &apos;s airbase in Okinawa to a less populous area of the island . 
And he supports Japan &apos;s entry into the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership , an emerging regional trading bloc that will exclude China . 
Nonetheless , a psychological schism between the Abe and Obama administrations has gradually developed . 
While the US frets about Abe &apos;s nationalistic stance vis-Ã -vis China and South Korea , Japanese officials have stopped trying to conceal their uneasiness over Obama &apos;s effort to strike a balance between its alliance commitments and its desire for Sino-American ties . 
Biden spent more than twice as much time in discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping as he did with Abe . 
The paradox is that while anxiety over China &apos;s growing assertiveness has returned the US to the center of Asian geopolitics and enabled it to strengthen its security arrangements in the region , this has not led to action aimed at quelling China &apos;s expansionary policies . 
As a result , Japan is becoming skeptical about America &apos;s willingness to support it militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands ( called the Diaoyu Islands in China ) . 
The Obama administration &apos;s contradictory rhetoric - affirming that the US-Japan security treaty covers the Senkakus , while refusing to take a position on the islands &quot; sovereignty - has not helped . 
A wake-up call for Japan was Obama &apos;s inaction in 2012 , when China captured the Scarborough Shoal , part of the Philippines &quot; exclusive economic zone . 
In an effort to end a tense standoff , the US brokered a deal in which both countries agreed to withdraw their maritime vessels from the area . 
But , after the Philippines withdrew , China occupied the shoal - and , despite a mutual-defense treaty between the US and the Philippines , the US did little in response . 
This emboldened China effectively to seize a second Philippine-claimed shoal , part of the disputed Spratly Islands . 
Factors like geographical distance and economic interdependence have made the US wary of entanglement in Asia &apos;s territorial feuds . 
And , unlike Asian countries , America would not really suffer from a Chinese &quot; Monroe Doctrine &quot; declaring that China would not accept any outside intervention in Asia . 
But America &apos;s neutrality on sovereignty disputes threatens to undermine its bilateral security alliances ( which , by preventing countries like Japan from turning toward militarism , actually serve Chinese interests ) . 
The Obama administration &apos;s Asian balancing act obfuscates the broader test of power that China &apos;s recent actions represent . 
What is at stake are not merely islands in the East and South China Seas , but a rules-based regional order , freedom of navigation of the seas and skies , access to maritime resources , and balanced power dynamics in Asia . 
By fueling Japanese insecurity , US policy risks bringing about the very outcome - a return to militarism - that it aims to prevent .
