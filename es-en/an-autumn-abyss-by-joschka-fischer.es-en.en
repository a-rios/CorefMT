An Autumn Abyss ? 
BERLIN - In the coming months , several serious regional economic and political crises could combine into one mega-watershed , fueling an intense global upheaval . 
In the course of the summer , the prospect of a perilous fall has become only more likely . 
The drums of war are being banged ever more loudly in the Middle East . 
No one can predict the direction in which Egypt &apos;s Sunni Islamist president and parliamentary majority will lead the country . 
This regional re-alignment need not be necessarily anti-Western , but it surely will be if Israel and / or the United States attack Iran militarily . 
Meanwhile , civil war is raging in Syria , accompanied by a humanitarian catastrophe . 
To be sure , President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime will not survive , but it is determined to fight until the end . 
Syria &apos;s balkanization among the country &apos;s diverse ethnic and religious groups is a clearly predictable result . 
Indeed , a Bosnia-type scenario can no longer be excluded , while the prospect of the Syrian government &apos;s loss of control over its chemical weapons poses an immediate threat of military intervention by Turkey , Israel , or the US . 
Moreover , the Syrian civil war has become a proxy in an openly declared battle for regional hegemony between Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Turkey , and the US on the other . 
Staying on the sidelines of this Arab-Western coalition , Israel is playing its cards close to its chest . 
Iran , for its part , has proclaimed Syria an indispensable ally , and is determined to prevent regime change there by all available means . 
Does that mean that Hezbollah &apos;s militias in neighboring Lebanon will now become directly involved in Syria &apos;s civil war ? 
Would such intervention revive Lebanon &apos;s own long civil war of the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s ? 
Is there a threat of a new Arab-Israeli war hanging over the Middle East ? 
And , as Kurds inside and outside of Syria grow more assertive , Turkey , with its large and long-restive Kurdish population , is also growing restive . 
At the same time , the regional struggle currently playing out in Syria is becoming increasingly entangled with the other major source of war sounds : Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Indeed , parallel to the Syrian drama , the rhetoric in the confrontation between Israel and Iran over the program has become dramatically harsher . 
Both sides have maneuvered themselves into a dead-end . 
If Iran gives in and agrees to a sustainable diplomatic solution , the regime will lose face on a critical domestic issue , jeopardizing its legitimacy and survival . 
From the regime &apos;s point of view , the legacy of the 1979 Islamic revolution is at stake . 
Everything points to the regime &apos;s need for success - now more than ever - concerning its nuclear program . 
Similarly , Israel &apos;s government has backed itself into a domestic policy trap of its own . 
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak cannot accept a nuclear-armed Iran . They do not fear a nuclear attack against Israel , but rather a nuclear arms race in the region and a dramatic shift in power to Israel &apos;s disadvantage . 
From their point of view , Israel must either convince the US to attack Iran and its nuclear plants or take on the maximum risk of using its own military forces to do so . 
Both sides have substantially reduced their options , thereby limiting the possibility of a diplomatic compromise . 
And that means that both sides have stopped thinking through the consequences of their actions . 
But , while advocates speak of a limited &quot; surgical operation , &quot; what they are really talking about is the start of two wars : an aerial war , led by the US and Israel , and an asymmetric war , led by Iran and its allies . 
And what if this &quot; military option &quot; fails ? 
What if Iran becomes a nuclear power , the region &apos;s democratic movements are swept away by a wave of anti-Western Islamic solidarity , and the Iranian regime emerges even stronger ? 
Iran , too , evidently has not thought its position through to its logical conclusion . 
And what if it triggers a regional nuclear arms race ? 
A war in the Persian Gulf - still the world &apos;s gas station - would affect oil exports for some time , and energy prices would skyrocket , dealing a severe blow to a global economy that is teetering on the brink of recession . 
China , already in economic trouble , would be hit hardest , along with the whole of East Asia . 
With the US also economically weakened and facing a presidential election , America &apos;s leadership ability would be seriously constricted . 
And could a weakened Europe cope with an oil shock at all ? A regional and global security shock caused by asymmetric warfare could add still further to the world economy &apos;s troubles , causing exports to slump even more . 
Respice finem ! 
( &quot; Consider the end &quot; ) , the Romans used to say . 
World leaders need to take this timeless wisdom to heart . 
It would be absurd if we had to suffer a real catastrophe again in order to understand what European integration has always been about .
