Beyond the Two-Degree Target 
BERLIN - In international climate-policy circles , there is broad consensus regarding the target of limiting global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels . 
Still , barring a breakthrough in United Nations negotiations in the near future and a reversal in current emissions trends , meeting that two-degree target is well-nigh impossible . 
But if world leaders abandon this target , they will have to make a fundamental strategic decision regarding the structure and stringency levels of a new climate goal . 
So international climate policy needs a paradigm shift . 
The science-based approach of translating a global temperature cap into precise national emission budgets is politically unfeasible . 
Instead , countries with a strong climate-policy agenda should advocate dynamic formulas for setting targets . 
The two-degree target is the primary point of reference for today &apos;s climate debate . 
A corresponding rise in the global mean temperature is usually seen as the limit beyond which the effects of climate change could become dangerous . 
But , contrary to widespread belief , the last assessment report of the UN &apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) did not call for the two-degree target , which , since the mid-1990s , has acted as a catchy symbol and point of orientation for an ambitious but realistic global climate agenda . 
The European Union was the primary force pushing for the two-degree target internationally . 
Europe &apos;s environment ministers have been advocates of the target since 1996 . 
Ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit at the end of 2009 , the EU succeeded in getting all relevant partners in the negotiations - including even China , India , Russia , and the United States - to commit to the two-degree target . 
In the &quot; Copenhagen Accord , &quot; the UN finally recognized the target , though without any binding measures for achieving it . 
There is little hope that this will be rectified at the next summit , in Canc√∫n , Mexico next month . 
Since the quantities of greenhouse gases emitted thus far will raise temperatures by 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times , major political decisions are needed to ensure compliance with the two-degree target . 
Climate science assumes that the global emissions peak must occur within the next several years . 
So at some point in the near future , a growing number of voices from the climate-science community must definitively reject the possibility of holding to the two-degree target . 
When that happens , simply championing a softer target , most probably 2.5 or three degrees , will not suffice . 
According to the current paradigm , the global target is defined within scientific categories and understood as an absolute upper limit . 
Given this top-down approach , all initial efforts have been focused on creating a global climate treaty , leading to a heavy focus on global negotiations while neglecting concrete de-carbonization efforts by industrialized and industrializing countries . 
This has resulted in stalemate , because governments can always blame failure on the inaction of others . 
Even the EU has used this argument to justify its refusal to increase its target for greenhouse-gas reduction for 2020 from 20 % to 30 % , although this would be an equitable burden for Europe to bear on the path towards meeting the two-degree target . 
An alternative paradigm would have to combine realism with a positive global vision . 
One possibility is to establish &quot; climate neutrality &quot; as a long-term global objective - i.e. , work to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero . 
Even if this objective were to be initially linked with a broadly defined timescale , it would establish the standard for action according to which all countries would have to be measured . 
Within such a framework , ambitious climate-policy actors such as the EU , Switzerland , or Japan would face the task of committing to exacting de-carbonization measures . 
They would need to muster evidence that the transition to a low-carbon economy is both technically feasible and profitable , yielding positive effects not only for the climate , but also for energy prices and security of supply . 
Success would spur other G-20 countries , acting out of self-interest , to follow in the climate leaders &quot; footsteps . 
This type of bottom-up approach would lead to significant reductions in emissions . 
To be sure , it would be impossible to predict , under the currently favoured top-down principle , how much temperature increase the world would have to bear . 
But it is questionable whether the increase would be any different . 
Given that holding to a strict temperature limit is not a politically viable option , focusing climate policy on flexible benchmarks such as &quot; climate neutrality &quot; would be more effective over the short term and more promising over the long term .
