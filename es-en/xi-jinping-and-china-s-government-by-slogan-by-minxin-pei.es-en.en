China &apos;s Dream World 
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - Ruling elites almost everywhere - whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes - believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power . 
There are , of course , crucial differences . 
In functioning democracies , government leaders can be held accountable for their promises : the press can scrutinize their policies , opposition parties are motivated to show that the party in power lies and cheats . 
As a result , incumbents are frequently forced to carry out at least some of their promises . 
Autocratic rulers , by contrast , face no such pressures . 
Press censorship , repression of dissent , and the absence of organized opposition allow rulers the luxury of promising whatever they want , with no political consequences for failing to deliver . 
The result is government of the sloganeers , by the sloganeers , and for the sloganeers . 
China appears to have perfected this form of government over the last decade . 
The ruling Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , in response to rising public demand for social justice , has devised numerous slogans , such as &quot; governing for the people , &quot; &quot; building a harmonious society , &quot; &quot; balanced development , &quot; &quot; scientific development , &quot; and so on . 
Whenever the top leadership in Beijing uttered such slogans , they became the rallying cry of the bureaucracy . 
The party &apos;s massive propaganda machine went into overdrive and blanketed the country with a publicity blitz that would make the most extravagant Madison Avenue advertising campaign look like child &apos;s play . 
But government by slogan , whether in China or in other autocracies , seldom achieves its declared goals . 
In the last decade , GDP growth soared , but most indices of social justice , governance performance , and public welfare deteriorated . 
Macroeconomic imbalances worsened as economic growth became excessively dependent on investment and exports . 
Inequality worsened . 
Official corruption escalated . 
Social mobility declined . 
Environmental degradation reached a crisis point . 
Today , it is the responsibility of China &apos;s new leadership , headed by President Xi Jinping , to avert another decade of missed opportunities . 
Without missing a beat , Xi , like his predecessors , rolled out a new slogan to inspire popular confidence in his leadership . 
As a catchphrase for his administration &apos;s objective , &quot; the great renaissance of the Chinese nation &quot; is bit long , but it has lately morphed into the simpler &quot; China Dream . &quot; 
The substance of the China Dream remains difficult to determine . 
When Xi first unveiled his slogan after being selected as the CCP &apos;s new general secretary , he defined it in simple , accessible , but nonetheless generic terms : The &quot; Chinese people dream of living the same good life as all other people in the world . &quot; 
Xi has said little about the China Dream since - and his silence has caused considerable trouble . 
China &apos;s ever-zealous propaganda officials , evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief , quickly hijacked the slogan ; the China Dream has replaced the &quot; China Model &quot; in official political branding . 
Whatever the new administration does is touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the &quot; China Dream &quot; come true . 
Unfortunately , China propagandists , who double as censors , have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand . 
The China Dream is no exception . 
So far , public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision . 
After a decade of government by slogan , the Chinese public wants substance . 
This presents Xi with a real challenge . 
He has risen to the top by winning friends and allies inside the CCP . 
Now that he is the leader of a dynamic , diverse , and increasingly demanding society , he must gain popular support and confidence to maintain his credibility and become an effective politician . 
The first thing that Xi should do is to articulate a clearer , more specific , and inspiring version of the China Dream , and stop letting the CCP &apos;s propaganda officials define it for him . 
The China Dream may include all of the economic benefits and material comfort that ordinary Chinese desire , but it will not be complete without the human rights and dignity that citizens in civilized societies take for granted . 
The second thing that Xi and his colleagues need to do is to follow up with specific policies and actions that can bolster the credibility of their declared goals . 
Political slogans , however high-sounding , become stale when their purveyors fail to make good on their promises . 
Xi may still be enjoying a honeymoon with the Chinese public , but it is likely to be a short one . 
His predecessors had ten years to carry out real reforms and accomplished little , leaving the Chinese in no mood to endure another decade of government by shibboleth .
