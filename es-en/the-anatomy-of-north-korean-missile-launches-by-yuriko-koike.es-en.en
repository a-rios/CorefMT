North Korea &apos;s Blackmail Missile 
TOKYO - The Unha-3 rocket launched from Sohae in North Korea on the morning of December 12 passed through Japanese air space over the island of Okinawa 12 minutes later , and crashed into the Pacific Ocean roughly 300 kilometers east of the Philippines . 
The launch could be considered a mild surprise , because South Korean intelligence sources had suggested that it had been canceled . 
More surprising was the success of the launch , which makes North Korea the tenth member of the world &apos;s &quot; Space Club &quot; ( the ninth member was Iran , which successfully launched its Safir rocket in 2008 ) . 
The Unha-3 , a three-stage rocket weighing 92 tons , follows the Unha-2 , which failed spectacularly in 2009 , so the evident progress that North Korea has made in its missile technology in such a short period has shocked governments around the world . 
The United Nations Security Council responded by debating a resolution on strengthening sanctions against North Korea . 
Only China - no surprise - opposed new sanctions , stressing that &quot; actions that heighten tension on the Korean Peninsula should not be taken . &quot; 
China has agreed to Security Council resolutions against Iran on several occasions , but it has backed sanctions against North Korea on only two , both coming after the North conducted nuclear tests ( in 2006 and 2009 ) . 
China &apos;s leaders oppose stiffer sanctions against North Korea for a simple reason : they fear the frailty of Kim Jong-un &apos;s regime more than they fear the international security consequences of the missile launch . 
Above all , China wants to prevent the regime &apos;s collapse , which it fears may result from stricter sanctions . 
If the Kim regime timed the missile launch to have a direct impact on elections in nearby Japan and South Korea , it may have succeeded merely in boosting support for defense-oriented conservative parties . 
Indeed , although it is difficult to say how large an impact the launch had on the result in Japan , the Liberal Democratic Party ( of which I am a member , serving as Deputy Chair of the election campaign ) won a landslide victory . 
Although Park Geun-hye &apos;s victory in South Korea , where she became the country &apos;s first-ever female president , followed a campaign mainly focused on domestic economic issues , North Korea &apos;s missile-guided brinkmanship probably shifted many undecided voters to the security-minded Park &apos;s camp . 
So , given the seemingly negative impact of the launch on neighboring South Korea and Japan , why didn &apos;t the North hold its fire ? 
Some suggest that North Korean leaders were determined to stage the launch before the first anniversary of Kim Jong-un &apos;s assumption of power on December 17 . 
Others suggest that the North Koreans prefer conservatives in power in Seoul and Tokyo , because a more robust vision of national defense in Japan and South Korea will antagonize China , which , isolated in East Asia , will then be more likely to maintain its support for the Kim regime . 
After all , China &apos;s small list of friends in Asia became even smaller in 2012 , given Myanmar &apos;s democratic transition . 
So , in Kim &apos;s perverse logic , a new push for UN sanctions , and new security-conscious governments in Japan and South Korea , will strengthen North Korea &apos;s hold on Chinese foreign policy . 
Thus , the missile launch can be viewed as an indication of how threatened the Kim dynasty feels : the regime appears to believe that it must blackmail its closest ally in order to maintain its support . 
The primary cause of the regime &apos;s fears is growing political uncertainty , which is the direct result of the failing health of Kim Kyong-hui , Kim Jong-un &apos;s aunt and the power behind the throne . 
Indeed , keen observers of North Korea suggest that Kim Jong-un ordered the missile launch as a way to strengthen his grip on power while he still has the experienced and ruthless Kim Kyong-hui &apos;s backing . 
Without it , the Kim dynasty &apos;s hold on power would almost certainly weaken , given Kim Jong-un &apos;s youth and inexperience , plunging the country into chaos . 
One seemingly obscure political move last month - the appointment of Jang Sung-taek ( Kim Kyong-hui &apos;s husband ) as the chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission - suggests that Kim Kyong-hui &apos;s ill health is already having an impact on the regime . 
Although no modern state would do so , the Sports Guidance Commission comprises the regime &apos;s most powerful members . 
Jang &apos;s move to the post strongly suggests that the internal struggle for power is already heating up . 
North Korea &apos;s missile launch , coming amid the internal uncertainty arising from Kim Kyong-hui &apos;s failing health , creates an extremely dangerous situation for the international community . 
Only by strengthening UN sanctions to such an extent that North Korea is forced to abandon its missiles and nuclear weapons - and China to reconsider its knee-jerk support - can the regime be dissuaded from further , and more ominous , maneuvering . 
But , given China &apos;s continuing opposition to further sanctions , there is scant hope of this happening . 
Until China puts its responsibilities as a modern global power ahead of its narrow national interests , the danger from North Korea will grow as the Kim regime becomes ever more unstable .
