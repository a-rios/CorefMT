Turkey &apos;s Coup that Failed 
ANKARA - The exposure of the plan hatched by senior military officials - called &quot; Operation Sledgehammer &quot; - to destabilize Turkey &apos;s government , and the subsequent arrest of high-ranking officers , demonstrates the growing strength of Turkey &apos;s democracy . 
Moreover , prosecutors &quot; efforts to uncover the truth are not a campaign to discredit the Turkish army , as some allege ; nor has the exposure of &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; led to an emerging showdown between &quot; secularists &quot; and &quot; Islamists . &quot; 
Turkish society and politics are too complicated to be reduced to such simplistic formulae . 
Nevertheless , this is a very serious moment for Turkey , because it may mark the country &apos;s transit from decades of military tutelage of its civilian politicians - and thus complete its transition to full-fledged democracy . 
&quot; Sledgehammer &quot; is , sad to say , yet another alleged coup plot in a series of attempts to topple the ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which was first elected in 2002 . 
According to the Turkish constitution , it is illegal for any agency , even the military , to try to overthrow a democratically elected government . 
Had such a coup attempt taken place , much less succeeded , it also would have put an end to Turkey &apos;s aspirations to become a full member of the European Union . 
Indeed , the EU &apos;s progress reports on Turkey have consistently raised the issue of the military &apos;s disproportionate power in Turkish politics , and the fact that some officers do not seem to accept that they are subject to civilian control . 
The three military coups Turkey endured in 1960 , 1971 , and 1980 brought neither prosperity nor stability to the country . 
The &quot; soft coup &quot; of 1997 , whereby a democratically elected government was forced by the military to resign , left deep scars in Turkish society . 
Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Turks respect the army only when it stays within its barracks . 
According to the evidence gathered by Turkish prosecutors , four coup attempts , named &quot; Sarıkız , &quot; &quot; Ayışığı , &quot; &quot; Yakamoz , &quot; and &quot; Eldiven , &quot; have been made since the AKP came to power . 
On April 27 , 2007 , the Turkish Armed Forces issued a statement opposing the presidential candidacy of Abdullah Gul , Turkey &apos;s deputy prime minister and foreign minister at the time , warning that if Gul was elected , Turkey would descend into chaos . 
But this effort at intimidation failed , and Gul won . 
General Yasar Buyukanit , the top commander of the Turkish Armed Forces back then , recently admitted that he himself wrote the April 27 memorandum . 
On March 14 , 2008 , the Chief Public Prosecutor opened an investigation aimed at shutting down the AKP on the grounds that it was intent on violating the constitutional ban on promoting religion . 
But the case was motivated almost exclusively by political and ideological considerations , with evidence gathered from newspaper clips and anti-government op-eds . 
&quot; Sledgehammer &quot; is but the most recent coup plot to be uncovered , going back to 2003 . 
According to the Turkish daily newspaper Taraf , to which the plot was leaked , a 5,000-page plan was drafted to create chaos in Turkey by burning mosques , downing Greek military aircraft , and carrying out mass arrests of those who opposed the military . 
The intent was to prepare the ground for a military takeover . 
Some critics dismiss this planning as just &quot; war games , &quot; not to be taken seriously . 
The same thing was said by top military officials about another plot , called &quot; The Action Plan against Religious Fundamentalism , &quot; drafted by Col. Dursun Cicek . 
On June 26 , 2009 , Chief of General Staff Gen. Ilker Basbug called the Action Plan &quot; just a piece of paper . &quot; 
Eight months later , a military committee investigating the case concluded that the plan was , indeed , drafted to damage and discredit the AKP and government . 
If none of the above constitutes a breach of democratic principles , one wonders what would . 
No democratic country would allow such interventions by its military , whatever the circumstances . 
Yet critics still insist on getting the root cause of these efforts wrong . 
They try to depict this as a showdown between the &quot; Islamist AKP &quot; and the country &apos;s democracy-loving secularists . 
Daniel Pipes , an American polemicist , has gone so far as almost to endorse the military coups of 1960 , 1971 , 1980 , and 1997 , arguing that &quot; on four occasions between 1960 and 1997 , the military intervened to repair a political process gone awry . &quot; 
One wonders if Pipes would accept the US military taking over the American government if it should ever unilaterally conclude that American politics had gone awry . The fact that these plots have been uncovered is a clear sign of the maturation of Turkish democracy . 
The legal investigations now underway do not mark a showdown between Islamists and secularists , nor are they a campaign to discredit Turkey &apos;s generals . 
They are part of a process of normalization , of the establishment of absolute civilian control of the military , and confirmation of the principle that no one is above the law .
