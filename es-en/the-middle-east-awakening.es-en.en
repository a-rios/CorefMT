The Middle East Awakening 
BERLIN - When the democratic revolt in Tunisia successfully ousted the old regime , the world reacted with amazement . 
Democracy from below in the Arab world ? 
After the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak &apos;s 30 year-old regime in Egypt , the heartland of the Middle East , amazement has turned into certainty . 
The Middle East has awakened and begun to enter the globalized world of the twenty-first century . 
Up to now , the region ( excluding Israel and Turkey ) had more or less missed out on the epochal process of worldwide modernization . 
Whether the Arab and wider Islamic world &apos;s democratic awakening will actually prevail or produce only change at the top of authoritarian regimes , whether it will lead to a stable order or sustained chaos and radicalization , still remains unclear . 
One thing , however , is already clear : the era when this vast region slept while others modernized has ended . 
The grassroots revolt will , of course , continue . 
Virtually no country in the region will escape it , though when and where the next eruption will occur remains uncertain . 
Iran , Syria , and Saudi Arabia are all candidates , with the latter probably posing the most difficulties . 
Israel , too , would be well advised to prepare for epochal change in the region and try to reach a peace settlement with the Palestinians and Syria as quickly as possible . 
There is , however , little indication that Israel &apos;s government has the vision required for such an undertaking . 
The problems are the same almost everywhere ( with the exception of Israel and Turkey ) : political suppression , economic underdevelopment and grinding poverty ( except in the smaller oil states ) , a lack of education , high unemployment , and huge demographic pressures , owing to a very young and rapidly growing population . 
These problems have been cited , year after year , in the United Nations Development Program &apos;s reports . 
Moreover , the situation was exacerbated by the incompetence of the region &apos;s authoritarian regimes , which have been unable to provide their young people with any prospects beyond repression . 
So it was only a matter of time until this powder keg was ignited . 
The fuses were the new information technologies of the Internet and satellite television , such as Al Jazeera . 
Indeed , one historical irony is that it wasn &apos;t American hard power - as applied , for example , in the Iraq war - that furthered this democratic revolution , but rather its soft power - Twitter and Facebook - which was much maligned under George W. Bush and his neocon advisers . 
Silicon Valley , it seems , has more potency than the Pentagon . 
These digital tools from the United States became the instruments for a trans-Arabian / Iranian youth revolt for freedom and democracy . 
And , although many things in the Middle East are in short supply , there is no dearth of hopeless young people , whose numbers will continue to grow in the coming years . 
Indeed , whatever resemblance events on Cairo &apos;s Tahrir Square bear to May 1968 in Paris and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , it would be premature to proclaim that freedom has prevailed . 
Whether it does will depend to a large degree on how the West responds now , because what is at stake is not just the ousting of tyrants , but also the profound transformation and modernization of entire societies and economies . 
It is a staggering task . 
Moreover , compared to Eastern Europe in 1989 , the Middle East in 2011 lacks any stabilizing external structures , such as NATO and the European Union , that could influence domestic reforms by holding out the prospect of membership . 
The efforts involved in this great transformation must come from within these societies , and this in all likelihood is asking too much . 
Eastern Europe &apos;s transformation after 1989 took a lot longer and was much more costly than originally envisaged . 
There were many people who lost out during this transformation , and the democratic revolution &apos;s organizers were not necessarily those who could push through the democratic and economic development . 
And there is the experience of Ukraine &apos;s &quot; Orange Revolution &quot; in 2004 , which failed a few years later due to the estrangement , incompetence , and corruption of its leaders . 
Taken together , these constraints and analogies suggest that the West , particularly Europe , should focus on long-term assistance for the democratic and economic development of the Middle East &apos;s reborn countries , and also on partnerships with all forces that support their countries &quot; democratization and modernization . 
The West can no longer continue with Realpolitik as usual . 
These tasks call for largesse , both financial and otherwise ( opportunities to travel , for example , were of vital importance in locking in the democratic aspirations of East Europeans after 1989 ) , and they require decades , not years , of persistence . 
In other words , success will be expensive - very expensive - which will be anything but popular in the current economic downturn . 
But a democracy that does not translate into regular dinners is a democracy that is bound to fail . 
Economic aid , the opening of the EU and US markets , strategic energy projects , legal and constitutional advice , and cooperation between universities are among the resources that the West must supply if it wants to contribute to the success of the Middle East &apos;s democratic awakening . 
Should this awakening fail , the result will be a radicalization throughout the region . 
There can be no return to the status quo ante . 
The genie is out of the bottle .
