Japan &apos;s Options 
TOKYO - The current tensions between China and Japan have revived talk about how far Japan has fallen since its glory years of the 1980 &quot; s . 
To the extent that this sense of decline is grounded in reality , can Japan recover ? 
Japan &apos;s economy has suffered two decades of slow growth because of the poor policy decisions that followed the collapse of the country &apos;s massive asset-price bubble in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
In 2010 , China &apos;s economy surpassed Japan &apos;s in total size , though it is only one-sixth the size in per capita terms . 
In 1988 , eight of the top ten companies in the world by market capitalization were Japanese ; today , none is . 
But , despite its recent poor performance , Japan retains impressive power resources . 
It possesses the world &apos;s third largest national economy , sophisticated industries , and the best-equipped conventional military forces among Asian countries . 
Only two decades ago , many Americans feared being overtaken after Japanese per capita income surpassed that of the United States . 
Books predicted a Japanese-led Pacific bloc that would exclude the US , and even an eventual war between the two countries . 
Futurologist Herman Kahn forecast that Japan would become a nuclear superpower , and that the transition in Japan &apos;s role would be like &quot; the change brought about in European and world affairs in the 1870 &quot; s by the rise of Prussia . &quot; 
These views extrapolated an impressive Japanese record . 
Today , however , they serve as a useful reminder about the danger of linear projections based on rapidly rising power resources . 
On the eve of World War II , Japan accounted for 5 % of the world &apos;s industrial production . 
Devastated by the war , it did not regain that level until 1964 . 
From 1950 to 1974 , Japan averaged a remarkable 10 % annual growth rate , and by the 1980 &quot; s was the world &apos;s second largest national economy , accounting for 15 % of global output . 
Japan also became the world &apos;s largest creditor and largest donor of foreign aid . 
Its technology was roughly equal to that of the US - and even slightly ahead in some manufacturing branches . 
Japan armed itself only lightly ( restricting military expenditures to about 1 % of GNP ) , and focused on economic growth . 
This was not the first time that Japan had impressively reinvented itself . 
A century and a half ago , Japan became the first non-Western country to adapt successfully to modern globalization . 
After centuries of isolation , Japan &apos;s Meiji restoration chose selectively from the rest of the world , and within 50 years the country had become strong enough to defeat a European great power , in the Russo-Japanese War . 
Can Japan reinvent itself again ? 
In 2000 , a prime minister &apos;s commission on Japan &apos;s goals in the twenty-first century called for just that . 
Little has happened . 
Given economic stagnation , the political system &apos;s weaknesses , the aging of the population , and resistance to immigration , fundamental change will not be easy . 
But Japan retains a high standard of living , a highly skilled labor force , a stable society , and areas of technological and manufacturing leadership . 
Moreover , its culture ( both traditional and popular ) , overseas development assistance , and support of international institutions provide resources for soft , or attractive , power . 
But it seems unlikely that a revived Japan , a decade or two hence , could become a global challenger economically or militarily , as was predicted two decades ago . 
Roughly the size of California , Japan will never have the geographical or demographic scale of China or the US . 
And its soft power is undercut by ethnocentric attitudes and policies . 
Some Japanese politicians talk about revising Article 9 of the constitution , which restricts Japan &apos;s forces to self defense , and a few have spoken of nuclear armament . 
Both seem unwise and unlikely now . 
Alternatively , if Japan were to ally with China , the two countries &quot; combined resources would make for a potent coalition . 
In 2006 , China became Japan &apos;s largest trade partner , and the new government formed by the Democratic Party of Japan in 2009 sought improved bilateral relations . 
But an alliance also seems unlikely . 
Not only have the wounds of the 1930 &quot; s failed to heal , but China and Japan have conflicting visions of Japan &apos;s proper place in Asia and the world . 
For example , China has blocked Japan &apos;s efforts to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . 
More recently , after Japanese maritime officials arrested a Chinese fishing-boat captain near the disputed Senkaku islands , China responded harshly with arrests of Japanese businessmen , cancelation of student visits , and suspension of exports of rare-earth minerals upon which key Japanese industries depend . 
China &apos;s actions shocked many Japanese and undercut its soft power in Japan . 
As one Japanese professor put it , in football terms , China scored an &quot; own goal . &quot; 
In the highly unlikely prospect that the US were to withdraw from the East Asian region , Japan might join a Chinese bandwagon , but Japan is more likely to maintain its American alliance to preserve its independence from China . 
The main danger for Japan today is a tendency to turn inward , rather than becoming a global civilian power that realizes its great potential to produce global public goods . 
For example , Japan &apos;s aid budget has declined , and only half as many Japanese students study overseas as did two decades ago . 
An inward-looking Japan would be a loss for the entire world .
