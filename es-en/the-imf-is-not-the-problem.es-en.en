The IMF Is Not the Problem 
Brazil &apos;s current presidential election campaign has again brought the IMF to the center of international debate . 
Are IMF cures worse than the disease , as critics such as Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz allege ? 
Kenneth Rogoff , the IMF &apos;s chief economist , speaks for the defense . 
Throughout much of the world , the IMF is caricatured as a demon of austerity . 
Wherever the IMF appears on the scene to provide financial assistance , painful government budget cuts seem certain to follow . 
This image of austerity appeals to the emotional need for stories with villains . 
After all , good villains sell books - including books about globalization that demonize the IMF . 
But does the image reflect reality ? 
Is the IMF , the member of the UN family charged to maintain global financial stability , really so evil or misguided that it can only propose policies that inflict economic pain instead of alleviating it ? 
I admit that the IMF has its faults , and I don &apos;t aim to gloss over them . 
Until a year ago , when I left a professorship at Harvard University to become the Fund &apos;s chief economist , I was a vocal , if perhaps not vitriolic , critic of the IMF &apos;s management of the international monetary system . 
Although the IMF has changed a lot in recent years , there is no denying that there are still major holes in the international system - not least the lack of a fair and orderly procedure for dealing with highly indebted countries that become insolvent . 
The IMF is working to fill that gap now . 
But the austerity charge is misconceived . 
Troubled countries knock on the Fund &apos;s door for financial assistance only when all other creditors have turned their backs . 
In most cases , a country is already in desperate fiscal straits by the time IMF economists arrive on the scene to discuss a loan . 
More often than not , the country has over-extended itself financially through some combination of imprudence and bad luck . 
Countries come to the IMF precisely because they know that it will lend to them when no one else will , and at interest rates lower than most could only dream of , even in the best of times . 
IMF loans thus relieve austerity : they help governments limit the amount of budgetary belt-tightening required in a crisis . 
You think I am crazy ? 
Allow me to draw an analogy from my personal finances . 
Just after I finished school , my older brother Hal ran into some financial difficulties . 
He and his wife had started ripping out all the walls , plumbing , and wiring in their modest Washington apartment , hoping to refurbish it prior to the arrival of their first child . 
It was an ambitious plan , but it seemed doable - until Hal started having problems with his baking business . 
Suddenly they found themselves desperately over-extended . 
Hal went to the bank for a loan , but with his business struggling , he didn &apos;t qualify . 
With all his credit cards at their limit , and all his cash gone , Hal finally came to me for a loan . 
I had managed to put aside some modest savings , which I freely lent him indefinitely at zero interest . 
Even with my help , things weren &apos;t easy . 
Hal had to work longer hours than ever before , and he still had to sharply cut back on household expenditures across the board . 
But my loan did help , eventually Hal &apos;s business recovered , my nephew was born and - much later - the apartment remodeling project came to a successful conclusion . 
Now , did my brother blame me for the period of belt-tightening austerity his family had to face ? 
No , obviously not . 
Admittedly , this is a simplistic analogy , but it captures the essence of the issue . 
Yes , I did not ask Hal what , exactly , he planned to do with my money ( would he use it to fix his plumbing , to help his business , or would he waste it somehow ? ) . 
When the IMF comes in , it typically applies some degree of conditionality , as would any other lender , to ensure that its loan is eventually repaid , and used for its intended purpose . 
Unlike my loan to Hal , the IMF usually does ask government officials to show how they plan to put their country back on its feet . 
Indeed , it is this planning dialogue that does more than anything else to help stabilize the economy and restore a viable balance of payments . 
It is not always an easy process , and reasonable people can and do disagree about the design of IMF-supported programs both before and after the fact . 
The IMF really does need to listen to its critics and constantly to seek better ways to accomplish its aims . 
When a country finally suffers through austerity and repays its IMF loans , no rich private shareholder gets fat as a result . 
The IMF &apos;s shareholders are its 184 member countries , and the Fund does not really pay dividends , other than in an accounting sense . 
As soon as one country repays its loans , the IMF is better placed to re-lend the foreign exchange to the next country in crisis . 
However effective the IMF &apos;s crisis prevention efforts are , realistically there will always be a next crisis country . 
Yes , the IMF needs many changes , as does the broader international financial system within which it operates . 
But saying that it causes austerity is like saying that doctors cause plagues .
