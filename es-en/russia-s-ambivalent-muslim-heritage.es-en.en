Russia \ u0027s Ambivalent Muslim Heritage 
On his recent visit to Brussels , Russian President Vladimir Putin stunned European leaders and journalists alike with his comments about the Islamic desire to establish a global Caliphate . 
Sensational in his rhetoric , Putin presents Russia &apos;s brutal war against the Chechens as his country &apos;s contribution to the international war against Islamist terrorism . 
But is it really ? 
Russia &apos;s attempts to subdue the Chechen insurrection are but another bloody chapter in a two hundred year colonial policy that began with Russia &apos;s subjugation of Caucasian mountain peoples in a cruel war that lasted for thirty years . 
This war lingered and flared well into the early Soviet era and , in 1944 , the entire Chechen population was forcibly deported to Central Asia . 
Fifty years later , President Yeltsin resumed the war when Chechens made a new bid for independence . 
So , from a historic perspective , it is more appropriate to compare today &apos;s Chechen war with the other great wars of the era of de-colonialization , particularly the bloody French war in Algeria , than it is to view it as a &quot; Clash of Civilizations &quot; or a war on terror . 
All the while , the fighting and ruined cities of Chechnya cast a shadow on the otherwise much more complex encounter of Russia with the Islamic world . 
Indeed , the Chechens are only a fraction of the 13 million Muslims who live in Russia - 9 % of the total population . 
But simultaneous with its attempts to crush the Chechen rebellion , Russia has pursued a very different path in its relations with the Volga Tatars and Bashkirs , who live in their own republics in the Volga-Ural area . 
In the early 1990s , Yeltsin concluded bilateral agreements with those republics , conceding extensive autonomy to Tatarstan and Bashkortostan . 
Although restoration of centralized political power in the Kremlin has marked Putin &apos;s presidency , Moscow and the two Muslim-dominated Russian republics still adhere to the Yeltsin-era bargain . 
The ambivalent relationship between Russia and its Muslims is deeply rooted in history . 
Russia conquered Muslim territories in the Volga-Ural area , Caucasus and Central Asia , and brutally suppressed any resistance . 
However , after loyalty was secured , the government adopted a more pragmatic policy . 
Until the mid 19th century , sedentary Muslim elites were co-opted into the imperial aristocracy , just as , in the 20th century , national communist elites were absorbed into the Soviet nomenclatura . 
Indeed , Russia &apos;s contacts with the Muslim world go back thousands of years and were rooted in a tradition of tolerance . 
With a few short-lived exceptions , Russia &apos;s imperial government did not support Orthodox evangelism . 
Forced conversion was unknown and Russia &apos;s policy with regard to Muslims was guided primarily by the political and economic interests of the state . 
After the Revolution , Soviet policy preserved the most important aspects of the old imperial approach . 
To be sure , the Communists tried to repress Islam as a religion - as they tried to repress all religions . 
But the Soviets encouraged the development of nations based on ethnic identity - Stalin , it is to be recalled , fancied himself a theorist of nationalities - and the ethnic identity of Soviet Muslims derived largely from their Islamic culture . 
In this sense , the Soviets helped keep Islam alive . 
What few people realize is that , overall , the history of Russian-Muslim relations stand in sharp contrast with the policy pursued by most West European governments over the centuries - policies have been rooted in anti-Islamic stereotypes since the Middle Ages . 
In Spain and Sicily , Muslims were discriminated against , forcibly baptized , and expelled since the 15th century . 
Five hundred years of warfare against the Ottomans also helped to fuel anti-Islamic prejudices and intolerance . 
Indeed , whenever Russia ( as in the first half of the 18th century ) or the Soviet Union ( in the late 1920s and 1930s ) combated Islam , its rulers pointed to the Western example . 
The policy toward the Muslims pursued by the Russian Empire , by contrast , largely preserved ethnic and religious communities . 
This pragmatism has mostly been preserved to this day . 
Reverting to the imperial Russian tradition , Boris Yeltsin , as the first president of an independent Russian nation-state , sought realistic solutions for the Muslim republics that desired autonomy or , as Chechnya , independence . 
This tolerant posture gave way to war in Chechnya in 1994 , but the armistice of 1996 , which de facto recognized Chechnya &apos;s independence , gave rise to new hopes of a better future . 
In 1999 Yeltsin and Putin , his then prime minister , resumed combat . 
The Chechen war was exploited in Putin &apos;s presidential election campaign and , after September 11 , 2001 , Putin has tried to legitimize his intransigence by presenting the war in Chechnya as Russia &apos;s contribution to its emerging partnership with the US in the war against terrorism . 
With the Soviet Union &apos;s disintegration , Russia and the West lost the enemy each had seen in the other . 
Both deem Islam the new enemy , one held in common . 
What they fail to see is that Islam is not a homogenous entity and that today &apos;s conflicts do not have religious or civilizing causes , but are rooted in political , social and economic reasons . 
Indeed , many Islamic movements are largely a reaction to former or still existing colonial dependence . 
The Putin government &apos;s focus on violence demonstrates that Russia hasn &apos;t learned from its long history of engagement with Islam . 
The Chechen War is not part of some Clash of Civilizations , but a retreat to a colonial policy that failed .
