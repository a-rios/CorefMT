From 9 / 11 to the Arab Spring 
CAIRO - Al Qaeda &apos;s operating environment today is vastly different from the one in which it launched its most notorious operation , the 9 / 11 terror attacks . 
Osama bin Laden , Al Qaeda &apos;s founder and charismatic leader , was killed by United States Navy Seals in Pakistan in May . 
Drone attacks have eliminated many of Al Qaeda &apos;s most experienced commanders , including , most recently , Atiyah Abd al-Rahman . 
Has militant jihadism failed , placing Al Qaeda &apos;s survival in doubt ? 
Jihadism is a modern revolutionary ideology which holds that political violence is a theologically legitimate and tactically efficient way to effect socio-political change . 
Terrorism dominated the armed activities of many of the groups that subscribe to this worldview , including , of course , Al Qaeda . 
But , while Al Qaeda maintained its ideology after 9 / 11 , its organization changed dramatically . 
From a centralized , hierarchical organization , it became a highly decentralized structure , with regional branches as the dominant actors . 
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) emerged in late 2002 as a force in Saudi Arabia , orchestrating a spectacular attack in Riyadh in 2003 . 
This was followed by the advent of Al Qaeda in Iraq ( AQI ) in 2004 . 
By 2007 , Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ( AQIM ) had appeared as well . 
The &quot; franchise model &quot; had fully taken hold . 
Ten years after 9 / 11 , however , these franchises are in check , rather than expansion . 
Parallel to the &quot; franchise &quot; model , Al Qaeda also has adopted a &quot; spider-web &quot; approach that eschews organization in favor of trained operatives who form small cells to conduct specific attacks and then disband . 
The attackers on Madrid and London represent this model . 
Then there is the &quot; ideological front &quot; model , initially advocated by a famous jihadi strategist , Abu Musab al-Suri . 
The premise here , as with the spider-web approach , is that the most secure way to organize is without an organization . 
&quot; This defeats any security arrangement , &quot; al-Suri wrote in a 1,600-page paramilitary manual , The Call for Global Islamic Resistance . 
The model works by propagating a narrative describing the severe injustices and humiliation suffered by Muslims , advancing an ideology that identifies the means to remove the grievances , and then letting sympathizers recruit themselves to Al Qaeda or initiate their own operations . 
This was the model followed in the case of US Army Major Nidal Hasan , who killed 13 fellow soldiers in Fort Hood , Texas , in 2009 , and by Roshonara Choudhary , who stabbed the British MP Stephen Timms in 2010 . 
Not only has Al Qaeda mutated structurally , but its ideology is constantly open to challenge by the most unlikely suspects . 
After 9 / 11 , several movements , factions , leading jihadists , and individual militants were highly critical of Al Qaeda &apos;s behavior , and began to move towards non-violence , depriving Al Qaeda of tens of thousands of supporters . 
This led to the transformation of entire organizations in Egypt , Libya , and Algeria , and of a significant number of individual militants in Saudi Arabia , Yemen , Iraq , Afghanistan , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , and other countries . 
In Egypt , al-Gama &apos;a al-Islamiyya ( Islamic Group , IG ) , a former Al Qaeda ally that cooperated in the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981 , has abandoned and delegitimized political violence . 
The IG , which led an insurgency in Upper Egypt from 1992-1997 and was implicated in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York , started disavowing armed tactics in 1997 , and consolidated this change by releasing some 25 volumes of theological and rational arguments to promote their new ideology . 
After Hosni Mubarak &apos;s fall from power in Egypt earlier this year , the IG , rather than stockpiling weapons and rebuilding its armed wing , held internal elections . 
The Egyptian al-Jihad Organization , which produced Ayman al-Zawahri , Al Qaeda &apos;s current paramount leader , also initiated a partly successful transformation process . 
Several of its factions still uphold armed tactics , including terrorism . 
The Libyan Islamic Fighting Group ( LIFG ) , another former Al Qaeda ally , abandoned the ideology between 2005 and 2010 and joined the revolution against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s dictatorship . 
The LIFG leader , Abd al-Hakim Belhaj ( a.k.a. 
After emerging victorious , Belhaj called for enhancing security , protecting property , ending vendettas , and building a new Libya . 
The moderate tone was generally consistent with what most of the LIFG leaders have been saying in the last six months , whether in eastern or western Libya . 
Overall , the Arab Spring delivered a heavy blow to jihadism and significantly undermined its rationale ( that armed militancy is the most effective and most legitimate tool for change ) . 
Indeed , the combined effect of intelligence operations , drone attacks , transformations within jihadi ranks , and the Arab Spring has thwarted the power of &quot; Al Qaeda Central . &quot; 
The franchises and rejigged ideology mean that some fragments of Al Qaeda will probably survive , because they are embedded more deeply within particular localities . 
But Al Qaeda as a global threat has been severely undermined .
