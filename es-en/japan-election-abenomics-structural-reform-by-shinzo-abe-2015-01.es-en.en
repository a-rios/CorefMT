Japan &apos;s Vote for Bold Reform 
TOKYO - With the powerful mandate of the Japanese people , demonstrated by their overwhelming vote of support in our country &apos;s December 14 election , my government &apos;s ability to act decisively has been strengthened immeasurably . 
Indeed , we now not only have the authority to act , but a clear and definitive message from the electorate that we must do so . 
In particular , we now have a mandate to launch what has become known around the world as the &quot; third arrow &quot; of so-called Abenomics : structural reform . 
By calling in November for a snap general election , my aim was to consolidate the government &apos;s political capital - not in order to hoard it , but to spend it on the reforms that were first promised two years ago . 
Now , with our renewed mandate , that is what we will do . 
First , we intend to subject Japan &apos;s tax regime to a fundamental review . 
Some of the agro-business organizations - the epitome of vested interests - must change , and we will push them to do so . 
Second , we must adapt Japan &apos;s labor regulations to the norms of modern life almost everywhere , which means allowing every individual to strike a beneficial balance between life and work . 
We Japanese will always work hard - I have no doubt about that . 
Moreover , it is not just bold domestic reforms that must be embraced . 
Japan also needs to change how its economy interacts with the world . 
Consider the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and the Japan-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement . 
Completion of both trade and investment deals are among the most urgent tasks we face , because Japan &apos;s economy needs powerful external catalysts to spur change in how we compete at home and for export markets . 
Japan has no alternative other than to do everything necessary and feasible to enhance its labor productivity . 
We now have the Japanese public &apos;s support to make all of these changes happen . 
That support is based on explicit statements of the government &apos;s intentions . 
For example , it is now well understood - and approved - by voters that , come April 2017 , my government will raise the consumption tax . 
Until then , we will no longer be bogged down in debating the merits of this decision . 
But we also know that the political space that we have secured is too precious to be squandered . 
We must use it single-mindedly to implement reforms that enhance Japan &apos;s long-term growth potential . 
Our country &apos;s global standing depends on it . 
Over the last two years , I have traveled 354,200 miles , visited a total of 62 countries , and conducted 246 one-on-one meetings with heads of state and other national leaders . 
These experiences have convinced me that there is an enormous amount of trust in the world about the path that postwar Japan has taken . 
In particular , there is no doubt about the norms and principles that our people and our government have long upheld , such as popular sovereignty , respect for human rights , and peace - all pillars of the Japanese constitution . 
Japan has also gained international credibility for the fact that , for seven decades , its diplomacy has not once sought to coerce or intimidate any other country with threats of military force . 
Most significant , global trust in Japan reflects the modesty and decorum that countless Japanese have exemplified as they worked to make our economy one of the world &apos;s three largest . 
The faith that the world has placed in Japan and its people has been Japanese diplomacy &apos;s most valuable asset . 
Our mandate from the Japanese people is to ensure that this tradition continues , undiminished , into the future . 
That is the oath I will be making as I assume leadership of Japan for the coming electoral term . 
For me and my government , the main task ahead - working even harder to restore Japan &apos;s economy - is inseparable from safeguarding our country &apos;s position in the global vanguard of peace , progress , and prosperity .
