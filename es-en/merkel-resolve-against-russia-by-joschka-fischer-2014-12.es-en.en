German Foreign Policy Comes of Age 
BERLIN - Germany &apos;s reunification , nearly 25 years ago , once again placed at the heart of Europe a large power whose location , economic potential , and , yes , history , raised suspicions of revived hegemonic ambitions . 
Major European leaders at the time - including Giulio Andreotti , Margaret Thatcher , and Fran√ßois Mitterrand - worried that Germany might seek to revise the results of the two world wars . 
In German political circles in 1990 , the very idea would have seemed monstrous and absurd . 
But the end of Germany &apos;s partition also meant the end of the Cold War &apos;s bipolar world order ; and , as the world confronts an accumulation of dangerous regional crises and tensions ( in Ukraine , the Middle East , and East Asia ) , the absence of a new order has become dangerously apparent . 
Worries about the return of history &apos;s ghosts so far have been unfounded , at least as far as Germany is concerned . 
Though the global financial crisis and its effects on Europe have de facto turned Germany into an economic hegemon , it is not a role that the government sought or relishes . 
The reunited Germany remains a peaceful democracy , recognizes all neighboring borders , and remains firmly anchored in NATO and the European Union . 
But , while Germany today poses no threat to its neighbors or the European order , this obviously was not always so . 
For the first 70 years after its unification in 1871 , Germany sought to enforce - more or less alone and against France - its political and military dominance in Europe . 
Failure in WWI led to radicalization under Adolf Hitler , which ended in total defeat and Germany &apos;s partition . 
West Germany , founded in 1949 , was anything but a sovereign power in foreign-policy terms . 
The start of the Cold War meant the young West German democracy &apos;s firm integration into the western bloc , under the tutelage of the three Western Allies - Britain , France , and America . 
Integration with the West took precedence over German unity . 
Neutrality in exchange for reunification did not have the support of a majority in the Federal Republic , and certainly not of the Allied powers . 
But successful integration with the West presupposed reconciliation with France , the old enemy and neighbor . 
Germany also had to overcome the moral catastrophe of Nazism . 
Its core foreign-policy concern was to regain the respect of the international community , and , ultimately , to retain the possibility of eventual reunification . 
These goals formed the basis of the Federal Republic &apos;s support for European integration , its approach to the Eastern Bloc ( Ostpolitik ) , and reconciliation with former enemies and the victims of Nazism - particularly the Jews . 
When reunification came , on October 3 , 1990 , Germany regained full sovereignty . 
It has been trying to figure out how to use it ever since . 
To do so could have created a strategic vacuum in the heart of Europe and raised questions about whether the country was perhaps again pursuing its own route , this time between East and West . 
Germany thus had to find a way forward that satisfied both the pacifism of a large majority of the German public and the military requirements of NATO . 
The fragility of Germany &apos;s foreign-policy foundations was to become clear during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis . 
Though the main democratic parties agreed after 1990 that continuity and predictability in German foreign policy were essential , it was Germany that opposed a European response to the crisis and insisted on national solutions that would be coordinated by the EU . 
As Europe &apos;s strongest economy , Germany suddenly was forced to lead . 
Germany &apos;s government still confuses the successful recipes of the Federal Republic with the very different needs of a continental economy &apos;s leading power . 
As a result , the EU has been in a permanent crisis , characterized by economic stagnation and high unemployment . 
But Russia &apos;s return to militarism in Europe &apos;s east now seems to be bringing about a gradual shift . 
Suddenly , the security of Germany &apos;s own territory is at stake again . 
Indeed , Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s policies imply a direct threat to the EU &apos;s most fundamental principles , which have defined German foreign policy for decades . 
It is no coincidence that one of Putin &apos;s central aims is to disengage Germany from the West ( or at least to neutralize it ) . 
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel has undergone a remarkable transformation . 
Though she has remained willing to talk to the Kremlin , her commitment to Western unity has been unwavering . 
This was clear in a recent speech in Sydney , in which she broke with the &quot; policy of small steps &quot; that had guided her in the post-2008 euro crisis . 
It was a remarkable speech .
