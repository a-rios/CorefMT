The Rising Sons of North Africa 
LONDON - The role played by Libyan ruler Muammar al-Qaddafi &apos;s son , Saif al-Islam , in gaining the release of the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi , and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s state visit to Washington accompanied by his son , Gamal , suggest that dynastic successions are underway in both countries . 
They are not alone . 
Mubarak and Qaddafi , along with Tunisia &apos;s Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria , are among the world &apos;s oldest and longest-serving heads of state . 
All four face the ticklish problem of succession , and speculation has been mounting for some time of possible attempts to keep power in the family . 
That solution is becoming pretty commonplace , from the Aliyevs of Azerbaijan to the Kims of North Korea to the Assads in Syria . 
Dynastic succession safeguards the immediate and frequently extensive interests of the ruling family as well as those of the wider political and business elite . 
But the possibility of near simultaneous successions in North Africa is striking nonetheless . 
All four North African rulers have , to greater or lesser degrees , made themselves the center of highly opaque power structures . 
Everything in their countries depends on the person and family rather than the office . 
Yet , despite these authoritarian leaders &quot; apparently solid grip on power , ensuring that a relative takes over is not as simple as it seems . 
The problem boils down to overcoming possible resistance - from both the elite and the public - that could derail the handover or undermine the successor &apos;s authority . 
Dealing with elite interests requires ingenuity . 
Lucrative business opportunities can be allocated to soothe the successor &apos;s political adversaries , while renegades can be targeted to discourage others - for example , by being stripped of property or dismissed from positions of influence . 
Where members of the ruling family hold direct commercial interests - as in Libya and Tunisia - the political transition is certain to cause collateral economic damage . 
For example , if Qaddafi &apos;s fourth son , Muatasim , emerges as the successor , he could take away Saif al-Islam &apos;s business holdings and ability to profit from foreign contracts . 
In Tunisia , a successor from the Trabelsi branch of the Ben Ali clan - linked to the president through his second wife , Leila Trabelsi - could target the extensive interests of families related to Ben Ali &apos;s daughters from a previous marriage . 
Securing popular legitimacy requires equal dexterity , which has played an important role in preventing North African leaders and family members from openly admitting their preparations for dynastic successions . 
In Egypt , where such preparations are the most obvious , Gamal and other senior figures have stubbornly denied his presidential ambitions . 
At the same time , room has been made for Gamal to build a public profile of his own through his senior role in the ruling party , and a constitutional framework has been put in place that will allow him to be elected in multi-candidate elections , thus establishing a façade of republican legitimacy . 
This strategy may find imitators . 
Ben Ali &apos;s son-in-law , Sakhr el-Materi , was last year elected to the central committee of the ruling Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique party . 
In Algeria , Bouteflika &apos;s brother , Said , has been linked to a &quot; grassroots &quot; movement that - it is rumored - could eventually serve as a basis for his succession bid . 
But these two cases are at much earlier stages , and their prospects for success more uncertain . 
In Libya , Saif al-Islam has sought to distinguish himself as an agent of democratic change by setting up &quot; non-governmental &quot; organizations , establishing &quot; independent &quot; media outlets , and even sponsoring his own private drafting committee for a new constitution . 
But he has encountered stubborn resistance from key elite groups , who regard his agenda as a threat to their vested interests . 
The legitimacy question is particularly problematic if the ruler &apos;s biography or charisma is closely tied to the legitimacy of the regime . 
In Libya , the regime &apos;s founding myth is inextricably linked to Qaddafi &apos;s 1969 coup and his eclectic political theories . 
His departure would expose the anachronistic nature of the state &apos;s ideological foundation ; family ties will do nothing to protect his successor from the resulting shock to the system . 
The Algerian situation is similar . 
The regime &apos;s legitimacy is based on the war of independence , with all presidents to date having played important roles in it . 
But Bouteflika &apos;s most likely successors , including his brother , almost certainly will not have this tie . 
As in Egypt , public opposition to a succession seen to threaten the republican order could sharpen the army &apos;s understanding of itself as guardian of the state , prompting it to intervene . 
This is much more likely in Algeria than in Egypt . 
Another public-relations problem concerns business interests . 
In Egypt , Gamal Mubarak will have to counter the widespread perception that his interests are aligned with close allies among the business elite , notably steel tycoon Ahmed el-Ezz . 
Gamal could seek to dispel this perception by publicly making examples of regime cronies involved in excesses . 
While business interests are not as openly discussed in Tunisia , they are no less unpopular . 
Ben Ali &apos;s successor could raise his profile by clamping down on cronyism . 
The four rulers have deliberately played their succession cards close to their chests . 
Keeping everyone in suspense helps prevent the emergence of organized opposition to a dynastic succession . 
Moreover , they may worry that heirs apparent will seek to force them out of office prematurely . 
Thus , Ben Ali has demoted prominent politicians back when they attained sufficient influence to be considered potential successors . 
He is apparently concerned that one of them could imitate a coup like the one he led in 1987 that toppled Habib Bourguiba . 
( He has since changed the constitution to prevent a repeat ) . 
In Libya , the fortunes of Saif al-Islam and Muatasim have waxed and waned as Qaddafi enforces his authority to prevent the emergence of a challenger . 
While few obstacles remain in Gamal &apos;s path to power in Egypt , in Algeria , meanwhile , a bid to install Said would likely collapse against resistance from powerful regime interests .
