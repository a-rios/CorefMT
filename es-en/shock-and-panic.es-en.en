Shock and Panic 
CARDIFF - No medical therapy is treated more differently by countries , regions , hospitals , and doctors than electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . 
This is surprising in an era when treatments that work should supposedly be used with some uniformity . 
In fact , despite a consensus that ECT is the most effective treatment for severe depressive disorder , it comes at the bottom of the list in most treatment regimens for mood disorders . 
Some of the unease about ECT stems from psychiatry &apos;s dark past , when patients in many countries had fewer legal rights than prisoners . 
Not so long ago , physical treatments such as lobotomy and ECT could be inflicted on patients without their consent , and sometimes for punitive purposes . 
But there is no comparable protest against the use of antipsychotic drugs , which have similarly been forced on people - and even used to torture prisoners . 
And , whereas few people now get ECT involuntarily , and in all cases consent is sought , a large and growing number get antipsychotic drugs under false pretences , including children , vulnerable adults , patients with Alzheimer &apos;s , and a host of others whose lives are shortened by treatment , with no effort undertaken to seek their consent . 
Although ECT &apos;s opponents believe that it causes brain damage , this is difficult to prove . 
Like antipsychotic drugs , antidepressants , and tranquilizers , ECT has an immediate organic effect . 
But , while ECT rarely , if ever , causes clear clinical evidence of brain damage and has not been shown to do so in animal studies , antipsychotic drugs regularly do , in the form of tardive dyskinesia and other syndromes . 
The same is true of antidepressants . 
There is no dispute that ECT can cause short-term memory loss . 
But critics have found it difficult to demonstrate memory or other cognitive problems that endure beyond three months . 
Nor can enduring autobiographical memory disturbances and inability to remember lists be readily attributed to ECT , because ECT is rarely given on its own . 
Indeed , very few of those who receive ECT do not also receive benzodiazepines , which do cause significant autobiographical memory problems when given alone , and antipsychotic drugs , which cause difficulties with lists of names or telephone numbers , and other comparable problems . 
Yet these drugs are rarely , if ever , blamed for cognitive disturbances following psychiatric treatment . 
The failure of ECT &apos;s critics to demonstrate what to them seems obvious indicates an active conspiracy to minimize treatment-induced problems and to block those who have been injured by treatment from seeking redress . 
In fact , at recent guideline meetings in the United Kingdom on the issue of ECT , there have been no representatives from psychiatry , but many from patient groups . 
Organized psychiatry appears to have little interest in ECT , or is scared of harassment from patient advocates . 
As a result , even evidence that a person &apos;s mood and clinical state has been significantly improved after ECT can be transformed into evidence of brain damage . When patients come forward to say they were helped by ECT , or a patient &apos;s medical record points to clinical improvement with treatment , the apparent improvements are read as indicating the disinhibition and vacuousness that accompanies brain damage . 
There are better targets in mental health than ECT . 
Where is the concern about the millions who are becoming physically dependent on antidepressants ? 
Where are the protests about the one-year-olds being treated with antipsychotic drugs ? 
How is it possible that , because no company with currently patented drugs is campaigning to help medical and nursing staff recognize the catatonic features displayed by one in ten patients going through a psychiatric unit - features that could be treated rapidly with benzodiazepines or ECT - these features are missed completely ? 
Why is it all but impossible to find anything but vilification of ECT on the Internet , and anything but glowing testimonies about drug treatments ? 
ECT &apos;s critics seem to think that if they do not protest against its use at every opportunity , its advocates will inflict it on people who do not need it . 
But , in contrast to psychotropic drugs , there are no marketing departments geared to maximizing ECT . 
This visceral focus on ECT has almost certainly led to ever more people ending up on drugs , and ever more brain damage and memory problems as a consequence . 
It sometimes seems that the critics are behaving according to the romantic illusion that if they can just abolish ECT , mental illness will disappear with it . 
Sigmund Freud would have been fascinated .
