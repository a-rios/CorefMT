Down With Human Rights 
The relationship between the United Nations and the human-rights movement has always been ambiguous . 
On the one hand , human-rights ideology - and it is an ideology , every bit as much as Communism was or neo-liberalism is today - is profoundly legalist , claiming legitimacy from treaties and other international and national instruments . 
These include , as &quot; first among equals , &quot; the UN &apos;s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights . 
The modern human-rights movement was born out of the UN , and in many ways it has never entirely left home . 
On the other hand , the UN is more a bully pulpit for the promulgation of the high ideals of human rights , equality , and personal and economic freedom than it is a way station on the road to world government ( no matter what some conservative extremists in the United States imagine ) . 
Indeed , at its institutional core , the UN is an inter-governmental body whose officials , from the most junior staffer to the Secretary General , serve at the pleasure of its member states - above all , its powerful member states . 
As a result of this profound contradiction between ambition and mandate , the UN often seems to impede the advance of human-rights goals as much as it realizes them . 
Doubters need only recall the unwillingness of Secretary General after Secretary General , from U Thant to Kofi Annan , to meet with - or , in some cases , even to permit on the UN &apos;s premises - victims of human rights violations who had the misfortune of being born in powerful countries . 
For all the UN &apos;s intellectual commitment to the furtherance of human rights , it knows better than to incite the displeasure of the Chinese or the Russians by receiving activists from Tibet or Chechnya . 
In fairness , no UN Secretary General has paid greater homage to the ideals of the human-rights movement , or attempted , at least rhetorically , to associate the UN with those ideals , than Kofi Annan . 
Rhetoric is not reality , of course , and the UN &apos;s declarations have often seemed far removed from its daily practice . 
Moreover , Annan &apos;s appointee as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , former Irish President Mary Robinson , was instrumental in many developing countries &quot; adoption of a human-rights agenda , which previously was often viewed as a flag of convenience for Western meddling . 
People close to Annan say that he hoped to build on these successes during the UN &apos;s recently concluded summit . 
In March , he wrote that &quot; the Organization &#91; must &#93; take the cause of human rights as seriously as those of security and development . &quot; 
Among his key proposals was the replacement of the largely discredited UN Commission on Human Rights - a body that has no mechanism for excluding even notorious human-rights violators like Libya , Cuba , or Zimbabwe - with a new Human Rights Council , where such embarrassments would in theory not be tolerated . 
It is generally agreed that the summit was largely a failure . 
Annan himself conceded as much in the speech he gave at the opening of the 60th UN General Assembly . 
There are many reasons for this . 
There was the US government &apos;s eleventh-hour decision to table hundreds of objections to the final Summit Declaration , effectively reducing it to a series of lowest-common-denominator platitudes . 
There was also skepticism among developing countries about whether a stronger UN commitment to human rights was what Annan claimed it to be or , instead , merely a moral flag of convenience - or worse , a legal warrant for Western military intervention . 
A great deal of attention has been paid to the stratagems of John Bolton , the fiercely anti-UN diplomat whom President Bush recently appointed US ambassador to the UN , and rightly so . 
But what has tended to get lost in these discussions are the malign synergies between a Third World suspicious that so-called humanitarian interventions are only colonialism redux and a unilateralist US administration wedded to the concept of pre-emptive war against enemies that it equates with states that violate human rights . 
Because the Bush administration , as its officials repeatedly insist , placed the installation of democratic , human-rights-oriented regimes , by force if necessary , at the core of US foreign policy , those who see only aggressive imperialism in America &apos;s interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq view human rights in a more skeptical light . 
In a sense , the UN , Annan , and the human-rights activists who have been perhaps his biggest backers , are caught in the crossfire . 
All of this brings to mind one of the great Spanish director Luis Bu√±uel &apos;s late films . 
The pre-credit sequence shows a group of Spanish guerrillas during the insurgency against Napoleon being led to a wall where they are to be executed by firing squad . 
At the head of the firing party , a French soldier carries the Tricolor forward . 
On it are the great words , &quot; Liberty , Equality , Fraternity . &quot; 
The guerrillas are led to the wall , and , just as the soldiers are raising their guns to their shoulders , one insurgent shouts , &quot; Down with liberty ! &quot; 
We have not progressed very far , it seems .
