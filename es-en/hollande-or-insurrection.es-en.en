Hollande or Insurrection ? 
PARIS - For better or worse , Europe is now engaged in an insurrection against the fiscal pact condemning European Union member countries to austerity without growth . 
Will it take a military coup to acknowledge that the situation is untenable ? 
Or will the election of Fran√ßois Hollande as French President shift Germany &apos;s uncompromising stance ? 
The prospect of reducing public deficits to less than 3 % of GDP is unrealistic in both the Netherlands and Spain . 
Unless it is ready to take punitive measures now , the EU will have to give these countries additional leeway - mindful that the European public tends to respond negatively every time it is consulted . 
In Greece , the recent election produced no government , necessitating another popular 
Ireland is fortunately less worrying , but the odds that the fiscal pact will be approved in a popular referendum are becoming longer . 
Granted , the removal of the unanimity clause provides a way to avoid this obstacle and allow for the pact &apos;s implementation . 
Even Germany &apos;s Social Democrats , whose support Chancellor Angela Merkel needs to secure ratification in the Bundestag , appear to have granted only conditional support . 
Germany is accused of monetarist dogmatism and of being responsible for accentuating the economic asymmetry between it and its eurozone neighbors . 
Its relatively good economic health allows it to finance its debt at less than the rate of inflation , while other European states finance theirs at rates that are three points higher than inflation . 
With Hollande &apos;s defeat of Nicolas Sarkozy , Merkel has virtually no support in the eurozone besides that of Finland . 
The tandem with Sarkozy was very useful to the Germans in advancing their views , while Sarkozy accepted his role in &quot; Merkozy &quot; in order to maintain France &apos;s key role in Europe &apos;s crisis management . 
In terms of form , traditionally pro-federalist Germany thus aligned with France &apos;s longstanding insistence on a Europe of governments . 
But , in terms of substance - austerity versus urgently needed economic growth - France lost . 
Hollande is determined to change course . 
He believes deeply in the centrality to Europe of the Franco-German relationship . 
Hollande &apos;s victory has already sharply redefined European politics . 
Almost all European governments are counting on him to change the balance of power . 
Rarely has a French election had such repercussions in Europe . 
Will he succeed ? 
The four proposals that Hollande has put forward are so consensual that it would be difficult for Germany to oppose them : use of non-disbursed resources from the EU Structural Funds , recapitalization of the European Investment Bank , creation of project bonds , and taxation of financial transactions . 
Significantly , two proposals that were most likely to meet German opposition - Eurobonds to pool risk and the transformation of the European Stability Mechanism into a bank that could borrow from the European Central Bank - were removed from his draft memorandum to European leaders . 
Despite the gravity of the situation , Hollande has three advantages : excessive austerity is unrealistic , given growing social opposition ; public deficits are only a small part of Europe &apos;s problems ( and are not necessarily the source of the crisis ) ; and a strong consensus has emerged outside of Germany to change tack . 
Moreover , during the upcoming G-8 summit , Hollande will enjoy the support of the United States , which worries that deflation in Europe would slow its own economic recovery . 
Germany has historically never benefitted from isolation . 
It is probably on the basis of this historical-political argument that Hollande will be able to bring about a German shift . 
Of course , one might argue that the emerging European consensus is quite ambiguous . 
Some favor stimulating growth through investment projects , while others emphasize structural reform . 
Furthermore , there is no guarantee that Hollande &apos;s proposals will quickly revive moribund economies . 
Indeed , it is blatantly obvious that in a country like France , reduction in public spending - especially the state &apos;s often-unproductive operating expenditures - is a prerequisite for recovery . 
Yet Europe &apos;s problems , by definition , cannot be solved simultaneously . 
And what is not at all ambiguous is the public &apos;s rejection of austerity - or , for that matter , financial markets &quot; increasing concern that long-term growth could suffer . 
That is a rare and powerful alliance , and one that Europe &apos;s political leaders ignore at their peril .
