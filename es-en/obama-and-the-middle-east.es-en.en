Obama and the Middle East 
BERLIN - With the successful enactment of his health reform , Barack Obama has achieved his biggest domestic success so far - which , surprisingly , had greater consequences abroad than at home . 
The US President , whose hands had been tied in recent months by domestic concerns , and whose political power had been progressively eroded , has suddenly returned to the world stage . 
Against this backdrop , the signing of a new treaty with Russia on nuclear-arms reduction , the global nuclear-disarmament initiative at the Washington conference , and an emerging new unity with Russia and China concerning further sanctions on Iran demonstrate the recovery of Obama &apos;s freedom of action and operational competence . 
In the process , America &apos;s new foreign-policy priorities and objectives are becoming increasingly clear . 
At their core lie Iran and its nuclear program . 
To be sure , worldwide nuclear disarmament is in itself a central issue for the Obama administration and , likewise , US relations with China and Russia influence many of America &apos;s other key interests . 
The various initiatives for nuclear disarmament are intended to build a new consensus on renunciation of nuclear weapons , which in turn would isolate and pressure Iran on its nuclear program . 
Cooperation with China and Russia serves , among other things , that same purpose . 
So , Obama &apos;s policy towards Iran will prove to be a test of whether the US , as a world power , can defend its interests more successfully by returning to diplomacy and multilateralism , thereby dissociating itself from the belligerent unilateralism of the previous Bush administration . 
As such , the success or failure of America &apos;s policy towards Iran will become a test of multilateralism itself . 
The difficulties are immense . 
America is fighting three wars in this region : in Iraq and Afghanistan , and - not to be forgotten ! - the &quot; war on terror &quot; against Al Qaeda and its offshoots , a war that is closely linked to the interests and conflicts within this large region . 
Obama must finish the first two wars within his first term - or at least massively reduce US military operations - for domestic-policy and budgetary reasons , if he does not want to ruin his prospects for a second term . 
Both wars are not only civil wars , but also proxy wars about regional power . 
The war in Afghanistan will not be decided by military force , but by the strategic interests of Pakistan and other regional powers . 
Every negotiated solution with the Taliban means re-establishing Pakistan &apos;s dominance in Afghanistan , at least partially . 
This , however , conflicts with the goals of America &apos;s &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
Besides , neither India nor Iran will simply accept such a compromise . 
In Iraq , the question of power-sharing between Sunnis and Shia has neither been resolved or secured institutionally in such a way that would definitively prevent a slide back into civil war after the majority of US troops withdraw in 2011 . 
Another significant factor is regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran over hegemony in the Persian Gulf . 
The US under George W. Bush successfully destabilized Iraq and increased Iran &apos;s influence there , and the question of whether and how Iraq can maintain its stability without US military presence remains open . 
As for the Middle East conflict , the conflicting interests of Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s administration and the American government are becoming clear . 
Netanyahu has the choice of either losing his majority in the government and the chairmanship of his Likud party by taking up Obama &apos;s peace initiative , or blocking that initiative . 
Everything favors his taking the second option , which will tend to lead to a standstill , and even a step back , in efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Looking at this picture , we should not forget the global dimension , either . 
Today , after the world financial and economic crisis ( and in contrast to 2001 ) , the US appears to be crucially weakened . 
Moreover , new superpowers with their own interests - namely , China and India - have come onto the international stage . 
Without the support of China and India , America &apos;s Middle East policy can no longer succeed , but this support is only granted half-heartedly - if at all . 
A success for American policy in this region holds very limited interest in Beijing and New Delhi , and Europe is neither willing nor able to contribute substantial support . 
In this tangled knot of regional wars , crises , and conflicts , Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions look like a ticking time bomb - and plenty of new dynamite is being accumulated throughout the region . 
If the Obama administration does not succeed in stopping Iran by peaceful means from crossing the threshold to becoming a nuclear power , a hot confrontation is lurking . 
It is hard to believe that Netanyahu , of all Israeli prime ministers , would be the one to accept idly Iran &apos;s entry into the nuclear club . 
It does not look good for Obama and his Middle East policy . 
In any case , he deserves every conceivable support .
