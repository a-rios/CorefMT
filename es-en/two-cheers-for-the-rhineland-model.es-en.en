Two Cheers for the Rhineland Model 
Not so long ago , Germans and other Continental Europeans pointed to America &apos;s &quot; working poor , &quot; as well as to the sorry state of public services in Britain , as defects that supposedly reflected the inevitable price Anglo-Saxon countries must pay for their ruthless form of capitalism . 
Europeans ( Germans in particular ) , on the other hand , enjoyed the &quot; Rhineland model &quot; : a market economy that harnesses economic success to the cause of social justice . 
So when Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , early in his first term , signed the so-called Blair-Schröder paper , which pledged agreement with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on liberalizing reforms , he made certain that it was published in London and played down in Berlin . 
Similarly , the European Union &apos;s Lisbon agenda of economic liberalization was never really taken seriously in Germany , France , or most other countries on the Continent . 
How things have changed in the last five years ! 
Today , few people - if any - refer to the Rhineland model with such satisfaction . 
As things stand now , the German economy lags behind most others in Europe , and almost all European economies trail Britain and the United States . 
Unemployment is high and growing , as German companies move production to low-wage countries in Eastern Europe or Asia . 
In Germany , &quot; capitalism unmodified &quot; has begun its reign . 
Profitable companies are closed if their returns fall below international standards . 
Managers &apos; salaries - including bonuses for failed or departing directors - have reached new highs . 
If all this leads people to conclude that social justice is being sacrificed to profits , cuts in public expenditure harden that conclusion even more . 
Social entitlements are being reduced , while individual contributions to cover the cost of health care , pensions , education , and basic welfare programs rise - not just in the Rhineland and neighboring länder , but in other countries that follow a similar model . 
One reason is straightforward and increasingly widely understood . 
The old system of social justice , the welfare state , was based on assumptions which no longer hold true . 
Some may never have been viable . 
For example , the Rhineland model used many measures of social policy that had built-in growth trends that were bound to make them unaffordable . 
This is true for health care . 
In addition , demographic changes reduced the number of contributors while increasing the demand for services . 
Unsurprisingly , high payroll taxes strained the capacity of working people and mounting non-wage labor costs eroded companies &apos; international competitiveness . 
For a while , borrowing hid the extent of the problem ; but today the extent of the burden that the accumulated debt that resulted from this borrowing is placing on future generations - a grave injustice in its own right - is clear . 
Thus , the Rhineland model &apos;s once-robust institutions of social justice were bound to be squeezed . 
But the capitalism that formed the Rhineland model &apos;s other component also changed , and here it is not wrong to blame globalization . 
Companies formed international links in order to remain competitive . 
Many of these links were with British or American companies , which led to a profound change in business culture . 
The old notion that large companies are responsible for their employees &apos; welfare from cradle to grave - providing not only wages and bonuses , but sports facilities , cheap holidays , and generous retirement benefits - fell into desuetude . 
Overseas owners were less than understanding of the German custom of paying a thirteenth monthly salary at Christmas . 
Beyond business culture , there is the fact that manufacturing , until recently the major source of strength of the German and other European economies , has begun to emigrate in a big way . 
Soon not only our refrigerators and television sets , but even our cars and machine tools , will come largely from China . 
There is no obvious substitute for such industries at home . 
Does this mean the end of the Rhineland model ? 
In the first instance , it does mean that reforms are necessary . 
People have become weary of the word reform , because for most it means a reduction in entitlements and living standards . 
Still , constructing a welfare state fit for new economic conditions is a task that must be undertaken . 
This will be a welfare state based on a new balance of solidarity and individual effort . 
It may mean that after a decades-long economic miracle , people must accept a modest reduction in their standard of living . 
The more difficult task will be to transform traditional economies into truly modern ones . 
No one has yet managed this process , not even the Anglo Saxons . 
A truly modern economy will be a service economy that combines high-productivity knowledge activities with indispensable personal service jobs . 
Such economies need not follow the same blueprint . 
It is possible - indeed , likely - that modern service-based economies will look very different in the Rhineland , Southeast England , Lombardy , and the Île-de-France . 
Such diversity may include varying degrees of social justice , if people choose to pay more or less for that purpose . 
So there is no reason for despair in the Rhineland - or for gloating by the enemies of its economic model . 
Even in an increasingly globalized economy , diversity will continue to be the hallmark .
