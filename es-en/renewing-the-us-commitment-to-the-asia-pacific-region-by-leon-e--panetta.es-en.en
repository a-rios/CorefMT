America &apos;s Pacific Rebalance 
WASHINGTON , DC - The United States military has entered a period of historic change after more than a decade of war following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
We ended the war in Iraq ; we are implementing an effective transition and drawdown in Afghanistan ; and we have seriously weakened Al Qaeda &apos;s leadership in the fight against terrorism . 
As a result of these efforts and the reality of budget constraints , the US has developed a new defense strategy for the twenty-first century , one that emphasizes agility , technology , and force projection . 
We have begun to focus on the challenges and opportunities of the future , and it is clear that many of them lie in Asia . 
After all , the global center of gravity is steadily shifting toward the Asia-Pacific , tying America &apos;s future prosperity and security ever more closely to this fast-growing region . 
At the same time , increasing military spending , challenges to maritime security , non-traditional threats ranging from piracy to terrorism , and the destruction wrought by natural disasters are making the region &apos;s security environment more complex . 
For these reasons , the US Department of Defense is implementing a &quot; rebalance &quot; of America &apos;s strategic focus and posture to the Asia-Pacific . 
The vast majority of America &apos;s rebalance comes in non-military areas like trade and development . 
This is part of a broad effort directed by President Barack Obama to deepen our diplomatic , development , economic , security , and cultural engagement across the region . 
For the Department of Defense , the rebalance is about helping to ensure that the US and all countries in the region continue to benefit from a secure and prosperous Asia-Pacific - as we have for nearly 70 years . 
This effort rests on four pillars.The first is America &apos;s longstanding commitment to a set of principles that helped to advance peace and security in the region in the twentieth century . 
As a Pacific power , the US has an abiding national interest in a just international order that emphasizes states &quot; rights and responsibilities and their fidelity to the rule of law ; open access for all to the global commons of sea , air , space , and cyberspace ; unimpeded economic development and commerce ; and resolving conflict without the use of force . 
These principles can and should underpin strong economic , diplomatic , and military relationships throughout the region today . 
The second pillar is a special priority of mine : modernizing and strengthening America &apos;s alliances and partnerships in the region , and developing new ones . 
That mission has led me to travel to Asia four times since becoming Secretary of Defense in July 2011 . 
It has led us to devote more resources and effort to building our partners &quot; capabilities and improving interoperability between the US military and forces in the region . 
We are also working to identify opportunities to deepen our cooperation in information security , intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance , and other high-tech frontiers - from cyberspace to outer space . 
For example , we are developing a new bilateral plan for the US-Japanese alliance &apos;s future roles , missions , and capabilities , and reached an agreement to position an additional missile-defense radar to protect against the North Korean threat . 
On my recent visit to Australia , we signed an agreement to relocate a space surveillance radar to Western Australia . 
And , in South Korea , our Strategic Alliance 2015 agreement charts a course for the future across a range of fronts , including cooperation in space and cyberspace , intelligence and information sharing , and command arrangements . 
Moreover , America is focused like never before on working with our allies and partners in South and Southeast Asia . 
With India , we have developed an unprecedented bilateral initiative that will streamline our export processes and deepen our defense trade and co-production . 
We are also pursuing new areas of cooperation in defense exercises , such as submarine salvage and rescue , reflecting this key partnership &apos;s growing dynamism . 
In Southeast Asia , we are expanding our engagement with the Association of Southeast Asia Nations ( ASEAN ) , increasing bilateral engagement with traditional allies and partners like Thailand , the Philippines , and Singapore , and developing our cooperative partnerships with Vietnam , Malaysia , and Indonesia . 
One of the most important ways to enhance alliances and partnerships is through joint training and exercises . 
During 2012 , the US increased both the size and the number of bilateral and multilateral exercises across the Asia-Pacific region . 
For example , the Rim of the Pacific ( RIMPAC ) exercise was the largest ever , including more than 42 ships and 25,000 personnel from 22 countries , while the US and China staged their first-ever maritime counter-piracy exercise near the Horn of Africa . 
In 2013 , we will engage for the first time in multilateral military exercises led by ASEAN , while China has been invited to send ships to RIMPAC 2014 . 
In support of this increased engagement - aimed not at establishing new permanent bases , but rather at building stronger allies and partners through a greater rotational presence - the third pillar of America &apos;s rebalancing is to enhance our presence across the Pacific and Indian Oceans . 
In Northeast Asia , where the US military has traditionally maintained a strong presence , we are modernizing our posture . 
This year , we deployed F-22s and MV-22 Ospreys to Japan and reached an important agreement to relocate our forces on Okinawa . 
We continue to develop Guam as a strategic hub , and plan to establish fully capable Marine Air-Ground Task Forces in Japan , Guam , and Hawaii . 
Meanwhile , we are retaining and upgrading US Army capabilities in Korea . 
The US military is also rebalancing within the Asia-Pacific region to place more emphasis on new partnerships in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean . 
Last spring , 200 US Marines arrived in Darwin , Australia , for the first six-month rotation to serve and train alongside Australian troops and operate with regional partners . 
We also increased the number and frequency of US Air Force aircraft rotating through Northern Australia . 
Finally , we agreed with Singapore to deploy up to four Littoral Combat Ships there on a rotational basis to join it and other countries in the region for exercises , training , and responses to challenges . 
The final pillar of the US rebalance is force projection . 
We plan to have 60 % of our naval fleet based in the Pacific by 2020 , and America &apos;s defense budget has preserved , and even boosted , investment in new and more capable assets needed in the Pacific theater . 
Our spending plan prioritizes the development and fielding of the newest , most capable technology , including Virginia-class submarines , fifth-generation F-22 and F-35 fighters , P-8 maritime patrol aircraft , new electronic warfare and communications capabilities , and improved precision weapons and cruise missiles . 
These are some of the capabilities that will maintain our forces &quot; ability to project power should our access and freedom of action be challenged . 
These four pillars reflect the Department of Defense &apos;s comprehensive approach to contributing to a peaceful and prosperous Asia-Pacific region in the twenty-first century . 
This rebalance is a long-term strategy , and in 2012 we laid a foundation for its long-term success . 
Nevertheless , questions and misperceptions remain . 
Some have concluded that the rebalance is directed at China . 
It is not . 
A key component of the rebalance is a healthy , stable , and continuous military-to-military relationship with China , based on sustained and substantive dialogue that enhances our ability to work together and to avoid any kind of miscalculation . 
I had a successful visit to China in September , and I am clear-eyed but optimistic about the future of this important military-to-military relationship . 
As the US seeks stronger defense ties with China and countries throughout the region , we expect and welcome other countries &quot; efforts to build ties with China and the US alike . 
Some argue that instability and turmoil in the Middle East will prevent us from implementing the rebalance . 
Our new defense strategy and budget makes clear that it will not . 
The US military is a global force that can walk and chew gum at the same time . 
Even as we rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region , we will retain a significant presence in the Middle East to deter aggression and promote stability . 
Finally , some question whether , given America &apos;s fiscal constraints , the US military can make the investments necessary to implement the rebalance . 
To be sure , the US is facing a new fiscal reality , and the defense budget must be reduced by $ 487 billion over the next decade . 
But budgets are about priorities , and we have clearly made the Asia-Pacific region a priority . 
We have a detailed plan for the rebalance in our budget , and we have made decisions that will make our military more cost-effective , efficient , and productive . 
America is and always will be a Pacific nation . 
The US has fought and spilled precious blood to give the nations in the Asia-Pacific the opportunity to achieve prosperity and security . 
We remain committed to improving the lives of all of those who are part of the Pacific family of nations . 
The purpose of the rebalance is to fulfill that commitment to the dream of a better and more secure twenty-first century .
