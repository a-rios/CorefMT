Rethinking the Monetization Taboo 
LONDON - Now that the pace of the US Federal Reserve &apos;s &quot; tapering &quot; of its asset-purchase program has been debated to death , attention will increasingly turn to prospects for interest-rate increases . 
But another question looms : How will central banks achieve a final &quot; exit &quot; from unconventional monetary policy and return balance sheets swollen by unconventional monetary policy to &quot; normal &quot; levels ? 
To many , a larger issue needs to be addressed . 
The Fed &apos;s tapering merely slows the growth of its balance sheet . 
The authorities would still have to sell $ 3 trillion of bonds to return to the pre-crisis status quo . 
The rarely admitted truth , however , is that there is no need for central banks &quot; balance sheets to shrink . 
They could stay permanently larger ; and , for some countries , permanently bigger central-bank balance sheets will help reduce public-debt burdens . 
As a recent IMF paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff illustrates , advanced economies face debt burdens that cannot be reduced simply through a mix of austerity , forbearance , and growth . 
But if a central bank owns the debt of its own government , no net public liability exists . 
The government owns the central bank , so the debt is to itself , and the interest expense comes back to the government as the central bank &apos;s profit . 
If central bank holdings of government debt were converted into non-interest-bearing perpetual obligations , nothing substantive would change , but it would become obvious that some previously issued public debt did not need to be repaid . 
This amounts to &quot; helicopter money &quot; after the fact . 
In 2003 , then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued that Japan , facing deflation , should increase public expenditure or cut taxes , funding the operation by printing money rather than issuing bonds . 
This , he argued , was bound to increase national income , because the direct stimulative effect would not be offset by concern about future debt burdens . 
His advice was not followed ; large Japanese deficits were in fact bond-financed . 
But the debts held by the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) could still be written off . 
In Japan &apos;s case , this would reduce government debt by an amount equal to more than 40 % of GDP today , and around 60 % if implemented after the bond purchases planned for 2014 . 
Objections focus on two risks : central-bank losses and excessive inflation . 
But both of these outcomes can be avoided . 
Central banks have bought government bonds with money on which they currently pay zero or very low interest rates . 
So , as interest rates rise , central banks might face costs exceeding their income . 
But central banks can choose to pay zero interest on a portion of the reserves that commercial banks hold with them , even when they increase the policy interest rate . 
And they can require commercial banks to hold zero-interest reserves at the central bank equal to a defined proportion of their loans , thus preventing inflationary growth of private credit and money . 
Permanent monetization of government debts is undoubtedly technically possible . 
Whether it is desirable depends on the outlook for inflation . 
Where inflation is returning to target levels , debt monetization could be unnecessarily and dangerously stimulative . 
Central-bank bond sales , while certainly not inevitable , may be appropriate . 
But if deflation is the danger , permanent monetization may be the best policy . 
I predict that Japan will , in effect , permanently monetize some government debt . 
After two decades of low growth and deflation , Japanese gross public debt is now above 240 % of GDP ( and above 140 % of GDP on a net basis ) ; and , with the fiscal deficit at 9.5 % of GDP , the debt burden continues to increase . 
According to the IMF , to reduce its net public debt to 80 % of GDP by 2030 , Japan would have to turn today &apos;s 8.6 % primary budget deficit ( the balance excluding interest payments ) into a 6.7 % primary surplus by 2020 and maintain such surpluses continuously until 2030 . 
That will not happen , and any attempt to reach that target would drive Japan into a severe depression . 
But the government does not need to repay the Â¥ 140 trillion ( $ 1.4 trillion ) of its debt that the BoJ already owns . 
The BoJ will continue to increase its balance sheet until it achieves its 2 % inflation target . 
Thereafter , its balance sheet may stabilize in absolute yen terms and fall slowly as a percentage of GDP , but its absolute size will probably never decrease - a likelihood that should cause no concern . 
It is precisely what happened to the Fed &apos;s balance sheet after its wartime and postwar buying of US government bonds came to an end in 1951 . 
Even as permanent monetization occurs , however , the truth may be obfuscated . 
If government bond repayments to the BoJ continued , but were always offset by new BoJ bond purchases , and if the BoJ kept the interest rate on reserves at zero , the net effect would be the same as a debt write-off , but the fiction of &quot; normal &quot; central-bank operations could be maintained . 
Central banks can monetize debt while pretending not to . 
That pretense may reflect a useful taboo : if we overtly recognize that debt write-off / monetization is possible , politicians might want to do it all the time and in excess , not just in circumstances that make it appropriate . 
The historical experience of Weimar Germany , or that of Zimbabwe today , illustrates the danger . 
As a result , even when permanent monetization occurs - as it almost certainly will in Japan and possibly elsewhere - it may remain forever the policy that dare not speak its name . 
Such reticence may serve a useful purpose .
