Diseases Without Borders 
DAVOS - Today &apos;s world seems more risk-laden than ever . 
The increasingly visible effects of climate change , rising geopolitical tensions , state crisis and collapse , inadequate or unequal economic opportunities , and the spread of infectious diseases - to name just some of the highest-profile threats - have created an environment of great uncertainty . 
Will 2015 be the year when these risks come to a head , or the moment when world leaders come together to develop real strategies for mitigating them ? 
This week , I am joining leaders from the worlds of business , government , politics , the arts , and academia at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , to discuss the risks that the world faces . 
Of course , determining which challenges merit the most attention will not be easy . 
That is where the WEF &apos;s annual Global Risks reports can help . 
Drawing on the perspectives of roughly 900 experts and decision-makers from around the world who participate in the WEF &apos;s global risks-perception survey , this year &apos;s report found that , for the first time in its ten-year history , economic risks are taking a backseat to environmental and geopolitical concerns . 
Specifically , participants rated interstate conflict with regional consequences as the top risk , in terms of likelihood , facing the world in 2015 , with extreme weather events coming in second . 
The top risks in terms of impact were water crises and the spread of infectious diseases . 
The point , of course , is not simply to highlight how much danger the world currently faces . 
By illuminating experts &quot; top-rated risks , the report highlights important opportunities for action . 
According to WEF founder Klaus Schwab , 2015 can be a &quot; year of destiny for humankind . &quot; 
Indeed , if global leaders - from multilateral organizations , governments , the private sector , and civil-society groups - seize opportunities for closer cooperation , long-simmering risks can be cooled before they boil over . 
One area where concerted , collaborative action can make a major difference is the spread of infectious diseases . 
During the meeting in Davos , officials will discuss the creation of a new global pandemic emergency facility that would enable countries to respond quickly to crises within their borders by providing them with the needed funds . 
To understand how badly the world needs this capacity , one need look no further than the ongoing Ebola pandemic , which has ravaged West African societies , claiming thousands of lives and upending many more . 
A rapid and determined response could have done much to contain the virus . 
Indeed , six months into the crisis , just 30 medical-response teams were treating and caring for patients on the ground in Guinea , Liberia , and Sierra Leone . 
The shortage of health workers , facilities , and supplies prevented many people from receiving treatment , allowing the virus to spread further . 
Fear of the disease &apos;s seemingly inexorable spread hampered trade , business activity , and travel in the affected countries . 
In December , the World Bank downgraded its growth estimates for the formerly fast-growing economies of Guinea , Liberia , and Sierra Leone , which are now expected to lose $ 1.6 billion in income in 2015 . 
In order to become better prepared to tackle future pandemics , the world must invest now in strengthening public-health systems , bolstering developing countries &quot; disease-prevention capacity , and establishing new and flexible financing instruments . 
A global pandemic emergency facility could mobilize public and private resources and frontload financing , so that when a global health emergency arises , funding is in place to support an immediate response at scale . 
As the Ebola crisis has demonstrated , passing the hat once a pandemic has taken hold is far too time-consuming and carries huge economic and , more important , human costs . 
Such a global resource could underpin the development of a comprehensive strategy to address the next outbreak , including a plan for putting health workers and supplies on the ground quickly . 
It could even provide a market signal for producers of vaccines and drugs . 
The WEF &apos;s Global Risks report emphasizes the need for robust plans to face the threat of pandemics . 
This is especially urgent in light of the rapid growth of cities and informal settlements - where infectious diseases can spread more easily - in developing countries . 
We need to start creating those plans now . 
After all , we do not know when the next pandemic will strike . 
We cannot eliminate global risk . 
We can , however , make our economies and societies more resilient and thus better equipped to minimize the impact of the threats we face . 
In this sense , forward-thinking initiatives like the global pandemic emergency facility are crucial to making the world a safer place for all of us .
