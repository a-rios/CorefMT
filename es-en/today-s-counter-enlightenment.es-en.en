Today &apos;s Counter-Enlightenment 
Not long ago , one might have concluded that , at least in Europe , there were no taboos left . 
A process that had begun with the Enlightenment had now reached the point at which &quot; anything goes . &quot; 
Particularly in the arts , there were no apparent limits to showing what even a generation ago would have been regarded as highly offensive . 
Two generations ago , most countries had censors who not only tried to prevent younger people from seeing certain films but who actually banned books . 
Since the 1960 &quot; s , such proscriptions have weakened until , in the end , explicit sexuality , violence , blasphemy - while upsetting to some people - were tolerated as a part of the enlightened world . 
Or were they ? 
Are there really no limits ? 
Outside Europe , the &quot; anything goes &quot; attitude was never fully accepted . 
And there were limits in Europe , too . 
The historian David Irving is still in detention in Austria for the crime of Holocaust denial . 
This is , to be sure , a special case . 
The denial of a well-documented truth may lead to new crimes . 
But is the answer to the old question , &quot; What is truth ? &quot; always so clear ? 
What exactly are we doing if we insist on Turkey &apos;s acknowledgement that the Armenian genocide did take place as a condition of its membership in the European Union ? 
Are we so sure of Darwin &apos;s theories of evolution that we should ban alternative notions of genesis from schools ? 
Those concerned with freedom of speech have always wondered about its limits . 
One such limit is the incitement to violence . 
The man who gets up in a crowded theater and shouts , &quot; Fire ! &quot; when there is none is guilty of what happens in the resulting stampede . 
But what if there actually is a fire ? 
This is the context in which we may see the invasion of Islamic taboos into the enlightened , mostly non-Islamic world . 
From the fatwa on Salman Rushdie for The Satanic Verses to the killing of a nun in Somalia in response to Pope Benedict &apos;s Regensburg lecture and the Berlin Opera &apos;s cancellation of a performance of Mozart &apos;s Idomeneo , with its severed heads of religious founders , including Muhammad , we have seen violence and intimidation used to defend a particular religion &apos;s taboos . 
There are questions here that are not easily answered by civilized defenders of the Enlightenment . 
Toleration and respect for people who have their own beliefs are right and perhaps necessary to preserve an enlightened world . 
But there is the other side to consider . 
Violent responses to unwelcome views are never justified and cannot be accepted . 
Those who argue that suicide bombers express understandable grudges have themselves sold out their freedom . 
Self-censorship is worse than censorship itself , because it sacrifices freedom voluntarily . 
This means that we have to defend Salman Rushdie and the Danish cartoonists and the friends of Idomeneo , whether we like them or not . 
If anyone does not like them , there are all the instruments of public debate and of critical discourse that an enlightened community has at its disposal . 
It is also true that we do not have to buy any particular book or listen to an opera . 
What a poor world it would be if anything that might offend any group could no longer be said ! 
A multicultural society that accepts every taboo of its diverse groups would have little to talk about . 
The kind of reaction we have seen recently to expressions of views that are offensive to some does not bode well for the future of liberty . 
It is as if a new wave of counter-enlightenment is sweeping the world , with the most restrictive views dominating the scene . 
Against such reactions , enlightened views must be reasserted strongly . 
Defending the right of all people to say things even if one detests their views is one of the first principles of liberty . 
Thus , Idomeneo must be performed , and Salman Rushdie must be published . 
Whether an editor publishes cartoons offensive to believers in Muhammad ( or Christ , for that matter ) is a matter of judgment , almost of taste . 
I might not do it , but I would nevertheless defend the right of someone who decides otherwise . 
It is debatable whether recent incidents of this kind require a &quot; dialogue between religions . &quot; 
Public debate making clear cases one way or the other seems more appropriate than conciliation . 
The gains of enlightened discourse are too precious to be turned into negotiable values . 
Defending those gains is the task that we now face .
