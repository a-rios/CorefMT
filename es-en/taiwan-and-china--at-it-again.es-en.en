Taiwan and China , At It Again 
Why is Taiwan &apos;s relationship with China so intractable an issue ? 
Why , when they share common economic interests - one million Taiwanese live on the Mainland , working in some 50,000 firms in which Taiwanese have invested over $ 400 billion - does China aim 500 short-range missiles at Taiwan ? 
The run-up to Taiwan &apos;s presidential election on March 20th is one current source of tension . 
The incumbent , Chen Shui-bian , has initiated a referendum process that might someday be used to ask Taiwanese if they want to formalize today &apos;s de facto independence . 
This infuriates China . 
After all , as Mao Zedong told Edgar Snow in 1936 , &quot; It is the immediate task of China to regain all our lost territories , &quot; explicitly including &quot; Formosa . &quot; 
Since then , China has sought to make good on Mao &apos;s pledge . 
China &apos;s new leadership often evinces a new judiciousness and moderation in its diplomacy . 
But Luo Yuan , a senior colonel at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences , recently declared that if Taiwan &apos;s leaders &quot; refuse to come to their senses and continue to use referenda as an excuse to seek independence , they will push &#91; their &#93; compatriots into the abyss of war . &quot; 
In an age when self-determination is a hallowed principle how is it possible that Taiwan - which has been part of China during only four of the last eleven decades , and has never been under the control of the People &apos;s Republic of China - is shunned by every nation when it deigns to wonder aloud why it should not be allowed to go its own way ? 
The reasons have deep historical roots . 
When Mao and the Chinese Communists came to power in 1949 , they promised &quot; reunification of the Motherland , &quot; which included bringing Xinjiang ( the Muslim desert regions of the West ) , Tibet , Mongolia , Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan back under central government control . 
It became a matter of national pride for a country that had been guafen , &quot; cut up like a melon , &quot; by predatory colonial powers , to end national feelings of humiliation by restoring itself to wholeness . 
Communist propaganda relentlessly proselytized for re-unification as a &quot; sacred &quot; duty . 
As Tibet , Hong Kong , and Macao returned &quot; to the embrace of the Motherland , &quot; Mao &apos;s commitment seemed close to realization . 
The fact that only Taiwan stands in the way makes reunification all the more non-negotiable . 
But , there is another dynamic at work . 
Over the last two decades , almost every other plank of the Communist Party &apos;s platform ( world-wide people &apos;s war , proletarian struggle leading to a classless utopia , a triumph over global capitalism , etc . ) , has been abandoned . 
This leaves unification as the last tie to Mao &apos;s revolution and justification for one-party rule . 
China &apos;s leadership plays up this &quot; revolutionary &quot; commitment , for it helps generate nationalist sentiment , one of the few things ( besides strong economic performance ) that legitimizes the Communist monopoly on power . 
China &apos;s leaders ought to reflect on the fact that their country is no longer the &quot; sick man of Asia . &quot; 
It is increasingly powerful , globally pro-active , and economically robust . 
So it is a timely moment to reappraise its position and to begin acting from strength , not weakness . 
In short , it is time for China &apos;s leaders to change the chemistry of their long feud with Taiwan . 
After all , China and Taiwan have struggled politically even as their economies become increasingly unified . 
In due course , they may well be able to become more unified on the political front - if they do not push their disagreements too aggressively . 
For economic convergence , if allowed to ripen , could set Taiwan and the PRC on an evolutionary course toward common sovereignty . 
How can such a scenario be realized ? 
China must declare , loudly and clearly , that greater democracy , not mutant Leninism , is its ultimate political goal , and that as this evolutionary process takes place and the political climate becomes more congenial , they look forward to discussing how to better weave a political , as well as an economic , fabric with Taiwan . 
Such a declaration alone would give Taiwanese the ability to imagine that they may one day find it in their interest to be part of China . 
For its part , Taiwan needs to calm down . 
Its leaders must understand that , even though &quot; independence &quot; may sometimes seem like a logical scenario , Taiwan is a small , vulnerable island , and China an emerging superpower . 
Even though Taiwan may have a &quot; right &quot; to independence , its leaders need to remind their people that provocative actions will gain them little . 
In 1973 , as Sino-US relations were thawing , Mao admitted to Henry Kissinger that , though he did not believe reunification would come peacefully , &quot; We can do without Taiwan for the time being , and let it come after 100 years ... 
Mao &apos;s advice is not bad . 
China must take to heart its newfound dynamism and strength , and write a new scenario for its relations with Taiwan that emphasizes persuasion instead of missiles . 
For the first time in fifty years , China and Taiwan share real interests . 
What blocks matrimony is China &apos;s lack of democracy . 
Most Chinese would probably like to see this absence remedied as much as they favor full reunification . 
Only democracy in China can bring lasting peace to the Taiwan Straits .
