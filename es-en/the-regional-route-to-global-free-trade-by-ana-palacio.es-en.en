The Regional Route to Global Free Trade 
MADRID - With the moribund Doha Round of multilateral free-trade talks awaiting its last rites , a new wave of regional trade negotiations has de facto taken up the mantle of establishing a global trade regime . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has placed the United States at the center of this shift , embracing two major simultaneous negotiations : the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) with the European Union ; and the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) with 11 countries in the Americas and Asia . 
As the only party to both initiatives , the US is well placed either to move them forward in harmony or to leverage the progress of one negotiation against the other . 
Beyond affecting America &apos;s immediate negotiating partners , the latter approach would gravely damage progress in establishing a rule-based global system . 
The new strategy of regional negotiations can succeed and provide a foundation upon which an international trading regime can be built only if the TTIP and the TPP are balanced and approachable to the wider international community . 
Otherwise , there is the danger of creating expensive global imbalances and even fragmentation . 
Europe has an important role to play in this regard . 
Broadening the discussion beyond a focus on the big two agreements - and beyond some of their substantive issues - will create a sense of urgency and purpose , pushing the US to engage actively or risk losing its central role in the global trade agenda . 
The EU is well placed to foster a conducive atmosphere by parlaying its existing trade partnerships , beginning with TPP members Mexico and Chile , with which it has longstanding free-trade agreements , and Singapore , with which it recently completed free-trade negotiations . 
More significant are Europe &apos;s other ongoing trade negotiations , which could be used to push the TPP / TTIP agenda forward . 
The EU-Canada talks , which should become a building block for harmonizing the TTIP and the TPP , have stalled and must be revitalized . 
Even smaller ongoing negotiations , like those with Malaysia and Vietnam , offer some opportunity . 
Most important , however , are the recently launched EU-Japan free trade talks . 
Europe and Japan are both facing difficult challenges , including rapidly aging populations and sputtering economies . 
Yet Japan enjoys the significant advantage of national cohesiveness , which occasionally allows for the type of bold and decisive action lacking in Europe . 
This assertiveness has been on full display under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who has vowed to attack Japan &apos;s prolonged economic morass using &quot; three arrows &quot; : expansionary monetary policy , aggressive fiscal policy , and structural reform . 
Abe &apos;s determined pursuit of the first two prongs has been well documented . 
Structural reform , however , is a more difficult proposition , with strongly entrenched interests and cultural values militating against change and opening up a partly closed economy . 
Indeed , the OECD ranks Japan last among member states in terms of regulatory restrictiveness with respect to inward foreign direct investment . 
The Abe government has touted trade agreements as a good way to push through needed reforms , and , although it is too soon to know what Japan &apos;s true position will be , indications are that it is a motivated negotiator . 
For Europe , which is seeking to expand its footprint in Asia , a strong link with a reformed Japanese economy would be a boon . 
Indeed , investment in Japan currently accounts for less than 3 % of the EU &apos;s total outward FDI . 
More significant , an engaged Japan that is willing to reach a deal will be a useful ally in pushing a forward-thinking and balanced trade agenda , particularly as the TTIP and the TPP appear headed for difficult waters . 
Japan &apos;s entry into the TPP this spring was a game changer . 
With a GDP matching that of all other TPP partners combined ( with the exception of the US ) , Japan adds significant economic heft . 
But it also brings added complexity , reflected in the reluctance shown by the US Congress immediately after Japan announced its desire to join the TPP negotiations , as well as in recent comments by American auto executives . 
The TPP is already in its 18th round of discussions , and , with some rumblings that China may join the negotiations , it appears that the talks will be prolonged significantly . 
Meanwhile , the euphoria that surrounded the TTIP in February , when Obama included it in his State of the Union address , has faded . 
Talk of &quot; one tank of gas &quot; has been drowned out by the drumbeat of l &apos;exception culturelle and the revelations of US spying on Europe made by the rogue American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden . 
The EU-Japan negotiations could be lithe in comparison . 
The bilateral nature of the talks makes them less unwieldy than the ever-expanding TPP . 
The disparity between the parties in terms of economic size - the EU &apos;s GDP is almost three times larger than Japan &apos;s - is not so wide as to lead to the strong-arm tactics seen in the EU-Canada talks ( a relationship in which Europe has a tenfold advantage in terms of output ) . 
Moreover , the EU-Japan talks lack the historical , cultural , and emotional baggage of the transatlantic relationship , and relatively subdued attention to them provides an easier environment in which to hash out difficult issues , such as government procurement and food safety . 
Trade negotiations are never easy , and the EU-Japan talks will be no exception . 
But if these two big players , both struggling to regain their luster , recognize the potential for the talks to be an engine for global trade reform , vital political will could and should be generated - particularly if European officials can develop a bit of Abe &apos;s boldness . 
If we are to keep this de facto regional trade round moving forward , we need more than just the TTIP and the TPP to do the peddling .
