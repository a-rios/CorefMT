India at the UN High Table 
NEW DELHI - Indian diplomacy began 2011 with election to the chair of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee , a body of some importance to the country ( and one which many thought India might not be asked to lead , given its strong feelings on the issue ) . 
Coming in the wake of India &apos;s record margin of victory in the race for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council , this news confirms India &apos;s standing in the world and the contribution it is capable of making on the Council . 
With such endorsements , however , expectations are high , and India &apos;s government will have to think about how they can best be fulfilled . 
This is an unusual year at the UN high table . 
Several powerful states , whose growing global role has made them aspirants to permanent seats on a reformed Security Council , will serve alongside India . 
Germany and South Africa were elected as non-permanent members at the same time , while Brazil and Nigeria are halfway through their two-year-terms . 
This also means that four international groupings will be represented on the Council in 2011 : the Russia-India-China triumvirate , whose foreign ministers meet twice a year ; the BRICs , which adds Brazil to the list ; the India-Brazil-South Africa alliance of the three largest southern hemisphere powers ; and BASIC , which brought Brazil , South Africa , India , and China together during the climate-change negotiations in Copenhagen last year . 
India is the only country that belongs to all four . 
That not only highlights the extent to which India has become a fulcrum in global politics , but also points to the exceptional composition of the new Security Council . 
Half the members of the G-20 , the grouping that is now the world &apos;s premier forum on international economic questions , will be on the Council , dealing with issues of global peace and security . 
The five permanent Security Council members - the US , Britain , France , China , and Russia - will not be able to take these members for granted . 
They have become accustomed in recent years to making deals among themselves and more or less imposing them on the ten non-permanent members . 
But the five big countries now also on the Council will expect to be consulted ; their acquiescence on key questions cannot simply be assumed . 
At the same time , the performance on the Council of those countries that aspire to permanent membership will be seen as a harbinger of what would come if they were to succeed . 
This puts the spotlight on India all the more . 
One immediate implication of serving on the Council will be the need to take positions on matters that in recent years some Indian mandarins have preferred to duck - for example , South Sudan , whose referendum on independence threatens to spark serious violence in an area where Indian UN peacekeepers are already serving . 
Also during India &apos;s first month as a Council member , the future of the UN peacekeeping operation in neighboring Nepal will be addressed . 
Before long , the Council will also have to consider the implications of the likely commencement of a US troop drawdown in Afghanistan , another area of direct importance to India &apos;s national security . 
Issues like sanctions on Iran , the stop-and-start Middle East peace process , and the world &apos;s response to a likely change of leadership in North Korea , will almost certainly appear on the Council &apos;s agenda as well . 
All are matters that call for creative and courageous thinking that transcends entrenched positions or reflexive solidarity with &quot; non-aligned &quot; countries . 
India will also have to reconsider its traditional opposition to the Council &apos;s tendency to broaden its mandate by taking on issues that India believes fall within the General Assembly &apos;s jurisdiction . 
The Council has tended to stretch into areas like HIV / AIDS , climate change , and women &apos;s empowerment , which inflate the term &quot; peace and security &quot; beyond recognition . 
And yet , as a member of the G-20 and the Security Council , India may well see an interest in bringing up issues of food security or energy security , which touch on both groups &quot; core concerns . 
There are serious staffing implications with respect to Security Council membership as well . 
The need to acquire expertise on diverse issues and to participate in the adoption of roughly 60 resolutions a year ( not to mention Presidential Statements on the same issues , which have less legal force but whose adoption requires unanimity ) will test India &apos;s capacity and negotiating skills . 
Various sub-committees and working groups of the Council ( including the Counter-Terrorism Committee ) will also require full-time attention . 
In August 2011 , India will preside over the Council by alphabetical rotation , and may find itself playing a key role in the election ( most likely the re-election ) of the UN Secretary-General , which must take place before the end of the year . 
All in all , India &apos;s place on the Security Council offers an extraordinary opportunity , after two decades of absence from the global high table , to demonstrate to the world what it is capable of . 
It should emerge from the experience with its reputation and credibility as a major global player enhanced . 
In any case , the world will be watching .
