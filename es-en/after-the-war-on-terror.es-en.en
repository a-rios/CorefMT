After the War on Terror 
NEW YORK - The basic outlines of Barack Obama &apos;s approach to foreign policy became clear in 2009 . 
His administration believes that the United States should talk with other governments even if it disagrees profoundly with their character . 
He prefers acting with other countries to going it alone . 
And he has shifted the focus of US foreign policy from what countries do within their borders to how they act beyond them . 
All of this differentiates Obama from his immediate predecessor , George W. Bush , whose administration branded selected countries as evil and mostly refused to deal with them ; often rejected cooperation with other governments , lest the US find itself constrained ; and sought to transform other countries , rather than to influence their actions . 
Any parallels between Obama &apos;s foreign policy and that of Bush are more with the father , America &apos;s 41st president , George H.W. Bush . 
Diplomacy , of course , should not be viewed as a favor or concession that signals &quot; softness . &quot; 
Obama rightly recognizes that it is an important tool of foreign policy , to be employed when it promises results that are more favorable than the alternatives . 
Obama is also correct that acting in concert with others is almost always desirable . 
The challenges that most define this era - nuclear proliferation , terrorism , global climate change , and pandemic disease - can be managed only collectively . 
Moreover , the reality is that the US is now too stretched economically and militarily to succeed by relying solely on its own resources . 
Finally , Obama is right to focus more on the behavior of countries than on their nature . 
It is not just that the assistance of odious governments is sometimes essential ; it is also that there is nothing more difficult than remaking the internal workings of other societies . 
Yet , even with these adjustments , and despite Obama &apos;s communication skills and his personal popularity ( reflected in his Nobel Peace Prize and in declining anti-Americanism around the world ) , 2009 was a difficult first year for his administration &apos;s foreign policy . 
To begin with , a willingness to talk to governments does not always translate into an ability to work with them . 
The US has shown new flexibility with Iran and North Korea , but neither has reciprocated so far . 
Reasonableness does not always yield results . 
Similarly , countries often choose not to cooperate . 
China , for example , resists using its influence with North Korea , fearing that instability on the Korean peninsula could lead to large refugee flows into China or a united Korea allied with the US . 
China prefers an imperfect status quo to such alternatives . 
For its part , Russia appears reluctant to pressure Iran to reining in its nuclear ambitions . 
Obama has worked hard to improve US-Russian ties : bilateral arms control is again a priority , and the president agreed to alter plans for anti-missile deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic . 
But Russian leaders resist tough sanctions on Iran , lest they jeopardize financial dealings there and lead to increased Iranian support for Muslim minorities inside Russia . 
As a result , it will be difficult in 2010 and beyond to develop an effective package of sanctions and incentives that enjoys broad international backing . 
Similarly , when it came to negotiating a new pact to mitigate global climate change , diplomatic efforts had to contend with international discord in 2009 , forcing leaders to postpone their efforts yet again . 
With developing countries fearing the impact of binding limits on carbon emissions on their economic growth , and with insufficient support in the US Congress , a global treaty appears unlikely in 2010 as well . 
In the Middle East , despite Obama &apos;s vow to re-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , progress remained stymied by differences over the scope and content of an agreement and how to bring it about . 
The lack of forward movement stems not just from disagreement over goals , but also from the inability of a divided Palestinian leadership to compromise . 
Weak protagonists make poor participants in peace negotiations . 
Moreover , other countries &quot; domestic politics do matter for what Obama can accomplish . 
Afghanistan &apos;s often corrupt and incompetent government undermines counter-insurgency efforts there . 
Pakistan &apos;s government does not share the same threat assessments or priorities as its American benefactor . 
No amount of increased American military effort is likely to offset the resulting lack of progress in weakening extremists in both countries . 
Domestic politics in the US is also getting in the way of Obama &apos;s foreign-policy goals . 
The absence of consensus on climate change , or resistance in Congress to new trade agreements , weakens the president &apos;s hand . 
And America &apos;s unwillingness to take meaningful steps to reduce its ballooning fiscal deficit further undermines the effectiveness of its foreign policy . 
Finally , some of what the Obama administration chose to do ( singling out Israeli settlements , for example ) and how it did it ( Guant√°namo comes to mind ) made tough situations tougher . 
But the larger truth is that the world has become a more difficult place to manage , much less to lead . 
The post-Cold War era of US unipolarity has ended , owing to America &apos;s economic mismanagement , the war in Iraq , the continuing rise of other countries , and globalization . 
There are bright spots , of course . 
America &apos;s relations with other major powers - China , India , Japan , Russia , Europe , and Brazil - are at least as cooperative as they are competitive ; conflict between such major powers , the dominant characteristic of the international order in the twentieth century , is unlikely . 
It is also possible that some of today &apos;s most closed countries , including Iran , North Korea , Burma , Cuba , and Venezuela , will become more open and less threatening with time . 
On balance , though , early evidence suggests that this will not be an era of smooth multilateralism or American leadership . 
Something more complicated , and unwieldy , appears increasingly likely . 
Barack Obama &apos;s next three years in office ( or seven , if he is re-elected in 2012 ) will likely be characterized as much by frustration as by accomplishment .
