The Deadly Axis of TB and Diabetes 
PARIS - Last year , tuberculosis surpassed HIV / AIDS to become the world &apos;s deadliest infectious disease . 
According to a recent report by the World Health Organization , the illness claims about 1.5 million lives every year . 
Astonishingly , one out of every three people worldwide lives with a latent TB infection that could eventually develop into the active - and potentially deadly - form of the disease . 
Great progress has been made in the fight against TB in recent decades ; since 2000 , some 43 million lives have been saved as a result . 
But world leaders have yet to mount a response commensurate with the scale of the problem . 
That needs to change - especially as we learn more about the interaction between TB and another deadly global killer : diabetes . 
Type-2 diabetes not only renders the body incapable of processing or responding to insulin ; it also weakens the immune system , increasing its victims &quot; risk of developing active TB . 
People with diabetes are three times more likely to fall prey to TB . 
Diabetes can also make patients less responsive to standard TB therapies and elevate the chance of relapse after the disease has been treated . 
Meanwhile , by driving up blood sugar in its initial stages , TB can aggravate or lead to diabetes . 
And , to make matters worse , certain key TB drugs can have adverse interactions with standard oral diabetes medications , rendering them less effective . 
These interactions will only become more common . 
Today , nearly 390 million people suffer from Type-2 diabetes , and within two decades the total number of cases is expected to exceed 592 million . 
Alarmingly , six of the ten countries projected to have the highest rates of diabetes by mid-century - Russia , India , China , Brazil , Indonesia , and Pakistan - are also classified by the WHO as having high TB burdens . 
This is not the first time we face such a problem . 
Two decades ago , TB and HIV / AIDS were paired in a similar deadly interplay . 
AIDS , like diabetes , weakens the immune system , making its victims more susceptible to active TB . 
From 1990 to 2005 , when HIV was infecting some two million people a year in Sub-Saharan Africa , the rate of new TB cases in the region quadrupled . 
World leaders were slow to react to the crisis - and the delay caused tremendous suffering and loss of life . 
Eventually , as the death toll mounted , leaders began to appreciate the scope of the problem and understand the need for collaborative action . 
Local healthcare clinics started bundling testing and treatment for the two diseases ; and , as anti-viral medications have become available in Africa , the rate of TB infections in HIV patients has begun to fall . 
But the effects are still being felt today . 
According to the WHO , about one-third of HIV / AIDS deaths in 2014 were attributable to TB . 
This time , with diabetes on the rise , we must not wait until the crisis spirals out of control before we act . 
On November 2 , public-health stakeholders , including representatives of business , civil society , and international aid organizations , gathered in Bali , Indonesia , to lay the groundwork for a global campaign to tackle the looming co-epidemic of TB and diabetes - the first-ever health summit specifically focused on a response to the twin scourge . 
That event , hosted by the Indonesian Ministry of Health , drew experts from Asia , Africa , Europe , and North America . 
Attendees were asked to sign &quot; The Bali Declaration , &quot; a pledge to implement specific health-care policies proven to help bring down TB and diabetes rates . 
The measures include concrete and relatively simple steps like &quot; bidirectional screening , &quot; which requires any person diagnosed with diabetes to be tested for tuberculosis and vice versa . 
Early bidirectional screening programs in India , China , and other heavily affected countries offer hope that the two diseases can be better managed . 
The Bali summit highlighted the indispensable opportunity we have to take preemptive action against a looming health-care crisis . 
But it must be followed by urgent action and commitment of resources . 
World leaders must be made to recognize the dual threat of TB and diabetes - and make it a high policymaking priority - before it is too late .
