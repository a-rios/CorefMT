An India-Pakistan Diplomatic Test Match 
LAHORE - In 2005 , during a visit to Islamabad , I met Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and told him of a conversation I had had with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India . 
The Indian leader , whom I have known for years , had said that he wanted better relations with Pakistan as one his legacies . 
Musharraf &apos;s response was interesting . 
He said he had the same aspiration , but that it would need effort from both sides to move things along . 
&quot; I have invited Manmohan a half-dozen times to visit Pakistan . 
I have also offered to take him to his village near Chakwal , a few miles south of Islamabad , where he was born . 
But he continues to demur , &quot; he told me . 
I repeated the conversation to Singh , who explained that in a democracy such as India , a great deal of work needs to be done with the members of the coalition and the senior bureaucracy before the prime minister can travel to Pakistan . 
&quot; Musharraf is a military leader ; he needs only to pack his bags and head this way . &quot; 
Musharraf did head that way a few months later , when he forced an invitation out of Singh to watch a cricket match between the two sides in New Delhi in 2005 . 
It took the Indian government some time to formulate an answer to Musharraf &apos;s request for a visit . 
When it came , it carried Singh &apos;s characteristic warmth . 
At the end of a speech in the Lok Sabah , the lower house of India &apos;s parliament , Singh issued his formal invitation . 
&quot; How nice it would be to conduct our affairs in this august House with the same spirit of sportsmanship that our cricketers exhibit on the playing fields of the sub-continent , &quot; he said . 
&quot; I am happy to inform the honorable members of this House that I have decided to invite President Musharraf to come to India to watch the cricket match between our two teams . 
It is my earnest desire that the people in our neighborly countries and their leaders should feel free to visit each other whenever they wish to do so . 
Be it to watch a cricket match ; be it do some shopping ; be it to meet friends and families - India is proud to be an open society , an open economy . 
I do hope that President Musharraf and his family will enjoy their visit to our country . &quot; 
The prime minister &apos;s statement was received with cheers , not the jeers that some of his aides had feared . 
Musharraf went to Ferozeshah Kotala cricket ground in Delhi and saw his team win the match . 
He and Singh also found time during the game to talk about bilateral relations , and agreed to launch what came to be called the &quot; composite dialogue , &quot; covering eight contentious issues that had soured ties for so long . 
Three years later , a Pakistan-based terrorist group killed more than 160 people in Mumbai , India &apos;s financial capital - and , with them , the diplomatic opening initiated by cricket . 
Once again , however , cricket has revived dialogue between the sub-continent &apos;s two nuclear-armed rivals . 
This time , the initiative came from Singh , who invited his Pakistani counterpart , Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani , to visit Mohali , near New Delhi , to watch the two countries play the semi-final in the Cricket World Cup . 
The match was played on March 30 , with Pakistan losing narrowly . 
On the political side , however , the two countries were not evenly matched . 
Of the troika that currently governs Pakistan - the president , the prime minister , and the chief of staff of the army - it is the prime minister who carries the least amount of authority . 
It was Gilani who sat next to Singh to watch the game ; but , ultimately , process , rather than protocol , will determine how bilateral relations move forward . 
After the match , Singh said that &quot; India and Pakistan should be working together to find cooperative solutions and need permanent reconciliation to live together in dignity and honor . 
We should put our ancient animosities behind us to attend to the problems our two nations face . &quot; 
Gilani expressed the same sentiment : &quot; We need to focus on dealing with our common enemies - inflation , poverty , hunger , disease , and unemployment - for the prosperity of the two countries . &quot; 
There have been indications of a gradual thaw . 
Senior officials from the ministries of commerce , defense , and foreign affairs will meet in the next two months followed by a meeting of the foreign ministers . 
Gilani invited Singh to visit Pakistan , an invitation that &quot; will be considered carefully , &quot; according to Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao . 
And she spoke of a new environment : &quot; Today , it is the Mohali spirit that pervades our relationship . 
This was an extremely positive and encouraging spirit that has been generated as a result of today &apos;s meetings . &quot; 
We have been here before , of course , only to see prospects for improved India-Pakistan relations snuffed out . 
There are no guarantees that this time will be different . 
But , for both countries , hope dies last .
