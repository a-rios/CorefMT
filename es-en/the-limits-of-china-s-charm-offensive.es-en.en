The Limits of China &apos;s Charm Offensive 
BRUSSELS - To many people in the West , China seems to have gone from a country that &quot; keeps a cool head and maintains a low profile , &quot; in Deng Xiaoping &apos;s formulation , to one that loves a good international bust-up . 
Putting an Australian mining executive behind bars for ten years , squeezing out Google , keeping the European Union at bay for an important dialogue , and letting a mid-level official wag his finger at US President Barack Obama at the Copenhagen Climate summit is not , after all , the best way to convince partners of your constructive intentions . 
Nor is it reassuring to recall that China , up to now , has been stubbornly watering down sanctions on Iran , investing in major offensive military systems , and pillorying Western leaders for irresponsible financial policies and protectionism . 
But the point in reciting this litany is not so much to highlight China &apos;s wayward behavior as it is to demonstrate the dilemma in which the country finds itself : if it behaves like a &quot; normal &quot; power , the world will forget the many hundreds of millions of people that it still needs to pull out of poverty . 
The Chinese leadership seems to be aware of this dilemma and is not , in fact , eager to be dragged into fierce competition with the West or its neighbors . 
During the recent National People &apos;s Congress , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stressed that China should not punch above its weight , and that the People &apos;s Republic still needs stability if it is to become a society that offers a decent life to all of its citizens . 
In recognition of this , China has stepped up its efforts to mend fences . 
President Hu Jintao &apos;s visit to Washington was a clear attempt to de-escalate tensions with the US over American arms sales to Taiwan , the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate , and Obama &apos;s meeting with the Dalai Lama . 
China will likely go to great lengths to foster a more positive attitude among the dozens of European leaders visiting this year &apos;s World Expo in Shanghai . 
At a lower level , too , China has unleashed an impressive charm offensive . 
State broadcaster CCTV will launch a worldwide program to explain the Chinese position on international affairs . 
In Brussels and Washington , one gets the impression that the mission of China &apos;s diplomats nowadays is to meet and charm everyone . 
Hardly a week passes without the Chinese ambassador giving eloquent speeches for different audiences . 
Indeed , in Brussels , events are organized for members of the European Parliament , the business community , and even high school students . 
Chinese diplomats now maintain closer relations with think tanks than their European counterparts do , and are praised for their constructive contribution to the public debate . 
But charm will not make up for lack of progress at the official level . 
It is unlikely that cajoling Western elites will mitigate the deep-seated uncertainty in the US and Europe about China &apos;s rise . 
And economic stagnation in the West will inevitably exacerbate distrust vis-Ã -vis the rising power as the relative gains from trade diminish and defensive and even protectionist policies likely follow - no matter how much China smiles at the world . 
China needs a mature strategic dialogue , particularly with the EU . 
This will not rescue the partnership , but at least it could help define common interests , identify policy options , and create the conditions to achieve results . 
Interests , not comradeship , should guide policies . 
One can have the most visible business summits possible , but if Western companies do not gain greater access to the Chinese market , or if they feel threatened by heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises , relations will continue to sour . 
We can stage round-table after round-table to discuss the importance of our relations with China , but if issues like Iran , Africa , or other trouble spots are not managed better , the West will inevitably consider China a security threat . 
Cultivating high expectations without progress could even be dangerous . 
In the short term , it would reduce the sense of urgency among decision makers to get serious about translating ambitions into deeds . 
In the long run , the growing expectation gap would aggravate the inevitable setbacks , and political leaders who championed closer relations could even be replaced by hard-liners . 
&quot; The crash will come if things go on like this , &quot; Otto von Bismarck wrote in the nineteenth century . 
&quot; We ought to do all we can to weaken the bad feeling , which has been called out through our growth to the position of a real great power . 
In order to produce this confidence , it is above all necessary that we are honorable , open , and easily reconciled in case of frictions . &quot; 
But even Germany &apos;s Iron Chancellor had to watch as distrust , economic nationalism , and populism pulled the European powers into a downward spiral of trade wars and diplomatic rivalry . 
History offers too many examples of once-promising partnerships collapsing in a climate of uncertainty for China and the West to take their relations for granted . 
For China , it will be hard to build confidence if Europe and the US doubt their own future . 
And China will remain prickly as long as it fears protectionism or a new containment strategy . 
Neither side can talk its way out of this predicament . 
If Beijing is serious about building strategic partnerships with the West , it should back up its charm offensive with deeds and take the initiative in fostering more effective cooperation .
