America &apos;s Economic Stalemate 
CAMBRIDGE - The United States appears trapped in a dangerous economic stalemate . 
The refusal by both Republicans and Democrats to give ground on the budget is preventing the government from dealing with its massive fiscal deficit and rapidly rising national debt . 
Indeed , the Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt could increase to 82 % of GDP over the next ten years - more than double the debt ratio as recently as 2008 . 
That forecast , moreover , is based on quite optimistic assumptions of strong economic growth and low interest rates . 
With slower growth and more normal interest rates , the debt ratio could easily rise to more than 100 % in 2021 , and exceed 150 % by 2030 . 
A major reason for the accelerating growth in government debt is America &apos;s rapidly aging population and the resulting increase in the cost of the universal pension and health-care programs - Social Security and Medicare . 
Most experts believe that limiting the rise in debt will require slowing the growth of these &quot; entitlement &quot; programs and increasing taxes as a share of GDP . 
But President Barack Obama and the congressional Democrats oppose any reduction in future entitlement programs , while the Republican presidential candidates and their party &apos;s congressional delegation oppose any increase in tax revenues . 
The result is the current stalemate in reducing the fiscal deficit and reversing the growth of the national debt . 
Republicans argue that the national debt &apos;s growth should be limited only by cutting government spending . 
Although some cuts in traditional outlays should be part of efforts to rein in spending , this approach should be supplemented by reducing &quot; tax expenditures &quot; - the special features of the tax code that subsidize health care , mortgage borrowing , local-government taxes , etc .. 
Limiting tax expenditures could reduce the annual deficit by as much as 2 % of GDP , thereby reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021 by more than 25 percentage points . 
Republicans generally reject this form of spending reduction , because it results in additional tax revenue . 
While this method does indeed increase total revenue , the economic effect of limiting tax expenditures is the same as it is under any other method of cutting spending on those programs . 
But the Republicans &quot; opposition to anything that raises revenue means that this key to breaking the budget stalemate won &apos;t be implemented . 
The budget cost of Social Security pensions could be gradually reduced by substituting annuities generated by investment-based personal retirement accounts for part of the current tax-financed benefits . 
But even though such a reform could maintain income levels for retirees , Democrats oppose it , because it lowers traditional government benefits . 
This reinforces the stalemate . 
The two parties &quot; hardline stances anticipate the upcoming congressional and presidential elections in November 2012 . 
The Republicans , in effect , face the voters with a sign that says , &quot; We won &apos;t raise your taxes , but the Democrats will . &quot; 
The Democrats &quot; sign , by contrast , says , &quot; We won &apos;t reduce your pension or health benefits , but the Republicans will . &quot; 
Neither side wants any ambiguity in their message before the election , thus ruling out the possibility of any immediate changes in tax expenditures or future Social Security pensions . 
But , for the same reason , I am optimistic that the stalemate will end after the election . 
At that point , both Republicans and Democrats will be able to accept reforms that they must reject now . 
Another post-election route to deficit reduction would be to lower marginal tax rates and balance that revenue loss with cuts in tax expenditures . 
Official analyses downplay the effect of lower marginal tax rates on taxable income , but experience shows that taxable income rises substantially as taxpayers respond to lower marginal rates by working more , taking more of their compensation in taxable cash than in fringe benefits , and reducing their tax-deductible consumption . 
Reducing tax expenditures while lowering marginal tax rates can produce substantial revenue by increasing the level of taxable income . 
The current economic stalemate is troubling , because financial markets could react adversely , and because delays in addressing the fiscal deficit means a higher national debt . 
I may be too optimistic , but I think there is good reason to believe that the current budget stalemate reflects election posturing , and that the US political system will prove more effective at making progress on fiscal consolidation once the election is past .
