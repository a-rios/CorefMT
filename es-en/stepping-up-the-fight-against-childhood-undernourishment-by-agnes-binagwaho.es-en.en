Diet and Growth 
KIGALI - There is no greater hindrance to a country &apos;s long-term economic development than childhood undernourishment . 
When a growing body does not get enough essential vitamins and nutrients , the harmful effects last long into adulthood . 
In low-income countries , diets consist primarily of starches , such as rice , and legumes , like peas , that contain very little protein . 
So even a child with a full belly does not necessarily get the right balance of nutritious food and vitamins required for healthy physical development . 
This takes an enormous toll . 
Undernourished children are more susceptible to illness . 
According to UNICEF , children who suffer from severe under-nutrition are 9.5 times more likely to die from diarrhea and 6.4 times more likely to die from pneumonia . 
Fully one in three preventable deaths among young children worldwide - up to 2.5 million each year - are the result of inadequate nutrition . 
Worldwide , one in four children under the age of five is stunted , meaning that chronic under-nutrition has caused serious and often irreversible physical and cognitive damage . 
There were 165 million stunted children in 2001 , equivalent to half the population of the United States . 
Stunted children often struggle to reach their potential in school and ultimately the workplace , diminishing economic productivity and development . 
A World Bank study found that under-nutrition can cost an individual up to 10 % of his or her potential lifetime earnings , and as much as 3 % of a country &apos;s GDP . 
To combat this problem , we need a multi-pronged approach that marshals all available resources to ensure good nutrition among children . 
That starts with strong leadership in countries where the challenge is acute . 
While my country , Rwanda , has reduced child mortality by 70 % over the past decade , the rate of stunting remains high , with 44 % of children under the age of five chronically malnourished . 
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has initiated a national emergency plan to address the fundamental causes of malnutrition . 
This means not only increasing available food sources for children , but also educating families about the importance of nutritious diets . 
Between 2006 and 2011 , for example , we doubled the agriculture budget , distributed more than 2,000 cows to low-income families , and expanded milk delivery and fruit and vegetable gardens across the country . 
Community health workers in each of Rwanda &apos;s 15,000 villages , as well as nurses at health centers across the country , periodically measure the weight and height of each child under the age of five , referring for help those identified as malnourished or at risk . 
At the same time , ensuring that these efforts translate into better health outcomes requires a revolution in the way families prepare their children &apos;s food . 
Our government has started a massive educational campaign to broaden understanding of the importance of nutritious diets . 
Pamphlets have been distributed across the country detailing the kinds of foods that children need , how to cook them , and the need for proper hygiene and exclusive breastfeeding for children under the age of six months . 
In each village , a woman skilled in communication will teach families how to prepare balanced meals and ensure adequate nutrition for children . 
Providing proper nutrition in a child &apos;s first thousand days is particularly important . 
The British medical journal The Lancet has described a package of effective interventions to accomplish this . 
Recommended measures include providing essential vitamins and minerals through enriched foods and supplements ; promoting breastfeeding and nutritious complementary feeding for weaning babies ; and treating severely malnourished children with therapeutic foods such as specially fortified peanut butter . 
There is an emerging consensus on the need to address under-nutrition worldwide . 
Last year , the Copenhagen Consensus - an esteemed panel of economists including several Nobel Laureates - ranked child nutrition as the top priority on its list of cost-effective investments that would improve global welfare . 
In many low-income countries , making these investments will require forging partnerships with foreign governments - and we welcome the vital role that donor programs , aid agencies , and volunteer organizations can play by working within the framework of national plans . 
Regional collaboration will also be key to fulfilling our commitment to succeed in fighting malnutrition . 
For us , this means working closely with our neighbors in the East African Community . 
On June 8 , just ahead of the G-8 Summit , the United Kingdom will convene a summit on Nutrition for Growth . 
Leaders from rich and poor countries , foundations , non-governmental organizations , and private industry will gather to make specific commitments to invest in nutrition . 
I hope that they will increase their efforts - and that they think hard about how to ensure that all sectors of recipient countries &quot; economies benefit through local procurement . 
Simply flooding markets with cheap high-calorie , low-nutrient grains will never solve chronic malnutrition . 
A change of mindset among development partners is required , along with long-term commitments to building sustainable , diversified , and equitably distributed systems of food production and distribution . 
The investments needed to make this happen represent a fraction of most donor assistance to low- and middle-income countries , but would have a massive global impact on human development in the long term . 
All of these efforts - production of affordable and nutritious food , ensuring its availability everywhere , and education about how to prepare it - will be essential if Rwanda and other countries are to succeed in ensuring that children receive the nourishment they need to live healthy and productive lives . 
Our job will not be finished until every child is assured a healthy and balanced diet and the opportunity to reach his or her full potential .
