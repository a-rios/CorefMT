Sputnik Redux 
CAPE CANAVERAL - More than 50 years ago ( 1957 ) , the Soviets launched the world &apos;s first orbiting satellite , beating the US into space . 
For Americans , the so-called &quot; Sputnik moment &quot; was a wake-up call that pushed the United States to increase investment in technology and science education . 
Months later , the US launched the Explorer 1 satellite , and the race was on . 
Children were encouraged to study math and science , and American know-how helped the US meet the challenge . 
But things have slowed down dramatically since then , and NASA has been trying since early November to get its latest shuttle ready for launch . 
In December , US President Barack Obama talked of the need for a new &quot; Sputnik moment &quot; to revitalize America &apos;s once-leading role in technology . 
Ironically , that moment happened two days later , but with lamentably little media coverage . 
However , this Sputnik moment - actually a &quot; Dragon moment &quot; - delivers a somewhat different message . 
The launch of the Dragon spacecraft was in fact a US achievement , in a traditionally American spirit . 
On December 8 , a US company , SpaceX , founded by an immigrant and financed mostly by private US investors , successfully launched a spacecraft into orbit and then recovered it from a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean . 
The message is not just that STEM ( science , technology , engineering , and math ) education is necessary , but also that this achievement by a private company cost just a fraction of NASA &apos;s budget in money and time . 
Governments are great at funding and carrying out research , but competitive private companies motivated by profit and glory tend to be more efficient and speedier in applying the results . 
One notable example : right before the launch , SpaceX engineers found a few cracks in the second-stage engine nozzle extension . 
Rather than haul the spacecraft back to the shop for repairs , they simply analyzed the flaw , trimmed off the affected section , and proceeded with the launch . 
( To be sure , they might have acted differently had the Dragon been carrying humans . ) 
The message of the Dragon moment is not that NASA is clueless , but that government research agencies are not the right type of organization to run routine operations that could be better handled by businesses . 
( NASA in particular has been constrained by years of political infighting and patronage in the US Congress , to the point where its mission seems to be employment maintenance rather space exploration . ) 
Of course , I must confess a personal interest in this question . 
I am writing this from Cape Canaveral , Florida . 
As a member of NASA &apos;s Advisory Council , I am currently visiting its Kennedy Space Center , which is badly in need of upgrading and repairs . 
Yet right now NASA is spending $ 475 million on a program that has already been canceled instead of on the space center . 
Because NASA is still operating under an old budget , the canceled program continues to be funded . 
Imagine how those workers must feel : grateful for the paychecks , but completely cynical about the value of the work they are doing . 
Why not pay them the same amount to share their knowledge and skills in high schools ? 
That would be a more appropriate response . 
But back to the Dragon , which succeeded for a number of reasons . 
First and foremost , SpaceX is a private company . 
Someone &apos;s own money is at stake , so it is not wasted . 
Its founder , Elon Musk , an immigrant from South Africa ( who in his spare time also runs Tesla , the electric-car company ) , funded it with his own money ( which he earned at PayPal , another start-up ) and that of other private investors . 
( Yes , SpaceX does have contracts with NASA , but for a fixed price per launch . ) 
The emphasis at SpaceX is on getting the job done , rather than just doing the job . 
Whereas governments and government contractors generally enjoy job security , private companies know that the money may run out . 
Also , private companies compete . 
Behind SpaceX is a crowd of other private companies developing spacecraft , including Masten Space Systems , XCOR Aerospace , Armadillo Aerospace , and Blue Origin . 
These companies aren &apos;t all competing to build precisely the same kind of vehicle ; in fact , each considers its own approach superior . 
This kind of redundancy is actually efficient in the long run , as each player experiments and all of them learn from everyone &apos;s failures and successes . 
In the meantime , each of them is competing not for a single grand prize but for a share of a growing market , risking investors &quot; money and their own reputations . 
It is this free-market economy , which rewards useful innovation and purposeful risk-taking , that we should honor and recognize . 
The US government ( or European governments , for that matter ) can &apos;t get us out of our current economic mess any better than they can get us to the moon at this point . 
In most areas of endeavor , the government should be a demanding customer rather than a provider ( or subsidizer ) . 
In the US , government fostered the airline business - largely by buying cargo services from private airlines . 
It also built what became the Internet - and then sensibly left most of the development and day-to-day operations to the private sector . 
Now , under Obama &apos;s new and sensible space policy , the US government is planning to focus on flying to Mars and so-called &quot; near-Earth objects , &quot; purchasing routine transportation to the International Space Station from companies such as SpaceX ( instead of from the Russian space program at $ 60 million or so per astronaut for every round-trip ) . 
What the Dragon moment makes clear is that the ability to commercialize innovation , not just to create it , is what has made the US economy so robust over the long run .
