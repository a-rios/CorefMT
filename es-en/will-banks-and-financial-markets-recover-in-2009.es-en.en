Will Banks and Financial Markets Recover in 2009 ? 
NEW YORK - Global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts . 
Global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest-rate spreads skyrocketed ; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and many emerging-market economies staggered to the International Monetary Fund for help . 
So what lies ahead in 2009 ? 
Is the worst behind us or ahead of us ? 
To answer these questions , we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contraction and worsening financial conditions is underway . 
The United States will certainly experience its worst recession in decades , a deep and protracted contraction lasting about 24 months through the end of 2009 . 
Moreover , the entire global economy will contract . 
There will be recession in the euro zone , the United Kingdom , Continental Europe , Canada , Japan , and the other advanced economies . 
There is also a risk of a hard landing for emerging-market economies , as trade , financial , and currency links transmit real and financial shocks to them . 
In the advanced economies , recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970 &quot; s-style stagflation ( a combination of economic stagnation and inflation ) . 
But , with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply , slack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms &quot; pricing power is restrained . 
Likewise , rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth . 
These factors , combined with sharply falling commodity prices , will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1 % level , raising concerns about deflation , not stagflation . 
Deflation is dangerous as it leads to a liquidity trap : nominal policy rates cannot fall below zero , so monetary policy becomes ineffective . 
Falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nominal debts rise , leading to further declines in consumption and investment - and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squeezed further , aggravating the fall in demand and prices . 
As traditional monetary policy becomes ineffective , other unorthodox policies will continue to be used : policies to bail out investors , financial institutions , and borrowers ; massive provision of liquidity to banks in order to ease the credit crunch ; and even more radical actions to reduce long-term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds . 
Today &apos;s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing bubble , but it was not caused by it . 
America &apos;s credit excesses were in residential mortgages , commercial mortgages , credit cards , auto loans , and student loans . 
There was also excess in the securitized products that converted these debts into toxic financial derivatives ; in borrowing by local governments ; in financing for leveraged buyouts that should never have occurred ; in corporate bonds that will now suffer massive losses in a surge of defaults ; in the dangerous and unregulated credit default swap market . 
Moreover , these pathologies were not confined to the US . 
There were housing bubbles in many other countries , fueled by excessive cheap lending that did not reflect underlying risks . 
There was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and hedge funds bubble . 
Indeed , we now see the demise of the shadow banking system , the complex of non-bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they borrowed short term and in liquid ways , leveraged a lot , and invested in longer term and illiquid ways . 
As a result , the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust , with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $ 2 trillion . 
Thus , unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions , the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending . 
Equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007 , but there are still significant downside risks . 
An emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets - including equities - have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur . 
But the worst is still ahead of us . 
In the next few months , the macroeconomic news and earnings / profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected , putting further downward pressure on prices of risky assets , because equity analysts are still deluding themselves that the economic contraction will be mild and short . 
While the risk of a total systemic financial meltdown has been reduced by the actions of the G-7 and other economies to backstop their financial systems , severe vulnerabilities remain . 
The credit crunch will get worse ; deleveraging will continue , as hedge funds and other leveraged players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets , thus causing more price falls and driving more insolvent financial institutions out of business . 
A few emerging-market economies will certainly enter a full-blown financial crisis . 
So 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stresses , losses , and bankruptcies . 
Only aggressive , coordinated , and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging-market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010 , rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation .
