The Rise of Chinese &quot; Sea Power &quot; 
In an age of missiles and terrorist threats , many people think that &quot; sea power &quot; is a word and concept from the past . 
Not in China . 
Indeed , China is increasingly emphasizing its naval and maritime interests : economic development , territorial management , energy and food security as well as trade . 
A navy sufficient to promote such activities is being rapidly developed and purchased from abroad ( mostly from Russia , the EU when possible ) . 
Many of China &apos;s neighbors are alarmed . 
The United States Defense Department views China &apos;s goal as being to build a series of military and diplomatic strategic bases - a so-called &quot; string of pearls &quot; - along the major sea lanes from the South China Sea to the oil rich Middle East . 
China seeks not only to secure its energy supplies , but to achieve broader security goals . 
For example , the Gwadar military port , which China is constructing in southwest Pakistan , is strategically placed to guard the throat of the Persian Gulf , with electronic eavesdropping posts to monitor ships  -  including war ships  -  moving through the Strait of Hormuz and the Arabian Sea . 
Similarly , China is building container port facilities at Chittagong in Bangladesh for its naval and merchant fleets , as well as more naval bases and electronic intelligence gathering facilities on islands owned by Myanmar in the Gulf of Bengal . 
Indeed , China &apos;s ties with Myanmar &apos;s military dictators look set to turn into a de facto military alliance . 
In nearby Thailand , China has invested $ 20 billion in a plan to build a canal across the Kra Isthmus to connect the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Siam , thereby providing an alternate oil import route that avoids the Strait of Malacca . 
In the South China Sea , China is developing systems to allow large-scale deployment of naval and air force units by fortifying bases on Hai Nan Island and the southern Chinese coastal area . 
On the Spratley and Paracel islands  -  seized from Vietnam and the Philippines respectively  -  China is building port facilities to moor large surface ships and runways large enough to handle long-range bombers . 
In effect , China is in the process of building a group of literally unsinkable aircraft carriers in the middle of the South China Sea . 
Why is China , usually considered a &quot; continental power , &quot; engaging in this maritime expansion ? 
China dominated Asia in terms of &quot; sea power &quot; until the seventeenth century . Indeed , during the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 - 1644 ) , Admiral Zheng He &apos;s &quot; Great Navy &quot; was the world &apos;s most powerful . 
But for the last three centuries , China has had no global maritime strategy , nor has it possessed - or sought to possess - naval forces capable of supporting such a strategy . 
Ironically , China &apos;s current maritime strategy has its roots in the US , the nation that China appears to perceive as its key strategic rival , namely in the &quot; sea power &quot; theory developed by Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan at the end of the nineteenth century . 
In The Influence of Sea Power upon History , published in 1890 , Mahan argued that maritime power and economic development were deeply intertwined . 
Only the ability to protect trade and project power by sea could assure the vitality of this nexus . 
Mahan identified the conditions that determine &quot; sea power &quot; : 
· geographical position and environment ; 
· territorial capacity , specifically coastline 
· population ; 
· character of people attuned to maritime expeditions ; 
· character of government eager to ebrace &quot; sea power . &quot; 
These conditions applied to the US of Mahan &apos;s time , and they surely apply to China today . 
China is already the world &apos;s third largest trading nation and rapidly developing its port capacities to manage an ever-increasing volume of trade . 
Its ship tonnage ( excluding fleets that sail under flags of convenience ) is the fourth largest in the world . 
Rapid expansion of ship tonnage is part of China &apos;s current Five-Year , and by 2010 its shipbuilding capabilities will likely rival those of Japan and Korea . 
However , unlike the US and Britain in the past , China today must turn to overseas bases rather than colonization to enhance its &quot; sea power &quot; - hence its &quot; string of pearls . &quot; 
Still , China is transforming its coastal navy into an ocean-going navy at a pace far quicker than most experts reckoned possible . 
By 2010 , China is expected to have 70 of the most modern surface vessels , several modern strategic nuclear submarines , and several tens of modernized attack submarines , exceeding the modern forces of both Taiwan &apos;s navy and even Japan &apos;s Maritime Self-Defense Force , at least in quantitative terms . 
Moreover , China plans to improve and expand its capabilities for assault landing and joint logistical support , both of which used to be weak points . 
This will provide China with necessary capabilities to invade , should China &apos;s rulers wish , Japan &apos;s most remote islands , including the disputed Senkaku Islands , as well as Taiwan . 
If China &apos;s naval growth continues at its current pace , it may have the world &apos;s largest naval force by 2020 . 
All of Asia must wake up to the arrival of Chinese-style aggressive &quot; sea power . &quot; 
Japan , in particular , must reformulate its national maritime strategy with this in mind . 
Japan , America and other traditional maritime countries must also once again treat &quot; sea power &quot; in Asia as a key component of their ability to defend their own national interests .
