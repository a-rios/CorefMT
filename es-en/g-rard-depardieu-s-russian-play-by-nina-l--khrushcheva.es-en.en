The Czar of the French 
MOSCOW - Vladimir Putin has finally done it . 
Russia has been vying for the West &apos;s esteem for centuries , with approval by the French - a sought-after prize since the time of Peter the Great - coveted the most . 
Indeed , the Marquis de Custine &apos;s Letters from Russia suggested that Russian civilization amounted to little more than the mimicry of monkeys . 
But now the French seal of approval seemingly has been bestowed . 
Along with a passport comes an offer of a free apartment in the Mordovia region ( still a Gulag site ) and even a job as the local culture minister . 
Two centuries after French troops were run out of Moscow in 1812 , Putin has succeeded in making a French popular idol want to be Russian . 
In Russia and elsewhere , the French are often perceived to feel and act superior . 
And who could blame them ? 
French artistic beauty is second to none . 
The French are the arbiters of European culture , and have long been among the shrewdest observers of other countries &quot; manners and mores . 
Indeed , in the 1830 &quot; s , two Frenchmen , Alexis de Tocqueville and Custine , went to the outskirts of civilization to describe the future superpower rivals , America and Russia . 
Until 1861 , Russia was a backward country in which serfdom reigned and royals and aristocrats envied the latest French fashions . 
From Alexander Pushkin &apos;s poems to Leo Tolstoy &apos;s novels , French influence pervades the commanding heights of Russian culture . 
Russia &apos;s most famous museum , the Hermitage , is second only to the Louvre in its collection of French art . 
Peter the Great , in his eighteenth-century effort to Westernize Russia , invited Jean-Baptiste Le Blond to become the chief architect of his new capital , St. Petersburg . 
But forget Peter the Great : Now &quot; Vova the Little &quot; - or Lilli-Putin , as Georgia &apos;s sharp-tongued president , Mikheil Saakashvili , once dubbed Russia &apos;s president - may have pulled off an even greater coup . 
When Depardieu was planning to cross the border into dull little Belgium to avoid French taxes , the Russians made him an offer that he could not refuse : not just a flat 13 % income-tax rate , but a chance to poke French President Fran√ßois Hollande in the eye . 
The ever-vain Depardieu ( and what actor isn &apos;t vain ? ) will be a god in Russia . 
We love the French in general , but we adore him in particular . 
After all , he starred in the 2011 film about the life of the mad monk Grigory Rasputin . 
He was portly Porthos in Alexander Dumas &apos;s classic The Three Musketeers ( in 1998 &quot; s The Man in the Iron Mask ) , and played the lead in the film version of Edmond Rostand &apos;s Cyrano de Bergerac ( 1990 ) , which is almost as popular with Russians as Pushkin &apos;s Eugene Onegin . 
Like all Russian leaders , Putin affects a deep love of culture . 
In the absence of fair elections , Kremlin occupants traditionally seek legitimacy by attracting artists to their side : if a beloved actor , writer , sculptor , or musician loves Putin , how could anyone feel otherwise ? 
I myself once witnessed Putin courting culture . 
It was New Year &apos;s Eve 2003 , during a concert at the newly opened House of Music in Moscow . 
Directly across the aisle from me , there was Putin , sitting between the one-time dissident cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and his equally famous wife , opera diva Galina Vishnevskaya . 
Russia &apos;s leader was like a kid in a candy store - thrilled to be surrounded by these cultural icons , former exiles no less . 
And the icons were obviously flattered by Putin &apos;s adoration ( and by their proximity to power ) . 
Putin has finally proved that he is capable of exploits that no czar could accomplish . 
All that tough anti-Western rhetoric on behalf of the nation - the bare-chested horsemanship , the kissing of tigers , and the flying with cranes - has paid off : the aloof French have at long last recognized Russian superiority and are sending one of their greatest representatives to partake of it . 
Indeed , not long after Depardieu &apos;s change of allegiance , a French icon of an even older vintage , Brigitte Bardot , suggested that she , too , might embrace Russia . 
In her own words , she &quot; decided to seek Russian nationality in order to flee this country , which is nothing but an animal cemetery , &quot; because it has &quot; the cowardice and impudence &quot; to consider euthanizing two elephants in the Lyon zoo . 
Putin does share Bardot &apos;s love of animals - not only his pets ( especially his dog Koni , whose consolation he allegedly seeks when grieving ) , but also the co-stars of his mostly animal-centered publicity stunts . 
It is with less obedient people that he has problems - say , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , imprisoned for more than ten years after backing Putin &apos;s political opponents ; 
Anna Politkovskaya , brutally murdered in 2006 for her investigative reporting on his regime &apos;s misdeeds in Chechnya ; and Sergei Magnitsky , a whistleblowing lawyer who died in prison in 2009 after being refused medical treatment . 
Putin &apos;s most vocal current foe , the lawyer Alexei Navalny , has been investigated three times for supposedly stealing millions of dollars . 
But one has to appreciate the historical absurdity . 
Putin , after more than a decade in power , has lost the support of his own , usually quiescent citizens , who have had rather limited experience with democracy .
