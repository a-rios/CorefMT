Free Speech for All 
COPENHAGEN - The attack on the French magazine Charlie Hebdo was an assault on democracy , on freedom , and on the ideals that underpin all free societies . 
As we face the forces of extremism and terror , we must have the courage to speak up for those ideals and to safeguard the right to say what we believe . 
But we must also take care to respect the fact that others have the same right . 
Charlie Hebdo is not the first publication to have suffered for publishing images which some perceived as offensive to Islam . 
In 2005 , when I was Prime Minister of Denmark , the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten provoked international controversy by publishing twelve sketches of the Prophet Muhammad . 
Some Muslims , in Denmark and abroad , accused Jyllands-Posten of blasphemy for publishing an image of the prophet . 
Others said that the images were an insult to Islam . 
There were calls for reprisals against the newspaper , against my government , and against Danish interests abroad . 
Our response was founded on the principle that freedom of speech is one of the pillars on which democracy stands , and that if you undermine it , you undermine democracy itself . 
In free countries , every citizen has the right to say what he or she wants , believe what he or she wants , and criticize or mock what he or she wants - in writing , drawings , or any other form of peaceful expression . 
Every citizen also has the right to disagree with another &apos;s opinions and to express that disagreement in a peaceful , legal manner . 
In 2005 , during the cartoons crisis , some commentators and politicians in the Muslim world claimed that the right to free speech had been abused and called for an apology and a condemnation of the cartoons , first from Jyllands-Posten , then from my government . 
To be sure , freedom of speech is a right that is best used wisely and responsibly . 
But we believed , and I still believe , that it would be neither wise nor responsible to attempt to limit it , and that the correct way to respond to a perceived insult is to present a counterargument , not to mount a terrorist attack . 
And , in democracies , you can always take the matter to court . 
That principle guided us through the 2005 crisis . 
We did not apologize for an independent newspaper &apos;s editorial decisions , despite great pressure from Muslim groups and governments . 
Nor did we seek to justify the publication of the cartoons . 
We simply stood up for freedom of speech . 
Despite the horror and anger we feel at the attacks on Charlie Hebdo , we must all hold fast to that principle , because to limit freedom of expression would be to weaken our own societies . 
The attacks on the journalists of Charlie Hebdo were disgusting and despicable , but if we respond to them by abridging the freedom on which our societies rest , we will be playing into the murderers &quot; hands . 
Governments must stand up for the freedom of journalists to write what they want and the freedom of every citizen to support or disagree with what they write . 
And journalists must continue to write and draw what they believe . 
Self-censorship would undermine their freedom and encourage further pressure on free speech . 
In the past few days , some editors decided that the right response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre was to republish the magazine &apos;s cartoons . 
Others decided not to . 
Still others criticized Charlie Hebdo &apos;s actions . 
The editors had the right to make those decisions and to express themselves as they saw fit . 
That is the essence of democracy . 
The day such decisions are made for fear of reprisal is the day our freedom ends . 
For citizens , freedom of speech means having the courage to speak out for what they believe , without resorting to violence - against journalists or against the representatives of any religious belief . 
To shoot journalists in cold blood for printing a cartoon is a hideous crime . 
But so is attacking a mosque or assaulting a Muslim because of his or her faith . 
There is a place for debate , even passionate debate , on the deeply moral question of how to balance freedom of speech with respect for religion . 
But the weapons of this debate should be words , not arms - the keyboard , not the Kalashnikov . 
Every one of us has the right to our opinion . 
None of us has the right to kill those with whom we disagree . 
The march of millions in Paris on January 11 was a magnificent expression of solidarity and peace . 
Every leader and legislator should strive to live up to those ideals as he or she responds to the threat of extremism . 
The terrorist attacks in Paris will , one hopes , be a game changer in the defense of press freedom , and freedom in general , because millions of people have realized what is at stake . 
We cannot take freedom of expression for granted . 
We must stand up for it and defend it , even - and perhaps especially - when we disagree with what is being expressed .
