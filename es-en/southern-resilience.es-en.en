Southern Resilience 
RIO DE JANEIRO - Latin America &apos;s resilience in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis has been remarkable , especially when compared to the region &apos;s performance in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
But , as the world economy faces renewed uncertainty , the region must find new strategies to reduce the potential impact of volatile financial markets and protracted stagnation in the world &apos;s richest economies . 
Although Latin America &apos;s growth corresponds to global trends , there is a good chance that , in 2012 , the region &apos;s economies will outperform industrial countries once again . 
Contraction of world trade and reduced financial flows will likely slow growth somewhat , but the annual pace should remain close to the region &apos;s 2000-2008 average of 4 % . 
One reason for this prediction is that abundant liquidity in international markets and continuing high demand from China and India may prevent commodity prices - especially for agricultural products - from falling as much as they did during the 2008-2009 crisis . 
Gains in terms of trade have been crucial for growth in Latin America , given the region &apos;s low domestic saving rates , because they encourage investment but have relatively little negative impact on current-account balances . 
Strong capital inflows , especially of foreign direct investment , and terms-of-trade recovery since 2009 have made the region less vulnerable to external shocks - that is , to recurrence of the abrupt capital-flow reversal that occurred in late 2008 and early 2009 . 
More importantly , most Latin American countries now have in place counter-cyclical measures to mitigate any negative external impact . 
For example , many countries that were tightening their monetary policy when the first signs of turbulence emerged have either put interest-rate hikes on hold , or , like Brazil , have already started to reduce rates . 
Most Latin American countries &quot; recent adjustments , moreover , have prevented their budget positions and current-account deficits from becoming sources of vulnerability . 
This appears to be the case , for example , in Peru , where sound fiscal policies have kept deficits and inflation under control . 
It is also true in Colombia , where strong budget revenues could allow for a temporary spending boost to counter external risks . 
Noteworthy exceptions are Argentina and Venezuela , where macroeconomic tensions have reduced the scope for counter-cyclical action , and Mexico , whose fate is bound by extensive trade links to that of the United States . 
Brazil , the region &apos;s largest country , and one of its most prosperous , reflects several economic trends in Latin America . 
After the global financial crisis erupted in the last quarter of 2008 , interest rates in Brazil fell sharply , credit expanded quickly , and fiscal policy shifted from neutral to strongly expansionary . 
The Brazilian treasury &apos;s massive funding of the National Development Bank also acted as a buffer against declining investment . 
This policy stimulus led to strong growth , in both consumption and investment , and economic activity recovered quickly . 
While the appreciation of the real &apos;s exchange rate kept a lid on prices for tradable goods , non-tradable goods , especially services , remained a source of inflationary pressure . 
To fight accelerating price growth , the authorities adopted measures at the end of 2010 to cool overheating domestic demand , first through credit restrictions and higher reserve requirements for banks - so-called &quot; macroprudential &quot; measures - and later through the resumption of interest-rate hikes . 
But the sudden deterioration of external financial conditions , and the prospect of protracted stagnation in Europe and the US , prompted Brazil to reverse its policy last August . 
The central bank has already cut its benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points , to 11 % , and the downward trend is expected to take real rates to record lows in the post-crisis period . 
But the price for this might well be that annual inflation remains significantly above the 4.5 % target . 
Indeed , more recently , the credit restrictions that were implemented at the end of 2010 have been loosened in order to stimulate consumer demand . 
Moreover , Brazilian fiscal policy is likely to switch from restrictive to neutral or slightly expansionary this year . 
The government has promised to make the move more gently than in 2009-2010 , thereby allowing the flexibility to bring down interest rates over the long term . 
In 2012 , it plans to increase the minimum wage by 14 % according to the current adjustment rule , with a strong impact on social-security benefits , and the public-investment outlays that were repressed last year are also likely to resume . 
These measures , plus a reduction in tax revenues , should reduce the primary surplus and contribute to reviving demand . 
Latin America has achieved substantial progress in its macroeconomic policy framework , giving its authorities increased room for maneuver in softening the impact of external shocks . 
But demand management is only part of the job when it comes to fostering long-term economic growth . 
Having successfully steered their countries through the crisis , Latin America &apos;s authorities should devote greater attention to resuming reform efforts aimed at improving competitiveness and ensuring the sustainability of high growth rates .
