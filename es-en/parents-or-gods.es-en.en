Parents or Gods ? 
The birth of Louise Brown in 1978 , and with her that of human in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , was a landmark in medical science . 
Surgically harvesting eggs from a woman &apos;s ovaries , fertilizing them outside her body , and transferring the resulting embryos into her uterus enabled effective treatment of female infertility caused by irreparably damaged fallopian tubes . 
Since then , rapid innovation has led to new applications for IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies . 
Many infertile couples now turn to such advanced technologies when other &quot; low tech &quot; options fail , and they are the treatment of choice not only for tubal damage , but also for significant forms of male infertility . 
For example , intracytoplasmic sperm injection is a technique in which a single viable sperm is injected into an egg , allowing fertilization to occur even in cases where few healthy sperm are available . 
Freezing unimplanted embryos is now standard procedure ; freezing unfertilized eggs is under development . 
Perhaps inevitably , our access to human eggs and embryos now enables us to extend prenatal genetic diagnosis to the pre-implantation embryo . 
Conventional prenatal diagnosis entails removing fetal cells , either from the amniotic fluid ( amniocentesis ) or from the placenta ( chorionic villus sampling , CVS ) . 
Both procedures are routinely offered to pregnant women 35 years and over to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities such as Down &apos;s syndrome , or to screen for cystic fibrosis , sickle cell disease , or Tay Sachs disease . 
However , amniocentesis and CVS both entail a 0.5-1 % risk of pregnancy loss , and if an abnormality is diagnosed the only clinical option is to terminate the pregnancy . 
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) is fundamentally different from its prenatal counterpart . 
Because the diagnosis is made prior to placement of the embryo in the woman &apos;s uterus , the exclusion of specific abnormalities is possible without terminating an established , ongoing pregnancy . 
Clearly , couples carrying a transmissible genetic defect and otherwise requiring IVF should be offered the option of PGD , and if necessary , referral to a center that can perform this specialized procedure . 
But genetically affected couples who do not suffer from infertility may also be candidates for IVF with PGD . 
They could well prefer this option to natural conception and the prospect of therapeutic abortion following a conventional prenatal genetic diagnosis . 
But now consider a more morally complicated scenario : a couple has a naturally conceived child affected with a life-threatening genetic disease for which the only possible cure is a bone marrow transplant from a matched donor . 
Understandably , they may want PGD to prevent similar defects in their future children . 
But they also want those embryos to be tissue typed in search of a sibling who could serve as a bone marrow donor to their first child . 
In this case , an embryo is being selected not only to avoid congenital disease and thus directly benefit the resulting child , but also to produce a child whose very existence could provide a cure for an older sibling , and with virtually no risk to the donor child . 
Ethicists have grappled with such scenarios , and many would find this clinical option to be ethically sound . 
But what if the older sibling requires a donated kidney ? 
The more the donor child is placed in physical jeopardy the thornier the issue becomes . 
Gender selection is another hotly debated potential application of PGD . 
Gender selection may be clinically justified in order to prevent transmission of a sex-linked disease , such as hemophilia . 
Under such circumstances , it should be no more controversial than using PGD to screen for sickle cell disease . 
But is PGD ethically sound if an infertile couple merely prefers a boy or a girl ? 
If so , then would it not be acceptable for &quot; family balancing , &quot; when a fertile couple with three boys strongly desires a girl , or if a couple wants to choose the sex of their first-born child ? 
Obviously , analogous questions can be extended to the selection of many other traits that are not essential to the health of the resulting offspring . 
To all of these questions , there are no simple answers . 
The essential goal of medicine is diagnosis and alleviation of disease , and infertility is a disease . 
The extension of prenatal diagnosis to an embryo in a laboratory dish will , in turn , reduce the incidence of certain types of genetically transmitted diseases . 
But new medical technologies also offer applications that fall outside of these conventional precepts . 
As always , the rapid advancement of science and technology should be accompanied and tempered by careful and thoughtful consideration of the appropriate uses of newly realized capabilities .
