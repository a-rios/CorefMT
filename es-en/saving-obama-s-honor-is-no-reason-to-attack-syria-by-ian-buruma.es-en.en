Bombing for Morality 
NEW YORK - A gift for words was always US President Barack Obama &apos;s strongest asset . 
Now it looks as if his words have trapped him . 
Having stated in March that the United States would &quot; not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people , &quot; and having spoken last year about a &quot; red line &quot; that could not be crossed , he will lose face if he fails to react forcefully to the murder , allegedly by the Syrian regime , of more than 1,000 civilians by sarin gas . 
Of course , the risk of losing face is not a good reason for attacking another country . 
But why did Obama fence himself in with such rhetoric in the first place ? 
Why this particular red line ? 
Secretary of State John Kerry was right to call the use of gas &quot; a moral obscenity . &quot; 
But so is torturing children , which is how the civil war in Syria actually began more than two years ago . 
And is killing civilians with chemical agents morally more obscene than shelling , shooting , or starving them to death ? 
At least since the use of mustard gas in World War I , it has been a common assumption that certain weapons are more immoral than others . 
Weapons of mass destruction , nuclear bombs in particular , certainly cause more damage faster than conventional armaments do . 
But is there really a clear moral distinction between killing roughly 100,000 people in Hiroshima with one atom bomb and killing even more people in Tokyo in a single night of incendiary bombing ? 
Was it more immoral to gas Jews than to machine-gun them into open pits ? 
There is an argument , made by Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times , that a swift punishment might persuade Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to stop using chemical weapons and use &quot; more banal ways to slaughter his people . &quot; 
This does not make sense to me . 
The problem is surely the slaughter , not the methods used . 
In any case , moral outrage , however justified , is not a sufficient reason for going to war . 
Mao Zedong was responsible for the deaths of more than 40 million Chinese in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s . 
No one in his right mind suggested that military intervention in China would be a good idea . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , Saddam Hussein gassed hundreds of thousands of Iranians and Kurds . 
The US supported him . 
So is it a legal issue ? 
Using chemical weapons is indeed a breach of international conventions , including the Chemical Weapons Convention , which Syria has never signed , and the Geneva Protocol , to which it is a party . 
So there are good reasons to treat Assad as a war criminal , in which case he should be indicted at the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) - established , incidentally , by a treaty that the US has never ratified . 
But bypassing the United Nations and unleashing an illegal war to punish an illegal act is not an easy policy to defend . 
Still , one might say , surely the &quot; international community , &quot; or the West , or the US as the major Western power , must draw the line somewhere . 
How can responsible governments simply look away when innocent people are being killed in large numbers ? 
Tolerating genocide is intolerable . 
But where exactly do we draw that line ? 
How many murders constitute genocide ? 
Thousands ? 
Hundreds of thousands ? 
Millions ? 
Or is it not a question of numbers ? 
Genocide , after all , is a matter of intent , of killing or persecuting people on the grounds of their race , ethnicity , or creed . 
Technically , killing ten people for such reasons - or even two - could be a form of genocide . 
There is another way of considering the matter . 
The question to ponder before intervening with force in another country is whether doing so is likely to improve matters , save lives , and make the world more secure . 
Yes , violence against citizens , whether by sarin gas or helicopter gunships , is a moral obscenity . 
The issue is how to respond : What will work ? 
Justice and morality have little to do with this . 
Like the ICC , &quot; humanitarian intervention &quot; has more chance of working in the case of a weak country ( say , Serbia , Mali , or Sierra Leone ) than where a big power is involved . 
No one is going to shoot missiles into China or Russia for the sake of upholding human rights or international standards of warfare . 
Syria , as many people have pointed out , is not Libya or Mali . 
Nor is it a great power . 
But its civil war has already spread beyond its borders , implicating greater powers like Iran , Turkey , and Russia in the process . 
One thing worse than the moral obscenities of a civil war would be a regional conflagration . 
It is by no means certain that US intervention would do anything to reduce the risk of a wider war . 
In fact , certain advocates of US intervention - both neo-cons and &quot; liberal hawks &quot; - seem to desire the opposite outcome ; they want a war against Iran . 
And there is probably a clear link in Obama &apos;s mind between the red line in Syria and the one he has drawn for Iran , perhaps equally unwisely , to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons . 
So what is to be achieved by a US strike on Syrian targets , which Obama has already assured the world is not meant to change the Syrian regime ? 
It will not stop the civil war . 
But even one missile would turn the US into a direct participant , provoking yet more violence . 
Saving Obama &apos;s honor hardly seems worth that risk . 
This is the view of many people in Syria , even among the rebels . 
It is the view of most people in Europe . 
Perhaps it is even the view of Obama himself , which is why he is playing for time , desperately turning over approval of an attack on Syria to the US Congress . 
His relations with Congress have been far from smooth . 
But now he needs it more than ever - in order , as they say in America , to cover his ass .
