Is China Really Immune to the Crisis ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Addressing the annual World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao explained his government &apos;s plans to counter the global economic meltdown with public spending and loans . 
He all but guaranteed that China &apos;s annual growth would remain above 8 % in 2009 . 
Wen &apos;s words were like warm milk to the recession-numbed audience of global political and business leaders . 
But does the Chinese government really have the tools needed to keep its economy so resilient ? 
Perhaps , but it is far from obvious . 
America &apos;s deepening recession is slamming China &apos;s export sector , just as it has everywhere else in Asia . 
The immediate problem is a credit crunch not so much in China as in the United States and Europe , where many small and medium-size importers cannot get the trade credits they need to buy inventory from abroad . 
As a result , some once-booming Chinese coastal areas now look like ghost towns , as tens of thousands of laid-off workers have packed their bags and returned to the countryside . 
Similarly , in Beijing &apos;s Korean section , perhaps half of the 200,000-300,000 inhabitants - mainly workers ( and their families ) who are paid by Korean companies that produce goods in China for export - reportedly have gone home . 
With roughly $ 2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , the Chinese do have deep pockets to fund massive increases in government spending , and to help backstop bank loans . 
Many leading Chinese researchers are convinced that that the government will do whatever it takes to keep growth above 8 % . 
But there is a catch . 
Even if successful in the short run , the huge shift toward government spending will almost certainly lead to significantly slower growth rates a few years down the road . 
Simply put , it is far from clear that marginal infrastructure projects are worth building , given that China is already investing more than 45 % of its income , much of it in infrastructure . 
True , some of China &apos;s fiscal stimulus effectively consists of loans to the private sector via the highly controlled banking sector . 
But is there any reason to believe that new loans will go to worthy projects rather than to politically connected borrowers ? 
In fact , China &apos;s success so far has come from maintaining a balance between government and private sector expansion . 
Sharply raising the government &apos;s already outsized profile in the economy will upset this delicate balance leading to slower growth in the future . 
It would be preferable for China to find a way to substitute Chinese for US private consumption demand , but the system seems unable to move quickly in this direction . 
If government investment has to be the main vehicle , then it would be far better to build desperately needed schools and hospitals than &quot; bridges to nowhere , &quot; as Japan famously did when it went down a similar path in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Unfortunately , China &apos;s local officials need to excel in the country &apos;s &quot; growth tournament &quot; to get promoted . 
Schools and hospitals simply do not generate the kind of fast tax revenue and GDP growth needed to outperform political rivals . 
Even prior to the onset of the global recession , there were strong reasons to doubt the sustainability of China &apos;s growth paradigm . 
The environmental degradation is obvious even to casual observers . 
And economists have started to calculate that if China were to continue its prodigious growth rate , it would soon occupy far too large a share of the global economy to maintain its recent export trajectory . 
The global recession has simply brought that problem forward a few years . 
Interestingly , the US faces a number of similar challenges . 
For years , the US achieved fast growth by deferring attention to a variety of issues , ranging from the environment to infrastructure to health care . 
Even absent the financial crisis , addressing the shortcomings in these areas would likely have slowed down US growth . 
This is not to say that the US and China are the same . 
One of the great challenges ahead is to find a way to bring these two countries &quot; savings into line , given the vast trade imbalances that many believe planted the seeds of financial crisis . 
I was reminded of the challenge recently when a Chinese researcher explained that men in China today feel compelled to save in order to find a bride . 
The same week , a former student of mine who lost his lucrative financial-sector job explained that he had no savings because it was so expensive to date in New York ! 
These social differences have little to do with the yuan-dollar exchange rate , although that matters , too . 
One way or the other , the financial crisis is likely to slow medium-term Chinese growth significantly . 
But will its leaders succeed in stabilizing the situation in the near term ? 
I hope so , but I would be more convinced by a plan tilted more toward domestic private consumption , health , and education than to one based on the same growth strategy of the past 30 years .
