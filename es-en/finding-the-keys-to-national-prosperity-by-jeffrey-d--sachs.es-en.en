Finding the Keys to National Prosperity 
NEW YORK - In many of history &apos;s most successful economic reforms , clever countries have learned from the policy successes of others , adapting them to local conditions . 
In the long history of economic development , eighteenth-century Britain learned from Holland ; early nineteenth-century Prussia learned from Britain and France ; mid-nineteenth-century Meiji Japan learned from Germany ; post-World War II Europe learned from the United States ; and Deng Xiaoping &apos;s China learned from Japan . 
Through a process of institutional borrowing and creative adaptation , successful economic institutions and cutting-edge technologies spread around the world , and thereby boost global growth . 
Today , too , there are some great opportunities for this kind of &quot; policy arbitrage , &quot; if more countries would only take the time to learn from other countries &quot; successes . 
For example , while many countries are facing a jobs crisis , one part of the capitalist world is doing just fine : northern Europe , including Germany , the Netherlands , and Scandinavia . 
Germany &apos;s unemployment rate this past summer was around 5.5 % , and its youth unemployment rate was around 8 % - remarkably low compared with many other high-income economies . 
How do northern Europeans do it ? 
All of them use active labor market policies , including flex time , school-to-work apprenticeships ( especially Germany ) , and extensive job training and matching . 
Likewise , in an age of chronic budget crises , Germany , Sweden , and Switzerland run near-balanced budgets . 
All three rely on budget rules that call for cyclically adjusted budget balance . 
And all three take a basic precaution to keep their entitlement spending under control : a retirement age of at least 65 . 
This keeps costs much lower than in France , and Greece , for example , where the retirement age is 60 or below , and where pension outlays are soaring as a result . 
In an age of rising health-care costs , most high-income countries - Canada , the European Union &apos;s Western economies , and Japan - manage to keep their total health-care costs below 12 % of GDP , with excellent health outcomes , while the US spends nearly 18 % of GDP , yet with decidedly mediocre health outcomes . 
And , America &apos;s is the only for-profit health system of the entire bunch . 
A new report by the US Institute of Medicine has found that America &apos;s for-profit system squanders around $ 750 billion , or 5 % of GDP , on waste , fraud , duplication , and bureaucracy . 
In an age of soaring oil costs , a few countries have made a real difference in energy efficiency . 
The OECD countries , on average , use 160 kilograms of oil-equivalent energy for every $ 1,000 of GDP ( measured at purchasing power parity ) . 
But , in energy-efficient Switzerland , energy use is just 100 kg per $ 1,000 of GDP , and in Demark it is just 110 kg , compared with 190 kg in the US . 
In an age of climate change , several countries are demonstrating how to move to a low-carbon economy . 
On average , the rich countries emit 2.3 kg of CO2 for every kg of oil-equivalent unit of energy . 
But France emits just 1.4 kg , owing to its enormous success in deploying safe , low-cost nuclear energy . 
Sweden , with its hydropower , is even lower , at 0.9 kg . 
And , while Germany is abandoning domestic production of nuclear energy for political reasons , we can bet that it will nonetheless continue to import electricity from France &apos;s nuclear plants . 
In an age of intense technological competition , countries that combine public and private research and development ( R D ) financing are outpacing the rest . 
The US continues to excel , with huge recent breakthroughs in Mars exploration and genomics , though it is now imperiling that excellence through budget cuts . 
Meanwhile , Sweden and South Korea are now excelling economically on the basis of R D spending of around 3.5 % of GDP , while Israel &apos;s R D outlays stand at a remarkable 4.7 % of GDP . 
In an age of rising inequality , at least some countries have narrowed their wealth and income gaps . 
Brazil is the recent pacesetter , markedly expanding public education and systematically attacking remaining pockets of poverty through targeted transfer programs . 
As a result , income inequality in Brazil is declining . 
And , in an age of pervasive anxiety , Bhutan is asking deep questions about the meaning and nature of happiness itself . 
In search of a more balanced society that combines economic prosperity , social cohesion , and environmental sustainability , Bhutan famously pursues Gross National Happiness rather than Gross National Product . 
Many other countries - including the United Kingdom - are now following Bhutan &apos;s lead in surveying their citizenry about life satisfaction . 
The countries highest on the ladder of life satisfaction are Denmark , Finland , and Norway . 
Yet there is hope for those at lower latitudes as well . 
Tropical Costa Rica also ranks near the top of the happiness league . 
What we can say is that all of the happiest countries emphasize equality , solidarity , democratic accountability , environmental sustainability , and strong public institutions . 
So here is one model economy : German labor-market policies , Swedish pensions , French low-carbon energy , Canadian health care , Swiss energy efficiency , American scientific curiosity , Brazilian anti-poverty programs , and Costa Rican tropical happiness . 
Of course , back in the real world , most countries will not achieve such bliss anytime soon . 
But , by opening our eyes to policy successes abroad , we would surely speed the path to national improvement in countries around the world .
