Judgment Day for the Eurozone 
MUNICH - Europe and the world are eagerly awaiting the decision of Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court on September 12 regarding the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , the proposed permanent successor to the eurozone &apos;s current emergency lender , the European Financial Stability Mechanism . 
The Court must rule on German plaintiffs &quot; claim that legislation to establish the ESM would violate Germany &apos;s Grundgesetz ( Basic Law ) . 
If the Court rules in the plaintiffs &quot; favor , it will ask Germany &apos;s president not to sign the ESM treaty , which has already been ratified by Germany &apos;s Bundestag ( parliament ) . 
There are serious concerns on all sides about the pending decision . 
Investors are worried that the Court could oppose the ESM such that they would have to bear the losses from their bad investments . 
Taxpayers and pensioners in European countries that still have solid economies are worried that the Court could pave the way for socialization of eurozone debt , saddling them with the burden of these same investors &quot; losses . 
The plaintiffs represent the entire political spectrum , including the Left Party , the Christian Social Union MP Peter Gauweiler , and the justice minister in former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder &apos;s Social Democratic government , Herta Däubler-Gmelin , who has collected tens of thousands of signatures supporting her case . 
There is also a group of retired professors of economics and law , and another of &quot; ordinary &quot; citizens , whose individual complaints have been selected as examples by the Court . 
The plaintiffs have raised several objections to the ESM . 
First , they claim that it breaches the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s &quot; no bail-out &quot; clause ( Article 125 ) . 
Germany agreed to relinquish the Deutsche Mark on the condition that the new currency area would not lead to direct or indirect socialization of its members &quot; debt , thus precluding any financial assistance from EU funds for states facing bankruptcy . 
Indeed , the new currency was conceived as a unit of account for economic exchange that would not have any wealth implications at all . 
The plaintiffs argue that , in the case of Greece , breaching Article 125 required proof that its insolvency would pose a greater danger than anticipated when the Maastricht Treaty was drafted . 
However , no such proof was provided . 
Second , Germany &apos;s law on the introduction of the ESM obliges Germany &apos;s representative on the ESM Council to vote only after having asked the Bundestag for a decision . 
According to the plaintiffs , this is not permissible under international law . 
If Germany had wished to constrain its governor &apos;s authority in this way , it should have informed the other signatory states prior to doing so . 
On the other hand , Germany &apos;s representative on the Governing Council is sworn to secrecy , which , the plaintiffs argue , precludes any accountability to the Bundestag . 
Moreover , the plaintiffs claim that , while the ESM treaty is restrictive in granting resources to individual states , requiring a qualified majority vote , it does not specify the conditions under which losses are acceptable . 
Losses can result from excessive wages paid by the ESM Governing Council members to themselves , a dearth of energy in efforts to collect debts from countries that have received credit , or other forms of mismanagement . 
And , because Governing Council and Executive Board members enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution , misbehavior cannot be punished . 
If losses arise , they must be covered by the initial cash contribution of € 80 billion ( $ 100 billion ) , which then would be topped up automatically by all participating countries according to their capital shares . 
If individual countries are no longer able to make the necessary contributions , others must do so on their behalf . 
In principle , a single country might have to assume the entire burden of losses . 
Such joint and several liability , the plaintiffs assert , contradicts the Court &apos;s previous statements that Germany should not accept any financial commitments stemming from other states &quot; behavior . 
Worse , according to the plaintiffs , although the liability of any country vis-à-vis external partners is limited to that country &apos;s share of capital , this limitation does not apply to other signatory states . 
It is theoretically possible that a single country could be held liable for the ESM &apos;s total exposure of € 700 billion . 
Finally , the ESM cannot be considered on its own , but must be seen in the context of the total exposure amount , which includes the € 1.4 trillion in bailout funds that have already been granted . 
In particular , the Target2 credit drawn by the crisis-afflicted countries &quot; central banks , which already totals almost € 1 trillion , should also be taken into consideration . 
Nobody knows how the Constitutional Court will rule on these objections . 
Most observers believe that the Court is unlikely to oppose the ESM treaty , though many expect the judges to demand certain amendments , or to ask Germany &apos;s president to make his signature subject to certain qualifications . 
It is good that the Court &apos;s decisions cannot be forecast , and even better that the Court cannot be lobbied or petitioned . 
The European Union can be based only on the rule of law . 
If those in power can break its rules on a case-by-case basis , the EU will never develop into the stable construct that is a prerequisite for peace and prosperity .
