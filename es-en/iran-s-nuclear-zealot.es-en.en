Iran &apos;s Nuclear Zealot 
With negotiations over Iran &apos;s nuclear program looming once again , understanding Iran &apos;s new president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is critically important . 
Perhaps the best place to start is the moment the world first gained a glimpse of Ahmadinejad &apos;s character and hardline program . 
When President Ahmadinejad addressed the United Nations in New York last September , he suddenly felt himself surrounded by light . 
It wasn &apos;t the stage lighting , he said . 
Ahmadinejad related his otherworldly experience in a videotaped meeting with a prominent Ayatollah in Tehran . 
A transcript of his comments and sections of the video-tape wound up on a hard-line , pro-regime website , baztab.com. 
According to the transcript , Ahmadinejad said that a member of his entourage at the UN meeting first told him of the light . 
&quot; When you began with the words &quot; In the name of God ... &quot; I saw a light coming , surrounding you and protecting you to the end &#91; of the speech &#93; . &quot; 
Ahmadinejad confirmed sensing a similar presence . 
&quot; I felt it myself , too , that suddenly the atmosphere changed and for 27-28 minutes the leaders could not blink .... They had their eyes and ears open for the message from the Islamic Republic , &quot; he told Ayatollah Javadi-Amoli . 
Ahmadinejad &apos;s &quot; vision &quot; at the UN could be dismissed as political posturing if it weren &apos;t for a string of similar statements and actions that suggest he believes that he is destined to bring about the &quot; End Times &quot; - the end of the world - by paving the way for the return of the Shia Muslim messiah . 
Given that Iran continues to pursue suspect nuclear programs , which could bring the Islamic Republic dangerously close to weapons capability , a leader with messianic visions is worrying . 
After all , this is the same man who recently pledged to use Iran &apos;s newfound powers to &quot; wipe Israel off the map &quot; and to &quot; destroy America . &quot; 
In a November 16 speech in Tehran to senior clerics who had come from all over Iran to hear him , the new president said that the main mission of his government was to &quot; pave the path for the glorious reappearance of Imam Mahdi ( May God Hasten His Reappearance ) . &quot; 
The mystical 12th Imam of Shia Islam disappeared as a child in 941 CE , and Shia Muslims have awaited his reappearance ever since , believing that when he returns , he will reign on earth for seven years , before bringing about the Last Judgment and the end of the world . 
In order to prepare for the Mahdi , Ahmadinejad said , &quot; Iran should turn into a mighty , advanced , and model Islamic society . &quot; 
Iranians should &quot; refrain from leaning toward any Western school of thought &quot; and abstain from &quot; luxurious lives &quot; and other excesses . 
Three months into Ahmadinejad &apos;s presidency , his views of the 12th Imam are being widely discussed in Tehran . 
According to one rumor , as mayor of Tehran , Ahmadinejad drew up a new city plan for the Imam &apos;s return . 
In recent weeks , Ahmadinejad &apos;s aides have denied another rumor that he ordered his cabinet to write a pact of loyalty with the 12th Imam and throw it down a well near the holy city of Qom , where some believe the Imam is hiding . 
Those who give credence to the rumor point to an early decision of his cabinet to allocate $ 17 million to renovate the Jamkaran mosque , where devotees of the 12th Imam have prayed for centuries . 
Similarly , reports in government media outlets in Tehran have quoted Ahmadinejad as having told regime officials that the Hidden Imam will reappear in two years . 
While many Shia Muslims worship the 12th Imam , a previously secret society of powerful clerics , now openly advising the new president , are transforming these messianic beliefs into government policies . 
Led by Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi , who frequently appears with the Ahmadinejad , the Hojatieh society is considered by many Shia as the lunatic fringe . 
During the early years of the Islamic Revolution , even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini found their beliefs too extreme and sent them scurrying underground . 
As devotees of the 12th Imam , the Hojatieh believe that only great tribulation will warrant his coming . 
Since taking office last August , Ahmadinejad has installed Hojatieh devotees in his cabinet and throughout the bureaucracy . 
The Ministry of Information and Security ( MOIS ) , largely sidelined by former President Mohammed Khatami , has re-emerged as a powerful repressive force , using plain-clothes agents , allied with the paramilitary Bassij and non-government vigilantes , to crack down on potential opponents of the regime . 
As the world prepares to confront an Iranian regime that continues to defy the International Atomic Energy Agency on its nuclear programs , we must listen to what Iran &apos;s leaders say as we watch what they do . 
A religious zealot with nuclear weapons is a dangerous combination the world cannot afford to tolerate .
