Why Vote ? 
As an Australian citizen , I voted in the recent federal election there . 
So did about 95 % of registered Australian voters . 
That figure contrasts markedly with elections in the United States , where the turnout in the 2004 presidential election barely exceeded 60 % . 
In Congressional elections that fall in the middle of a president &apos;s term , usually fewer than 40 % of eligible Americans bother to vote . 
There is a reason why so many Australians vote . 
In the 1920 &quot; s , when voter turnout fell below 60 % , parliament made voting compulsory . 
Since then , despite governments of varying political complexions , there has been no serious attempt to repeal the law , which polls show is supported by about 70 % of the population . 
Australians who don &apos;t vote receive a letter asking why . 
Those without an acceptable excuse , like illness or travel abroad , must pay a small fine , but the number fined is less than 1 % of eligible voters . 
In practice , what is compulsory is not casting a valid vote , but going to the polling place , having one &apos;s name checked off , and putting a ballot paper in the box . 
The secrecy of the ballot makes it impossible to prevent people writing nonsense on their ballot papers or leaving them blank . 
While the percentage of invalid votes is a little higher where voting is compulsory , it comes nowhere near offsetting the difference in voter turnout . 
Compulsory voting is not unique to Australia . 
Belgium and Argentina introduced it earlier , and it is practiced in many other countries , especially in Latin America , although both sanctions and enforcement vary . 
Because I was in the US at the time of the Australian election , I was under no compulsion to vote . 
I had many reasons to hope for the defeat of John Howard &apos;s conservative government , but that doesn &apos;t explain why I went to some trouble to vote , since the likelihood that my vote would make any difference was miniscule ( and , predictably , it did not ) . 
When voting is voluntary , and the chance that the result will be determined by any single person &apos;s vote is extremely low , even the smallest cost - for example , the time it takes to stroll down to the polling place , wait in line , and cast a ballot - is sufficient to make voting seem irrational . 
Yet if many people follow this line of reasoning , and do not vote , a minority of the population can determine a country &apos;s future , leaving a discontented majority . 
Poland &apos;s recent electoral history provides an example . 
In the 2005 national elections , barely 40 % of those eligible voted , the lowest total since the advent of free elections after the communist period . 
As a result , Jaroslaw Kaczynski was able to become prime minister with the support of a coalition of parties that gained a majority of seats in parliament , despite receiving only six million votes , out of a total of 30 million eligible voters . 
When Kaczynski was forced to go to the polls again only two years later , it became evident that many of those who had not voted in 2005 were unhappy with the outcome . 
Turnout rose to nearly 54 % , with the increase especially marked among younger and better-educated voters . 
Kaczynski &apos;s government suffered a heavy defeat . 
If we don &apos;t want a small minority to determine our government , we will favor a high turnout . 
Yet since our own vote makes such a tiny contribution to the outcome , each of us still faces the temptation to get a free ride , not bothering to vote while hoping that enough other people will vote to keep democracy robust and to elect a government that is responsive to the views of a majority of citizens . 
But there are many possible reasons for voting . 
Some people vote because they enjoy it , and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not . 
Others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not assess the rationality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one &apos;s own ballot . 
Still others might vote not because they imagine that they will determine the outcome of the election , but because , like football fans , they want to cheer their team on . 
They may vote because if they don &apos;t , they will be in no position to complain if they don &apos;t like the government that is elected . 
Or they may calculate that while the chances of their determining the outcome are only one in several million , the result is of such importance that even that tiny chance is enough to outweigh the minor inconveniences of voting . 
If these considerations fail to get people to the polls , however , compulsory voting is one way of overcoming the free-rider problem . 
The small cost imposed on not voting makes it rational for everyone to vote and at the same time establishes a social norm of voting . 
Australians want to be coerced into voting . 
They are happy to vote , knowing that everyone else is voting , too . 
Countries worried about low voter turnout would do well to consider their compulsory model .
