Education in Emergencies 
NEW YORK - Some time ago , I met a young girl in Jordan &apos;s vast Zaatari refugee camp . 
Like the tens of thousands of other children there , she and her family had fled the ever-worsening conflict in Syria . 
I first met her in a makeshift classroom situated in a sea of tents ; later , I saw her again , playing with other children on a rough playground . 
I asked her where she would rather be , learning in the classroom or playing with her friends . 
I know what my answer would have been at her age . 
Of all the things she was forced to leave behind in Syria , her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose - not if she were ever going to realize her dream of being a doctor and avoid a future dictated by deprivation , violence , and loss . 
I &apos;ve heard that same hunger for learning voiced by so many children affected by the crisis in Syria and other emergencies around the world . 
Children desperately want to go to school . 
In the midst of violence and instability , school is a place of learning and opportunity , a sanctuary for healing and health , and a haven of normalcy and hope for the future . 
Education not only increases the chances that , someday , children will be able to support themselves and seek a better life for their families ; it also provides them with the skills to rebuild their societies . 
So reaching the children affected by emergencies - and providing them with the opportunity to learn - serves both humanitarian needs and development goals . 
In fact , it is an area where humanitarian and development interests are almost perfectly aligned . 
As global leaders prepare to adopt the new Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) that will guide development efforts for the next 15 years , this could not be more important . 
The good news is that there is a growing global consensus on the centrality of schooling in breaking intergenerational cycles of inequality and building stronger , more stable societies . 
The proposed education SDG reflects this consensus , as it calls for inclusive , equitable access to the classroom . 
Unlike the Millennium Development Goal for education , which called for universal access to primary education , the SDG calls for universal access to learning - from early childhood development to secondary school , and beyond . 
As we embrace the new education goal , we should consider one of the primary obstacles to its achievement : the rising number of emergencies around the world . 
According to a new report by the Overseas Development Institute , nearly one in three children out of school today is living in a country affected by crisis . 
In the 35 countries most affected by violence , 65 million children from age three to 15 are at risk of missing out on learning . 
For the youngest children , crisis and conflict mean that schooling never starts . 
For others , it means that education is interrupted , never to be restarted . 
For still others , the quality of education is so poor - owing to a lack of adequately trained teachers or appropriate materials - that they are not acquiring even basic reading and writing skills . 
Some groups face particularly serious challenges . 
Children with disabilities - most of whom never enter school in developing countries - see their already-minimal prospects decline even further in times of crisis . 
And according to new data released by the Education for All Global Monitoring Report , young women living in conflict-affected areas are nearly 90 % more likely to be out of secondary school than their counterparts in more stable countries . 
This is all the more problematic , given that even a single year of additional schooling for girls increases both their earning power and the likelihood that they will send their own children to school . 
Though the number of children affected by crisis is reaching an all-time high , financing for education in emergencies remains outrageously low . 
In 2013 , less than 2 % of emergency aid went to education and learning opportunities . 
To meet the new SDG target on education , our investments need to respond to the realities of a more volatile world . 
That begins with acceptance of a basic truth : that learning is not only a critical element of relief for every child in an emergency , but also a crucial investment in the future development of their societies . 
We must act on this knowledge , by securing greater and more predictable funding for education in unpredictable emergencies . 
Over the last few months - on the margins of the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , and at the World Education Forum in May - an informal group has been considering a proposal to establish a new global fund for education in emergencies . 
Though many details remain to be discussed , the idea is gaining strength . 
For we face a choice , one that we must make collectively : Should we spend more now on education in emergencies , or pay the price of a lost generation of poorly educated children who will someday be inadequately equipped to rebuild their shattered societies ? 
A generation of children who are denied the chance to reach their own dreams will find it much harder to give their own children a chance at a better future .
