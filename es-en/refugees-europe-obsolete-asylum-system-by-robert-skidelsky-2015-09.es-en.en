The Agony and the Exodus 
BRUSSELS - The tragic exodus of people from war-torn Syria and surrounding countries challenges the world &apos;s reason and sympathy . 
Since 2011 , some four million people have fled Syria , with millions more internally displaced . 
Syria &apos;s neighbors - Jordan , Lebanon , and Turkey - currently house the vast majority of the externally displaced . 
But , as the crisis has progressed , hundreds of thousands of refugees have headed toward Europe , with most taking the extremely dangerous marine route . 
The nature and scale of this exodus have rendered all previous legal and political assumptions about migration obsolete . 
In the past , the chief motive for migration was economic . 
The debate to which economic migration gave rise was between liberals , who upheld the principle of the free movement of labor , and those who wanted restrictions on movement among countries in order to protect jobs , culture , and / or political cohesion . 
As the world filled up with nation-states , and empty spaces filled up with people , restriction triumphed over free movement . 
Controls on immigration became widespread after World War I. All countries developed population policies . 
But there has always been another , much smaller , group of asylum-seekers - those individuals forced to flee their home countries by persecution , often on religious or ethnic grounds . 
The 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees recognized a right of asylum for those unable to return to their country of origin owing to a &quot; well founded &quot; fear of persecution . 
In practice , however , it has never been simple to distinguish between economic and political migrants , because political persecution usually includes economic restrictions . 
The Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe at the end of the nineteenth century , or Hitler &apos;s Germany in the 1930s , were both economic and political migrants . 
So were the East African Asians forced out of Uganda in the 1960s . 
But the number of those identified as political refugees with a right of asylum was much smaller than those whose chief motive was to improve their economic lot . 
This reflected the relatively settled political conditions of the world of the 1950s . 
Back then , the countries from which refugees are now escaping were under colonial or quasi-colonial rule , while homegrown dictatorships then emerged to preserve order in the old empires &quot; successor states . 
It was the collapse of these brutal systems in the wake of the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Arab Spring of 2011 that created the current refugee crisis . 
The refugees &quot; flight from Syria and other war-ravaged countries comes up against legal regimes that are poorly adapted to cope with it . 
The European Union severely restricts labor from non-member countries , but allows free movement of labor within its single market . 
This is justified by the fiction that the citizens of EU countries are members of a single polity . 
The right of Greeks to work in Germany is no different from that of Parisians to work in Marseilles . 
But the EU is an incomplete state - one that may never be completed . 
An obvious indicator of this is that it lacks a fiscal-transfer mechanism to reduce the pressure of emigration from poor to rich areas . 
In the absence of this , it is assumed that free economic migration within the EU will produce little net movement of populations . 
The implicit model is that of the &quot; guest worker &quot; who comes and goes ; in practice , a sizeable share of economic migrants from poorer parts of Europe stay in their country of destination , fueling an increase in support for anti-immigrant parties . 
The asylum system is totally unprepared to deal with the new generation of refugees , who are ineligible under the existing framework , because they are fleeing not from specific acts of persecution , but from the disintegration of their states . 
They can be provided &quot; humanitarian protection &quot; or be granted &quot; discretionary leave to remain &quot; for a short period ; but then they can be deported as illegal immigrants . 
So what is to be done ? 
Temporary residence status , in Europe or outside , would be reasonable if a rapid return to normalcy in the refugees &quot; countries of origin was a realistic prospect . 
In Syria , for example , it is not : Although politicians and commentators talk about stemming the flood at the source , no peace plan is in sight . 
The US and Russia back different sides . 
The West cannot accept the possibility that the Assad dictatorship , however brutal , may be the least bad option on offer . 
So the civil war will continue , the number of refugees in transit camps will increase , and more of them will risk their lives to enter leaky Fortress Europe . 
Jean-Claude Juncker , the president of the European Commission , has proposed distributing 160,000 of the refugees currently in Europe across the EU &apos;s 28 member states . 
Germany is prepared to take far more . 
Indeed , Chancellor Angela Merkel has bravely asserted &quot; the fundamental right to asylum for the politically persecuted with no upper limit ; and that goes for refugees who come to us from the hell of civil war . &quot; 
But other European leaders , faced with the rise of extremist , anti-immigrant parties , have not endorsed Merkel &apos;s view ; and the refugees still have to get to Germany through countries like Hungary , which are erecting walls and other border defenses to keep them out . 
The truth is that the West cannot or will not absorb refugees in the numbers needed ; and it has no solution to the problem of failed states . 
This means that , apart from doling out humanitarian aid to those in refugee camps , it has no policy . 
Unless and until that changes , the tragedy can only deepen .
