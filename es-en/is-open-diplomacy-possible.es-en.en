Is Open Diplomacy Possible ? 
PRINCETON - At Princeton University , Woodrow Wilson , who was president of the university before he became president of the United States , is never far away . 
His larger-than-life image looks out across the dining hall at Wilson College , where I am a fellow , and Prospect House , the dining facility for academic staff , was his family home when he led the university . 
So when the furor erupted over WikiLeaks &quot; recent release of a quarter-million diplomatic cables , I was reminded of Wilson &apos;s 1918 speech in which he put forward &quot; Fourteen Points &quot; for a just peace to end World War I. The first of those fourteen points reads : &quot; Open covenants of peace must be arrived at , after which there will surely be no private international action or rulings of any kind , but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view . &quot; 
Is this an ideal that we should take seriously ? 
Is Wikileaks founder Julian Assange a true follower of Woodrow Wilson ? 
Wilson was unable to get the Treaty of Versailles to reflect his fourteen points fully , although it did include several of them , including the establishment of an association of states that proved to be the forerunner of today &apos;s United Nations . 
But Wilson then failed to get the US Senate to ratify the treaty , which included the covenant of the League of Nations . 
Writing in The New York Times earlier this month , Paul Schroeter , an emeritus professor of history , argued that open diplomacy is often &quot; fatally flawed , &quot; and gave as an example the need for secret negotiations to reach agreement on the Treaty of Versailles . 
Since the Treaty bears substantial responsibility for the resurrection of German nationalism that led to the rise of Hitler and World War II , it has a fair claim to being the most disastrous peace treaty in human history . 
Moreover , it is hard to imagine that if Wilson &apos;s proposals had formed the basis of the peace , and set the tone for all future negotiations , the history of Europe in the twentieth century would have been worse than it actually was . 
That makes the Treaty of Versailles a poor example to use to demonstrate the desirability of secrecy in international negotiations . 
Open government is , within limits , an ideal that we all share . 
US President Barack Obama endorsed it when he took office in January 2009 . 
&quot; Starting today , &quot; he told his cabinet secretaries and staff , &quot; every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information but those who seek to make it known . &quot; 
He then noted that there would have to be exceptions to this policy to protect privacy and national security . 
Even Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has admitted , however , that while the recent leaks are embarrassing and awkward for the US , their consequences for its foreign policy are modest . 
Some of the leaked cables are just opinion , and not much more than gossip about national leaders . 
But , because of the leak , we know , for example , that when the British government set up its supposedly open inquiry into the causes of the Iraq war , it also promised the US government that it would &quot; put measures in place to protect your interests . &quot; 
The British government appears to have been deceiving the public and its own parliament . 
Similarly , the cables reveal that President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen lied to his people and parliament about the source of US airstrikes against al-Qaeda in Yemen , telling them that Yemen &apos;s military was the source of the bombs . 
We have also learned more about the level of corruption in some of the regimes that the US supports , like those in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and in other countries with which the US has friendly relations , notably Russia . 
We now know that the Saudi royal family has been urging the US to undertake a military attack on Iran to prevent it from becoming capable of producing nuclear weapons . 
Here , perhaps , we learned something for which the US government deserves credit : it has resisted that suggestion . 
Knowledge is generally considered a good thing ; so , presumably , knowing more about how the US thinks and operates around the world is also good . 
In a democracy , citizens pass judgment on their government , and if they are kept in the dark about what their government is doing , they cannot be in a position to make well-grounded decisions . 
Even in non-democratic countries , people have a legitimate interest in knowing about actions taken by the government . 
Nevertheless , it isn &apos;t always the case that openness is better than secrecy . 
Suppose that US diplomats had discovered that democrats living under a brutal military dictatorship were negotiating with junior officers to stage a coup to restore democracy and the rule of law . 
I would hope that WikiLeaks would not publish a cable in which diplomats informed their superiors of the plot . 
Openness is in this respect like pacifism : just as we cannot embrace complete disarmament while others stand ready to use their weapons , so Woodrow Wilson &apos;s world of open diplomacy is a noble ideal that cannot be fully realized in the world in which we live . 
We could , however , try to get closer to that ideal . 
If governments did not mislead their citizens so often , there would be less need for secrecy , and if leaders knew that they could not rely on keeping the public in the dark about what they are doing , they would have a powerful incentive to behave better . 
It is therefore regrettable that the most likely outcome of the recent revelations will be greater restrictions to prevent further leaks . 
Let &apos;s hope that in the new WikiLeaks age , that goal remains out of reach .
