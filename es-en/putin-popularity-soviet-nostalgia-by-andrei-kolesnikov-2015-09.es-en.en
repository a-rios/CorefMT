Putin &apos;s Crooked Road to Damascus 
MOSCOW - When Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed the United Nations General Assembly on September 28 , he knew he would grab the world &apos;s attention and upstage US President Barack Obama with his call for a united front in the battle against the Islamic State . 
But Putin was addressing Russians , too , knowing full well the need to distract them from their country &apos;s increasingly obvious economic woes . 
Last year , the distraction was the annexation of Crimea , followed by the encouragement of pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine . 
The recent dispatch of Russian aircraft , missiles , and a few thousand troops to Syria is a flag-waving substitute for that failed &quot; Novorossiya &quot; project . 
Putin &apos;s critics rightly see his Syrian adventure as yet another appeal to Russian nostalgia for the Soviet past : the USSR was mighty - and Putin claims that Russia can and does have the same power . 
But to what end ? 
Wrong-footing the United States and the West may be good tactics in the short term , but there seems to be no long-term vision of the purposes that Russian power is supposed to serve , other than to preserve the power of Russia &apos;s elites . 
As a result , the regime mimics the forms of democracy while using its propaganda to foment an aggressive form of nationalism . 
In the early years of this century the combination of high oil prices and economic growth dulled the elites &quot; appetite for strategic thinking and allowed them to ignore the subsequent rollback of health-care , education , and social-welfare reforms . 
The regime and the public now see the current situation as more or less normal - a &quot; non-crisis crisis . &quot; 
Because perception shapes reality , everything is normal , nothing has to be done , and Putin - having supposedly restored Russia &apos;s dignity - can enjoy his approval ratings of more than 80 % . 
To Putin , restoring Russia &apos;s dignity is the same as resurrecting its &quot; great-power status &quot; following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its humiliating &quot; defeat &quot; by the West in the Cold War . 
Exercising power externally apparently compensates for the fact that dignity within the country is far from restored : Today &apos;s Russian citizen remains defenseless before his bosses , the utility companies , the courts , and the police - and yet , whatever his hardships , he remains proud of his nation and its leader . 
There is , of course , another explanation of why Putin &apos;s popularity is still growing in the face of a worsening economy : those unable to fend for themselves naturally look to the state for help - and are hardly likely to bite the hand feeds them . 
What Westerners decry as human-rights abuses ordinary Russians are likely to praise as policies to rid the country of &quot; alien &quot; practices and protect the majority from the &quot; subversive &quot; minority . 
The regime &apos;s hostility toward gays and lesbians may offend the West , but it strikes a sympathetic chord with most Russians . 
Because those same Russians regard the war in Ukraine as defensive and just , war becomes justified ; history &apos;s dark pages are rewritten ; and hostile language becomes the norm . 
Not long ago , ordinary Russians spoke openly about the number of deaths and casualties suffered in their country &apos;s military operations ; now , following Putin &apos;s presidential decree on &quot; secret losses , &quot; they keep quiet . 
Even though the decree may well conflict with the Russian Constitution and the Law on State Secrets , the list of classified information now includes Russian military losses during peacetime operations . 
The consequence is a country divided between loyal and disloyal , patriotic and unpatriotic - that is , between those who toe the party line and those who refuse . 
If the polls are accurate , the loyal and obedient are a clear majority - at least so far . 
This explains support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine &apos;s Donbas region and for Putin &apos;s intervention in Syria . 
If the US cannot accept this , it merely proves that America insists on hegemony , whether in Europe , through NATO , or in the Middle East . 
Such logic is bolstered by Putin &apos;s self-interested reinterpretation of history , which justifies the 1939 Winter War against Finland , the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 , and the 1979 Soviet invasion in Afghanistan . 
The Attorney General &apos;s Office has even been occupying itself with a ludicrous retrospective analysis of the decision in 1954 to transfer Crimea from the jurisdiction of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to that of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic . 
Worryingly , the same analysis is being carried out on the legality of the independence of the Baltic states after the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
Where will all this lead ? 
Just as in the Soviet era , today &apos;s rulers equate themselves with the state . 
The state is then reduced to the leader &apos;s inner circle and the top echelon of the financial and political elites , secure in their power because ordinary citizens have been duped into an uncritical and extreme form of nationalism . 
Putin &apos;s embattled opponents can safely predict a long period of political , economic , and intellectual stagnation - certainly until the parliamentary election next year and the presidential election two years later . 
The stagnation will probably last into the following political cycle , too . 
But it cannot last forever : at some point , the regime &apos;s survival will require offering the public something other than nationalism and nostalgia . 
The question is whether Putin , now deepening Russia &apos;s involvement in yet another foreign military adventure , understands this .
