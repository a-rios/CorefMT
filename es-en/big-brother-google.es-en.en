Big Brother Google ? 
MOSCOW - &quot; Google violates its &quot; don &apos;t be evil &quot; motto . &quot; 
To Google &apos;s credit , if you Google that sentence , you can find reference to a debate on that claim that I took part in recently . 
As it happens , I have a complex relationship with Google . 
I have fed at its trough many times - as a personal guest ; as an advisory board member of Stop Badware , an NGO it sponsors ; and as a speaker at its events . 
I also sit on the board of 23andMe , co-founded by the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin . 
But I also sit on the boards of Yandex in Russia , one of a small number of companies around the world who beat Google in their local markets , and of WPP , a worldwide advertising / marketing company famous for its rivalry with Google . 
Finally , I &apos;m suspicious of concentrations of power of any kind . 
So I welcomed the chance to clarify my thinking . 
I took the con side of the debate : Google does not violate its motto . 
However , I do think there is a danger that someday it could . 
The danger lies in the concentration of information - arguably a concentration of power - that Google represents . 
Google doesn &apos;t merely point users to existing information on the Web ; it also collects information that it doesn &apos;t share about its users &quot; behavior . 
If you can use patterns in Google searches to track flu outbreaks and predict a movie &apos;s commercial prospects , can you also use it to forecast market movements or even revolutions ? 
Even if Google uses personal information only for their benefit ( whatever that means ) , it represents an attractive target for governments . 
In fact , Google generally fights government requests for personal information . 
( It was Yahoo , not Google , that gave personal information to China &apos;s government , which then jailed a blogger . ) 
Google has become a de facto gatekeeper of information , to the extent that if your site is not highly ranked by Google , you are like the tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it . 
It doesn &apos;t matter that people seeking information are free to bypass Google and use other tools ; they don &apos;t . 
So how does information equal power ? 
The active power that information provides is typically the threat of exposure . 
Such information gives you power primarily in a secretive , opaque world where access to information is limited . 
But generally , the free flow of information reduces the concentration of power . 
So , rather than suppressing or regulating the information that Google uncovers , we are better off making it more freely available . 
A Google that is accountable to its users - searchers , advertisers , investors , and governments - is likely to be a better outfit that does more good in today &apos;s relatively open market . 
In short , there is no regulatory system that I trust more than the current messy world of conflicting interests . 
Whatever short-term temptations it faces - to manipulate its search results , use private information , or throw its weight around - Google , it is clear , could lose a lot by succumbing to them in a world where its every move is watched . 
Meanwhile , Google is not merely avoiding evil ; it actively fights against it . 
For example , Google fights censorship - by doing , not by shouting . 
Rather than stand on the sidelines and proclaim censorship evil , it is picking its way through the landmines in China - competing with a politically well-connected rival and politely letting its users know that they aren &apos;t always getting the whole picture . 
In short , Google is changing expectations about what people can know - even in the United States , where formal censorship is absent , but government obfuscation , opaque corporations , and the like are not . 
Moreover , in countries where Google is criticized for blocking access to information , it points out the information &apos;s absence when something is blocked - letting people know that it exists but that they can &apos;t have access to it . 
On the other hand , every time someone in China Googles something and gets an answer - a product &apos;s good and bad points , the details about someone the government does not like - he must wonder , &quot; Why can &apos;t I get this kind of information about everything ? &quot; 
With Google , people start to expect answers about everything . 
A little transparency inevitably leads to more . 
Rather than demand an end to censorship now - an impossible dream - Google is working to make that happen by eroding government control over information . 
Moreover , from a purely practical point of view , Google makes the world more efficient . 
Buyers and sellers can find one another , schoolchildren can find information needed for their homework , and sick people can find health information . 
The real threat of evil , I think , lies in the temptations of &quot; international governance &quot; - say , a sinister multilateral government body called the World Information Center . 
Nice as it sounds , the reality is likely to be ridden with bureaucracy , susceptible to control by the worst of the world &apos;s governments rather than its best ones , and incapable of innovation . 
Take , for example , ICANN , the body that sets policy for the Domain Name System . 
I was its founding chairman , and I don &apos;t think anyone considers it a success . 
Its saving grace is that it is widely considered illegitimate and therefore has little power . 
By contrast , Google is effective at what it does , and therefore has the legitimacy of results . 
But it has little coercive power , because anyone is free to try an alternative . 
Its only option is to be better than the competition . 
The fact that these issues are being debated is a good sign in itself - keeping Google and its watchers on guard . 
Fortunately , a wary press corps , powerful governments , and nervous competitors watch its every move , hoping the company to fight its many temptations . 
Abuse of power is evil , but power itself is not .
