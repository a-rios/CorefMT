China &apos;s Struggle to Slow 
BEIJING - At the opening of the annual session of China &apos;s parliament , the National People &apos;s Congress ( NPC ) , Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the government &apos;s target for annual economic growth in 2012 was 7.5 % . 
With the global economy still struggling to recover , Wen &apos;s announcement of such a significant dip in China &apos;s growth rate naturally sparked widespread concern around the world . 
But it is important to note that Wen was expressing a policy rather than forecasting performance . 
The purpose of targeting a lower growth rate , he explained , is &quot; to guide people in all sectors to focus their work on accelerating the transformation of the pattern of economic development and making economic development more sustainable and efficient . &quot; 
Fixed-asset investment is the most important engine of China &apos;s growth . 
As a developing country with annual per capita income of less than $ 5,000 , there is still significant room for China to increase its capital stock . 
The issue is not whether China needs more investment , but whether China &apos;s absorption capacity can continue to accommodate the rapid investment growth of the past decade . 
In this sense , the investment rate , which in China approaches 50 % of GDP and is rising , can be regarded as a measure of the stress that fixed investment places on the economy . 
It is not entirely an exaggeration to say that the economy &apos;s capacity for investment growth has reached its limit . 
The recent high-speed rail debacle is a case in point . 
In 2003 , China built its first high-speed-rail project . 
As a key component of the RMB4 trillion ( $ 630 billion ) stimulus package introduced during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis , investment in high-speed-rail construction increased by leaps and bounds . 
By the end of 2010 , China &apos;s operational high-speed-rail network surpassed 8,000 kilometers , with an additional 17,000 kilometers under construction . 
By contrast , all Western countries combined took a half-century to build a total of 6,500 kilometers . 
Built in such haste , catastrophe was almost inevitable . 
Investment growth that surpasses an economy &apos;s absorption capacity will lead to a rapid deterioration in the efficiency of investment , which in turn will harm long-term growth prospects . 
Evidence of this in China today is all too prevalent . 
To reverse this trend , some respite in investment growth is not only necessary , but also inevitable in a profit-driven economy . 
While China &apos;s investment rate should be brought down to a sustainable level , an equally , if not more , important challenge is to adjust the structure of investment . 
For many years , the single most important category of investment in China has been real-estate development , which accounts for roughly 10 % of GDP and a quarter of total investment . 
Adjusting the investment structure , however , will inevitably cause investment growth to decelerate , at least in the transitional period , thus leading to a slowdown in overall GDP growth . 
International trade has played a pivotal role in China &apos;s economic development over the past 30 years . 
However , the global market is no longer able to absorb China &apos;s massive exports , not to mention the immediate impact of economic malaise in Europe and the United States on export demand . 
Moreover , rising labor costs and a stronger renminbi will also undermine China &apos;s export sector , causing GDP growth to slow this year . 
Few would argue against China &apos;s need for slower but better growth . 
The problem is that if China wishes to lower the GDP growth rate to 7.5 % in 2012 , from 9.2 % in 2011 , without worsening the growth pattern by raising the high investment rate even further , the annual growth rate of investment must be equal to or less than 7.5 % . 
A back-of-the-envelope calculation suffices to show that , unless the government is prepared to tolerate a further increase in the investment rate , achieving a GDP growth target of 7.5 % implies a significant fall in the growth rate of investment . 
To compensate for the negative impact on GDP growth , and with export growth constrained by weak global demand , consumption must rise even more sharply , which is hard to imagine . 
In other words , lowering the GDP growth rate to 7.5 % without making China &apos;s growth pattern even more irrational is an impossible mission . 
So a more likely growth scenario for 2012 is that China &apos;s growth will be lower than in 2011 , but still significantly higher than 7.5 % . 
Correspondingly , its investment-driven growth pattern will be strengthened further , though at a slowing pace . 
Otherwise , a policy-induced hard landing would be difficult to avoid . 
Indeed , how to achieve a more moderate growth rate without causing a hard landing is one of the most severe challenges confronting the Chinese government . 
A hard landing is simply not an option . 
With the country &apos;s fiscal position still positive , it is difficult to image that the Chinese leadership would be so headstrong about &quot; accelerating the transformation of the pattern of economic development &quot; as to risk such an outcome . 
Even if it is , GDP-obsessed and debt-ridden local governments are likely to strive to achieve the highest possible growth rates for themselves , while paying lip service to Wen &apos;s call for a slowdown . 
That is why , despite the official target , most Chinese economists still bet on a growth rate well above 8 % for 2012 .
