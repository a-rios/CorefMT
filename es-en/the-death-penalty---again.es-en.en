The Death Penalty - Again 
PRINCETON - Three significant events relating to the death penalty occurred in the United States during September . 
The one that gained the most publicity was the execution in Georgia of Troy Davis , who had been convicted of the 1989 murder of Mark McPhail , an off-duty police officer . 
Davis &apos;s death sentence was carried out despite serious doubts about whether he was guilty of the crime for which he received it . 
Witnesses who had testified at his trial later said that prosecutors had coerced them . 
Even death-penalty supporters protested against his execution , saying that he should be given a new trial . 
But the courts denied his appeals . 
In his final words , he proclaimed his innocence . 
The deliberate judicial killing of a man who might have been innocent is deeply disturbing . 
But the execution was consistent with something that happened just two weeks earlier , at one of the debates between Republican candidates for their party &apos;s nomination to challenge President Barack Obama next year . 
Texas Governor Rick Perry was reminded that during his term of office , the death penalty has been carried out 234 times . 
No other governor in modern times has presided over as many executions . 
But what is more remarkable is that some audience members applauded when the high number of executions was mentioned . 
Perry was then asked whether he was ever troubled by the fact that one of them might have been innocent . 
He replied that he did not lose any sleep over the executions , because he had confidence in the judicial system in Texas . 
In view of the record of mistakes in every other judicial system , such confidence is difficult to justify . 
Indeed , less than a month later , Michael Morton , who had served nearly 25 years of a life sentence for the murder of his wife , was released from a Texas prison . 
DNA tests had shown that another man was responsible for the crime . 
As September drew to a close , the US Supreme Court reached its decision in the case of Manuel Valle , who had been sentenced to death 33 years earlier . 
Valle had asked the court to halt his execution , on the grounds that to spend so long on death row is &quot; cruel and unusual punishment &quot; and therefore prohibited by the US constitution . 
Justice Stephen Breyer agreed that to spend 33 years in prison awaiting execution is cruel . 
In support of that view , he pointed to &quot; barbaric &quot; conditions on death row , and the &quot; horrible &quot; feelings of uncertainty when one is under sentence of execution but does not know whether or when the sentence will be carried out . 
Breyer then went on to document the fact that so long a period on death row is also unusual . 
It was , in fact , a record , although the average length of time spent on death row in the US is 15 years ; in 2009 , of 3173 death-row prisoners , 113 had been there for more than 29 years . 
So Breyer held that Valle &apos;s treatment was unconstitutional , and that he should not be executed . 
But he found no support for his position among the eight other Supreme Court judges . 
On September 28 , the court rejected Valle &apos;s application , and he was executed that evening . 
The US is now the only Western industrialized nation to retain the death penalty for murder . 
Of 50 European countries , only Belarus , notorious for its lack of respect for basic human rights , still executes criminals in peacetime . 
The European Union &apos;s Charter of Fundamental Rights regards the death penalty as a human-rights violation . 
The death penalty is not an effective deterrent . 
Murder rates in Europe and other Western industrialized nations are lower , often much lower , than those in the US . 
In the US , however , deterrence is not really the issue . 
Retribution is often seen as a more important justification for the death penalty . 
It is quite common for family members of the victim to watch the execution of the person convicted of killing their relative , and afterwards to pronounce themselves satisfied that justice has been done - it happened again with the execution of Troy Davis . 
In the rest of the Western world , the desire to witness an execution is widely regarded as barbaric , and barely comprehensible . 
The idea that the families of murder victims cannot obtain &quot; closure &quot; until the murderer has been executed seems not to be a universal human truth , but a product of a particular culture - perhaps not even American culture as a whole , but rather the culture of the American South , where 80 % of all executions take place . 
In view of the possibility that Georgia recently executed an innocent man , it is particularly ironic that the South &apos;s voters are America &apos;s most zealous in their efforts to protect innocent human life - as long as that life is still inside the womb , or is that of a person who , suffering from a terminal illness , seeks a doctor &apos;s assistance in order to die when he or she wants . 
It is a contradiction that belies what the Republican Party , which dominates the region , promotes as a &quot; culture of life . &quot;
