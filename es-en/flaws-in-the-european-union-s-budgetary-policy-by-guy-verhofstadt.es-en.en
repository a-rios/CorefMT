A Better EU Budget 
BRUSSELS - Stopping Europe &apos;s economic decline and overcoming its competitiveness crisis will require radical solutions . 
But European Union leaders remain fixated on old priorities - a lack of vision evident in negotiations over the EU &apos;s 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) . 
Once again , short-term national interests are taking precedence over the need for a forward-looking , flexible , and efficient EU budget . 
The European Parliament , which for the first time must approve the MFF , should use its new-found influence to uphold the EU-wide public interest and offset the blinkered , vested interests of individual member states . 
In a climate of budgetary restraint , it is unsurprising that the European Council agreed earlier this year to reduce the EU budget by 3.4 % relative to the 2007-2013 MFF . 
But , with austerity under fire and EU countries looking to encourage spending , the Council should also consider the budget &apos;s shape , ensuring that the MFF does not impede future growth and investment . 
For example , the proposed budget slashes funding for cross-border infrastructure projects , including the expansion of high-speed broadband networks into rural areas and the development of transport and energy infrastructure . 
But the EU can add considerable value by coordinating transnational infrastructure projects , thereby achieving economies of scale and avoiding a duplication of national spending . 
Europeans would benefit directly through improved Internet access , lower energy costs , and more efficient transport links . 
Likewise , in order to lay the foundations for future economic growth , the EU should nurture new , sustainable industries and innovative small and medium-size enterprises - not cut funding for important research programs like Horizon 2020 . 
Innovations in renewable energy , for example , are essential to improving energy security and preserving Europe &apos;s standing as a global leader in combating climate change . 
Given that renewable energy is one of the world &apos;s fastest-growing sectors , such investment could have a significant impact on future GDP growth and job creation . 
Meanwhile , agricultural subsidies and cohesion funds , which were cut by 11 % and 8 % , respectively , relative to the previous MFF , still account for almost two-thirds of total spending . 
While these areas are important , their allocations should be reduced further to create space for growth-enhancing investments . 
Another major problem is the MFF &apos;s lack of flexibility . 
A priority review during the budgetary term would enable the EU to adapt its annual budgets to changing circumstances and reallocate unspent money where it is needed most . 
Moreover , the current structure of the EU &apos;s annual budget carries financial risks . 
For example , many projects are completed toward the end of the budgetary cycle , generating a backlog of unpaid bills in the MFF &apos;s later years . 
If they are not addressed through an MFF-amending budget , they risk fueling a run-up in debt . 
While the Council eventually agreed to cover the difference in the 2012 budget , an even greater shortfall is forecast for this year - and many member states are unable to oblige the Commission &apos;s request for an additional â‚¬ 11.2 billion to cover these outstanding liabilities . 
Now , the European Parliament is insisting that all unpaid bills should be settled before the next budgetary cycle begins . 
To be sure , the EU budget contains flexible instruments , such as the EU Solidarity Fund , which provides emergency assistance after natural disasters . 
But these tools have not always been used as effectively as possible . 
Disbursal of relief funds to help Italy rebuild after severe floods in 2011 took almost a year , owing to politicization in the Council . 
Even without the delays caused by political interference , such instruments are inadequate . 
Scope to adapt the MFF as a whole is needed , not least to ensure its legitimacy . 
It should include a comprehensive and binding revision clause ensuring that the state of public finances and collective investment needs are reassessed at the halfway point . 
This would give the next European Parliament - and the voters who elect its members - the influence over the EU &apos;s long-term budget that a democratic system requires . 
Agreement on budgetary priorities should be achieved in the Council through qualified majority voting , so that a single country cannot hijack the process . 
A &quot; sunset clause &quot; would prevent the Council from blocking subsequent revisions by , say , stipulating that the budget would revert to 2013 levels if no review were conducted by the specified date . 
In the long term , the MFF &apos;s timing should be adjusted to coincide with the European Parliament &apos;s mandate , and the EU &apos;s excessive reliance on national contributions should be reduced . 
As trade liberalization has diminished the EU &apos;s income , mainly derived from customs duties , individual countries have increasingly sought to minimize their net contributions . 
Bargaining between member states leads to lowest-common-denominator budgets that appease vested interests but fail to support EU member states &quot; shared ambitions . 
Europe thus ends up losing , and the true benefits of EU membership are not fully realized . 
Add to that the way deals are reached - behind closed doors and without adequate democratic oversight - and it is not surprising that Europeans &quot; views of the EU are becoming increasingly negative . 
A system based on the EU &apos;s own resources would reduce tension between contributors and beneficiaries and ease pressure on member states &quot; budgets . 
Existing proposals include a &quot; Robin Hood &quot; tax on financial transactions , a share of the profits from the EU &apos;s carbon emissions-trading scheme , or a larger take from value-added tax receipts . 
But the Council has left this potentially contentious subject out of recent discussions . 
That is precisely the problem . 
Political leadership calls for vision and courage . 
Postponing important decisions leads to an inefficient budget shaped by competing national interests . 
Without a responsive budgetary policy that focuses on the EU as a whole , the MFF negotiations will provide plenty of high drama and fine rhetoric , but few real benefits that might boost Europe &apos;s recovery .
