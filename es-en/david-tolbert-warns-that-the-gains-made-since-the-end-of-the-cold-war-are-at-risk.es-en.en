A Wrong Turn for Human Rights 
NEW YORK - The world has plunged into a period of brutality , with impunity for the perpetrators of violence . 
Syria is suffering untold civilian casualties as a divided United Nations Security Council sits on the sidelines . Gaza was pummeled to dust yet again with the world watching on . Iraq is in flames , with no end in sight . 
Atrocities are mounting in South Sudan and the Central African Republic , which are also being swept by an epidemic of sexual violence . 
Even Europe is not immune : a civilian aircraft was shot down over a conflict zone in eastern Ukraine , and officials were prevented from investigating . 
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , and more than a decade after the establishment of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , shockingly little is being done to stop these abuses , and the prospects of the victims ever getting justice , let alone bringing the perpetrators to account , seem ever more remote . 
For many years , the world seemed to be progressing toward greater recognition of human rights and demands for justice . 
As democracies emerged in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe in the 1980s and 1990s , these issues assumed increasing importance . 
Although wars , conflicts , and atrocities continued , the global powers tried , and occasionally managed - albeit chaotically and usually late - to stop the killing . 
Moreover , the international community created frameworks for justice to deal with the consequences of violence , a move that was scarcely imaginable during the Cold War . 
New UN-backed international and hybrid tribunals were created to bring to account perpetrators of atrocities in the Balkans , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , and Cambodia . 
The ICC , with jurisdiction over atrocities committed in 122 member states , was established to try cases referred to it by state parties or the Security Council ( even though three permanent members - the United States , Russia , and China - have not ratified or acceded to the Rome Statute , which places parties under ICC jurisdiction ) . 
In addition , many governments , with UN support , created mechanisms for transitional justice at home , including more than 40 &quot; truth commissions &quot; ( such as in Argentina , El Salvador , East Timor , Morocco , and South Africa ) , reparation programs , and prosecutions . 
None of these efforts has been perfect , but they have given victims a voice and recognized their suffering , while signaling to culprits that their crimes will not be forgotten . 
Such measures have also deeply affected , and in some cases transformed , public discourse for the better . 
Today , however , the international community appears to be backsliding on its human-rights commitments . 
The world &apos;s emerging powers lack any sense of urgency in addressing abuses , preferring the pursuit of narrower , short-term interests to investing in long-term peace and justice . 
Without robust support from the international community , the institutions of justice are coming under pressure - and losing their momentum . 
Several countries have attacked the ICC ; 
To be sure , many states undergoing political transition are doggedly pursuing some form of justice . 
For example , justice and human rights are at the heart of the historic peace talks in Colombia . 
Despite the collapse of the Arab Spring , Tunisia is pressing ahead with reforms , including the creation of a Truth and Dignity Commission . 
But these societies may find it difficult to address adequately their troubled pasts without the support of international institutions . 
Elsewhere , the fight for human rights might become virtually impossible . 
Indeed , it will be hard enough to defend the human-rights gains made since the end of the Cold War , much less to expand them . 
Fortunately , governments &quot; growing reticence about progress on human rights - if not outright obstruction - will not stop civil-society groups from continuing their fight for justice . 
Groups like is Argentina &apos;s Mothers of Plaza de Mayo and the Mothers of Srebrenica have always bravely led the way ; they will , no doubt , continue to do so . 
But the absence from this process of key governments , especially the emerging powers , threatens to end the world &apos;s all-too-brief era of accountability . 
It is time for the international community to redouble its resolve , regain its sense of purpose , and reaffirm , in both word and deed , its commitment to human rights and a more just world .
