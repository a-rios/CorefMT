Off With Their Heads . 
WASHINGTON , DC - At last the Obama administration seems to be contemplating a decisive move against America &apos;s banking elite . 
Following the recent electoral setback in Massachusetts the proposals laid down by former Federal Reserve chairman , Paul Volcker , to reduce the market power of the banks , are being dusted off . 
Until now it has been a very different story - essentially a victory for the big bankers since spring 2009 , when some of the healthier ones were allowed to start paying back any funds they had drawn from the US treasury &apos;s Troubled Asset Relief Program . 
That , in turn , allowed them to escape even the very weak special conditions that had been laid down by the government relating to bonuses and remuneration . 
At the critical moment of crisis and rescue - from September 2008 to early 2009 - the Bush and Obama administrations blinked . 
There was no serious thought of deposing the bankers , who had helped to cause the crisis , or of breaking up their banks . 
Ordinarily , if an industry plunges into crisis , you expect a serious shake-up . 
Even if there was some bad luck mixed in with manifest incompetence , the presumption generally is : if your company requires a government rescue , top management needs to be replaced . 
The US treasury has for many years consistently advocated such principles - both directly and through its influence with the IMF - when other countries have got into trouble . 
But in the case of the US banking industry , nothing , at least until now , has happened at all . 
Most of the pre-crisis executives in big banks have remained in place , and very little has changed in terms of risk-control practices , or remuneration . 
Why was the administration so conservative ? 
Fear of a complete collapse of the banking system must have played some role - along with an unhealthy degree of intermingling between the political and financial elite , which meant that there was real affection for firms such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup at the top of government . 
In any case , the window of opportunity appeared to have been missed . 
As the measures taken to stabilize the economy began to work , the banks started to make money again . 
And , given the departure of some competitors - such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers - the larger market share for those that remained meant higher profits . 
The administration did launch a modest regulatory-reform initiative in summer 2009 , proposing new consumer protections and some measures to strengthen financial stability , but the measures were fought every inch of the way . 
And early in 2010 a new bank tax was proposed that aimed to raise about $ 90 billion over a decade or so - but that would have represented only about 1 % of banks &quot; profits . 
It is no surprise that the banks have tried to resist reform . 
The existing business model allows them to take the upside when they win , and hand over the downside to taxpayers when they lose . 
This encourages excessive risk and threatens repeated cycles of boom-bust-bailout . 
Indeed , Andrew Haldane , head of financial stability at the Bank of England , calls this our &quot; doom loop . &quot; 
Back-to-back international financial crises are rare , but the continued presence of such perverse incentives always leads to trouble - more than 50 years of IMF experience is clear on this point . &amp; 
But , finally , after Massachusetts , it looks as if something important is happening . 
The reforms proposed by Volcker would impose restrictions on banks similar to those contained in the Glass-Steagall Act , the depression-era legislation that separated commercial banking and investment banking . 
The dilution of Glass-Steagall , and its ultimate repeal in 1999 , allowed banks to engage in so-called &quot; proprietary trading &quot; - enabling them to use depositors &quot; savings to trade for their own account , mainly in risky mortgage-backed securities . 
But the Obama administration must go further than prohibiting proprietary trading by commercial banks and do two further things . 
First , capital requirements should be tripled - not just in the US , but across the G-20 - so that banks hold at least 20-25 % of assets in core capital . 
That way , shareholders rather than regulators would play the leading role in making banks behave sensibly . 
Second , if banks are &quot; too big to fail , &quot; they must be shrunk , so that taxpayers do not need to bail them out every time a crisis erupts . 
In the US context , the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act of 1994 , which set a size cap so that no bank can have more than 10 % of retail deposits , needs to be amended . 
We need to update and enforce this sensible general notion and set a limit on how big any bank can become relative to the overall economy . 
Obama is right to get tough with the six largest US banks - including JP Morgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , and Bank of America Â­ - which now have total assets worth more than 60 % of GDP . 
This is an unprecedented degree of financial concentration . 
As Teddy Roosevelt pointed out more than 100 years ago , concentrated economic power tends to take over political power , which runs counter to the democratic tradition . 
We have now learned that it also runs counter to sound economic policy .
