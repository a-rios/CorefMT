The Greening of China 
Two countries - the United States and China - remain aloof from global efforts to create a new post-Kyoto framework on climate change . 
Fifty years ago , the rest of the world might have carried on with remedying the problem of conventional and greenhouse gas emissions and let China and the US stew in their own waste . 
But the world is now so interdependent that what happens in one place affects all others . 
For example , visitors and residents alike have long thought of Hong Kong as a beautiful city clinging to the South China coast . 
But , for at least five years , Hong Kong &apos;s citizens have found themselves starting to cough and wheeze from the city &apos;s increasingly degraded air . 
Corporate employers are even complaining about not being able to attract overseas talent . 
Pollution from Hong Kong &apos;s own power generation plants , growing number of vehicles , and burgeoning shipping industry can certainly be reduced . 
But the lion &apos;s share of this industrial haze - like the growing pollution of its coastal waters - is a direct result of the rapid industrialization of the Pearl River Delta across the border in China &apos;s Guangdong Province . 
China is exporting not only more and more goods , but also its environmental degradation . 
The inescapable truth is that the futures of Hong Kong and China are integrally linked . 
There are roughly 58,000 factories in the Pearl River Delta with Hong Kong connections , and together they employ more than 10 million workers . 
Guangdong accounts for about 30 % of China &apos;s total foreign trade , while Hong Kong is China &apos;s international finance center . 
Officials in both Hong Kong and Guangdong are powerless to clean up their environmental problems on their own . 
In fact , development plans in China may be heading in the opposite direction . 
Political heavyweights in Guangdong still favor a form of development that relies on speed and quantity while ignoring overall environmental quality . 
And Hong Kong &apos;s economic blueprint also focuses on accelerating large infrastructure projects whose environmental impact has not been rigorously examined . 
It will not be easy for leaders on either side of the border to reverse gears , but there is still chance that people and companies can make a difference . 
Increasingly loud complaints about deteriorating air quality have goaded Hong Kong and Guangdong into embarking on a joint program in which a series of monitoring stations now provides emissions data . 
Hong Kong &apos;s data have been released regularly , and in 2006 , Guangdong &apos;s data were made publicly available for the first time . 
There is now also talk about monitoring water quality . 
These are laudable steps for China , given its poor record on transparency . 
Indeed , the joint air-monitoring network provides a foundation for the region to develop a sophisticated regional air management program . 
Furthermore , new coal-fired power plants may no longer be allowed on either side of the border , necessitating greater use of natural gas and renewable energy sources . 
The first challenge for authorities is to regulate power generation very differently . 
People are used to paying for the electricity that they actually use . 
But , to optimize efficiency , utilities need to be rewarded for what they help consumers save . 
In other words , utilities must be given incentives to help consumers use less power . 
This idea is clearly feasible . 
Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute has proposed what he calls the &quot; negawatt , &quot; or energy that is never used . 
All that is needed are the right financial incentives to induce utility companies to produce less electricity ( and still be more profitable ) and consumers to reduce their use ( and gain savings without sacrificing comfort ) . 
This can be done by refitting households with high-efficiency light bulbs and other technological improvements , and by retrofitting industrial plants with energy-saving technologies . 
Another innovative idea that Hong Kong and Guangdong are exploring is the &quot; P2E2 &quot; scheme . 
To help industries in the region upgrade environmentally , firms can now obtain special loans for which the Asian Development Bank assumes the risk - a program made possible by Hong Kong &apos;s sound banking practices . 
Another initiative worth watching is the Hong Kong stock exchange &apos;s exploratory project to offer a trading platform for emissions derivatives , which will most likely include conventional pollutants as well as carbon . 
The exchange will undertake a study this summer , with trading to begin as early as 2008 . 
If these reforms are not trumped by efforts to maintain high growth at all costs , the region could not only clean itself up while continuing to prosper , but could also establish a model for all of China . 
Nothing is more necessary in a country that , according to the United Nations Development Program , contains 16 of the world &apos;s 20 most polluted cities . 
Hong Kong &apos;s leaders to do not want to end up on that infamous list . 
By saving themselves , they may also be able to play an instrumental role in saving China .
