Running in Place 
SANTIAGO - A billionaire with a Harvard degree runs for President of Chile promising reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness , and wins . 
Once he takes office in 2010 , the economy recovers quickly from the global financial crisis , creates jobs , and continues growing until recently . 
The billionaire , never one to shy from publicity , claims the credit . 
Chile is a case of successful pro-market reform , argues Sebastián Piñera , who stepped down from the presidency on March 11 . 
He is wrong . 
The Chilean economy has expanded , and no one with his or her heart in the right place can fail to celebrate that ; but this growth has little to do with the former president &apos;s policies . 
Even worse , the expansion is proving to be unsustainable , and Chileans will soon feel the consequences of Piñera &apos;s failure to carry out the pro-growth reforms he once promised . 
Chile was hit hard by the 2008-2009 financial crisis : foreign loans vanished and the price of copper , Chile &apos;s main export , collapsed . 
But this time around , the Chilean economy was in shape to withstand massive external shocks . 
The government had been running surpluses , public debt was almost nil , and banks were well regulated . 
As a result , the government of President Michelle Bachelet ( who was in office from 2006 to 2010 and has just been sworn in for a second term ) was able to launch a potent anti-crisis fiscal stimulus , financed with resources saved from the earlier copper boom . 
The central bank , autonomous from political pressures and run by highly respected professionals , did its part by slashing interest rates . 
In Europe , the recession has lasted six years and counting ; in Chile , it lasted ten months . 
Tough regulation and record-low interest rates left companies and households with no debt overhang and little need to deleverage . 
By late 2009 , the Chilean economy was growing again , and in the years since , growth has been helped by highly propitious external conditions . 
Sky-high commodity prices , rock-bottom dollar interest rates , and ample international liquidity are what Chile hopes for in the rest of the world ; they are also precisely what Chile got since 2010 . 
Unsurprisingly , growth was swift - until late last year , when the combination of the US Federal Reserve &apos;s gradual exit from quantitative easing and lower commodity prices worldwide caused a swift deceleration in economic activity . 
After recording annual GDP growth of more than 5 % on average during the last four years , Chile &apos;s economy is expected to grow by 3.7 % or less in 2014 . 
Piñera blamed the incoming Bachelet administration , and its plan to raise taxes , for the drop in the growth rate . 
If so , Bachelet &apos;s economists are very influential indeed , because a similar slowdown has occurred all over Latin America and in emerging countries worldwide . 
The immediate cause of Chile &apos;s slowdown is the decline in investment , particularly in mining ; but the underlying problem is that the failure to diversify the economy sufficiently makes it far from clear what new kinds of investment , and which new exports , will take up the slack . 
The export basket of economically diversified countries like Thailand , Malaysia , Mexico , and Ireland is entirely different from what it was a generation ago . 
By contrast , Chile &apos;s export basket has remained unchanged . 
In 1984 , Chile exported copper and other minerals , paper and pulp , fruits and wine , fishmeal , and a smattering of light manufactures . 
Thirty years later , Chile &apos;s exports comprise the same items . 
Investment in energy would probably take off - if only Chile &apos;s institutions were modernized to make that possible . 
This is another area where Piñera &apos;s legacy is wanting . 
Chile is unique among its neighbors in having no oil or gas . 
Chileans today pay the highest electricity rates in the region , because generating capacity has failed to keep pace with rising demand . 
A prolonged dry spell could cause the lights to go off in the next few years . 
Ensuring both cheaper energy and a clean environment is a big challenge . 
Experts agree that it will require a national plan for locating generators across Chile &apos;s mountainous territory , a revamped regime for the transmission of power , more intensive use of natural gas , and a concerted effort to promote renewables , particularly wind and solar . 
Regrettably , Piñera took action in none of these areas . 
Employment policy was yet another shortcoming of his administration . 
With the post-2009 recovery came a drop in measured joblessness , which allowed the government to pay scant attention to a labor market that leaves out far too many women and young Chileans . 
There is broad consensus that Chile must change hiring and firing rules , allow unions to negotiate shifts and working hours , improve on- and off-the-job training , and make more information available to job-seekers . 
But these are all politically sensitive areas , where the smallest legal change can elicit howls of opposition . 
Piñera took the safe route of attempting no changes at all . 
And , of course , those young Chileans will have better prospects of getting a job if they come equipped with a first-rate education . 
Chile has succeeded in getting the young into the classroom ( enrollment rates are comparable to those in developed countries ) ; but it has had limited success at ensuring that the young - and particularly the children of low-income families - receive a high-quality education once they are there . 
Piñera &apos;s government became embroiled in a fight with protesting students over who should pay for university education . 
That controversy prevented most other changes in education from going forward . 
Bachelet has vowed to end this paralysis and make educational reform her administration &apos;s top priority . 
The goal is laudable , but achieving it will not be easy . 
Every year , Chile &apos;s finance ministry asks a group of independent experts how fast Chile can grow without triggering inflation or other imbalances . 
In 2008 , before Chile felt the consequences of the financial crisis , the average answer provided by those experts was 4.83 % . 
In 2013 , after three years of center-right government in Chile , the corresponding answer was ... 4.85 % . 
Under Piñera &apos;s government , pro-growth rhetoric was abundant .
