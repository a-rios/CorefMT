The End of Population Growth 
NEW DELHI - According to the United Nations &quot; Population Division , the world &apos;s human population hit seven billion on October 31 . 
As always happens whenever we approach such a milestone , this one has produced a spike in conferences , seminars , and learned articles , including the usual dire Malthusian predictions . 
After all , the UN forecasts that world population will rise to 9.3 billion in 2050 and surpass 10 billion by the end of this century . 
Such forecasts , however , misrepresent underlying demographic dynamics . 
The future we face is not one of too much population growth , but too little . 
Most countries conducted their national population census last year , and the data suggest that fertility rates are plunging in most of them . 
Birth rates have been low in developed countries for some time , but now they are falling rapidly in the majority of developing countries . 
Chinese , Russians , and Brazilians are no longer replacing themselves , while Indians are having far fewer children . 
Indeed , global fertility will fall to the replacement rate in a little more than a decade . 
Population may keep growing until mid-century , owing to rising longevity , but , reproductively speaking , our species should no longer be expanding . 
What demographers call the Total Fertility Rate is the average number of live births per woman over her lifetime . 
In the long run , a population is said to be stable if the TFR is at the replacement rate , which is a little above 2.3 for the world as a whole , and somewhat lower , at 2.1 , for developed countries , reflecting their lower infant-mortality rates . 
The TFR for most developed countries now stands well below replacement levels . 
The OECD average is at around 1.74 , but some countries , including Germany and Japan , produce less than 1.4 children per woman . 
However , the biggest TFR declines in recent years have been in developing countries . 
The TFR in China and India was 6.1 and 5.9 , respectively , in 1950 . 
It now stands at 1.8 in China , owing to the authorities &quot; aggressive one-child policy , while rapid urbanization and changing social attitudes have brought down India &apos;s TFR to 2.6 . 
An additional factor could depress future birth rates in China and India . 
The Chinese census suggests that there are 118.6 boys being born for every 100 girls . 
Similarly , India has a gender ratio at birth of around 110 boys for every 100 girls , with large regional variations . 
Compare this to the natural ratio of 105 boys per 100 girls . 
The deviation is usually attributed to a cultural preference for boys , which will take an additional toll on both populations , as the future scarcity of women implies that both countries &quot; effective reproductive capacity is below what is suggested by the unadjusted TFR . 
Indeed , after adjusting for the gender imbalance , China &apos;s Effective Fertility Rate ( EFR ) is around 1.5 , and India &apos;s is 2.45 . 
In other words , the Chinese are very far from replacing themselves , and the Indians are only slightly above the replacement rate . 
The EFR stands at around 2.4 for the world as a whole , barely above the replacement rate . 
Current trends suggest that the human race will no longer be replacing itself by the early 2020 &quot; s . 
Population growth after this will be mostly caused by people living longer , a factor that will diminish in significance from mid-century . 
These shifts have important implications for global labor supply . 
China is aging very rapidly , and its working-age population will begin to shrink within a few years . 
Relaxing the one-child policy might have some positive impact in the very long run , but China is already past the tipping point , pushed there by the combined effect of gender imbalance and a very skewed age structure . 
The number of women of child-bearing age ( 15-49 years ) in China will drop 8 % between 2010 and 2020 , another 10 % in the 2020 &quot; s and , if not corrected , at an even faster pace thereafter . 
Thus , China will have to withdraw an increasing proportion of its female workforce and deploy it for reproduction and childcare . 
Even if China can engineer this , it implies an immediate outflow from the workforce , with the benefits lagging by 25 years . 
Meanwhile , the labor force has peaked or is close to peaking in most major economies . 
Germany , Japan , and Russia already have declining workforces . 
The United States is one of a handful of advanced countries with a growing workforce , owing to its relative openness to immigration . 
But this may change as the source countries become richer and undergo rapid declines in birth rates . 
Thus , many developed countries will have to consider how to keep people working productively well into their seventies . 
India , the only large economy whose workforce will grow in sufficient scale over the next three decades , may partly balance the declines expected in other major economies . 
But , with birth rates declining there , too , current trends suggest that its population will probably stabilize at 1.55 billion in the early 2050 &quot; s , a full decade ahead of - and 170 million people below - the UN &apos;s forecast . 
Given this , it is likely that world population will peak at nine billion in the 2050 &quot; s , a half-century sooner than generally anticipated , followed by a sharp decline . 
One could argue that this is a good thing , in view of the planet &apos;s limited carrying capacity . 
But , when demographic dynamics turn , the world will have to confront a different set of problems .
