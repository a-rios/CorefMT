Russia &apos;s European Prospects 
MOSCOW - In 1966 , Charles de Gaulle &apos;s vision of a Europe &quot; that stretched from the Atlantic to the Urals &quot; was provocative . 
Today , Russian President Vladimir Putin has advanced an even more ambitious goal : &quot; a common market stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific . &quot; 
In the race toward globalization , the stakes are high for both Russia and Europe . 
If Russia continues on its current path toward becoming solely a raw-materials producer , it will not only become increasingly vulnerable to global energy-price fluctuations , but its scientific , cultural , and educational potential will decay further , eventually stripping the country of its global clout . 
If Europe , for its part , fails to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century , it will face chronic economic stagnation , rising social tension , and political instability . 
Indeed , as industrial production migrates to East Asia and innovation remains in North America , Europe risks losing its position in the most attractive international markets . 
As a result , the European project itself could be called into question . 
To avoid these outcomes , Russia and Europe must identify where their interests converge , and work to establish a mutually beneficial partnership in those areas . 
But , in order to foster such a partnership , they must first alter their negative perceptions of each other . 
Many Russians do not regard Europe as a political and economic partner , or even as an ally . 
In their view , Europe has already lost the battle for innovation and economic development , and is gradually becoming an &quot; industrial museum . &quot; 
Russia , they argue , should form partnerships with more dynamic countries . 
Likewise , many Europeans believe that , while a partnership with Russia might be an asset now , it would corrode Europe &apos;s economies and politics in the long run . 
If Europe wants to lead and prosper , according to this view , it should limit its ties with Russia as much as possible . 
Ongoing disputes between Russia and the European Union reflect this mutual distrust . 
Russians accuse Europeans of taking too long to liberalize visas , blocking Russian energy companies &quot; access to Europe &apos;s downstream markets , instigating anti-Russian sentiment in the post-Soviet era , and trying to interfere in Russia &apos;s domestic politics . 
Meanwhile , Europeans have serious reservations about Russia &apos;s human-rights record , legal system , failure to adhere to European values , and position on international crises , especially in the Middle East . 
As a result , the prospect of closer cooperation remains distant . 
Without a fundamental reset , relations between Russia and Europe will continue to decay , eventually becoming characterized by benign neglect . 
Despite their common geography , history , and economic interests , their strategic trajectories will diverge . 
An alternative scenario relies on the powerful unifying impact of human capital , the defining factor in the quest for global influence . 
Human capital - not natural resources , production capacity , or financial reserves - should constitute the foundation of Russian and European development policies . 
Cultivating human capital requires a supportive cultural environment , a well-developed educational system , and research and innovation centers . 
Many argue that , in both Russia and Europe , such social infrastructure has become so costly that it is hindering the development of a more efficient and dynamic economy . 
Only by dismantling the welfare state , critics contend , can progress be made . 
But curtailing social programs in both Europe and Russia would jeopardize human capital , their most valuable comparative advantage . 
By enhancing the welfare state &apos;s efficiency , economic progress can occur without sacrificing this crucial source of long-term growth . 
Given their strong traditions of building human capital - and their motivation to continue to do so - Russia and Europe have much to offer one another . 
By focusing on the areas in which their modernization agendas overlap - from education to public health to environmental protection - they can identify ways to increase their human capital &apos;s efficiency . 
While Europeans have reason to criticize Russia &apos;s shortcomings , they should also recognize that only two decades ago , Russia &apos;s political , economic , social , and legal systems underwent a fundamental shift , which significantly affected its people &apos;s psychology , self-perception , and behavior . 
Given Europeans &quot; complicated experience with European Union enlargement , they should understand the challenges that accompany such a profound change . 
With this understanding should come recognition that Europe &apos;s current policy of demanding that Russia &quot; mature &quot; as a condition for cooperation is counterproductive . 
Russia will mature much more slowly in isolation than it will if it is integrated into European institutions . 
Some progress has already been made . 
For example , participating in the Council of Europe has helped Russia to improve significantly its prison system . 
Likewise , launching initial public offerings on European stock exchanges has strengthened Russian corporations &quot; governance , social responsibility , and treatment of minority shareholders . 
In short , more interaction , not less , should be actively encouraged . 
Of course , Russia will probably not become a full NATO member in the foreseeable future , owing to the many structural , technical , and psychological obstacles blocking its path . 
But political integration is feasible . 
Greater political cooperation would provide a context for discussing issues like the future of Afghanistan , international terrorism , and nuclear proliferation , as well as for creating joint initiatives and strategies that address crucial issues affecting both powers . 
The institutional integration of Russia into greater Europe will require strong commitment from both sides . 
But , in this globalized century , it is the only option .
