APEC at the Apex 
BRISBANE - The significance of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Beijing consists not so much in what is on APEC &apos;s agenda as in what transpires on the sidelines . 
These bilateral relationships constitute much of the strategic undercurrent of East Asian security at a time when the region &apos;s long-term geostrategic stability has come into question . 
The core reality is that the Asia-Pacific region comprises a group of rapidly globalizing twenty-first-century economies sitting on top of a set of nineteenth-century national tensions . 
That contradiction matters for the entire world , because the region accounts for some 60 % of global output . 
Economically speaking , where Asia goes in the future , the world will follow . 
But Asia is home to a multiplicity of unresolved territorial disputes . 
It is the epicenter of underlying tensions stemming from China &apos;s rise and its impact on the United States , the region &apos;s established power since World War II &apos;s end . 
Indeed , many of the region &apos;s territorial disputes pit China against US allies . 
More broadly , the region &apos;s rifts are endemic : a divided Korean Peninsula ; territorial disputes between Russia and Japan , China and Korea , and China and Japan ; the unique circumstances of Taiwan ; and conflicting maritime claims in the South China Sea involving China , the Philippines , Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia , Vietnam , and Taiwan . 
There are also long-standing border disputes between China and India , and between India and China &apos;s ally , Pakistan . 
As if that were not worrying enough , Asia has become the next global arms bazaar , with military outlays in the region now higher than in Europe . 
Moreover , six Asian states have nuclear weapons . 
Both the tone and the content of the China-US relationship are a cause for concern . 
China argues that it is subject to a US policy of isolation and containment . 
The Chinese also see the commercial equivalent of containment in the US-proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership , which includes Japan but excludes China . 
Furthermore , Chinese leaders point to what they regards as intrusive US human-rights diplomacy aimed at fomenting political protest within China ( including Hong Kong ) and undermining the regime &apos;s domestic legitimacy . 
The US , no surprise , disputes these claims . 
For starters , the US argues that it is the various states of East Asia that have actively sought American support for their security , owing to their collective concerns about China . 
Moreover , the US insists that it is not containing China ( as it did the Soviet Union ) ; on the contrary , China &apos;s economic rise has been facilitated by access to US markets , as well as to global markets through American support for Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization . 
On human rights , the US argues that there are indeed fundamental differences between the two countries &quot; political traditions and current systems . 
For these reasons , the bilateral strategic-trust deficit is growing . 
Xi , to his credit , has advanced what he describes as a concept for &quot; a new type of great power relationship , &quot; one that seeks to avoid what others have concluded is the near-inevitability of long-term conflict between a rising power ( China ) and the established power ( America ) . 
It is imperative that both parties try to close the trust deficit . 
Such a framework embraces realism about areas of contention defined by significant conflicting national interests and values . 
These issues should simply be peacefully managed over time , until sufficient political capital has been created in the rest of the relationship to address them directly . 
At the same time , it is &quot; constructive &quot; in the sense of identifying areas of sufficient commonality to create new public goods , such as bilateral investment treaties , a non-nuclear Korean Peninsula , and a global agreement on climate change . 
A constructive realist approach should also begin to sketch the broad outlines of a long-term &quot; common security &quot; concept for East Asia . 
The outlook for the China-Japan relationship appears somewhat better . 
Just a few months ago , the bilateral relationship had sunk to an all-time post-war low , owing to a toxic cocktail of territorial disputes over the Diaoyu / Senkaku Islands , Japan &apos;s handling of its wartime history ( particularly prime ministerial visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine ) , and Chinese fears about Japanese rearmament . 
But now both governments appear to have recognized the growing risk of unintended conflict in the seas and airspace around the disputed territories , given the sheer concentration of naval and air assets in a limited space and the absence of effective protocols to manage incidents and prevent them from escalating . 
Both sides have concluded that even limited armed conflict would be disastrous . 
Moreover , with Japan and China facing increasing economic uncertainty , they have recognized that it makes sense for the world &apos;s second and third largest economies to remove major political impediments to expanded bilateral trade and investment . 
For these reasons , barring any last-minute diplomatic indelicacies , the APEC Summit is likely to represent the start of a formal thaw in Sino-Japanese relations . 
APEC , an Australian diplomatic initiative launched 25 years ago , was originally conceived as an exclusively economic forum . 
Fortunately , it has also become an annual forum for US , Chinese , Japanese , and other leaders to engage with one another on critical questions of long-term strategic stability . 
The future of the region &apos;s economy and the global economy - and the stability upon which they are predicated - will be powerfully shaped by the outcome of these deliberations .
