Eyesight for Israel &apos;s Blind 
PARIS - To find a glimmer of hope on the Israel-Palestine question has become difficult , if not impossible . 
Most Israelis now believe that a peaceful solution will not come in their generation . 
As for the Palestinians , the political stalemate , and ongoing Israeli occupation , has led to radicalization : if they cannot have &quot; something , &quot; they want it all . 
And many believe that whatever their weakness today , time is on the Palestinians &quot; side . 
Even the most moderate Palestinians now reject Israeli leftists &quot; offers of help in terms of human support against the actions of Israeli settlers or police . 
The political dialogue between moderates of both camps is mostly dead , and personal contact has become minimal . 
In the streets of Jerusalem , Israelis and Palestinians give the impression of deliberately trying not to see each other . 
Moreover , as Israel increasingly resembles a successful developed country , its Jewish citizens tend to ignore its Arab citizens , just as the rich elsewhere often do not see the poor in their midst . 
But , unlike the poor in many emerging and developed countries , who can hope for social mobility , Israeli Arabs are second-class citizens , even if their living standards remain higher than those of most Arabs in the region . 
As we know from Deuteronomy , &quot; Man does not live by bread alone . &quot; 
This distrustful ignorance of the other can be found everywhere in Israel . 
Or almost everywhere , for there is a place that escapes this reality : the hospital . 
Because of an urgent eye problem upon my arrival in Israel in late June , I had to spend seven hours in the ophthalmology department of the Hadassah Hospital in Ein Kerem , which is the main center of treatment , teaching , and research in Jerusalem . 
What I saw during those hours were , despite my personal condition , the most comforting and hopeful signs that I have encountered in the entire region in many years . 
Arab citizens of Israel - that is , Palestinian doctors and nurses - were treating Jewish and Arab patients . 
Israeli doctors and nurses attended to Arabs &quot; needs . 
I even saw some interaction among patients themselves . 
Old Israelis who had clearly come from Eastern Europe before World War II were playing with very young Palestinian children . 
There was an atmosphere of reassuring tolerance of the other . 
In the highly professional , well-organized , and yet very relaxed ( if not slightly confused ) atmosphere of the hospital , one could glimpse what the future might hold with different political leadership on both sides . 
It was as if the ill were behaving in a healthy way , whereas , outside of the hospital , the healthy were behaving pathologically . 
In the hospital , patients &quot; only choice was to place themselves in the hands of the other . 
What I encountered that day in Ein Kerem was the best of Israel - and a direct rebuttal to the frequent accusation that Israel is an &quot; apartheid state . &quot; 
And it was fitting that this token of a possible future should be found in an ophthalmology department , an enterprise devoted to restoring vision . 
Arab citizens of Israel and Jewish citizens of Israel interact with each other as equals when they are placed in a situation in which they can and must . 
Might all Israelis and Palestinians find themselves in such a position one day ? 
I am not na√Øve . 
I understand that what I saw that day ( with one eye ) in the Hadassah Hospital cannot easily be replicated elsewhere . 
Two days after my hospital experience , a tour of the Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem - surrounded or divided by the security wall - served as a reminder of the region &apos;s harsh and sobering realities . 
But the lessons from the Hadassah Hospital remain alive in my heart as much as my head . 
When people have no other choice but to trust each other , they will be able to do so and feel better for it . 
It is a question of balance , competence , and respect . 
Can the reality of the hospital be transferred to the reality outside ? 
Probably not . 
But that should not prevent people from reflecting on what a different world could look like one day - or from working to bring about that world now .
