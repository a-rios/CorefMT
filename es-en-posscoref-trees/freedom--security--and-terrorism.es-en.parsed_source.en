Freedom , Security , and Terrorism 
America currently finds itself in the midst of a confused search for a central principle around which to organize its foreign and defense policies . 
For almost a half-century , until the collapse of the Soviet system in the early 1990 &apos;s , containing communism was the core doctrine guiding US national security policies . 
The &quot; war on terrorism &quot; has come to serve as a handy substitute . 
But it fails to provide a solid ( or particularly admirable ) foundation upon which to base America &apos;s role in the world in the 21 st century . 
The search for a new grand strategy , or at the very least a new organizing principle , is confounded by the revolutionary times in which we live - an unprecedented era of several simultaneous revolutions , all of which are epic and historic . 
Globalization is internationalizing markets , finance , and commerce , while the information revolution is changing the way we work , learn , and communicate . 
Both revolutions are benefiting the developed , Western world but further dividing the &quot; haves &quot; from the &quot; have-nots , &quot; in this case those without finished products , services , or resources to trade or without access to new technologies . 
They are also contributing to a third revolution , the erosion of the sovereignty - and thus the authority - of the nation state . 
The failure of states , especially those artificially constructed by great powers after wars or cobbled together by older colonial powers , is becoming a serious international issue and promises to remain so . 
As the authority of the state erodes , the fourth , and potentially most dangerous , revolution emerges : the transformation of war and the changing nature of conflict . 
This is the revolution that arrived at America &apos;s doorstep on September 11 , 2001 . 
There were , of course , many warnings . 
The first attack on the World Trade Center itself occurred in 1993 . 
Then came the bombings of the US barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996 , the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , and the USS Cole in 2000 . 
On September 15 , 1999 , the US Commission on National Security for the 21 st Century issued a report entitled &quot; New World Coming . &quot; 
Its first conclusion was that : &quot; The United States will be attacked by terrorists using weapons of mass destruction , and Americans will lose their lives on American soil , possibly in large numbers . &quot; 
The same Commission , on which I served , urged the new President , George W. Bush , on January 31 , 2001 , to prepare the nation for these attacks by consolidating dispersed federal government agencies into a new national homeland security agency . 
Our warnings and recommendations were not heeded . 
Three thousand people died in the first terrorist attack in America in the new century . 
Everyone agrees that others will follow . 
Many experts believe that , two years later , the US has still not begun to take the urgent steps necessary to defend itself against further attacks . 
Even the tradeoff of liberty and security has been little discussed relative to its importance . 
This is probably because most of those inconvenienced by preliminary counter-terrorism measures in the US are Arab-Americans , while the broader American community has not been bothered . 
But the US is , and prides itself on being , an advanced liberal democracy where individual liberties are guaranteed by a written constitution and bill of rights , and whose freedoms are protected by an independent judiciary established as an equal third branch of government . 
America &apos;s legal community , and some in the wider society , are beginning to awake to the complex issues confronting the US as it seeks to protect itself from outside attacks for the first time since 1812 . 
Should the national government be able to monitor the computer and telephonic communications of citizens and residents ? 
Should suspects be placed under surveillance because they belong to a particular religious or ethnic community ? 
Should due process - including habeas corpus , the right to counsel , and the right to trial by jury - be suspended for &quot; enemy combatants &quot; or others who are simply suspects ? 
These and other questions go to the very nature of democracy and the values of the American Republic . 
They will not become any easier to answer over time . 
Indeed , they threaten to become much more frequent and troubling . 
One of the great issues for democratic societies in the New World of the early 21 st century is achieving a proper balance between security and liberty . 
Err too far on the side of liberty and the society is open to attack . 
But creating a high-security state hands terrorists a victory by choking democratic freedom . 
Policymakers with the wisdom of Solomon , of whom there are precious few , are required . 
In this search for the right balance , democracy knows no boundaries . 
The US might learn from the experience of other nations and share its experience with them . 
Freedom belongs to no particular nation or system . 
It is a universal good that all must seek . 
Whether threatened by fascism , communism , terrorism , or any other form of fanaticism , freedom must defend itself in ways that do not become self-destructive . 
In this age of profound and multiple revolutions , perhaps the greatest revolution will involve the invention of new ways to make democratic freedoms survive and flourish .
