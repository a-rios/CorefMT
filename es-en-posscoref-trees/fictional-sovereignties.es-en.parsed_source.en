Fictional Sovereignties 
LONDON - A year ago , tiny Georgia tried to regain control over its breakaway enclave of South Ossetia . 
The Russians quickly expelled the Georgian army , to almost universal opprobrium from the West . 
South Ossetia , together with Abkhazia ( combined population 300,000 ) , promptly declared their &quot; independence , &quot; creating two new fictional sovereignties , and acquiring in the process all the official trappings of statehood : national heroes , colorful uniforms , anthems , flags , frontier posts , military forces , presidents , parliaments , and , most important , new opportunities for smuggling and corruption . 
So far , only Russia and Nicaragua recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
Russian recognition was widely seen as retaliation for Western recognition of Kosovo ( population two million ) , the breakaway province of Serbia , earlier last year . 
A thousand miles to the west of Georgia is Moldova ( population 3.5 million ) , which lies between Romania and Ukraine . 
Annexed by Tsarist Russia in 1812 , joined to Romania in 1918 , and re-annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 , it seized its independence from Moscow in 1991 . 
It is a member of the United Nations , the Council of Europe , the World Trade Organization , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , and various other prestigious international bodies . 
Moldova &apos;s main claim to fame is King Stephen the Great , who defeated the Ottomans in a great fifteenth century battle . 
It also produces rather good wine . 
An enduring memory from my own recent visit to its capital Chisinau is the election poster of a local politician called Lupu , who holds a pair of spectacles to his eyes , whether to suggest visions or wisdom isn &apos;t clear . 
To get to Moldova from Odessa ( now in Ukraine ) one must drive through the self-proclaimed &quot; republic &quot; of Transdniestria ( population 700,000 ) , a sliver of land on the north shore of the Dniester river . 
A clump of peeling buildings , rusting wire , and a filthy lavatory mark the start of Transdniestrian sovereignty . 
Progress through this squalid , but well manned , frontier post involved the stamping of lots of documents and a liberal scattering of bribes , a process repeated on leaving the &quot; republic . &quot; 
A shadowy mafia-style company , Sheriff , owns most of the economy . 
It is said to have close links to the president and his family . 
It has built a giant football stadium in the capital , Tiraspol , which seems to be some kind of symbol of Transdniestrian virility . 
Unrecognized by the rest of the world , Transdniestrian &quot; independence &quot; is secured by a Russian garrison . 
The world &apos;s population is about six billion . 
Suppose it was divided into independent political units of two million people each . 
That would mean 3,000 micro-states , each refusing to accept any sovereignty superior to its own . 
Of course , this would be a recipe for global anarchy . 
Yet the trend over the past century has been towards a continuous increase in the number of small states , mainly owing to nationalist revolts against multi-national empires : the latest bout of state creation followed the disintegration of the USSR . 
Even long-established states like the United Kingdom now have strong separatist movements . 
In its political life , the world has been regressing to a form of tribalism , even as its economic life has become increasingly globalized . 
The equation of state with nation is the arch-heresy of our time . 
A &quot; nation &quot; is , at root , an ethno-linguistic - occasionally religious - entity , and because it is through language and liturgy that culture is transmitted , each nation will have its own distinctive cultural history , available for use and misuse , invention and discovery . 
The state , however , is a political construction , designed to keep the peace in an economically viable territory . 
There are simply too many &quot; nations , &quot; actual or potential , to form the basis of a world system of states , not least because so many of them , having been jumbled up for centuries , cannot now be disentangled . 
Micro-states can never be made small enough to satisfy their advocates &quot; exalted standards of cultural integrity . 
So the unraveling of multi-national states is a false path . 
The way forward lies in democratic forms of federalism , which can preserve sufficient central authority for the purposes of statehood , while respecting local and regional cultures . 
Today &apos;s upsurge of micro-nationalism is not just a consequence of the revolt against empires : it is also a revolt against globalization . 
There is widespread resistance to the idea that the chief function of modern states is to slot their peoples into a global market dominated by the imperatives of efficiency and cheapness , heedless of the damage to non-economic activities . 
This feeling is strengthened when the global economy turns out to be a global casino . 
National assertion is a way of combating impersonal forces and remote authorities . 
Globalization promises too much in terms of welfare gains , particularly to developing countries , to be abandoned . 
But the lesson from the current crisis is that we will have to develop styles of global economic governance to manage , regulate , and mitigate the creative , but often disruptive forces unleashed by the global market . 
In the absence of an actual world government , this can be done only through cooperation among states . 
The fewer &quot; sovereigns &quot; there are , the easier it will be to secure the necessary cooperation . 
The Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 , which laid the institutional foundation for the post-war World War II economy , was made possible because the United States and Britain called the shots . 
When objections were raised to Cuba being put on the drafting committee , Harry Dexter White , the American representative , remarked that Cuba &apos;s function was to provide cigars . 
Such a cavalier attitude to the demands of lesser powers to be heard is no longer possible . 
Provided we do not deceive ourselves about where real power lies , let presidents and parliaments be three a penny if that is what makes people feel good about themselves .
