Abenomics and Asia SEOUL - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s economic agenda - dubbed &quot; Abenomics &quot; - seems to be working for his country . 
Expansionary monetary policy is expected to inject liquidity into the Japanese economy until inflation hits the Bank of Japan &apos;s 2 % target , while expansionary fiscal policy is expected to continue until economic recovery takes hold . 
As a result , consumer and investor confidence is returning . 
The Japanese stock market has soared more than 40 % since November of last year , when it became clear that Abe would form the next government , and exports and growth are also picking up . 
With a large output gap and low inflationary pressure , expansionary policies show great potential for reviving economic activity . 
But other countries - including neighboring Asian economies - fear that Japan is devaluing the yen to bolster exports and growth at their expense . 
Some have accused Japan of fueling a global &quot; currency war . &quot; 
Anticipation of aggressive monetary expansion has sharply weakened the yen , which has fallen by almost 20 % against the dollar in just over four months . 
Of course , Japan &apos;s escape from its 15-year deflationary trap and two decades of economic stagnation would be good for the world . 
Japan remains the world &apos;s third-largest economy , the fourth-largest trader , and the third-largest export market for neighboring China and South Korea , which thus stand to benefit if &quot; Abenomics &quot; revitalizes Japanese domestic demand . 
More broadly , given Europe &apos;s slide into recession and only a slow rise in world trade volume , renewed growth and stronger import demand in Japan would support global recovery . 
The question now is whether Abenomics can achieve its goals without destabilizing the world economy , especially neighboring Asian economies . 
Doing so requires Japanese policymakers to focus on more sustainable growth while averting a vicious cycle of competitive devaluation and protectionism with Japan &apos;s trade partners . 
In particular , expansionary monetary and fiscal policies - which are helpful in the short term - must be accompanied by fundamental structural reforms . 
Japan &apos;s deflation and economic stagnation over the last two decades stemmed largely from a dysfunctional financial system and a lack of private demand . 
The collapse of asset bubbles in the 1990 &quot; s left Japan &apos;s financial system and private sector saddled with a huge debt overhang . 
Recovery began only after the balance-sheet weaknesses in the financial , household , and corporate sectors were addressed . 
Sustainable growth requires sustained private-sector demand . 
Monetary easing and fiscal stimulus , combined with structural measures to restore private firms to financial health , would stimulate household expenditure and business investment . 
Indeed , the impact of real exchange-rate depreciation on growth is likely to be short-lived unless increased corporate profits in the export sector lead to higher household consumption and investment . 
And yet risks to financial and fiscal stability could arise if higher inflation and currency depreciation were to spoil investors &quot; appetite for Japanese government bonds , thereby pushing up nominal interest rates . 
That is why the success of &quot; Abenomics &quot; hinges not on the short-term stimulus provided by aggressive monetary expansion and fiscal policies , but on a program of structural reform that increases competition and innovation , and that combats the adverse effects of an aging population . 
Japan , of course , is not alone in using exchange-rate policies to keep exports competitive . 
Many emerging economies &quot; authorities intervene in currency markets to prevent exchange-rate appreciation and a loss of export competitiveness . 
But if Japan starts to intervene directly in global currency markets to ensure a weaker yen , neighboring competitors will respond in kind . 
The danger of a currency war and protectionism should not be underestimated . 
In South Korea , the government and business leaders worry that a stronger won , which recently rose to its highest level against the yen since August 2011 , will hurt key export sectors , including automobiles , machinery , and electronics . 
One report by a Korean research institute shows that the Korean economy will slip into recession if the yen-dollar exchange rate nears 118 , its average level back in 2007 . 
Moreover , unlimited quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan , the Federal Reserve , and the European Central Bank also increases the risk of volatile capital flows and asset bubbles in Asian emerging economies . 
Chinese policymakers have raised serious concerns about the growing risks of inflation and property bubbles . 
This delicate situation could escalate into further currency intervention , trade protectionism , and capital controls . 
Beggar-thy-neighbor policies could lower total trade volume - a zero-sum game from which no one would benefit . 
After all , Japanese exports rely on emerging and developing markets , with East Asia alone accounting for nearly half of Japan &apos;s foreign sales . 
The regional economy would benefit from closer coordination of exchange-rate and monetary policies . 
Mechanisms like the G-20 and ASEAN + 3 ( ASEAN , with China , Japan , and South Korea ) should be used more actively for policy dialogue and surveillance . 
East Asian economies could then , over time , cooperate to enhance regional exchange-rate stability , thereby creating a more conducive environment for intra-regional trade . 
Japan &apos;s economy is moving at last , which bodes well for Asia and the world . 
But , despite its new vigor , the benefits of recovery could prove to be short-lived unless a sustainable and cooperative growth path is found .
