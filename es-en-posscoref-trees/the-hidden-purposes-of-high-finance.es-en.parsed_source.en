The Hidden Purposes of High Finance 
BERKELEY - No one questions the usefulness of &quot; low &quot; finance : the ability to use checks , banknotes , and credit cards rather than having to cart around chests of silver , scales , and reagents to assay purity , and needing armed guards to protect the silver - and more guards to watch the first set of guards - has obvious efficiencies . 
But what use is &quot; high &quot; finance ? 
Economists &quot; conventional description depicts high finance as providing us with three types of utility . 
First , it allows for many savers to pool their wealth to finance large enterprises that can achieve the efficiencies of scale possible from capital-intensive modern industry . 
Second , high finance provides an arena to curb the worst abuses by managers of large corporations . 
Shareholder democracy simply does not work , but managers &quot; fear that if the stock price drops too low they will be out on their ears provides a useful restraint . 
Finally , high finance allows for portfolio diversification , so that individual investors can seek high expected returns without being forced to assume large , idiosyncratic risks of bankruptcy and poverty . 
But these are the benefits of high finance as they apply to the ideal world of economists - that is , a world of rational utilitarian actors who are skilled calculators of expected utility under uncertainty , who are masters of dynamic programming , and who breathe stochastic calculus in their daily life . 
We do not live in such a world . 
Economists have spent their lives attempting to evolve theories that would account for how salient features of reality might emerge if we did live in their ideal world , but since we don &apos;t , their theoretical enterprise is of doubtful utility . 
It is like describing how one could bake a delicious wedding cake using only honey , bicarbonate of soda , and raw eggplant . 
If we take the world as it really is , we quickly see that high finance performs two further tasks that advance our collective economic welfare . 
It induces us to save , accumulate , and invest by promising us safe and liquid investments even in extraordinary times . 
It also induces us to save and invest as a prerequisite to indulging our love of gambling , and as a byproduct of it . 
It is a fact that we are much happier saving and accumulating , and that we are much more likely to do so when we think that the resources we have saved and accumulated are at hand . 
It is also true that when we invest our wealth - in Pfizer &apos;s intellectual property , factories in Shenzhen , worldwide distribution networks , or shopping malls in Atlanta - it is not , in fact , at hand . 
Our invested wealth can only be made to appear liquid to any one of us , and only if there is no general shift in our collective desire for liquidity . 
And it is also a fact that we are happier saving and accumulating if we receive positive and negative feedback on our decisions on a time scale that allows us to believe that we can do better next time by altering our strategy - hence marketwatch.com and CNN / Money . 
Of course investors who believe that their wealth is securely liquid , and that they are adding value for themselves by buying and selling are suffering from a delusion . 
Our financial wealth is not liquid in an emergency . 
But we benefit from these delusions . 
Psychologically , we are naturally impatient , so it is good for us to believe that our wealth is safe and secure , and that we can add to it through skillful acts of investment , because that delusion makes us behave less impatiently . 
Seventy-three years ago , John Maynard Keynes thought about the reform and regulation of financial markets from the perspective of the first three purposes and found himself &quot; moved toward ... mak &#91; ing &#93; the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble , like marriage ... &quot; 
But he immediately drew back : the fact &quot; that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is &quot; liquid &quot; ( though this cannot be true for all investors collectively ) calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk ... &quot; 
Moreover , for Keynes , &quot; &#91; t &#93; he game of professional investment is intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct ; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll ... &quot; 
It is for these reasons that we have seemed frozen for the past generation or two whenever we have contemplated reforming our system of financial regulation .
