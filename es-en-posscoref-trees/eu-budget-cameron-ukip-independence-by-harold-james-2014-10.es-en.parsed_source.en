Britain &apos;s Last EU Straw ? 
LONDON - Is £ 1.7 billion ( $ 2.7 billion ) a lot of money for the British government to fork out ? 
It is when it is a European Union budget demand that comes out of the blue . 
But the impact of the EU &apos;s unexpected budget invoice is not just financial , for it has arrived at a time when the anti-EU , United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) is riding high in opinion polls . 
The episode reveals the arbitrary nature of EU budget setting , which puts the EU itself in a bad light - and could be the last straw for Britain &apos;s EU membership . 
The bill originates from a statistical recalculation by Eurostat , the EU statistical office , of the UK &apos;s economic performance over the past 20 years . 
The longer-terms costs , however , could be much greater than the relatively small amount ( 0.1 % of GDP ) involved . 
The political crisis - which originated with the calculation of national budget surcharges and rebates from the EU budget - stems from an institutional arbitrariness that seems unjust and fosters immense resentment . 
Like friendships or marriages that break down over seemingly trivial issues that in fact signify fundamental problems , this budget crisis has highlighted a serious flaw in the UK-EU relationship . 
The new financial demand surprised UK Prime Minister David Cameron , who called it &quot; completely unacceptable . &quot; 
For many Euroskeptics , this was yet another sign of a conspiracy by the European Commission against Britain . 
Referring to a children &apos;s murder-detective board game , Cameron declared : &quot; You don &apos;t need a Cluedo set to know that someone has been clubbed with the lead piping in the library . &quot; 
A better comparison might have been with the &quot; Chance &quot; cards in Monopoly , the Great Depression-era board game that highlighted the random injustice of capitalism . 
The timing of the spat could not be better for Britain &apos;s EU opponents . 
UKIP could conceivably hold the balance of power following next May &apos;s general election , and force the government to hold its promised &quot; in-out &quot; referendum on EU membership . 
Under electoral pressure , Britain &apos;s two main parties - Conservatives and Labour - are already advocating limits on immigration that are incompatible with EU law and the core principles of European integration . 
The emotional escalation may lead many people , on both sides of the English Channel , to conclude that the UK and the EU would each be better off without the other . 
Pre-existing tensions have inevitably played a large part in the current flare-up . 
But is the EU &apos;s budget calculation method also at fault ? 
It is rational for a country &apos;s EU budget contribution to reflect its real level of economic activity . 
In any case , the total EU budget , at around 1 % of EU output , is relatively small , and has not changed for more than 30 years . 
The recalculation simply attempts to achieve a more accurate picture of the EU economy , correcting for activity not officially measured in national accounts , such as charity , drugs , and prostitution . 
Moreover , Britain was not the only EU member to fall foul of the recalculation . 
Italy &apos;s economic performance also looked better than previously assumed , necessitating an additional payment . 
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi duly joined the chorus of outrage , calling the recalculation a &quot; lethal weapon . &quot; 
To be sure , it is fundamentally sensible for governments to monitor and tax as much domestic economic activity as possible . 
An external assessment that attempts to account for the whole of the economy - and calculates the budget contribution on this basis - should increase tax efficiency . 
Poor taxation capacity has , after all , been an endemic problem in southern Europe , including in Italy ( and especially in Greece ) , while France and Germany , which both received large rebates , are better tax collectors . 
Italy , like Greece , has been trying to broaden its tax base . 
Aerial surveys now detect garden swimming pools ; tax assessors investigate yachts moored in harbors ; and no transactions above € 1,000 ( $ 1,268 ) may be made in cash . 
Yet why should the EU &apos;s budget calculations place such importance on national accounts , which constitute a set of arbitrary conventions ? 
If , for example , wages were paid for housework , GDP would increase without any more activity taking place . 
In a rational world , EU budget contributions would not be arbitrarily set , but would be automatically determined , say , as a fixed proportion of value-added tax ( VAT ) receipts . 
Only a relatively small share would be needed , requiring no periodic recalculations . 
Assessing , and then reassessing , members &quot; dues in the current way damages the EU . 
Taken to its logical extreme , member countries would demand recalculations to reflect the different ways they measure income and wealth , thereby pitting potential beneficiary countries against contributors . 
Such a fiscal set-up has already threatened to break up member states - consider Scotland or Catalonia . 
If the EU is seen as being little more than a treasure chest that allots fiscal resources to its members , it is bound to fail . 
As geopolitical challenges mount , and Europe faces its first systemic security threat since the end of the Cold War , the stakes could not be higher . 
Europe cannot get bogged down in what should be a simple bureaucratic process . 
Rather , the EU must be able to explain what it truly represents , and these ideals must be reflected in actions that are clear , predictable , and non-arbitrary .
