British Banks &quot; Comedy of Terrors 
WASHINGTON , DC - The devil is always in the details . 
And the greatest devils of our economic age lurk in the details of how officials regard the capital - the equity funding - of our largest banks . 
Government officials have identified far too closely with the distorted , self-interested worldview of global banking executives . 
The result is great peril for the rest of us . 
In this surreal world , the United Kingdom takes on disproportionate influence , because London is still a top financial center - and because the biggest banks in the United States and Europe have proved very effective at playing off American and British regulators against one another . 
Opinion leaders around the world look to the British for a clever and nuanced approach to financial-sector policy . 
Unfortunately , they currently look in vain . 
To understand the precise problem , you must dip into the latest details of the Prudential Regulatory Authority &apos;s &quot; capital shortfall exercise &quot; with eight major UK banks . 
I won &apos;t pretend that the PRA &apos;s work is easy reading for a layperson ; but anyone who spends a little time with the documents will first laugh and then cry . 
With great fanfare ( and generally favorable press coverage ) , the PRA announced that some banks do not have enough loss-absorbing capital - relative to target levels of equity that are ludicrously low . 
The Bank of England &apos;s Financial Policy Committee ( FPC ) said that the target should be 7 % of risk-weighted assets under Basel III definitions . 
And , in the PRA &apos;s presentation , this amounts to a leverage ratio of around 3 % for most of these banks ( again using Basel III definitions ) , though a couple of banks will need an additional adjustment to reach that level . 
In plain English , a supposedly well-capitalized bank in the UK can have 97 cents of debt per one dollar of assets ( and just three cents of equity ) . 
Such a low loss-absorption capacity would get you run out of town in the US , where regulators are weighing a 5-6 % leverage ratio ( twice as much equity on a non-risk-weighted basis ) , and some responsible officials are still pushing for 10 % or higher . 
So much for the laughs . 
The tragedy in the PRA &apos;s exercise is British officials &quot; apparent belief that they are carrying out real reform , rather than setting the stage for serious trouble . 
To be fair , some of what the PRA did makes sense - including adjusting risk weights and taking into consideration losses from &quot; future conduct costs &quot; ( translation : penalties for breaking the law will be substantial ) . 
And the treatment of investments by banks in insurance companies is sensible relative to the alternatives . 
But the potential for more tears for taxpayers - still reeling from the cost of rescuing the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) - looms large . 
The invitation to banks to game the risk-weighting system further is stated plainly : &quot; In line with the FPC recommendation , the PRA has accepted restructuring actions which , by reducing risk-weighted assets , will credibly deliver improvements in capital adequacy . &quot; 
In other words , the banks can change how they calculate risk - for example , by tweaking their own models - in ways that will make them look better as far as regulators are concerned . 
The British authorities believe that they are building a resilient global financial center that is capable of assuming big risks and withstanding large shocks - either home-grown or transmitted from abroad ( that is , from the eurozone ) . 
But even HSBC , the best capitalized of the lot , has a leverage ratio of only 4.6 % , while Barclays &quot; ratio is under 3 % . 
In a deeply unstable world , these are paper-thin cushions against losses . 
The margin for macroeconomic , prudential , and operating error is similarly small . 
The British - and the rest of us - have made many such errors in the last decade . 
At risk is everyone who has a job in the UK , as well as all financial institutions that have significant operations there - including a huge proportion of all global banks . 
The idea that the British set any kind of standard for bank conduct was exploded by last year &apos;s Libor scandal , while the fiasco at RBS destroyed the notion that UK officials know how to handle a failing bank . 
And now the PRA has confirmed that the British authorities do not even have a firm grip on the basics of regulating capital - that is , determining how much equity is safe for large complex global financial institutions . 
British officials - and those elsewhere - should take a day off and read Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig &apos;s book , The Bankers &quot; New Clothes : What &apos;s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About It , an inspired &quot; how to &quot; guide for thinking about why we need more equity in our financial system . 
Then they should come back to work and do their job properly , by phasing in much higher capital requirements in a responsible manner .
