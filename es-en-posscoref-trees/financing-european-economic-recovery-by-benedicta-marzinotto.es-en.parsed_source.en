Europe &apos;s Dysfunctional Growth Compact 
BRUSSELS - Recently , a € 10 billion ( $ 13 billion ) shortfall in this year &apos;s European Union budget came to light . 
As a result , the EU cannot reimburse member states for recent unexpected expenditures , including emergency outlays , such as aid to Italian earthquake victims , and spending aimed at boosting economic growth and employment , such as the accelerated absorption of unused Structural and Cohesion Funds . 
Member states have refused the European Commission &apos;s request for extra contributions to cover the shortfall , causing talks over next year &apos;s budget to collapse . 
Meanwhile , negotiations over the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) , the central-planning instrument for the use of EU funds , have broken down , owing to disagreement over key issues , including the size of the budget and the composition of expenditure . 
The decision has been postponed until early next year . 
The situation has highlighted the ambiguity surrounding the EU budget &apos;s role in European integration . 
While all EU leaders have advocated using the budget to stimulate economic growth , little action is being taken . 
This raises doubts about the so-called &quot; growth compact &quot; launched by the European Council in June , particularly about the political commitment to mobilize € 120 billion quickly by reallocating unused Structural and Cohesion Funds and increasing the European Investment Bank &apos;s lending capacity . 
Indeed , although European governments have agreed to encourage faster absorption of EU funds in crisis countries , they have refused to pay into the EU budget to enable the funds &quot; disbursement . 
This contradiction signals that national interests continue to prevail in EU budget negotiations , which are often exploited for domestic political gain in member states . 
Unless a mechanism is introduced that facilitates the rapid disbursement of EU funds , thus insulating the budget from destructive politicization , these funds cannot be used to stimulate growth in times of crisis . 
Not all member states contribute equally to the EU budget ; some are net contributors , while others are net beneficiaries . 
At the end of EU-financed investment projects - payments for which are agreed and executed in the annual budget framework - the money is transferred to the beneficiary . 
Cash to net beneficiaries is paid in by net contributors . 
One country &apos;s inflow of EU money is thus another country &apos;s outflow - and these are grants , not loans . 
As a result , agreement every seven years on overall expenditures is inadequate to preclude conflict on annual budgets . 
Nonetheless , steps can be taken to prevent political deadlock in budget negotiations , while increasing the budget &apos;s flexibility so that it can be used to stimulate growth . 
For example , some leveraging of the budget could be allowed , although this would spark controversy , given that EU treaties require that the budget remains balanced at all times . 
But the EU budget has already enabled an indirect form of leveraging : the European Commission &apos;s use of implicit budget guarantees to raise capital on financial markets . 
These funds are used to provide financial assistance to non-eurozone EU countries through the Medium-Term Financial Assistance Facility , to eurozone countries through the now-expired European Financial Stabilization Mechanism , and to partner third countries . 
Between the MTFA , the EFSM , and payments to third countries , the total exposure this year is € 70.5 billion . 
Some borrowing over the seven-year MFF period may be possible , while upholding the medium-term objective of a balanced budget . 
Such leveraging of the EU budget would complement the recently established European Stabilization Mechanism ( the successor to the EFSM ) and the MTFA . 
Countries receiving assistance should be given the option of applying for an anticipated disbursement of EU funds . 
Following a request by a member state , the Commission would be entitled to borrow on capital markets under the implicit EU budget guarantee , with the maximum amount determined by the size of the country &apos;s unused ( pre-allocated ) Structural and Cohesion Funds . 
The capital would be repaid in annual installments as the funds become available through the EU budget , while the national co-financing rate would apply to interest payments . 
This framework would reduce incentives for using annual EU budget negotiations to advance political agendas . 
Net contributors would be locked into a relationship with the markets - a convincing creditor . 
At the same time , imposing conditionality on this kind of disbursement would enhance legitimacy , as opposed to the current framework , in which beneficiaries seek entitlements . 
Indeed , all EU countries - not just eurozone members - would benefit from such a framework . 
Such an initiative could co-exist with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy &apos;s proposal to create a risk-sharing mechanism only for eurozone countries . 
The revamped growth compact would more effectively allocate European resources and increase the flexibility of permanent transfers from rich to poor countries - provided that the money is used for productive investment . 
Van Rompuy &apos;s budget would also help to stabilize the eurozone in the event that asymmetric shocks require temporary transfers from unaffected to crisis-stricken countries . 
In fact , the two instruments may well be complementary in eurozone countries . 
Crises are typically associated with a drop not only in actual growth , but also in a country &apos;s growth potential , owing to deferred investment . 
A risk-sharing facility could limit the decline in actual growth after a crisis , while prompt EU-financed investment would prevent a country from shifting to a lower growth path .
