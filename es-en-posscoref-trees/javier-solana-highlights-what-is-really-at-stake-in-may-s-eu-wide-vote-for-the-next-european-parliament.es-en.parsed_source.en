Re-Electing Europe 
MADRID - The run-up to next month &apos;s European Parliament election has been characterized by a stifling tension between pro- and anti-Europeans . 
Surveys show that the two main political forces , conservatives and social democrats , are still running close ( and far ahead of the rest ) ; however the rise of populism is deeply worrying to everyone who believes in European unity - not only conservatives and social democrats , but also liberals and greens . 
Parties like the National Front in France or the United Kingdom &apos;s Independence Party could become front-runners in their respective countries , and they are not alone . 
In Finland , Austria , Holland , Hungary , Greece , and elsewhere , anti-European parties and more traditional Euroskeptics are benefiting from growing disillusion with Europe &apos;s institutions , the remedies used to combat Europe &apos;s ongoing economic crisis , and the widening division between the European Union &apos;s north and south . 
Despite a rapid succession of significant steps , citizens throughout the EU sense too little improvement where it matters most - in their everyday lives . 
But the battle between pro- and anti-Europeans is masking what really is at stake - and thus what should be the focus of electoral debate : how Europe can generate sustained economic growth . 
This question , rather than an endless defense against Euroskepticism , should be the main item of deliberation for parties pushing for an improved Europe for all . 
Broad-based recovery - in investment , demand , and employment - is the best weapon with which to confront those who would destroy the European project . 
The upcoming election will render the public &apos;s judgment on the success or failure of the austerity policies that have been undertaken . 
But it will also determine whether Europe will be able to remain the world &apos;s leading economic power , maintain its social model , and safeguard its framework of rights and liberties in a world that will not wait for Europeans to resolve their differences . 
Not long ago , while teaching a class in which European students were a small minority , I conducted a brief experiment , a variant on John Rawls &apos;s famous &quot; veil of ignorance . &quot; 
I asked the students where they would prefer to be born today if they could choose . 
The answer was virtually unanimous : the majority chose a European country . 
But , though Europe &apos;s magnetic power is still strong , the EU &apos;s member states are too small to compete on a global scale with China , the United States , or India . 
To do so , they need an even more integrated Europe . 
Indeed , as the Ukraine crisis shows , European countries cannot live in self-absorbed isolation . 
Integration is as urgent today as it ever was , especially in sectors such as energy . 
A single energy market is essential not only to ensure secure and reliable supplies , but also to achieve sustainable growth compatible with Europe &apos;s commitments on climate change . 
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States is another imperative for policymakers - one that is key to creating jobs on both sides of the Atlantic . 
Above all , the EU needs to gain greater democratic legitimacy if it is to counter the growing sentiment that the European project benefits only Europe &apos;s elite . 
Worryingly , the anti-Europeans &quot; simplistic message is striking a chord with a large segment of Europe &apos;s voters . 
That should come as no surprise : Just 31 % of Europeans say that they have confidence in the EU , down sharply from 52 % in 2007 , while the share of those with a negative view of the EU has almost doubled , from 15 % to 28 % , during this period . 
Though confidence in the EU has declined dramatically during the European Parliament &apos;s current electoral term , the trend is not irreversible . 
Voters are critical of today &apos;s policies , but the European ideal will survive if it can be modernized and serve again as a source of hope for EU citizens . 
That may be a big &quot; if , &quot; especially given that the greatest threat posed by anti-European parties consists not in the number of seats they win , but rather in their ability to influence the political mainstream . 
If the main parliamentary forces are tempted to take on anti-European ideas for electoral reasons , their opponents could achieve some of their objectives : blocking the integration process , restricting the free movement of people , or approving xenophobic policies . 
Faced with this , Europe should move toward what might be called &quot; Erasmusization , &quot; building on the success of the EU &apos;s Erasmus scholarships . 
By enabling students to study across the EU , the Erasmus program promotes a robust exchange of experiences , ideas , values , and ways of life . 
And , to the extent that it has emerged as a potent force among younger Europeans , it is also Europe &apos;s best chance for a future of freedom and prosperity . 
If the EU gains greater democratic legitimacy and designs lasting and credible solutions for its economic problems - unemployment , poverty , and inequality - the confidence gap should begin to close rapidly . 
It will then be possible to make progress on other important questions that have been postponed since the crisis erupted five years ago . 
The European Parliament &apos;s new control over the selection of the European Commission &apos;s president ( and thus members ) is a giant step forward in terms of democratic legitimacy . 
However , if the upcoming election deepens the fissure between pro- and anti-European forces , popular disaffection with Europe will continue to metastasize , foreclosing a new golden age in which Europe - a century after World War I - remains the world &apos;s best place to grow up , work , and live .
