The Business of Korean Reconciliation 
SEOUL - Can trade and commerce foster peace and mutual understanding between hostile governments ? 
When it comes to the Koreas , this question may seem to be beside the point , given the ruthless purge now underway in the North . 
The Kaesong Industrial Complex , a joint venture of the North and South Korean governments , is both a tribute to the concept of diplomatic reconciliation through business and a difficult test of its feasibility . 
Roughly 50,000 North Korean workers are employed in 123 factories that produce about $ 450 million worth of goods ( mainly textiles , shoes , and household goods ) . 
Kaesong is an expensive investment for South Korea , which provides capital and infrastructure , including a power station , a water purification plant , and a hospital . 
Despite generous tax incentives , South Korea &apos;s huge conglomerates , the chaebol , have spurned the experiment , at least partly because of enduring transportation and communications problems . 
The complex can be accessed only through the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas , which requires entry and exit passes . 
The lack of mobile-phone networks and broadband Internet means that South Korean managers must communicate with their headquarters by landline phones and fax . 
Of course , commercial gain is not the only motivation behind the Kaesong complex . 
The South Korean authorities are rightly proud of the initiative , which they view as an investment in future reunification with the North . 
Seen from this perspective , North Korea &apos;s recent announcement that it will open another 14 special economic zones is a positive development - one that is underpinned by significant financial incentives . 
Aside from enabling the North to acquire technology and learn market-oriented business practices , the Kaesong complex generates about $ 80 million annually in workers &quot; compensation ( the monthly wage of $ 160 is far higher than in North Korea ) . 
But political and historical tensions continue to shape daily life in Kaesong , where companies operate under the constant threat that North Korea , for whatever reason , will react rashly , even abandoning the joint project altogether . 
Already last year , rising inter-Korean tensions led to a temporary shutdown of the complex . 
As a result , firms must dedicate considerable time and effort to dealing with North Korea &apos;s often volatile and opaque politics , exemplified in the recent execution of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un &apos;s powerful uncle , Jang Song-thaek . 
This challenging climate undermines the project &apos;s viability , even though the business model - based on lower-cost workers from the North producing labor-intensive goods - makes sense . 
Kaesong is a bit of George Orwell &apos;s 1984 , with added elements of nineteenth-century paternalism . 
The atmosphere is stilted and muffled , with workers moving around in silence and guards everywhere . 
During a recent visit - the first by a foreign delegation since 2006 - the cold and snowy weather intensified this feeling , creating the sense of being suspended in time and space . 
The visit began with military jeeps escorting our convoy into North Korean territory . 
The vehicles &quot; number plates were covered with white cardboard , and red flags had been affixed to the doors next to the side-view mirrors - for which none of our South Korean hosts was able to offer an explanation . 
Even the preparation for our visit , which was confirmed less than 24 hours before it began , was somewhat Orwellian . 
Detailed packing instructions were issued , informing us that we could not bring radios , mobile phones , wireless devices , printed materials , photos , cassette tapes , or DVDs . 
Despite being limited to cameras with lenses under 160mm , we were not permitted to take photos of the demilitarized zone between the industrial complex and the border , or of North Korean soldiers or workers . 
Our cameras were checked when we left the country to verify compliance . 
The border between the two Koreas is virtually impenetrable , with gates that open for a half-hour at a time a few times per day . 
As a result , all personal contact occurs through official channels . 
Even as diplomatic visitors , we were prohibited from speaking with or giving anything to the workers , whom we watched with a mixture of curiosity and sympathy . 
The North Koreans seemed to share our desire to connect , as they sought to engage with us to whatever extent they could . 
The diminutive border guard looked into my eyes , smiled warmly , and asked where I was from . 
Likewise , lined-up workers at one of the factories responded to my gesticulations with waves and smiles as we passed them . 
Given the prevailing paranoia , fueled by propaganda and genuine ignorance , on both sides of the border , it is possible that our hosts were being excessively cautious . 
Nonetheless , our pre-trip &quot; indoctrination &quot; stifled our reactions , regrettably preventing us from trying harder to reach out to the workers we encountered - an experience that seemed to exemplify the difficulty of bringing North Korea into the international community . 
Despite their flaws , initiatives like the Kaesong complex help to build an environment of collaboration and trust . 
As Asia &apos;s recent history shows , authoritarian regimes tend to open up in response to a combination of grassroots movements and gradual top-down reforms . 
North Koreans may well be prepared to provide the former , but whether the government is prepared to do its part remains highly uncertain , to say the least . 
The expansion of special economic zones - supported by increased private investment , especially from firms that are not South Korean or Chinese - would significantly improve the odds that North Korea &apos;s regime eases its repressive rule and embraces a program of economic reform , as China did more than three decades ago . 
The task of defusing the threat to regional peace and stability that North Korea poses should be one that is shared across Asia .
