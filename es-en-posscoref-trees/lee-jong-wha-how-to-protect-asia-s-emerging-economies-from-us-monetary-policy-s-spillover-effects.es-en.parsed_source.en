Financial Safety Nets for Asia 
SEOUL - Emerging economies are facing significant uncertainty and serious downside risks . 
One major source of instability is the looming reversal of the US Federal Reserve &apos;s expansionary monetary policy - the prospect of which is generating volatility in global financial markets and threatening to disrupt emerging-economy growth . 
The Fed has signaled that its federal funds rate will remain near 0 % , at least as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5 % and inflation expectations remain well anchored . 
But when and how the Fed will begin tightening monetary policy remains unclear . 
What is certain is that , in making its decision , the Fed will not consider its policy &apos;s spillover effects on the rest of the world , leaving affected countries &quot; policymakers and central bankers to deal with the fallout . 
Tighter US monetary policy could intensify the global credit shortage , thereby increasing pressure on Asia &apos;s economic and financial systems . 
Overreaction and herding behavior by market participants could trigger a sudden reversal of capital inflows , with a severe dollar shortage - as occurred in 1997 and 2008 - straining Asian banks and corporations . 
These risks explain why the Fed &apos;s mere suggestion of a potential move toward reducing its purchases of long-term asset ( so-called quantitative easing ) caused emerging-market currencies and asset prices to plummet this summer . 
They also underscore Asian economies &quot; need for stronger financial safety nets . 
The 2008 global financial crisis revealed fundamental flaws in the international monetary system , as the failure to ensure sufficient liquidity weighed heavily on emerging Asian economies . 
Since then , these countries have taken measures to safeguard the stability of their financial systems against volatile external shocks , strengthen financial supervision and regulation , and develop more effective macroeconomic frameworks , including better macro-prudential regulation and capital-control measures . 
But their heavy reliance on international trade and capital flows means that they remain vulnerable to severe financial spillovers from the United States . 
Moreover , since the 1997 Asian financial crisis , the region &apos;s emerging economies have increased their holdings of foreign-exchange reserves , and now possess more than half of the world &apos;s total . 
Seven of the world &apos;s top ten reserve-holding economies are in Asia . 
But hoarding international reserves , mostly in the form of low-yielding short-term US Treasury securities , is expensive and inefficient . 
Some Asian economies , especially China , are also attempting to internationalize their currencies . 
Given China &apos;s expanding global influence , the renminbi &apos;s emergence as a new international currency is inevitable . 
For smaller economies , however , internationalization will be far more difficult . 
In their quest to ensure sufficient liquidity , Asian economies have also actively pursued currency-swap arrangements . 
Since 2008 , China has signed 23 bilateral swap agreements , including one with South Korea . 
Japan expanded bilateral swap facilities with its Asian neighbors during the global financial crisis . 
And the ten ASEAN countries , together with China , Japan , and South Korea , have constructed a $ 240 billion regional reserve pool to provide short-term liquidity to members in an emergency . 
Such swaps should help Asian countries to cope with currency turmoil in the wake of a Fed policy reversal . 
But they remain untested and , given their relatively small volumes , cannot reassure markets or provide adequate emergency support to crisis countries , especially in the event of large-scale systemic shocks . 
The Fed , as the de facto global lender of last resort , can improve significantly the effectiveness of Asia &apos;s financial safety nets by establishing currency-swap arrangements with emerging economies &quot; central banks during the policy-reversal process . 
In 2008 , the Fed established currency-swap lines with the central banks of ten developed economies , including the eurozone , the United Kingdom , Japan , and Switzerland , and four emerging economies ( Brazil , South Korea , Mexico , and Singapore ) . 
These arrangements , most of which ended in 2010 , responded to strains in short-term credit markets and improved liquidity conditions during the crisis . 
The South Korean central bank &apos;s $ 30 billion swap , though limited , averted a run on the won . 
Reestablishing the Fed &apos;s swap arrangements with emerging economies would minimize negative spillovers during the coming monetary-policy reversal . 
Even an announcement by the Fed stating its willingness to do so would go a long way toward reassuring markets that emerging economies can avert a liquidity crisis . 
The swap lines would also serve American interests . 
After all , trouble in emerging economies would destabilize the entire global economy , threatening the fragile recoveries of advanced economies , including the US . 
Critics might cite the moral-hazard risk generated by liquidity support . 
But a well-designed framework that offers swap lines only to well-qualified emerging economies - and only temporarily - would diminish this risk substantially . 
In fact , some experts , such as the economist Edwin Truman , have proposed establishing an institutionalized global swap arrangement as a more effective and robust crisis-prevention mechanism - an idea that G-20 countries should consider . 
But creating such a system would take time . 
In the meantime , the Fed should take the initiative by re-establishing swap lines with advanced and emerging economies alike .
