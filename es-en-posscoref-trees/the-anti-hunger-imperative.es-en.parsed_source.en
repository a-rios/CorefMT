The Anti-Hunger Imperative 
BRUSSELS - There are plenty of summits to choose from this year , but the World Summit on Food Security deserves not to be lost in the crowd . 
This meeting in Rome from November 16-18 provides badly needed political momentum to three linked issues that rank among the most challenging of the current era : food security , biodiversity , and climate change . 
Collectively , we are failing in the fight against world hunger . 
More than one billion people in the world today do not have enough food to meet their basic daily nutritional needs , and the situation in developing countries is getting worse . 
This is , first and foremost , a moral outrage . 
How can it be that in the twenty-first century , when we have taken men to the Moon and back , we still cannot feed everyone on this planet ? 
Policymakers must recognize , moreover , that food insecurity is linked to the lasting effects of the economic crisis and ongoing climate change , and that it represents no less a threat to our global community . 
To be fair , world leaders have responded . 
At the recent G-8 summit in L &apos;Aquila , Italy , we made a firm commitment &quot; to act with the scale and urgency needed to achieve global food security , &quot; and we collectively pledged $ 20 billion over three years . 
This is a sizeable commitment , but it may not be enough - more needs to be done to increase agricultural production , to free up the potential of trade to address food insecurity , and to deal with the increasing impact of climate change on agriculture . 
The European Commission , too , has responded , with finance for food security coming via a number of instruments . 
Our European Union food facility , agreed last year , is mobilizing an additional $ 1.5 billion for a rapid response to rising food prices . 
And we will pump in another $ 4 billion in the coming three years to fund activities that help countries improve food security and adapt to climate change . 
Extra money to address food security problems , among other things , should be one of the key outcomes of the finance package that the EU strongly supports for the next crucial event on the summit calendar : the Copenhagen climate conference in December . 
Changing weather patterns and the increasing magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events will require substantial investments if farmers are to adapt successfully . 
These changes hit the poorest the hardest , and global trends mask deep regional disparities . 
Small farmers , predominantly in developing countries , will bear the brunt of climate change . 
If we do not act quickly , the 40 poorest countries , predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America , will by 2080 lose from 10 % to 20 % of their basic grain-growing capacity due to drought . 
But answers to this problem are close to hand . 
The impact of biodiversity is often insufficiently understood , which means that we have undervalued its contribution to tackling global challenges . 
The more diverse the variation of life forms within a given ecosystem , the more resilient it is to change . 
So biodiversity can act as a natural &quot; insurance policy &quot; against sudden environmental changes and a buffer against losses caused by them ( as well as by pests and diseases ) . 
Biodiversity is essential for reliable and stable long-term food production . 
The famines in Ireland in the nineteenth century and in Ethiopia in the late twentieth century provide clear evidence of the vulnerability of undiversified crops to environmental changes , and the dramatic consequences of such vulnerability for the population . 
Crop diversity can also deliver important ecosystem benefits . 
Varieties that are tolerant to drought and flood can not only increase productivity , but also can prevent soil erosion and desertification . 
In southern Ghana , for example , farmers have managed to reduce crop failures arising from rainfall variability and unpredictability by cultivating several drought-tolerant types of the same crop species . 
In addition , crop diversification has reduced the need for costly and environmentally damaging pesticides . 
So I am convinced that we should raise the profile of biodiversity in tackling climate change and food insecurity , and that we need more high-level attention to this subject . 
Next week , when leaders meet in Rome , I hope that we will agree on the key priorities to fight hunger and food insecurity , and in particular to establish an authoritative source of advice on food security to governments and international institutions . 
In fact , we need for food security what the United Nations &quot; Intergovernmental Panel has done for climate change : a science-based red-alert system for the planet . 
And at the start of a new five-year term at the European Commission , I will continue to do all I can to promote this important issue . 
But even the best and most up-to-date donor policies will remain vain exercises if governments in developed countries fail to translate their commitments into hard cash and improvements in agricultural investment worldwide . 
So finally let the World Summit on Food Security provide tangible evidence of a commitment from all governments to a common objective : a world free of hunger . 
History will judge us unfavorably if we fail .
