Who Pays for Bird Flu ? 
Fifty years ago , American chicken farmers found that by keeping their birds in sheds they could produce chickens for the table more cheaply and with less work than by traditional farmyard methods . 
The new method spread : chickens disappeared from fields into long , windowless sheds . 
Factory farming was born . 
It isn &apos;t called &quot; factory farming &quot; merely because those sheds look like factories . 
Everything about the production method is geared towards turning live animals into machines for converting grain into meat or eggs at the lowest possible cost . 
Walk into such a shed - if the producer will let you - and you will find up to 30,000 chickens . 
The National Chicken Council , the trade association for the US chicken industry , recommends a stocking density of 85 square inches per bird - less than a standard sheet of typing paper . 
When the chickens approach market weight , they cover the floor completely . 
No chicken can move without having to push through other birds . 
In the egg industry , hens can barely move at all , because they are crammed into wire cages , which makes it possible to stack them in tiers , one above the other . 
Environmentalists point out that this production method is unsustainable . 
For a start , it relies on the use of fossil fuel energy to light and ventilate the sheds , and to transport the grain eaten by the chickens . 
When this grain , which humans could eat directly , is fed to chickens , they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat . 
So we get less food back than we put into the birds - and less protein , too - while disposing of the concentrated chicken manure causes serious pollution to rivers and ground water . 
Animal-welfare advocates protest that crowding the chickens keeps them from forming a natural flock , causes them stress , and , in the case of laying hens , prevents them from even stretching their wings . 
The air in the sheds is high in ammonia from bird feces , which are usually allowed to pile up for months - and in some cases for a year or more - before being cleaned out . 
Medical experts warn that because the birds are routinely fed antibiotics to keep them growing in such crowded , filthy , and stressful conditions , antibiotic-resistant bacteria could cause a public-health threat . 
Yet , despite these well-founded criticisms , over the last 20 years factory farming - not only of chickens , but also of pigs , veal calves , dairy cows , and , in outdoor feedlots , cattle - has spread rapidly in developing countries , especially in Asia . 
Now we are discovering that the consequences may be far more deadly than we ever imagined . 
As University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown put it after a Canadian outbreak of avian influenza , &quot; high-intensity chicken rearing is a perfect environment for generating virulent avian flu viruses . &quot; 
Other experts agree . 
In October 2005 , a United Nations task force identified as one of the root causes of the bird flu epidemic , &quot; farming methods which crowd huge numbers of animals into small spaces . &quot; 
Supporters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free-range flocks , or by wild ducks and other migrating birds , who may join the free-range birds to feed with them or drop their feces while flying overhead . 
But , as Brown has pointed out , viruses found in wild birds are generally not very dangerous . 
On the contrary , it is only when these viruses enter a high-density poultry operation that they mutate into something far more virulent . 
By contrast , birds that are reared by traditional methods are likely to have greater resistance to disease than the stressed , genetically similar birds kept in intensive confinement systems . 
Moreover , factory farms are not biologically secure . 
So far , a relatively small number of human beings have died from the current strain of avian influenza , and it appears that they have all been in contact with infected birds . 
But if the virus mutates into a form that is transmissible between humans , the number of deaths could run into the hundreds of millions . 
Governments are , rightly , taking action to prepare for this threat . 
Recently , the US Senate approved spending $ 8 billion to stockpile vaccines and other drugs to help prevent a possible bird flu epidemic . 
Other governments have already spent tens of millions on vaccines and other preventive measures . 
What is now clear , however , is that such government spending is really a kind of subsidy to the poultry industry . 
Factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods . 
In fact , it was cheaper only because it passed some of its costs on to others - for example , to people who lived downstream or downwind from the factory farms , and could no longer enjoy clean water and air . 
Now we see that these were only a small part of the total costs . 
Factory farming is passing far bigger costs - and risks - on to all of us . 
In economic terms , these costs should be &quot; internalized &quot; by the factory farmers rather than being shifted onto the rest of us . 
That won &apos;t be easy to do , but we could make a start by imposing a tax on factory-farm products until enough revenue is raised to pay for the precautions that governments now have to take against avian influenza . 
Then we might finally see that chicken from the factory farm really isn &apos;t so cheap after all .
