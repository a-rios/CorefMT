Japan &apos;s Political Tremors 
NEW YORK - Rarely - indeed , perhaps not since World War II - have the Japanese had such good press abroad . 
Even South Korean newspapers have been full of praise for the self-discipline of ordinary Japanese in dire circumstances . 
And coming from Koreans , not usually Japan &apos;s biggest fans , that is no small thing . 
When it comes to Japanese officials , however , matters are a little different . 
There has been much complaining from foreign observers , aid teams , reporters , and government spokesmen about the lack of clarity , not to mention reliability , of official Japanese statements about the various disasters following the massive earthquake that struck northeastern Japan on March 11 . 
Serious problems appeared to be skirted , deliberately hidden , or played down . 
Worse still , few people had any understanding of who was responsible for what . 
Sometimes it looked very much as if the Japanese government itself was kept in the dark by officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company ( TEPCO ) , owners of the nuclear power plants that are leaking radiation into land , sea , and sky . 
Prime Minister Naoto Kan had to ask TEPCO executives at one point , &quot; What the hell is going on ? &quot; 
If Kan didn &apos;t know , how could anyone else ? 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s powerful bureaucrats , normally assumed to know what they are doing , appeared to be as helpless as elected politicians . 
Outside Japan , it is widely believed that everything works differently there , owing to the country &apos;s exotic culture . 
This perception is not entirely false . 
An important aspect of culture is the use of language . 
Often Japanese officials &quot; utterances are deliberately vague , to avoid having to take responsibility if things go wrong - a fairly universal trait among the powerful . 
But some utterances may get lost in translation . 
When a Japanese official says that he will take something &quot; into serious consideration , &quot; he means &quot; no . &quot; 
This is not always properly understood . 
In the case of Japan &apos;s official response to the earthquake and tsunami-related disasters , however , cultural exoticism is not an adequate explanation . 
In fact , the Japanese themselves have been as critical as any foreigner , if not more so , of their politicians &quot; apparent haplessness , and of TEPCO officials &quot; evasions and obfuscations . 
Some people are even leaving the relative safety of Tokyo , having lost trust in the government and TEPCO , which has a history of covering up dangerous flaws in its nuclear facilities . 
An investigation in 2002 revealed that TEPCO had submitted false data to the government , concealed accidents , and literally hid cracks . 
The breakdown of public trust in Japanese officialdom would be worrying were it to lead to a democratic breakdown . 
But it might also lead to necessary changes . 
Even though systems of government may have certain traditional components , Japan &apos;s problems are systemic , not cultural . 
Japanese government was always paternalistic , and the chain of command complex and vague . 
During the war , the emperor was omnipotent in theory , but relatively powerless in fact . 
But there was never a dictator , either . 
Decisions emerged from murky negotiations and hidden rivalries between bureaucrats , imperial courtiers , politicians , and military officials , often pushed this way or that by various domestic and foreign pressures , some of them violent . 
The post-war political order , though no longer belligerent , was just as murky , with bureaucrats acting as the puppeteers of underfunded and ill-informed politicians , who operated regional pork-barrel operations together with big business , which in turn worked in cahoots with the bureaucrats . 
So long as Japan was playing catch-up with the West , and government and industrial resources were concentrated on economic growth , the system worked quite well . 
Indeed , it was the envy of many Westerners , who were fed up with self-interested lobbying , pesky labor unions , and meddling politicians . 
Such Westerners are now often just as enamored of China &apos;s paternalistic - and equally opaque and impenetrable - political system . 
But it was this system that produced the problems now associated with TEPCO . 
Tight-knit cliques of bureaucrats and corporate officials made sure that a utility company vital for economic growth would never be hindered by strict regulation or political oversight . 
The cozy relationships between government officials and the corporate world - and not just in the case of TEPCO - was reflected in the large number of retired bureaucrats who took jobs on the boards of companies that they had supposedly regulated . 
Many Japanese are aware of these problems , which is why they voted for Kan &apos;s Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) in 2009 , breaking the virtual political monopoly exercised for a half-century by the conservative Liberal Democrats . 
One of the DPJ government &apos;s stated goals was to increase the political system &apos;s transparency : less hidden authority for bureaucrats , more responsibility for elected politicians . 
The aftermath of the earthquake is thus a potential watershed . 
If Japan &apos;s relatively inexperienced government is blamed for everything that goes wrong , people might wish to retreat to the old ways of murky paternalism . 
If , on the other hand , enough people realize that the old ways are the problem , rather than the solution , democratic reforms will still have a fighting chance . 
That would cast at least one ray of light on the gloom that envelops Japan today .
