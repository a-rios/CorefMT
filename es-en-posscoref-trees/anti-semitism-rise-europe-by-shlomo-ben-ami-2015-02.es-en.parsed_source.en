In Defense of the Jews , Again 
MADRID - Despite the impression given by massive unity rallies throughout France , the recent attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo does not mean that freedom of expression is under any serious threat in Western Europe . 
Nor does it indicate that Islamic radicalism is somehow about to engulf or transform Western societies . 
The threat that it does highlight is a less publicized one : the resurgence of discrimination and violence against Europe &apos;s Jews . 
Charlie Hebdo - the last vestige of a bawdy and somewhat savage nineteenth-century French tradition of outrageous caricature of religious and political figures - may well be an ideal icon of free expression . 
Europeans rose to defend a vital principle ; free speech , however vicious , retains a place in any democracy . 
Likewise , &quot; Eurabia , &quot; Bat Ye &apos;Or &apos;s prophecy of Islamic doom for the West , simply is not emerging . 
No Islamic parties hold seats in European parliaments ; few leading Muslim figures feature in Europe &apos;s major centers of cultural and political power ; and European Union institutions are practically bereft of Arabs and Muslims . 
Efforts by radicals to recruit and indoctrinate young European Muslims do not reflect the inexorable rise of Islamist - or even Islamic - influence in Europe . 
Rather , they highlight the radicals &quot; desperation to influence a region where the overwhelming majority of Muslims aspire to integrate into , rather than challenge , the established order . 
What is truly under threat in Europe is its Jewish community . 
In 2006 , the French Jew Ilan Halimi was kidnapped and brutally tortured in a cellar for three weeks , resulting in his death . 
In 2012 , three Jewish schoolchildren and a rabbi were gunned down in Toulouse . 
A month later , a French jihadist attacked the Jewish museum in Brussels , leaving three dead and one critically wounded . 
A few months after that , a mob assaulted a synagogue in Paris . 
None of these events sparked anything remotely resembling the public outrage of recent weeks . Had the murder of four Jews at a kosher supermarket in Paris , carried out by a confederate of the Charlie Hebdo attackers prior to their capture , occurred in other circumstances , one can assume that it would not have fueled a widespread movement to defend the values of the French Republic . 
Some argue that the surge in anti-Semitic violence in Europe is motivated primarily by the plight of the Palestinians . 
But , according to a 2012 poll , more Europeans believe that violence against Jews is fueled by long-standing anti-Semitic attitudes , rather than anti-Israel sentiment . 
Radical Islam propagated hatred for Jews long before Zionism , and it will continue to do so after the creation of a Palestinian state . 
Given this , it is not surprising that the increasing visibility of Islamist extremism has , by capturing the attention of frustrated young Muslim men in Europe and elsewhere , spurred increased violence against Jews . 
But the problem runs deeper , giving Jews the impression that they have no future in Europe . 
A recent YouGov poll found that a substantial share of the French and British populations hold anti-Semitic views . 
Another poll , conducted by the Center for Research on Prejudice at Warsaw University , showed that , in 2013 , some 63 % of Poles believed Jews conspire to control the banking system and the world media . 
This has serious implications not just for Jews , but for Europe as a whole . 
As Hannah Arendt pointed out six decades ago , the rise of anti-Semitism fueled Europe &apos;s descent into totalitarianism . 
With right-wing extremist and populist movements gaining traction in many countries , Europe &apos;s political system - and the values that underpin it - is at risk . 
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls recognizes this danger . 
In a recent speech at the National Assembly that recalled Emile Zola &apos;s attack on the &quot; blind stupidity &quot; of Jew-hatred almost 120 years ago , he asked : &quot; How can we accept that in France &amp; hellip ; shouts of &quot; Death to the Jews ! &quot; can be heard in our streets ? ... How can we accept that French people can be murdered because they are Jewish ? &quot; 
He then warned that the revival of anti-Semitism in France - apparent , for example , in the anxiety over the Holocaust &apos;s inclusion in the French school curriculum - indicates a crisis of democracy . 
But Valls remains the only European politician to have highlighted the danger with the sense of urgency that it merits . 
It is time for his counterparts to step up , and doing so should not rule out bold policies , free of any complexes , aimed at influencing Israel &apos;s policy toward Palestine . 
At the same time , it is a dangerous fallacy to seek redemption for a problem that is so deeply ingrained in Europe &apos;s history - and in Islam &apos;s - by blaming it on the Israel-Palestine conflict or on young , alienated Muslims . 
Europeans must take a good hard look at themselves if they are to avoid falling back into the clutches of fear , hatred , and appalling politics .
