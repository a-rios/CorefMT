Back to the Politics of Cultural Despair 
Some years ago the historian Fritz Stern wrote a book about Germany entitled The Politics of Cultural Despair . 
He used the example of three ( now forgotten ) bestselling authors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to show the deep aversion of many Germans to the modern world , notably to market economics and democratic politics . 
For Stern , this was part of the cultural soil in which National Socialism flourished . 
Much has changed since the Nazi era . 
The murderous triumph and bloody defeat of the politics of cultural despair was followed by an economic miracle that made Germany one of the world &apos;s most prosperous countries , with nearly six decades of increasingly stable democracy . 
Yet there are still traces within Germany of an attitude that finds modern economics distasteful and the opening of all frontiers to a globalized world frightening . 
&quot; Pure capitalism &quot; and &quot; globalization &quot; evoke horrific images . 
Swarms of capitalist &quot; locusts &quot; threaten to descend on defenseless , hardworking people , to quote the unfortunate metaphor used in a recent speech by Franz MÃ¼ntefering , the chairman of the governing Social Democrats . 
Of course , revulsion for liberal economies and global markets is not confined to Germany . 
A similar sentiment formed one of the motives for the French and perhaps even the Dutch to reject the European Union &apos;s Constitutional Treaty , which some regarded as too &quot; Anglo-Saxon &quot; in its economic liberalism . 
For many , the alternative to capitalism and globalization is an idyllic image of a &quot; European social model , &quot; which no one has yet defined . 
Indeed , it would be difficult to do so . 
Social policies in Europe - like everything else - vary widely , and popular attitudes cover a spectrum , from tired protectionism and longing for subsidies in some of &quot; old Europe &quot; to the free-market enthusiasm of more recent EU members in the West ( Ireland and Portugal ) and the East ( Poland and Slovakia ) . 
In fact , Europe &apos;s much-vaunted social model is more a dream than a reality , the dream of a cozy world in which a benevolent state looks after us . 
This world has ceased to be viable in large part for reasons of demography , as ever more claimants for assistance make costs unaffordable . 
Some people - and even a few politicians - are drawing the right conclusions from this . 
They know that ultimately we all must rely on our own initiative and effort , and they make use of the opportunities of open markets . 
But others in Europe treat such attitudes like a cartoon whose caption could be in French or German : &quot; Self-reliance is absolutely important , we depend on politics for it . &quot; 
Behind such differences lie deep political and cultural traditions concerning the role of the state in everyday life . 
This is where the United States really is different from France and Germany , while Britain has a similar tradition of distrusting the state rather than relying on it . 
In a different way , this is true of Italy as well . 
Italy has long had a large Communist Party , and the left may be in power again ; but there is no gut antagonism to the freedoms that capitalism encourages . 
Poland is another country in which individual initiative flourishes - to the point that the apocryphal &quot; Polish plumber &quot; came to epitomize the threats posed by globalization in France . 
Needless to say , there are no such hang-ups in many of the high-growth economies of Asia . 
True , in India the inertia of an indigenous version of Fabian socialism had to be overcome ; but this has happened . 
In fact , new models to square the circle of economic growth , social cohesion , and political liberty may be emerging in some of the countries that have grasped the mantle of globalization . 
The entrenched anti-capitalist , anti-globalization mood elsewhere is a source of concern . 
After all , Fritz Stern wrote his book to warn of the dangers posed by a romantic abhorrence of modernity . 
High , often long-term unemployment and cuts in social benefits nurture , but do not cause such attitudes ; their deep-seated cultural roots matter far more . 
So do their consequences . 
A sense of frustration that results from anti-capitalist , anti-globalization sentiment leads to a lethal combination of Arcadian dreams ( &quot; France to the French &quot; ) and the reality of ruthless , if seductive , leaders on the right ( Jean-Marie Le Pen in France ) and the left ( Oskar Lafontaine and his new party in Germany ) . 
Prosperity and liberty will be the victims , unless those who grasp the opportunities of the new world prevail .
