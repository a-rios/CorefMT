De-Nationalizing the ECB &apos;s Executive Board 
The European Central Bank &apos;s chief economist , Otmar Issing , may not be scheduled to retire until May 2006 . 
But behind the scenes , maneuvering and politicking over his replacement are already in full swing . 
The only certainty about Mr. Issing &apos;s successor at the present moment is that he or she will be a German . 
This is because the big countries are acting as if they &quot; own &quot; seats on the Executive Board - that there is a &quot; German chair , &quot; a &quot; Spanish chair , &quot; an &quot; Italian chair , &quot; and so on . 
They are getting away with their power grab even though it goes against the Maastricht Treaty , which excludes nationality as a criterion for membership on the Executive Board . 
The pattern has been all too obvious . 
First , there was the controversial appointment of the Spaniard Jose Manuel Gonzales-Paramo to replace his countryman Domingo Solans on the Executive Board in May 2004 . 
In May of this year , Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi will replace another Italian , the retiring Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa . 
These appointments set a bad precedent , regardless of the merits of the individual members in question . 
Current practice is blatantly unfair , because it excludes candidates from small countries from competing for the vacated seats . 
This practice is also unwise . 
Some of the best people serving the ECB - or who have served in the past - are from small countries . 
Preventing small countries - as well as other big ones - from competing for specific vacant seats reduces the Executive Board &apos;s potential competency . 
Giving big countries permanent seats on the Executive Board also makes it easier for their politicians to control the ECB through the appointments process . 
It is much more difficult to appoint a political puppet to the Board in a system of open competition than under the current scheme . 
The last thing the ECB needs is a political crony of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder assuming Mr. Issing &apos;s key post . 
Of course , opening up the competition for Executive Board portfolios to all member countries does not guarantee the most qualified and politically independent person gets the job ; it only increases the probability of such an outcome . 
After all , member governments would still pick the candidates , and there can be no escaping politics in what is essentially a political process . 
If member governments are intent on bad candidates , it will be impossible to avoid them . 
Still , an open competitive process , even with all the inevitable political horse-trading and compromise that this entails , will most likely result in better Executive Board members than under the current system . 
Aware of the danger that Schroeder may pick a dubious candidate for Issing &apos;s post , senior ECB officials are already quietly discussing ways to outmaneuver him . 
One proposal currently making the rounds in Frankfurt is to split Issing &apos;s current portfolio in two , transferring part of the chief economist &apos;s responsibilities to another Board member . 
Another is to decouple the economics portfolio from the &quot; German chair &quot; altogether . 
The question is whether Germany will respond by claiming that it &quot; owns &quot; Issing &apos;s portfolio as well as his chair . 
So far , the big countries have been able to get away with their power grab because the small ones have been too disunited to launch an effective counterattack . 
Belgium , for example , complains constantly about its lack of representation on the Executive Board , but it has been more interested in demanding equal treatment with the Netherlands in the ECB than pursuing a common strategy with its neighbor to counter the big countries &quot; unwarranted assumption of permanent seats . 
The new EU members from Central and Eastern Europe , in particular , have a big stake in how the issue plays out . 
Many of the new members will be small countries who will introduce the euro someday and will want to have a seat on the Executive Board . 
If that is not possible because the original big countries have locked up most of the six seats on the Board for themselves , public opinion in Europe - which is broader than German , French , Spanish , and Italian opinion - could turn against the ECB . 
For this reason alone , the competition for the limited seats on the Executive Board must be an open one .
