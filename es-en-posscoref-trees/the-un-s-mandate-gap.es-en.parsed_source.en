The UN &apos;s Mandate Gap 
The United Nations peacekeeping operations now underway in Lebanon offer a big opportunity for the UN to demonstrate its relevance and impact on the world stage in the 21st century . 
If only those member states who claim to be the UN &apos;s biggest supporters put their money where their mouths are . 
Many world leaders , particularly those in Europe , decry the Bush administration &apos;s undermining of the UN , especially since 2003 . 
Yet leaders in France , who expressed outrage when the US sidestepped the UN and invaded Iraq without the international community &apos;s blessing , stunned the world in August when they backed down from their promise to send 2,000 peacekeepers to intervene in southern Lebanon , and instead only committed 200 . 
Fortunately , France has reconsidered , Germany will provide limited naval assistance , and Italy has stepped up to contribute 3,000 peacekeepers . 
In addition , China has recently pledged 1,000 troops . 
If we cannot do what it takes to make them more effective , we will increasingly find that nations will bypass them altogether . 
UN Security Council Resolution 1701 &quot; calls for Israel and Lebanon to support a permanent ceasefire . &quot; 
It thus set the stage for UN officials to establish the &quot; Rules of Engagement &quot; ( ROEs ) for its peacekeepers , which dictate when and under what circumstances UN troops can fire their weapons to defend themselves . 
But as the current UN mission in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) well knows , defending yourself is not the same as protecting yourself from hostile fire in the first place . 
In this context , the French are understandably worried about the fate of their soldiers - soldiers charged with supporting the Lebanese government in its efforts to establish control over the Hezbollah-controlled south . 
The terrible French peacekeeping experience in Bosnia in the early 1990s , in which France lost 84 soldiers serving in a humanitarian capacity under restrictive ROEs , justifies their fears . 
But ROEs are only the symptom of a deeper problem . 
The real issue is a yawning gap between paper and practice . 
In the heat of an international crisis , the Security Council passes resolutions to great public fanfare , establishing an official UN &quot; mandate . &quot; 
But then the UN Secretary General is left , resolution in hand , to ask UN member states for the actual , tangible resources necessary to implement what has been commanded . 
In the overwhelming majority of cases , those resources fall far short of what is required to successfully intervene in a crisis . 
A 2006 UN mandate review finds that UN member states adopt hundreds of mandates each year , conferring &quot; additional responsibilities with neither corresponding funds nor guidance &quot; on how resources should be used . 
In American domestic politics , these kinds of commands from the US Congress to states are known as &quot; unfunded mandates ; &quot; ordering results without providing the resources necessary to achieve them . 
It &apos;s political theater - big headlines , small results . 
The UN &apos;s experience in Lebanon is not encouraging . 
According to the UN &apos;s Department of Peacekeeping Operations , up to now UNIFIL has operated on an annual budget of $ 94 million and suffers chronic budget shortfalls due to unpaid assessments from member states . 
Now consider what an expanded UNIFIL is mandated to do under Resolution 1701 : peacekeepers must monitor the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah ; support and accompany the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy in southern Lebanon ; assist Lebanon &apos;s government in securing the country &apos;s borders and ports to keep illegal weapons from getting into Hezbollah &apos;s hands ; and &quot; help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons . &quot; 
This is a Herculean task . 
But over a month after the resolution , barely 5,000 troops are deployed . 
Even if all 15,000 UN troops could be found and deployed , the challenges in Lebanon will remain daunting . 
The UN insists that Resolution 1701 does 
That is only the military aspect of the peacekeeping effort . 
Lebanon &apos;s infrastructure - especially in the south - has been decimated . 
Homes and livelihoods have been destroyed . 
Who will build or re-build hospitals ? 
How will communications infrastructure be rebuilt ? 
Who will repair Lebanon &apos;s bridges and roads ? 
The mandate gap reflects the way the world has done business with the UN for decades - big promises , small pay-outs , much scapegoating if the UN then fails . 
But today the international community has a tremendous window of opportunity to secure a small but significant peace in the Middle East along the volatile border of Lebanon and Israel . 
How member states respond now - especially those who believe in the purpose and value of the UN - may help shape the outcomes of other , wider ongoing regional conflicts , notably with Iran and Syria , both of which support Hezbollah . 
The UN provides the mechanism for a global response , but as Kofi Annan often repeats , it does not exist apart from its member states . 
It is up to those members - to all of our governments - to provide both the necessary will and the required resources . 
Otherwise the UN is nothing more than a handy mechanism for outsourcing political blame . 
Our commitment to bring peace to the Middle East , or Darfur , or Congo , or Kosovo , or Haiti , is not measured by our words but by our wallets . 
The world gets what it pays for .
