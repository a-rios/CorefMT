The Meaning of Cyprus 
BRUSSELS - The root of the problem in Cyprus is well known . 
Its two major banks had attracted huge deposits from abroad , largely from Russia , and presumably mostly from individuals who wished to escape scrutiny at home or elsewhere . 
The proceeds were then invested in Greek government bonds and loans to Greek companies . 
When Greece imploded , the investments turned sour , and the Cypriot banks that had engaged in this strategy became insolvent . 
Given this situation , the logical choice for the country should have been clear : if the government wanted to survive , foreign depositors must bear part of the losses . 
It is thus difficult to understand why the Cypriot government was at first so reluctant to inflict any losses on depositors . 
But the solution that was eventually agreed makes sense : the country &apos;s two largest banks are effectively resolved . 
Their bad assets will be separated and wound down over time . 
Neither the Cypriot government nor European taxpayers will put any additional funds into these banks . 
The losses that remain after the bad assets have been disposed of will thus have to be borne by the banks &quot; uninsured creditors , which in this case means those with deposits of more than € 100,000 ( $ 130,000 ) . 
Although Cyprus is too small to matter for global financial markets , the crisis there could turn out to be an important precedent guiding how European policymakers deal with future banking problems . 
In particular , it could affect current plans for a &quot; banking union , &quot; which needs three elements : a single supervisor , a common resolution authority , and a credible system of deposit insurance . 
The Cyprus crisis holds important lessons on all three counts . 
First , the crisis has underscored the need for a single supervisor that is not captured by local interests . 
The European Central Bank would never have allowed Cypriot banks to attract huge deposits by paying above-market interest rates , and then to put all of their eggs in one basket ( Greece ) . 
This was a high-risk strategy without a safety net . 
Second , while there is still some discussion about how to create a common resolution mechanism for eurozone banks , events have shown that the ECB already de facto fills this role . 
No bank in difficulties can survive if the ECB does not grant or renew emergency liquidity assistance . 
This accumulation of power in the hands of a completely independent institution is , of course , not ideal from the standpoint of democratic accountability . 
Finally , the revolt of Cyprus &apos;s small savers highlighted the need for a credible system of deposit insurance . 
The EU directive that stipulates the protection of bank deposits up to € 100,000 does not provide a European guarantee ; it only requires member states to create a deposit-insurance system at the national level . 
In reality , however , there has been a widespread misperception that somehow &quot; Europe &quot; protects small depositors . 
Yet a common deposit-insurance system had , at least so far , not even been under discussion , because the issue was not perceived as a live problem . 
Cyprus has shattered this complacency . 
Leaving deposit insurance exclusively at the national level is no longer an option . 
Cyprus also holds a more general lesson : Given the extreme reaction of financial markets to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 , it had become axiomatic among European policymakers that no bank should be allowed to become insolvent . 
But financial markets reacted calmly to the news that , for the first time , even depositors in a bank in the European Union will lose part of their money ( and this was noted with glee in Berlin and elsewhere in northern Europe ) . 
The key lesson for European policymakers is thus that it is possible to &quot; bail in &quot; a bank &apos;s creditors . 
This realization - that the European taxpayer does not have to save every troubled bank - might have a very beneficial effect , because Germany &apos;s resistance to a banking union is motivated by the fear that German taxpayers would be forced to underwrite indirectly the losses of banks in the distressed countries of the eurozone periphery . 
This fear may now ease . 
The crisis in Cyprus represents an extreme and special case in many respects .
