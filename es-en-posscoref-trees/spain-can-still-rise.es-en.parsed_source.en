Spain Can Still Rise 
MADRID - July will enter Spanish history as having started on a tremendous high , spurred by Spain &apos;s recent triumph in the 2012 Euro Soccer Championship . 
But all signs indicate that the month will end in doubt and pessimism . 
The image of joyful crowds and Spanish flags draped from cars and windows has given way to that of throngs of demonstrators holding banners protesting the government &apos;s latest austerity measures . 
With one in four Spaniards unemployed and Spain &apos;s sovereign bonds rated just above junk status , Spain seems to be on the edge of falling into the abyss . 
But very few analyses delve beneath the surface of immediate figures and assess the core of Spain &apos;s strengths and weaknesses . 
Observers today tend to forget that , until the early 1980 &quot; s , Spain qualified as a developing country , according to World Bank standards . 
Indeed , together with Singapore and Ireland , Spain represents the biggest economic success story of the last quarter of the twentieth century . 
And it should not be forgotten that , together with an astounding leap in GDP per capita ( from $ 7,284 in 1980 to over $ 30,000 in 2010 ) , Spain , under King Juan Carlos &apos;s invaluable leadership , carried out a successful transition to democracy and joined the European Union . 
Such feats always entail important asymmetries and political pacts ; though fundamental to the post-Franco transition , when Spaniards were still fearful of reviving the deep divisions of the civil war , they plague the country to this day . 
Furthermore , Spain &apos;s success , coupled with lax credit policy in the eurozone , resulted in a financial bubble whose collapse exposed structural challenges . 
As a result , Spain now requires a concerted effort from its citizens , one rooted in confidence in their achievements of the last 30 years . 
One area in grave need of reform is the labor market . 
The foundations of Spain &apos;s current labor laws date to 1938 , when the civil war was tearing the country apart . 
The system created by Generalissimo Francisco Franco following his victory offered workers job security and strong collective-bargaining rights , which helped to maintain social stability in the absence of democracy . 
Paradoxically , the bulk of this platform has survived as a banner of the left . 
Changing it is , therefore , not only vital for regaining competitiveness ; it is also a critical test of the maturity of Spain &apos;s democracy . 
The current system underpins Spain &apos;s soaring unemployment rate . 
Since the second half of the 1980 &quot; s , when net emigration abruptly reversed , Spain has experienced high levels of structural unemployment , even when annual growth was above 4 % , in part owing to the high quality and generous provisions of Spain &apos;s social-welfare system , which was also consolidated in the post-Franco period . 
As of 2011 , an estimated 5.7 million residents ( 12 % of the population ) were immigrants - over a million more than in the significantly larger United Kingdom ( with a population of 62 million ) . 
International observers often also target the need to reduce public employment . 
Here , too , the problem is a direct consequence of the political agreements reached at the beginning of the transition to democracy . 
The public sector underwent rapid and radical decentralization as part of the transition , owing to the creation of the country &apos;s quasi-federal governmental structure , which created significant overlap and duplication , both in terms of effort and resources . 
Meanwhile , it distorts reality to view Spain &apos;s entire banking sector through the prism of the cajas , the savings banks that are the soft underbelly of the Spanish financial system . 
Indeed , Santander and BBVA rank among today &apos;s most successful international banks . 
Nevertheless , it was the cajas that concentrated the risk associated with the housing bubble , and whose governance presented the worst face of public ownership . 
The cajas had neither the corporate governance structures nor the management skills to withstand the crisis . 
Moreover , Spanish schools trail behind in the international ranking system ; the relatively effective Franco-era vocational training system became collateral damage in the transition ; and the low number of patent applications reveals severe shortcomings in research and development . 
This hindrance to competitiveness is also linked to an underperforming , state-regulated higher-education system , with no Spanish public university among the top 150 ranked in the 2012 Academic Ranking of World Universities , whereas three private institutions ( IE , IESE , and ESADE ) are all ranked among the top business schools worldwide . 
Today , Spain has some of Europe &apos;s best infrastructure , including high-speed trains , high-tech airports , fast highways , and top-notch green-energy networks . 
Its entrepreneurial class has pioneered business ventures , such as Inditex and Mercadona , whose models are case studies in the best business schools . 
Spain counts a fair number of successful , cutting-edge multinationals , from Ferrovial and FCC in public works to Iberdrola and Abengoa in the energy sector . 
It is also important to emphasize the political stability - and public maturity - that allowed aparty whose program called for rationalization of spending to win an absolute majority in the parliamentary election held six months ago . 
Spain &apos;s soccer victory was not a fluke but the culmination of a long evolution to emerge as a winning machine from its Francoist furia espa√±ola past . 
After Spain &apos;s victories at Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup , the national team demonstrated once again how diversity can coalesce into a winning formula through identification with a common goal . 
Spaniards in general , and particularly their political leaders , must rediscover what it takes to succeed . 
Dealt a difficult hand , Spain can overcome its critical situation only through collective hard work , responsibility , respect , and loyalty , thereby ensuring its standing in Europe and beyond .
