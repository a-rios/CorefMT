Realism on North Korea 
BERLIN - The world &apos;s task in addressing North Korea &apos;s saber rattling is made no easier by the fact that it confronts an impoverished and effectively defeated country . 
On the contrary , it is in such circumstances that calm foresight is most necessary . 
The genius of the Habsburg Empire &apos;s Prince Klemens von Metternich in framing a new international order after the Napoleonic Wars was that he did not push a defeated France into a corner . 
Although Metternich sought to deter any possible French resurgence , he restored France &apos;s prewar frontiers . 
By contrast , as Henry Kissinger has argued , the victors in World War I could neither deter a defeated Germany nor provide it with incentives to accept the Versailles Treaty . 
Instead , they imposed harsh terms , hoping to weaken Germany permanently . 
We know how that plan ended . 
John F. Kennedy was in the Metternich mold . 
During the Cuban missile crisis , he did not try to humiliate or win a total victory over the Soviet Union . 
Rather , he put himself in Nikita Khrushchev &apos;s shoes and agreed to dismantle , secretly , American missiles in Turkey and Italy in exchange for withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba . 
Kennedy &apos;s pragmatism prevented World War III . 
Sadly , North Korea has not received such far-sighted statesmanship . 
Faced with the North &apos;s dangerous nuclear game , we should ask what would have happened if , over the last 20 some years , the North Korea problem had been approached with the sagacity of Metternich and Kennedy . 
Of course , North Korea is not early-nineteenth century France or the USSR of 1962 . 
In the eyes of Western ( including Japanese ) political leaders , it has never amounted to more than a small , fringe country whose economic failings made it appear to be poised perpetually on the edge of self-destruction . 
For the most part , world leaders preferred not to be bothered with North Korea , and so reacted in an ad hoc way whenever it created a security problem . 
But now , following the North &apos;s recent nuclear tests , and given its improving ballistic-missile capabilities , that approach is no longer tenable . 
Perhaps the best chance to address the problem at an earlier stage was immediately after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in 1991 . 
Back then , Kim Il-sung - the North &apos;s founder - faced economic collapse , diminution of his conventional military forces , and diplomatic isolation . 
In interviews with Asahi Shimbun and The Washington Times in March and April 1992 , Kim clearly expressed a wish to establish diplomatic relations with the US . 
But US and South Korean leaders were not ready to accommodate Kim &apos;s overture . 
Their received ideas about North Korea prevented them from recognizing a fast-changing political reality . 
Another opportunity was missed later in the decade . 
If North Korea had reciprocated in a timely manner following US envoy William Perry &apos;s visit to Pyongyang in May 1999 , President Bill Clinton &apos;s policy of engagement with the North might have been upgraded to a push for normalization of diplomatic relations . 
Instead , the North procrastinated , sending Vice Marshall Jo Myong-rok to the US only in October 2000 , near the end of Clinton &apos;s presidency . 
A few months later , newly elected President George W. Bush reversed Clinton &apos;s North Korea policy . 
I still recall the difficulty that I faced , as South Korea &apos;s foreign minister , in convincing Bush administration policymakers to negotiate with North Korea instead of merely applying pressure and waiting for the North to capitulate . 
Back then , North Korea was restarting its Yongbyon nuclear facility and producing plutonium , thus strengthening its bargaining position vis-Ã -vis the US . 
Precious time was squandered before North Korea &apos;s first nuclear test in 2006 . 
Though Bush shifted his policy toward bilateral negotiations with the North a few months later , the Kim regime had become much more obstinate . 
Indeed , North Korea &apos;s behavior has since become even more volatile . 
Its sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan and the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010 were unprecedented , and raised inter-Korean tensions to their highest level in decades . 
Today , following the North &apos;s third nuclear test , we seem to have entered the most precarious stage yet , with the regime declaring that it will never surrender its nuclear option . 
So , what should be done ? 
The first option should be deterrence of further aggression through diplomacy . 
But achieving diplomatic deterrence will depend on China &apos;s cooperation , and this requires that China &apos;s vital national-security interests be recognized . 
China fears not only the social and economic consequences of a North Korean implosion , but also the strategic consequences of reunification - in particular , that the US military , through its alliance with South Korea , would gain access to territory on its border . 
A mere statement by the US that it has no intention to press this military advantage will not assuage China &apos;s fears . 
Chinese leaders recall that the US promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that German reunification and democratic transition in Eastern Europe would not mean eastward expansion of NATO . 
So a more concrete undertaking , one that preserves South Korea &apos;s bedrock security concerns , is needed . 
Only after its security is assured will China free itself from complicity in North Korean brinkmanship and be better able to control the North &apos;s behavior . 
But Chinese cooperation , though necessary , will not resolve the North Korea problem on its own . 
A comprehensive approach must recognize the speed of internal change , especially in the minds of ordinary North Koreans . 
Simply put , North Koreans are not as isolated as they once were , and have a growing appreciation of their impoverishment , owing primarily to greater trade and closer connections with booming China . 
This internal change needs to be encouraged , because it will prove more effective than external pressure in influencing the regime &apos;s behavior . 
But such encouragement must be undertaken in ways that do not incite the North &apos;s fears of being destroyed by indirect means . 
South Korean President Park Geun-hye &apos;s recent proposal to provide humanitarian assistance despite the recent spike in tension , is a start in the right direction . 
The lives of ordinary North Koreans matter as much as the security of North Korea &apos;s neighbors . 
A comprehensive approach is required - one that focuses as much on the human dimension as on the security dimension . 
It remains to be seen whether this approach requires more foresight and courage than today &apos;s political leaders in South Korea , the West , and China can muster .
