What Is Wrong With Sub-Saharan Africa ? 
The world &apos;s economic powers finally appear to be closing ranks behind efforts to address global poverty and economic underdevelopment . 
At this year &apos;s World Economic Forum , within the G-8 , and elsewhere , the consensus that something needs to be done has been as clear and as it is welcome . 
Basic indicators of economic and social development show SSA lagging far behind other developing areas . 
The average income per capita of SSA countries in 2000 was less than half that for all developing countries , about 40 % of the level of East Asian and Pacific developing countries , and less than 25 % that of Latin America and the Caribbean countries . 
Similarly , life expectancy at birth in SSA countries lagged 16 years behind the developing-country average , 14 years behind countries in South Asia , and 21 years behind countries in East Asia , Latin America , and the Caribbean . 
In combined gross enrolment in primary , secondary and higher education , SSA countries stood 19 % below the average for developing countries , 11 % below South Asian countries , 29 % below East Asia and the Pacific , and 32 % below Latin America and the Caribbean . 
What accounts for this broad-based underdevelopment ? 
Until the late 1800 &quot; s , most of Africa was unexplored and occupied by hunter-gatherers and practitioners of subsistence agriculture . 
Land was relatively abundant and allocated by tribal chiefs without regard to Western-style property rights . 
The only territorial units resembling those that exist today were Ethiopia , Liberia , and South Africa . 
During the burst of imperial expansion in Africa that followed national integration and trade liberalization in Europe , colonial powers showed little interest in delineating colonial national boundaries based on cultural or ethnic considerations ; they cared only about raw materials and markets . 
The Berlin Conference of 1885 fixed the borders of Europe &apos;s African colonies so that they included within them a large variety of languages , religions , and ethnic groups . 
Most SSA countries attained national independence some time after the end of the Second World War , as the British , French , Belgian , and Portuguese empires unraveled ( Germany had already lost its colonies after 1918 ) . 
Thus , SSA countries have only enjoyed independence for a short period in comparison with , say , South America , where countries had their wars of independence around 1810-1820 and achieved some type of constitutional government by 1850-1880 . 
The legacy of arbitrarily drawn borders and limited political centralization meant that in many SSA countries remnants of the colonial experience continue to play a big role in defining the institutional landscape , such as the civil service and public administration , educational system , and economic infrastructure . 
To be sure , many countries adopted English , French , or Portuguese as their official languages , and European missionaries , who often followed in the colonizers &quot; footsteps , had success in transmitting their religious practices to local populations . 
Nevertheless , linguistic variety and ethnic divisions remain more important than in most of the developing world , and tribal affiliation has continued to hinder the emergence of unifying national identities . 
Moreover , self-rule has not brought many democratically elected regimes . 
Instead , anti-colonial liberation leaders often developed personality cults and hogged power for decades . 
Monopolization of political power led , in turn , to rampant cronyism and corruption , which stifled economic and social development . 
Recent data on perceived corruption in public transactions show the SSA countries with the lowest average score for all developing regions . 
Only Botswana and Namibia achieved respectable scores , while the worst offenders were Cameroon , Uganda , Kenya , Angola , Madagascar , and Nigeria . 
Weak national unity has underpinned an even more damaging pattern . 
Since the 1990 &quot; s , many of the world &apos;s armed conflicts have taken place in SSA countries . 
Congo and Lesotho each experienced two conflicts during the decade , while civil strife ravaged Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Congo , and Sudan . 
This deterred not only foreign and domestic investment , but , more fundamentally , the formation of the very institutions needed for successful economic development . 
Sustained economic growth requires , everywhere , the accumulation of physical and human capital , as well as the acquisition of technological capabilities . 
This process does not occur in a historical vacuum , devoid of the influence of powerful social and political factors . 
Structure , institutions , and policies are critical determinants , as is the availability of qualified technical and administrative personnel . 
Indeed , the availability of a highly qualified bureaucracy in both South Korea and Taiwan - and before that in their model country , Japan - was a necessary precondition for achieving rapid economic growth . 
By contrast , the shortage in SSA of scientific , technical , and administrative skills , such as those of engineers , natural scientists , managers , and technicians , is a key reason why the East Asian &quot; miracle &quot; could not be reproduced there . 
None of the preconditions of economic development will be met in SSA until the legacy of colonialism and weak states that has defined the region is overcome . 
Developed countries can provide limited help by means of well-focused , untied aid and technical assistance projects . 
But success depends mainly on the emergence of dedicated , talented , and honest national and regional political leaders . 
Only such leaders can build up the legitimacy needed to unite their countries , and only then will they be able to confront head on the many challenges that the region faces in shaking loose from the shackles of backwardness .
