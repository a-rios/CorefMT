Defending a Divided Iraq 
OXFORD - The United States and its allies are facing another major policy challenge in Iraq . 
Airstrikes against the Islamic State might unseat the group &apos;s fighters in critical areas ; but , as things stand , troops will be needed to hold and govern liberated territory . 
Securing Iraq therefore requires a formidable force to be in place , which is why US President Barack Obama &apos;s strategy includes rebuilding the Iraqi army . 
But doing so will require overcoming three related obstacles : Iraqi leaders &quot; military inexperience ; corruption and cronyism ; and ambiguity regarding the extent of external support . 
When states collapse , their constituent parts sometimes inherit armed forces that are competent enough to maintain minimal levels of governance . 
This is more often the case when a state breaks up as a result of armed conflict , in which case stability depends on whether the best military leaders are allowed to remain in place . 
But states often collapse as an unintended consequence of the presence of a supporting external force . 
For example , following Vietnam &apos;s partition in the wake of France &apos;s defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 , Ngo Dinh Diem , Vietnam &apos;s last non-Communist president , was able to turn to the US military for support . 
A similar situation is evident in Iraq today . 
Divided by sectarianism , Iraq &apos;s armed forces have become unable and unwilling to fight . 
In the two years following the withdrawal of US troops , then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , like Diem four decades earlier , set about consolidating political power through patronage . 
Al-Maliki sought to protect the interests of Iraq &apos;s Shia at the expense of its Sunni citizens , appointing military leaders based on their tribal and sectarian affiliations rather than their merit . 
One might expect a leader who faces internal armed opposition to avoid doing anything that might weaken the military . 
But al-Maliki seems to have assumed that external forces would simply come to his aid should he run into trouble . 
With his lack of a military background , he seems not to have understood that external forces need to work closely with the local army , and that a sophisticated support network must be in place to avoid logistical disruptions resulting from enemy action or corruption . 
Viewing the situation from the ground - which is essential if security is to be restored and economic recovery is to be achieved - local militias must be able to defend themselves against rivals or criminal gangs . 
This means that the central government &apos;s role should be to provide more advanced security assets such as fixed or rotary air support , intelligence , and logistical and communications support . 
Yet the top priority for the leader of a fragmented state is to gain and consolidate a monopoly on the legitimate use of lethal force . 
And donor countries tend to support the leader , because doing so allows them to standardize and simplify assistance . 
Unfortunately , this approach seldom works . 
Instead , security experts should consider how best to manage the potential for violence among and within the various factions vying for local control . 
Strikingly , the reconfiguration of the security forces is usually ignored in post-war political settlements ( though this has been changing since Iraq &apos;s implosion ) . 
Indeed , though ethnic divisions can undermine military cohesion , a full appreciation of them can lead to a more robust and stable security environment . 
Kurds in Iraq &apos;s autonomous Kurdish region , for example , certainly feel more secure having their own soldiers , the Peshmerga , and have proven to be a better fighting force as a result . 
By contrast , the weak national Iraqi defense forces are believed to be doing the bidding of the Shia majority . 
Contested state breakups create tough policy problems , and there are no ideal outcomes . 
But if foreign powers wish to engage constructively , they must understand a country &apos;s internal politics and demographics , and address all affected groups &quot; security concerns equally and fairly . 
Failure to do so leaves everyone weak and vulnerable .
