A Greek Suicide ? 
LONDON - The good news is that a Greek default , which has become more likely after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras &quot; provocative rejection of what he described as the &quot; absurd &quot; bailout offer by Greece &apos;s creditors , no longer poses a serious threat to the rest of Europe . 
The bad news is that Tsipras does not seem to understand this . 
To judge by Tsipras &apos;s belligerence , he firmly believes that Europe needs Greece as desperately as Greece needs Europe . 
This is the true &quot; absurdity &quot; in the present negotiations , and Tsipras &quot; misapprehension of his bargaining power now risks catastrophe for his country , humiliation for his Syriza party , or both . 
The most likely outcome is that Tsipras will eat his words and submit to the conditions set by the &quot; troika &quot; ( the European Commission , European Central Bank , and the International Monetary Fund ) before the end of June . 
If not , the ECB will stop supporting the Greek banking system , and the government will run out of money to service foreign debts and , more dramatically , to pay Greek citizens their pensions and wages . 
Cut off from all external finance , Greece will become an economic pariah - the Argentina of Europe - and public pressure will presumably oust Syriza from power . 
This outcome is all the more tragic , given that the economic analysis underlying Syriza &apos;s demand for an easing of austerity was broadly right . 
Instead of seeking a face-saving compromise on softening the troika program , Tsipras wasted six months on symbolic battles over economically irrelevant issues such as labor laws , privatizations , even the name of the troika . 
This provocative behavior lost Greece all potential allies in France and Italy . 
Worse still , the time wasted on political grandstanding destroyed the primary budget surplus , which was Tsipras &apos;s trump card in the early negotiations . 
Now Tsipras thinks he holds another trump card : Europe &apos;s fear of a Greek default . 
Apparently , Varoufakis believes that his &quot; sophisticated grasp of game theory &quot; gives Greece a crucial advantage in &quot; the complicated dynamics &quot; of the negotiations . 
In fact , the game being played out in Europe is less like chess than like tic-tac-toe , where a draw is the normal outcome , but a wrong move means certain defeat . 
The rules of this game are much simpler than Varoufakis expected because of a momentous event that occurred in the same week as the Greek election . 
On January 22 , the ECB took decisive action to protect the eurozone from a possible Greek default . 
By announcing a huge program of bond purchases , much bigger relative to the eurozone bond market than the quantitative easing implemented in the United States , Britain , or Japan , ECB President Mario Draghi erected the impenetrable firewall that had long been needed to protect the monetary Union from a Lehman-style financial meltdown . 
The ECB &apos;s newfound ability to print money , essentially without limit , to support both banks and governments has reduced Greek contagion to insignificance . 
That represents a profound change in Europe &apos;s financial environment , which Greek politicians , along with many economic analysts , still fail to understand . 
Before the ECB &apos;s decision , contagion from Greece was a genuine threat . 
If the Greek government defaulted or tried to abandon the euro , Greece &apos;s banks would collapse , and Greeks who failed to get their money out of the country would lose their savings , as occurred in Cyprus in 2013 . 
When savers in other indebted euro countries such as Portugal and Spain observed this , they would fear similar losses and move their money to banks in Germany or Austria , as well as sell their holdings of Portuguese or Spanish government bonds . 
As a result , the debtor countries &quot; bond prices would collapse , interest rates would soar , and banks would be threatened with collapse . 
If the contagion from Greece intensified , the next-weakest country , probably Portugal , would find itself unable to support its banking system or pay its debts . 
In extremis , it would abandon the euro , following the Greek example . 
Before January , this sequence of events was quite likely , but the ECB &apos;s bond-buying program put a firebreak at each point of the contagion process . 
If holders of Portuguese bonds are alarmed by a future Greek default , the ECB will simply increase its bond buying ; with no limit to its buying power , it will easily overwhelm any selling pressure . 
If savers in Portuguese banks start moving their money to Germany , the ECB will recycle these euros back to Portugal through interbank deposits . 
Again , there is no limit to how much money the ECB can recycle , provided Portuguese banks remain solvent - which they will , so long as the ECB continues to buy Portuguese government bonds . 
In short , the ECB bond-buying program has transformed the ECB from a passive observer of the euro crisis , paralyzed by the outdated legalistic constraints of the Maastricht Treaty , into a proper lender of last resort . 
With powers to monetize government debts similar to those exercised by the US Federal Reserve , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of England , the ECB can now guarantee the eurozone against financial contagion . 
Unfortunately for Greece , this has been lost on the Tsipras government . 
Greek politicians who still see the threat of financial contagion as their trump card should note the coincidence of the Greek election and the ECB &apos;s bond-buying program and draw the obvious conclusion . 
The ECB &apos;s new policy was designed to protect the euro from the consequences of a Greek exit or default . 
The latest Greek negotiating strategy is to demand a ransom to desist threatening suicide . 
Such blackmail might work for a suicide bomber .
