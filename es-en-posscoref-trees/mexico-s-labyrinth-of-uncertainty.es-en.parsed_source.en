Mexico \ u0027s Labyrinth of Uncertainty 
What makes countries grow is perhaps the most fascinating issue in economics , and one of tremendous political-indeed , geopolitical-importance as well . 
In pondering this question , the case of Mexico-neither an economic tiger like China or Singapore nor a sluggard like many African and Carribean countries-may be especially instructive . 
On a recent trip to Mexico I spoke to many Mexicans about the state of their economy and about their hopes for the future . 
I asked about their long-term expectations , and about their thoughts concerning Mexico &apos;s economic prospects in the decades ahead . 
What I heard suggested that the dominant feeling for most Mexicans is one of a great uncertainty about their future-perhaps the very uncertainty at the root of our imperfect knowledge about growth in general . 
Mexicans seem to believe that they could be living at close to US living standards in another few decades . 
But they find it equally likely that their living standards might drop even lower than they are today . 
This mixture of optimism and fear applies to everyone , Mexican businesses and Mexican families alike . 
People do have strong reasons to be optimistic . 
The 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) between Mexico , the US , and Canada helped Mexico &apos;s economy recover quickly from the 1994-95 peso crisis . 
Indeed , NAFTA membership has proven to be so popular that Mexico &apos;s government has forged many other free trade agreements , including one with the EU in 2000 . 
So Mexico &apos;s current economic slowdown appears to reflect nothing more than weak global conditions . 
In fact , the economy has shown signs of recovery recently . 
If these are sustained , Mexico should soon find itself on a solid upward path . 
Once again , Mexicans can thank NAFTA for the quick recovery . 
True , NAFTA is only an economic-not a political - union , and no symbolic gesture like the creation of a common currency is contemplated . 
But the obvious advantages of economic integration with the prosperous US are no less important to Mexico &apos;s economic stability and development than accession to the EU is for countries like Poland , Latvia , or Slovakia . 
Indeed , the most important benefit of NAFTA for Mexico is that it represents a long-term commitment among the three member countries to work together . 
With over 20 million Mexicans in the US already , and with Hispanic voters so potent a political force that President Bush makes a show of speaking Spanish , that commitment appears genuine . 
But alongside those strong grounds for optimism are significant worries . 
As Pedro Aspe , a much-admired former finance minister , emphasized to me , NAFTA did give a sudden boost to Mexico &apos;s economy at the outset . 
Labor productivity soared , as Mexicans were forced to adapt to the rules of the US economy in order to compete . 
But that improvement appears to have been only a so-called &quot; impact effect . &quot; 
Mexican productivity growth has since fallen back to its levels in the 1980 &apos;s . 
Mexicans also point to their economy &apos;s disappointing growth on a per capita basis since 1982 . 
Twenty years is a long time to have almost no economic growth . 
It was also a time when many Mexicans were abandoning their economy and leaving to work in the US . 
Meanwhile , China , a country with more than ten times Mexico &apos;s population , managed to grow spectacularly in this period . 
Why , Mexicans ask , should their country &apos;s growth have been so disappointing-and this just as they were establishing free-market institutions , privatizing assets , and developing a more robust democracy ? 
China &apos;s one-child policy must have been an advantage for its per capita GDP growth , allowing more time to be spent on business activities rather than childrearing . 
But Mexico has recently also shown a sharp decline in population growth rates , as Mexican women opt for more birth control and smaller families . 
Mexicans &apos; obsession with China is no accident . 
China &apos;s much lower labor costs mean that Mexican jobs and income levels are directly at risk . 
Mexican autoworkers earn three times as much as Chinese autoworkers . 
So Mexico &apos;s auto industry must make huge advances in productivity if it is to maintain the same wage level in the future . 
Part of Mexico &apos;s problem is due to suffering two major financial crises since 1982 : the Less-Developed-Country Debt crisis of the early 1980 &apos;s and the peso crisis of 1994-95 . 
Both were random hits generated by sudden shifts in investor confidence ; both represented big setbacks that required years to recover from fully . 
Worse , no one can be sure that such setbacks will not occur again . 
Confidence crises beget the risk of further confidence crises . 
More political and legal change is needed if confidence is to have a more solid footing . 
For example , corruption in all economic sectors-as well as government and labor unions-impedes growth by destroying trust . 
This means that personal and family connections mean a lot more in Mexican business than they do elsewhere , which prevents people from moving freely through the economy to exploit their personal talents . 
Mexicans generally do not want to go to college abroad because they would miss opportunities to form the necessary bonds with other Mexicans . 
But if corruption were reduced and social trust strengthened , such inhibitions would become irrelevant , and investor confidence would rise . 
Moreover , though Mexico elected its first president , Vicente Fox , from an opposition party after 71 years of one-party rule , this new democratic government appears ineffective . 
No party has a majority in the Chamber of Deputies . 
Political bickering seems to take priority over action . 
Disaffection with an ineffective government might lead voters to acquiesce in a more authoritarian government . 
Little wonder , then , that Mexicans express fundamental uncertainty about where their country is heading . 
That uncertainty will be a major factor in how Mexico &apos;s economy does or does not develop .
