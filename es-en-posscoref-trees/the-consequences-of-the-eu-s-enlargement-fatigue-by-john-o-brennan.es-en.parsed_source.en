Will Europe End in Croatia ? 
MAYNOOTH , IRELAND - Despite its many woes , the European Union remains a lodestar for poorer states outside its borders . 
Indeed , the gravitational pull of the EU &apos;s enlargement process has been the most important factor in the reconstitution of economic , political , and civic life in the western Balkans since the end of the post-Yugoslav wars of the 1990 &quot; s . 
Croatia &apos;s accession to the EU on July 1 provides a welcome boost to a region that has been placed on the back burner as a result of &quot; enlargement fatigue &quot; and the EU &apos;s crisis-induced introspection . 
Enlargement advocates also point to the deal signed by Kosovo and Serbia in April as another key development in unlocking the Balkans &quot; European future . 
The decisive break with more than a decade of war and confrontation came in December 2012 , when Kosovo and Serbia began to implement an agreement on border control . 
The April agreement goes further by establishing a power-sharing arrangement in northern Kosovo that is designed to bolster local self-government through an association of Serb-majority municipalities while providing new arrangements for policing and the judiciary . 
The just-concluded meeting of the European Council acknowledged the progress made by both Serbia and Kosovo , with the Serbs being given a ( somewhat conditional ) start date for accession negotiations and Kosovo to begin a &quot; pre-screening &quot; process . 
The EU bet here is that , on the back of Croatia &apos;s accession , the enlargement logjam in the western Balkans will finally be broken . 
But enlargement fatigue among the member states continues to muddy this optimistic forecast . 
Although more than three-quarters of the EU &apos;s member states are former enlargement countries , the Union &apos;s expansion is no longer viewed as an unalloyed success story . 
On the contrary , it is often presented as a bridge too far . 
In fact , enlargement fatigue has been the dominant feature of EU relations with the western Balkan states and explains why the accession process has been flat-lining along a path of frozen negotiations and mutual mistrust toward an increasingly uncertain destination . 
This remains the case even after Croatia &apos;s accession . 
Enlargement fatigue entered the European political lexicon in the wake of the dramatic failures of the French and Dutch referenda on the EU Constitutional Treaty in 2005 . 
The seismic shock of the treaty &apos;s rejection by two original EU members cried out for a scapegoat , and the &quot; big bang &quot; enlargement completed the previous year - in which eight post-communist countries ( along with Cyprus and Malta ) joined simultaneously - seemed a good place to put the blame . 
Suddenly , Polish plumbers were inundating the &quot; old &quot; member states . 
The western Balkan applicants have thus had to contend with a process that is now managed on a more intergovernmental basis than was the big bang of 2004 , and which has , at times , been held hostage to member states &quot; selfish bilateral demands . 
Enlargement was traditionally viewed as an area where national interests would be more readily set aside than in conventional EU settings : the normative dimension of the process seemed to demand a more community-oriented approach to decision-making . 
Enlargement is now more easily politicized in individual member states , and this is especially the case where there is a groundswell of Euro-skepticism upon which to draw . 
The European Council , rather than the European Commission , is increasingly setting the benchmarks for delineating progress in accession talks , thus largely determining the pace at which negotiations proceed . 
This intergovernmental mode of enlargement decision-making was evident as Slovenia made significant maritime territorial demands of Croatia . 
It can also be seen in the continuing Greek objections to Macedonia &apos;s name and the Bundestag &apos;s insistence on approving the progress of individual applicant states - a demand that has complicated relations with Turkey enormously . 
There is ample evidence from earlier enlargement rounds of the transformative power of the EU to democratize and &quot; Europeanize &quot; states in advance of their accessions . 
They must be willing to bear the costs of implementation because they believe that the benefits to their countries as EU members ( or to themselves as political actors ) will be realized . 
So the EU &apos;s promise of membership simply has to be credible if accession-driven reforms are to succeed and EU norms internalized in applicant states . 
The EU &apos;s real problem in the western Balkans is that the promise ( of membership ) made to aspiring states in 2003 is no longer sufficient to counter the currents of enlargement fatigue , which has led to reform fatigue , slowing the progress of the region &apos;s applicants to a virtual standstill . 
Indeed , unlike in previous accession rounds , the EU has provided no concrete timetable for achieving the promise of membership made in Thessaloniki ten years ago . 
Rather , the process remains open and indeterminate . 
EU Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighborhood Policy Štefan Füle insists that enlargement is progressing , but the western Balkans remains a fragile region , defined by mutually antagonistic nationalisms , incomplete state formation , deep and pervasive patterns of corruption , and endemic economic mismanagement . 
As the EU celebrates the accession of Croatia - which will undoubtedly provide a short-term boost to the reform process throughout the western Balkans - it faces a profound choice in its engagement with the region . 
It can reinvigorate the spirit of earlier enlargement rounds , or it can succumb to enlargement fatigue . 
Either way , the region &apos;s future hangs in the balance .
