Russia &apos;s Lawless Legality 
MOSCOW - Colonel Yuri Budanov is a convicted rapist and murderer . 
After serving half his prison sentence for the rape and murder of an 18-year-old Chechen , Elsa Kungayeva , he was released last December . 
Svetlana Bakhmina was a lawyer at Yukos , the oil company formerly run by Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
In 2004 , she was arrested and , in 2006 , sentenced to six and a half years on embezzlement and tax fraud charges . 
Like Budanov , she applied for early release from prison in 2008 . 
Her request was refused , as was her earlier plea in 2006 to suspend her sentence until her two small sons reached the age of 14 - a request she was entitled to make under Russian law . 
Vasily Aleksanyan was Executive Vice President of Yukos , and , as a lawyer , defended Khodorkovsky and his partner , Platon Lebedev , after their arrest in 2003 . 
He was subsequently disbarred and was himself arrested in April 2006 . 
By that time , Aleksanyan was critically ill with AIDS , for which treatment was withheld . 
In December 2008 , the Moscow City Court approved his release on bail of 50 million rubles ( around $ 1,775,000 at the time ) . 
Finally , consider Khodorkovsky and Lebedev themselves . 
Arrested in 2003 , they were sentenced in 2005 to eight years in prison on charges of tax fraud . 
They are serving their sentence in Chita on the Chinese border , although Russian law prescribes that , for the crimes with which they were charged , they were entitled to be imprisoned near their place of domicile , i.e. , in Moscow . 
When Dmitry Medvedev was elected as Russia &apos;s president a little more than a year ago , he promised to do away with the &quot; legal nihilism &quot; in Russia . 
Although he was a close confidante of Vladimir Putin and probably was able to assume presidential office exclusively for that reason , many dared to hope that he would stop the vendetta against Khodorkovsky and all those who had been close to him . 
Disillusion fully set in only one year after Medvedev &apos;s election , when a new case against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev was brought , this time for embezzlement of billions and money laundering . 
A cynical observer remarked at the preliminary hearing that by the looks of it the Russian authorities couldn &apos;t make up their mind : either the former Yukos bosses didn &apos;t pay taxes or they embezzled money . 
But since when does one pay taxes on embezzled funds ? 
The courtroom where the new trial against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev is taking place is slightly larger than a spacious classroom . 
And it is full of heavily armed guards . 
Every day , they are brought into the courtroom handcuffed like dangerous felons . 
One cannot help but contrast this with Budanov , the rapist and murderer who is now free to move about Russia at will . 
The judge refused without comment requests by the defense to remove the cage and to replace one of the prosecutors , who had already been a prosecuting counsel during the first trial . 
So the authorities &quot; aim seems clear : put Khodorkovsky and Lebedev away for a much longer time - more than 20 years if they are convicted . 
Few doubt that they will be . 
Still , this new trial of course is also a test case for Medvedev &apos;s presidency . 
So far , he has done nothing to counteract the legal nihilism against which he himself has spoken . 
But maybe he will in the course of this trial , which resembles a personal vendetta even more than the first one did . 
To be sure , Khodorkovsky is no saint . 
Like many others in Russia who are allowed to enjoy their wealth in peace today ( or maybe are lamenting its loss due to the financial crisis ) , he made his money in thoroughly obscure ways during the early post-Soviet years . 
But , instead of buying villas , yachts , or soccer clubs abroad , he invested his fortune in Russia . 
Of course , he did mainly fill his own pockets - and his social and political activities certainly were not entirely altruistic , either . 
But what made him public enemy number one for Putin was his desire to move Russia in a political direction that he viewed as positive and desirable . 
It was his ambition to subject the country to truly far-reaching social and political reforms that sealed his downfall and also brought about this new trial , which appears intended to silence him for good . 
Medvedev &apos;s presidency will inevitably be measured by this case . 
Will he tolerate and endorse his prime minister &apos;s personal aversions , or is he willing to put an end to the infamous spectacle of a judicial process that has been manipulated and abused from beginning to end ? 
Little speaks for the latter scenario , but Russia has always been a country where hope dies last .
