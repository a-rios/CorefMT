Europe &apos;s German Ball and Chain 
BRUSSELS - A storm-tossed ship near dangerous cliffs needs a strong anchor to avoid finishing on the rocks . 
In 2012 , when a financial storm engulfed the eurozone , it was Germany that kept the European ship off the shoals of financial disaster . 
But now Europe &apos;s anchor has become a brake , hindering forward movement . 
Of course , German Chancellor Angela Merkel acted in 2012 only when she could tell her domestic constituency that there was no alternative . 
But in the end , Merkel agreed to a permanent bailout fund for the eurozone . 
She also backed the formation of a banking union , which remains incomplete but still represents a key step toward a financial system supervised by the European Central Bank . 
Thanks to these measures , and ECB President Mario Draghi &apos;s vow , which Germany tacitly approved , to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro , the financial storm abated . 
But now the eurozone seems incapable of escaping near-deflation , with little economic growth and prices barely moving upwards . 
That was not supposed to happen . 
When the crisis struck , the economies of the eurozone periphery were buffeted by the twin shocks of spiking risk premiums and a collapsing housing market . 
At the same time , the German economy benefited from the return of capital fleeing the periphery . 
Real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates in Germany became substantially negative , triggering a housing boom . 
It was assumed that this would generate strong domestic demand in Germany , helping the periphery to export more . 
Instead , the German economy has barely grown ; indeed , weaker world trade threatens to put it in recession . 
The current-account surplus , which was supposed to decline sharply , has actually increased , as savings have remained higher - and investment lower - than expected . 
Another problem , at least from the point of view of the rest of the eurozone , is that inflation in Germany remains too low . 
With German prices rising at less than 1 % annually , the eurozone periphery needs falling prices in order to regain the competitiveness lost during the pre-2008 boom years . 
This lack of dynamism at the core of the eurozone has now become its key problem . 
With no growth in Germany , the rest of the eurozone might not be able to reduce debt via external surpluses . 
And there might be no solution short of a magic button to increase German domestic demand . 
Obviously , the German government is in charge of the country &apos;s public finances . 
But fiscal policy has been roughly neutral in recent years , and thus cannot be blamed for the German economy &apos;s lack of dynamism . 
This year , the public-sector budget might move from a small deficit to what German officials call a &quot; black zero &quot; - a very small surplus . 
But this tightening by a fraction of a percentage point of GDP implies no adverse effect on growth . 
The root cause of Germany &apos;s sluggish economic performance in recent years is the continuing unwillingness of its households and enterprises to consume and invest . 
And it is difficult to see what the government can do about this . 
Indeed , investment has fallen despite financing conditions for enterprises that have never been easier , both in terms of ultra-low interest rates and banks &quot; willingness to lend . 
Yet Germany &apos;s corporate sector remains reluctant to borrow and invest in the country , because it sees little reason to expect long-term economic growth , given that the population is set to decline and productivity gains remain anemic . 
With investment unlikely to become a motor for the German economy , consumption holds the key to stronger demand growth in Germany . 
Its weakness is somewhat surprising : real incomes are up , and the coalition government that came to power last year has introduced a series of generous welfare measures , including a large increase in the minimum wage , a reduction of the retirement age , and a special top-up pension for women with children . 
But even these measures , which foreign observers have largely overlooked , have failed to boost consumer demand . 
So what more could the German government do to wean the Germans off their abstemious habits ? 
Public investment is the one area where the government could act . 
But the growth fillip from public-sector infrastructure spending can only be modest . 
Increasing infrastructure spending by a quarter , which would represent a huge administrative effort , would lift GDP growth by just 0.4 percentage points . 
The main danger now is political . 
A weak German economy makes the necessary structural adjustments in the eurozone periphery much more difficult . 
That , in turn , fuels the perception that responsibility lies with the German government , which is seen as unwilling to take the steps needed to strengthen domestic demand - even as it prohibits the periphery governments from spending more themselves . 
As unemployment remains stubbornly high and incomes stagnate in much of the eurozone , the temptation to blame &quot; the Germans &quot; is becoming ever stronger . 
The German government , no surprise , does not even acknowledge that there is a problem . 
With unemployment remaining near record lows , the lack of demand growth is simply dismissed , and the absence of inflation is taken as a sign of success . 
This is a mistake . 
Europe &apos;s German anchor has become stuck , and the rising tide of anxiety among Germany &apos;s partners should not leave its government indifferent .
