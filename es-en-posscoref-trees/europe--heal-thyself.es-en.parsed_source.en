Europe , Heal Thyself 
BRUSSELS - European policymakers like to extol the strength of the eurozone : relative to the United States , it has a much lower fiscal deficit ( 4 % of GDP , compared to almost 10 % for the US ) . 
Moreover , unlike the US , the eurozone does not have an external deficit , which means that the monetary union holds enough savings to finance all of its members &quot; budget deficits and resolve their debt problems . 
But , despite this relative strength , the European Union &apos;s leaders seem incapable of resolving the eurozone &apos;s sovereign-debt crisis . 
Despite meeting after meeting , heads of state and finance ministers have failed to reassure markets . 
Now , Europe &apos;s policymakers are appealing for help from the International Monetary Fund and Asian investors . 
This appeal for outside help is misguided , given the reasons why the euro crisis has gone from bad to worse , despite the EU &apos;s abundant resources . 
The key problem is the distribution of savings within the eurozone . 
The countries north of the Alps have excess savings , but Northern European savers do not want to finance indebted Southern European countries like Italy , Spain , and Greece . 
That is why the risk premium on Italian and other Southern European debt had risen at one time to 5 % , and why , at the same time , the German government can issue short-term debt at negative real interest rates . 
Northern Europeans &quot; reluctance to invest in their southern neighbors is the problem behind the problem . 
The German government could change this if it were willing to guarantee all Italian , Spanish , and other eurozone debt . 
But it is understandably loath to do so , owing to the high risk involved . 
The European Central Bank could also help solve the problem by agreeing to buy debt that has been shunned by financial markets . 
But , like Germany , the ECB understandably lacks enthusiasm about this solution . 
So the standoff continues , and the crisis worsens . 
The world &apos;s major central banks recently agreed to make more dollar liquidity available , mostly to European banks . 
This has eased the immediate liquidity crisis , but the fundamental debt problem remains , because the Italian government cannot fund itself at reasonable interest rates . 
Because the eurozone finance ministers could not agree on an internal solution , their latest idea is to call on the IMF to finance an extra-large support package for Italy . 
But this might be wishful thinking . 
Why should the IMF &apos;s non-European members agree to finance a massive support program for a member of the G-7 and the eurozone that has no external balance-of-payments problem and stronger public finances than most other developed countries ? 
A month ago , the eurozone &apos;s heads of state arrived at another way to appeal for foreign funds : the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) could package euro debt and sell it to foreign investors such as the Chinese and other Asian central banks . 
Here the same question arises : Why should China buy Italian debt when Germany shuns it ? 
Even if China agreed to buy the debt , it would likely consider buying some of the special paper that the EFSF plans to issue only if it obtained some political concessions and an implicit guarantee from Germany . 
But it makes no sense for Germany to pay a political price for doing something - guaranteeing other countries &quot; debt - that it has consistently refused to do . 
The political concessions that China would probably demand - for example , EU recognition of the country as a market economy , or a greater voice within the IMF - may be overdue . 
Nevertheless , these issues should not be linked to the eurozone &apos;s inability to solve its own problems . 
Moreover , a large inflow of funds from the IMF , China , or elsewhere could do more harm than good to the extent that it puts upward pressure on the euro &apos;s exchange rate - and thus makes recovery in the crisis countries even more difficult . 
German growth could survive a stronger euro , because its exports are much less price-sensitive , but countries such as Italy and Greece , which must compete on price , would be weakened further . 
Europe &apos;s policymakers cannot offshore the eurozone &apos;s problems . 
Europeans can and must deal with this crisis themselves . 
One option discussed these days is a special fund , financed by the ECB &apos;s major national central banks and placed at the IMF &apos;s disposal to help Italy and Spain . 
This would harness the ECB &apos;s resources without formally violating the EU &apos;s Lisbon Treaty , which forbids central-bank financing for governments . 
This plan would have the advantage of forcing the eurozone to rely on its own resources . 
But it would also fully expose Europe &apos;s political weakness and lack of coherence . 
Indeed , if it turns out that a detour through the IMF is needed to allow the ECB to provide liquidity to countries like Italy and Spain , the rest of the world will ask why Europe cannot be more candid about the ECB &apos;s central role in this crisis . 
Good question .
