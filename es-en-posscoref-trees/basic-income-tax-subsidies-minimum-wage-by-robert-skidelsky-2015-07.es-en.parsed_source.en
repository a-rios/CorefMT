Minimum Wage or Living Income ? 
LONDON - Most rich countries now have millions of &quot; working poor &quot; - people whose jobs do not pay enough to keep them above the poverty line , and whose wages therefore have to be subsidized by the state . 
The idea is a very old one . 
England implemented its &quot; Speenhamland &quot; system - a form of outdoor relief intended to offset rising bread prices - during the Napoleonic Wars . 
In 1795 , the authorities of Speenhamland , a village in Berkshire , authorized a means-tested sliding scale of wage supplements . 
But the scheme was criticized for allowing employers to pay below-subsistence wages , because the taxpayer would make up the difference . 
In 1834 , the Speenhamland system was replaced by the New Poor Law , which confined relief to workhouses , under conditions sufficiently odious to force people back into the labor market . 
Then , in the twentieth century , the Speenhamland principle was revived - and by none other than the free-market liberal Milton Friedman . 
In 1962 , Friedman proposed a &quot; negative income tax , &quot; whereby people earning below a certain threshold would receive supplemental income from the government , rather than paying taxes to it . 
The idea was to get people off the dole and back to work . 
It was implemented as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States and the Working Families Tax Credit in the United Kingdom . 
At the same time , there have been efforts to raise the level of earned income by setting minimum-wage legislation . 
But the minimum wage has never reached the floor set for a &quot; living income &quot; and has not , therefore , appreciably reduced the bill for wage subsidies . 
In 2008 , about 5.5 million working families in the UK received tax credits , including working and child credits , housing benefits , and local tax benefits . 
Austerity policies have reduced this number to 4.3 million . 
Given that there were 11.4 million working households in the UK in 2012 , this means that an astonishing 38 % did not receive a &quot; living wage . &quot; 
Or , to put it another way : the market-clearing wage was unable to provide a living income for 38 % of working families . 
These are the &quot; working poor . &quot; 
In his July 8 budget announcement , Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne proposed to cut £ 12 billion ( $ 18.6 billion ) from the welfare bill over the next four years as part of his deficit-cutting plan . 
To offset this cut , Osborne proposed to raise the minimum wage from £ 6.50 per hour to £ 9 per hour over the same period . 
The increase will fall on employers , not the public purse , and so the reduction in credits and benefits is a net gain for Her Majesty &apos;s Treasury . 
An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has concluded that while the Treasury will save £ 12 billion , the gross increase in pay from the higher minimum wage amounts to only £ 4 billion . 
As Paul Johnson , head of the IFS , put it : &quot; There is simply not enough money going into the new minimum wage to anywhere near compensate in cash terms people on tax credits . &quot; 
But even if the minimum wage were raised sufficiently to offset the withdrawal of tax credits , transferring more of the cost of labor from taxpayers to employers would be the wrong strategy . 
The reason is that for many - perhaps most - people , work will be a declining source of income . 
After all , one prediction on which we can confidently rely is that automation will make increasingly large inroads into the world of human work . 
Up to 50 % of existing jobs may be at risk in the next 20 years . 
It is at least an open question whether enough new jobs can be found to replace them , or , indeed , whether it is desirable to continue producing more and more products simply to provide human employment at ever shrinking wages . 
As robots increasingly replace human labor , humans will need incomes to replace wages from work . 
Whereas tax credits point in the direction of replacement incomes , raising the minimum wage points in the opposite direction , by making income more dependent on jobs . 
In fact , focusing on the minimum wage would almost certainly speed up the automation process . 
Previous evidence that minimum-wage legislation does not reduce the demand for labor might not stand up against the rapidly falling cost of automating the production of goods and services . 
In short , if Osborne is serious about his pledge to provide a &quot; living income &quot; for all , he should be moving toward the idea of a &quot; basic &quot; or &quot; citizen &apos;s &quot; income , independent of the job market . 
A simple way forward would be to provide all citizens an unconditional tax credit , which could be built up gradually as the rewards from work fall . 
Both free-market and socialist thinkers have long advocated implementing a basic-income scheme . 
But the idea has always fallen foul of two objections : societies are too poor to afford it , and it would be a disincentive to work . 
The first objection is surely no longer true of the advanced economies , while the second is irrelevant , given that the goal is not to strengthen the incentive to work , but to enable people to live without work . 
An unconditional basic income would make part-time work a possibility for many who now have to work full-time at non-living wages . 
And all workers would begin to gain the freedom to make the same choices regarding how much to work , and under what conditions , that owners of substantial capital now have .
