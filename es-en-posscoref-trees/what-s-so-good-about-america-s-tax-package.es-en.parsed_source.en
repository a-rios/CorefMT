What &apos;s So Good about America &apos;s Tax Package ? 
CAMBRIDGE -The tax package agreed to by President Barack Obama and his Republican opponents in the United States Congress represents the right mix of an appropriate short-run fiscal policy and a first step toward longer-term fiscal prudence . 
The key feature of the agreement is to continue the existing 2010 income-tax rates for another two years with no commitment about what will happen to tax rates after that . 
Without that agreement , tax rates would have reverted in 2011 to the higher level that prevailed before the Bush tax cuts of 2001 . 
Because America &apos;s GDP has recently been growing at an annual rate of only about 2 % - and final sales at only about 1 % - such a tax increase would probably have pushed the US economy into a new recession . 
Although the new tax law is generally described as a fiscal stimulus , it is more accurate to say that it avoids a large immediate fiscal contraction . 
The long-term implications of the agreement stand in sharp contrast both to Obama &apos;s February 2010 budget proposal and to the Republicans &quot; counter-proposal . 
Obama wanted to continue the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpayers except those with annual incomes over $ 250,000 . 
The Republicans proposed continuing the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpayers . 
By agreeing to limit the current tax rates for just two years , the tax package reduces the projected national debt at the end of the decade ( relative to what it would have been with the Obama budget ) by some $ 2 trillion or nearly 10 % of GDP in 2020 . 
That reduction in potential deficits and debt can by itself give a boost to the economy in 2011 by calming fears that an exploding national debt would eventually force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates - perhaps sharply if foreign buyers of US Treasuries suddenly became frightened by the deficit prospects . 
The official budget arithmetic will treat the agreement on personal-income tax rates as a $ 450 billion increase in the deficit , making it seem like a big fiscal stimulus . 
It would be a fiscal stimulus only if taxpayers had previously expected that Congress and the administration would allow the tax rates to rise - an unlikely prospect , given the highly adverse effects that doing so would have had on the currently weak economy . 
Even for those taxpayers who had feared a tax increase in 2011 and 2012 , it is not clear how much the lower tax payments will actually boost consumer spending . 
The previous temporary tax cuts in 2008 and 2009 appear to have gone largely into saving and debt reduction rather than increased spending . 
It is surprising , therefore , that forecasters raised their GDP growth forecasts for 2011 significantly on the basis of the tax agreement . 
A typical reaction was to raise the forecast for 2011 from 2.5 % to 3.5 % . 
While an increase of this magnitude would be plausible if a forecaster had previously expected tax rates to increase in 2011 , it would not have been reasonable to forecast 2.5 % growth in the first place with that assumption in mind . 
So , either the initial 2.5 % forecast was too high or the increase of one percentage point is too large . 
What is true of the agreement is also true of the decision , as part of that agreement , to maintain unemployment insurance benefits for the long-term unemployed . 
This , too , is essentially just a continuation of the status quo . 
No new benefit has been created . 
The most substantial potential boost to spending comes from a temporary reduction of the payroll tax , lowering the rate paid by employees on income up to about $ 100,000 from 6.2 % to 4.2 % . 
Because this tax cut will take the form of lower withholding from weekly or monthly wages , it may seem more permanent than it really is , and therefore have a greater impact on spending than households &quot; very feeble response to the previous temporary tax changes . 
The final component of the agreement is temporary acceleration of tax depreciation , allowing firms in 2011 to write off 100 % of capital investment immediately , in contrast to the current rule , which stipulates a 50 % immediate write-off , followed by depreciation of the remaining 50 % over the statutory life of the equipment . 
A greater stimulus to business investment may come from the perception that Obama &apos;s agreement to extend the personal-income tax cuts for high-income individuals signals his administration &apos;s reduced antagonism to business and the wealthy . 
Obama &apos;s recent statement that he favors reforming personal and corporate taxes by lowering rates and broadening the tax base reinforces that impression . 
Let &apos;s hope that &apos;s true .
