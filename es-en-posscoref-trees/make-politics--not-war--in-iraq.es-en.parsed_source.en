Make Politics , Not War , in Iraq 
The United States is once again learning the limits of military power . 
In Iraq , America has unrivaled control of the air , but can &apos;t hold the ground . 
Its mere presence incites violence . 
While President George W. Bush believes that he has protected Americans by &quot; taking the war to the enemy , &quot; more than 1,700 Americans have died in the Iraq war , which also has provoked terrorist attacks on US allies . 
The Bush administration &apos;s mistake , of course , is to neglect politics in its war calculations , or to follow blindly the dictum that war is politics by other means . 
In fact , most war is a failure of politics , a failure of political imagination . 
Given their self-righteousness and lack of historical and cultural awareness , Bush and his advisors believed that invading Iraq would be easy , that Saddam Hussein &apos;s military would crumble , and that the US would be welcomed as a liberator . 
They failed to comprehend that Iraq has long been an occupied and externally manipulated country . 
As a result , Iraqis understandably regard the American-led occupation as just another episode of outside exploitation . 
It is widely accepted that oil , not terror , was the original motivation of the war - a war planned by Mr. Bush &apos;s senior advisors during the 1990 &quot; s , and made possible by their accession to power in 2001 . 
Through the 1990 &quot; s , US Vice President Dick Cheney and others made clear that Saddam &apos;s reign threatened America &apos;s oil security by forcing over-reliance on Saudi Arabia . 
Iraq &apos;s vast reserves , went the argument , could not be developed safely until Saddam was deposed . 
The September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the US provided the green light , not the underlying motivation . 
The Iraqis sense all of this . 
Bush &apos;s refusal to set a deadline for withdrawing troops is not taken as a sign of resolve , but as a statement of America &apos;s intent to remain in Iraq , establish a puppet regime , control the country &apos;s oil and set up permanent military bases . 
That won &apos;t work . 
There are simply too many real political forces on the ground in Iraq for America to manage , and these forces are increasingly demanding a timetable for US withdrawal , as are legions of Iraqis in the course of public protests and mosque worships . 
Every time the US reiterates its refusal to set a deadline for withdrawal , it simply stokes political opposition , not to mention the insurgency . 
There are too many Iraqis ready to fight and die to oppose the American presence . 
Only politics , not arms , can calm the scene . 
Vietnam is a true precedent here . 
Vietnamese deaths and casualties outnumbered American deaths and casualties by perhaps 20 to one , but the US still could not subdue the nationalist adversary that they faced . 
The US could bomb Vietnam &apos;s cities to rubble , as it can Iraq &apos;s cities , but this solves nothing , claims vast numbers of innocent lives , and confirms the view of Americans as occupiers . 
All of this has an economic angle as well . 
American foreign policy doctrine states that US national security rests on three pillars : defense , diplomacy , and development . 
Economic aid for poor nations is crucial , because poverty provides the tinder for violence , conflict , and even terrorism . 
Yet diplomacy and development take a distant second and third place behind defense - or more accurately , military - approaches in US foreign policy spending . 
The US will devote approximately $ 500 billion , or 5 % of GNP , to military spending this year - half of the world &apos;s total . 
In other words , the US spends as much on arms as the rest of the world combined . 
By contrast , the US spends just $ 18 billion , roughly 0.16 % of GNP , on development aid . 
In Europe , by contrast , military spending is roughly 2 % of GNP , while development aid is around 0.4 % of GNP and on a rising path to reach 0.7 % of GNP by 2015 . 
If the US would pursue politics rather than war , it would understand that more development spending and a commercial approach to Asia , Africa , and the Middle East , rather than the current military approach , would best serve American interests . 
Bombing Libya did not bring Muammar Qadaffi &quot; in from the cold . &quot; 
Peaceful diplomacy did the job , showing Qadaffi that reopening diplomatic relations with the West and abandoning Libya &apos;s nuclear ambitions would be advantageous for its own future and that of the country . 
The same approach would have been far less expensive and more promising vis-Ã -vis Saddam Hussein . 
Vast sums - and millions of lives - would have been saved if that approach had been tried with Ho Chi Minh in the 1950 &quot; s . 
No one doubts that intelligence operations and police actions are needed to fight terrorists . 
But the war in Iraq and enormous military expenditures are quite another matter . 
The American military can protect the US from conventional military attack , and it can keep the high seas open , ensuring the flow of oil and other vital commodities . 
But it can &apos;t protect the US from politics . 
For that , Americans need to be smarter , investing in peaceful development rather than military bases in long-abused lands . 
The US should leave Iraq quickly . 
After that , it can and should use its political and economic weight to help manage a complex and difficult situation that is significantly , though not exclusively , of its own making . 
America &apos;s sway in Iraq will be limited , but leaving now would actually make it more effective than it is now , and at much less cost in terms of money and American , allied , and Iraqi lives .
