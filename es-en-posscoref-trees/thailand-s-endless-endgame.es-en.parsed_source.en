Thailand &apos;s Endless Endgame 
BANGKOK - The hospitalization of King Bhumibol Adulyadej has brought Thailand &apos;s most daunting question to the fore . 
Thailand &apos;s endgame is being shaped by several key events : the military coup of September 2006 , the current military-supported constitution and election in 2007 , street protests and seizures of Government House and Bangkok &apos;s airports in 2008 , the army-brokered coalition government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva that has ruled since January this year , and the Bangkok riots in April . 
At stake is the soul of an emerging Thailand , with far-reaching ramifications for developing democracies elsewhere as well as the broader international community . 
Thailand &apos;s color-coated crisis pits largely urban , conservative , and royalist &quot; yellow &quot; shirts against the predominantly rural &quot; red &quot; columns of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra . 
For much of Thailand &apos;s long economic boom of the past two decades , wealth resided mostly in the Bangkok metropolitan area , a boon to the burgeoning urban middle class , but deeply resented by the rural majority . 
While the rural population had more than enough to eat , their economic opportunities and upward mobility were limited by a shoddy education system and docile state-run media that fed them soap operas and official messages . 
For a nobody to become a somebody , all roads led to Bangkok and its prestigious prep schools and universities . 
Thailand &apos;s farms became increasingly alienated from the urban elite . 
Thaksin recognized this urban-rural divide and shrewdly exploited it , upending the elite consensus that had long prevailed . 
That consensus rested on a nexus of the military , the monarchy , and the bureaucracy . 
Military rule and putsches stemming from factional infighting among generals were the norm until the early 1970 &quot; s , when university students overthrew a military dictatorship and opened up democratic space . 
Parliament , political parties , and politicians then came and went alternately with military coups , which invariably suppressed the maturation of democratic institutions . 
The rural-urban divide wedded the grassroots rural population to upcountry patronage networks and vote-buying , while elected politicians reaped their rewards through corruption and graft . 
In turn , the military stepped in from time to time - once every four years on average since 1932 - ostensibly to suppress corruption , but retarding democratic rule in the process . 
All this changed when Thailand promulgated a constitution in 1997 that promoted political transparency and accountability and government stability and effectiveness . 
Its logical but flawed outcome was the triumph of Thaksin and his once-invincible Thai Rak Thai party , which became the first to complete a full term and be re-elected - by a landslide in 2005 . 
Thai Rak Thai &apos;s populism featured income redistribution , cheap health care , micro-credit schemes , and a dazzling array of policy innovations that ushered Thailand into twenty-first-century globalization . 
The direct connection of Thaksin and his party to the electorate bypassed and threatened the established trinity of institutions that had long called the shots in Thailand . 
Thaksin and his cronies handed the establishment an opportunity to strike back by abusing power and profiting personally from it . 
A billionaire telecommunications tycoon , Thaksin presided over the trebling of his family &apos;s assets in the stock market . 
He also engineered an extrajudicial drug-suppression campaign that claimed 2,275 lives . 
Thaksin &apos;s sins are voluminous , and became the basis of the rise of his yellow-shirted opponents , the People &apos;s Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , which entered the electoral arena as the New Politics Party . 
The PAD spent much of last year demonstrating against the two successive Thaksin-nominated governments that arose from the December 2007 election , reinvigorating Thai Rak Thai &apos;s anti-PAD red-shirted allies , the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship ( UDD ) . 
After more than three years , Thailand &apos;s crisis has become a knotty saga . 
Abhisit &apos;s pledges of reform and reconciliation in the wake of April &apos;s riots have made little headway . 
The PAD wants to maintain the 2007 charter . 
Enraged by a sense of social injustice , the reds rail against the establishment &apos;s double standards , while the pro-establishment yellows have hunkered down for a battle of attrition . 
In the process , what had been a pro- and anti-Thaksin fight has gradually become a pro- and anti-monarchy struggle . 
The rigidly hierarchical forces of the establishment are insecure and fearful of what will happen after the king dies . 
Lèse majesté cases alleging insults against the immediate royal family are on the rise . 
Many thousands of Web sites challenging establishment interests and deploring post-coup machinations have been blocked . 
Thaksin &apos;s appeal splits the reds . 
Many repudiate his corruption but , in challenging the post-coup status quo , have no recourse except to use him as a rallying symbol . 
Likewise , all yellows find Thaksin &apos;s misrule intolerable , but not all are fanatical royalists . 
A stalemate has taken hold , with the denouement likely to be reached only after the royal succession . 
A new consensus is imperative if Thailand is to regain its footing . 
The reds will need to distance themselves from Thaksin &apos;s abuses of power as much as the yellows will have to accept some of Thaksin &apos;s policy legacy , particularly grassroots opportunities for jobs , education , and upward mobility .
