The Adaptation Imperative 
NAIROBI - In the run-up to the recent United Nations meeting on climate change in Lima , Peru , much of the world &apos;s attention focused on how strongly countries would commit to a framework for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Governments &quot; commitment to such a framework , after all , is vital to ensure that the agreement to be signed in Paris in December will keep global temperatures from rising more than 2ยบ Celsius above pre-industrial levels . 
The good news is that the Lima &quot; Call for Climate Action &quot; made sufficient progress to enable preparations for a comprehensive climate deal in Paris . 
But it also left many questions unresolved - a shortcoming that was reflected in discussions on adaptation . 
Though the new emphasis on this important topic is welcome , how to deliver the funding , technology , and knowledge that countries , communities , and ecosystems need to adjust to climate change requires further articulation . 
Even if we limit the rise in global temperatures , climate change is here to stay . 
Communities are already facing more extreme and frequent droughts , floods , and other weather events . 
Yet the UN Environment Programme &apos;s first adaptation report , released in Lima , showed that the world remains wholly unprepared to cover the costs of adaptation . 
According to the report , even if the temperature target is met , the cost of adaptation will reach 2-3 times the previously anticipated $ 70-100 billion per year by 2050 ( an increase of as much as fivefold is possible , though less likely ) . 
If global temperatures exceed the two-degree ceiling significantly , adaptation costs could reach double the worst-case figures , placing a crippling burden on the world economy . 
If world leaders needed another compelling reason to reach a deal in Paris that keeps global temperatures below the target , this is it . 
The burden of adjustment will be borne by everyone . 
Though international funding will be available , costs will fall largely to countries , with governments forced to divert scarce resources from development projects to adaptation initiatives . 
Adaptation funding from public sources reached $ 23-26 billion in 2012-2013 . 
According to a recent assessment by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , global financial flows for mitigation and adaptation measures amounted to $ 340-650 billion in 2011-2012 . 
Furthermore , pledges at the Lima conference by Australia , Austria , Belgium , Colombia , Norway , and Peru bring the Green Climate Fund to nearly $ 10.2 billion . 
And the impact of climate change is increasingly , though still inadequately , being factored into national and local budgets . 
But much more financing will be needed to prevent a funding gap after 2020 . 
The Green Climate Fund , for example , is supposed to reach $ 100 billion per year - ten times higher than it is now - in the next five years . 
Commitments on adaptation in the Paris agreement would go a long way toward closing this gap . 
The international auctioning of emissions allowances and allowances in domestic emissions-trading schemes , a carbon tax , revenues from international transport , a surcharge on electricity transmission , and financial transaction taxes could generate as much as $ 220 billion per year in additional revenues . 
Of course , funding is not the only component of a successful adaptation strategy . 
As the adaptation report emphasizes , closing gaps in technology and knowledge is also crucial . 
Many technologies that could help countries adapt to the consequences of climate change already exist . 
For example , by planting scientifically engineered crops that grow faster , farmers can harvest them before , say , cyclone season , which will become increasingly violent as global temperatures rise . 
But there remain significant barriers to adoption - barriers that governments should dismantle through a combination of incentives , regulatory reform , and institutional upgrading . 
The benefits of such action would extend beyond increased climate resilience . 
Accelerating harvests would mean higher , more reliable production with less labor - a formula for stronger , more stable livelihoods . 
Policymakers should thus pursue integrated solutions that combine climate-change adaptation and mitigation with broader societal concerns , including development . 
Knowledge would offer similarly monumental benefits . 
Science magazine recently published research suggesting that universal education , by giving populations the appropriate intellectual tools and skills they need , is the single most efficient mechanism for adapting to climate change and reducing fatalities associated with extreme weather events . 
International support on adaptation - incorporating financing , technology , and knowledge - could go a long way toward advancing countries &quot; sustainable-development aspirations . 
World leaders should recognize this - and establish adaptation as an integral part of the global climate-change agreement to be reached in Paris . 
Some argue that the global economy cannot afford adaptation . 
But , as the latest evidence shows , delaying action will mean higher costs later . 
If we truly want to build a sustainable , prosperous , and equitable future , we cannot afford to wait .
