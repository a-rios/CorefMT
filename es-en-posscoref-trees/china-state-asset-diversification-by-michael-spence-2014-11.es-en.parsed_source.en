Reforming China &apos;s Commanding Heights 
MILAN - Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s massive anti-corruption campaign has advanced a number of key objectives : It has gone a long way toward restoring confidence in the Communist Party &apos;s commitment to a merit-based system ; countered a decades-old pattern of public-sector domination ; reduced the power of vested interests to block reform ; and bolstered Xi &apos;s popularity among private-sector actors , if far less so with the bureaucracy . 
In short , Xi &apos;s effort to root out corruption has empowered both the Party and the reformers . 
The question is how far they will take their reform ambitions . 
Xi is certainly not finished yet , having outlined a set of legal reforms at last month &apos;s Fourth Plenum of the Communist Party aimed at creating a more level playing field for the public and private sectors . 
If implemented properly , the reforms will create a more efficient system for the creation and enforcement of contracts , ease the path for market entrants , and strengthen the application of China &apos;s competition laws . 
Greater fidelity to the rule of law will also lead to the creation of a legal and financial infrastructure that reduces fraud in the private sector , including in financial reporting . 
That , together with increased access to capital , will help to accelerate the development of the services sector , which is needed to create urban employment . 
Better management of China &apos;s considerable public assets - which include $ 3.5-4 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves , substantial land holdings , and majority ownership of the state-owned enterprises that dominate the economy - would complement these efforts . 
Indeed , it could help to boost competition , encourage innovation , strengthen the financial system , and expand access to capital . 
The question is how China could achieve this . 
As it stands , China &apos;s economy follows , to some extent , the old Leninist &quot; commanding heights &quot; model , with the Party holding all political power and controlling major enterprises and sectors , even as the burgeoning private sector drives growth and employment . 
In this context , the kind of &quot; meritocratic professionalism &quot; that China is pursuing is important ; but it is no substitute for genuine competition in the public or private sector - at least not if innovation and structural change are the goals . 
Of course , Xi could simply declare that China &apos;s version of state capitalism has worked well in the past , and will continue to do so . 
But experience with the microeconomic dynamics of advanced economies ( where China is headed ) makes this a weak stance - and , thus , one that Xi is unlikely to take . 
The alternative would be to embark on a sustained program of privatization to shrink the asset side of the state &apos;s huge balance sheet . 
But China &apos;s balance sheet has served it well , enabling the extraordinarily high rates of investment that have fueled rapid growth . 
Meanwhile , many advanced economies have suffered considerably from their balance-sheet composition , with limited , poorly measured assets and outsize debt and non-debt liabilities . 
In fact , given an increasingly unequal distribution of income between capital and labor ( as well as across the income spectrum for labor ) a larger store of public assets certainly has merit , as it equalizes the distribution of capital and wealth , albeit indirectly . 
Not only can public assets be used to cushion shocks and counter adverse trends ; they can also help fund an expansion of social insurance . 
The problem in China is not the volume of state-owned assets , but their concentration in a few companies and industries - a situation that poses risks to economic performance . 
Given this , the logical solution is not to dispose of the state &apos;s asset holdings , but to diversify them over time . 
Such an approach would have a number of benefits . 
First and foremost , it would reconcile a large state balance sheet with an expanding role for markets , bolstering employment , stimulating innovation , and advancing the economy &apos;s structural transformation . 
To this end , public investment in infrastructure , human capital , and the economy &apos;s knowledge and technology base would remain crucial . 
Furthermore , the diversification of China &apos;s asset holdings would deepen its financial markets considerably . 
Over the next several years , as the traded or tradable share of the state-owned sector &apos;s market capitalization increased from today &apos;s low base of 10-15 % , more institutional investors , such as pension funds and insurance companies , would become involved in Chinese equity trading , which is currently dominated by retail investors . 
This would augment savings options for an increasingly affluent population and strengthen support for long-term investment and development . 
Debt markets would also benefit from such an initiative . 
Blurring the line between the private and the state-owned sectors would , over time , reduce the latter &apos;s privileged access to - and overuse of - bank financing , leading to the expansion of corporate bond markets . 
With public entities like the social security system and sovereign-wealth funds holding more diversified asset portfolios , incentives would be substantially reduced for market intervention favoring incumbents in which the state owned a large share . 
This , along with enhanced enforcement of competition law , would go a long way toward leveling the playing field in markets . 
Clearly specified fiduciary responsibilities and governance would help to ensure that publicly held assets were managed to maximize long-term risk-adjusted returns , with the state and citizens as beneficiaries and the market as the arbiter of efficiency and innovation . 
The best-managed state-owned enterprises could emerge - or remain - as successful and prominent players , adapting to expanded market competition and combining innovation with economies of scale . 
Indeed , public-sector asset management could be &quot; outsourced , &quot; with private asset managers competing for the job . 
This would accelerate the development of the asset-management sector , with far-reaching benefits for savers and investors . 
China does not have to give up the safety net provided by large asset holdings to allow markets to play a decisive microeconomic role . 
It can abandon the commanding heights model and develop its version of &quot; state capitalism &quot; to support the best of both worlds . 
All that is needed is a persistently strong government commitment to the public interest - and , of course , a skillfully executed reform strategy .
