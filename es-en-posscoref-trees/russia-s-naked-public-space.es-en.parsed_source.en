Russia \ u0027s Naked Public Space 
Those who lived in Moscow in the late 1990 &apos;s frequently encountered odd - and mostly incomprehensible - billboards . 
The first such billboard showed a young woman &apos;s face , but no bar of soap or bottle of perfume . 
No brand name , either . 
A short line said simply &quot; I love you . &quot; 
Who loved this woman and why did he want everyone to know of his passion ? 
Rumors had it that one of Russia &apos;s richest men wanted to impress his sweetheart . 
Next came a billboard showing a man &apos;s face , with foreign coins flowing down upon it . 
The line read , &quot; Roma takes care of the Family , the Family takes care of Roma . 
Congratulations ! 
Roma found a classy place for himself . &quot; 
There was never any public explanation for this message , either , just rumors - that &quot; Roma &quot; was Roman Abramovich ( this was long before the tycoon bought the Chelsea football team , becoming a world celebrity ) , and that he had close ties with then President Boris Yeltsin &apos;s inner circle , known as &quot; the Family . &quot; 
Even the few who claimed knowledge about Roma were unsure about who commissioned the billboard . 
It was simply taken for granted that what is supposed to be public space - the streets of Moscow - was appropriated for a vaguely menacing private message . 
Such &quot; private &quot; billboards kept appearing for about a year with varying themes . 
The implications of this game , however , run deeper than the actual messages sent and received . 
The billboards with their private messages were able to occupy public space so easily because in Russia public space is virtually empty : there &apos;s very little , if any , communication between state and society , and barely any public debate . 
Under Communism , public debate was confined to private kitchens . 
Everything beyond private space was state territory . 
Those who encroached upon it were punished . 
Perestroika turned the country into one big public space . 
Streets and squares , newspapers and literary journals became the ground for free public expression . 
Newspapers published in gigantic numbers . 
Russia &apos;s people wanted to make a difference and amazingly they did : their energy and cohesion put an end to Communist rule . 
Of course , what Russia had in the late 1980 &apos;s and early 1990 &apos;s wasn &apos;t institutionalized democracy , but revolutionary excitement . 
It was expected that out of this sea of democratic emotion new political institutions would emerge . 
Instead , political life here has been reduced to mere formality . 
Although there &apos;s nothing like Soviet oppression , the alienation between state and society resembles that of Soviet days . 
Unlike the Communist regime , the new Russian state doesn &apos;t treat its citizens like a flock of sheep . 
On the contrary , the state generally ignores its citizens - it is in no way accountable to the public , nor does it bother to explain what actually goes on inside the Kremlin . 
With political parties driven into irrelevance , parliament turned into a rubber stamp agency , and national television networks taken under government control , public discourse has all but disappeared . 
Ideas may be voiced , but there &apos;s barely any audience , and these utterances don &apos;t resonate ; they die away with no implications or consequences . 
Russian society is atomized , with no sense of cohesion , solidarity , or collective drive in any interest group , professional or social , big or small . 
Big business won &apos;t stand up for the oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky , singled out by the Kremlin as a political enemy and imprisoned since last year . 
Instead , each businessman makes his own deals with the Kremlin to gain relative security . 
The same lack of cohesion is found among journalists . 
No professional solidarity was shown back in 2001 , when Russia &apos;s private national television network NTV was taken over by the government . 
A considerable degree of freedom remains , but a submissive society freely gives ground to the state . 
Seven or eight liberal dailies publish critical opinion or even incriminating evidence against government officials . 
But their print runs range between 20 and 100 thousand copies , and their circulation is mostly limited to Moscow . 
With such small audiences , they are all but irrelevant . 
Worse , the broad public isn &apos;t anxious to get a better idea of how important government decisions are made . 
The old Soviet mindset persists : they up there will take their own decisions regardless of us down below . 
In this atmosphere of public silence , the virtually vacant public space is filled with odd voices that are not intended for public consumption . 
The billboards were &quot; them &quot; communicating in our common space , exchanging messages , as it were , over our heads . 
In March , a high-quality Moscow business daily , Vedomosti , published a letter from Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
It was a mystery how the letter was smuggled out of jail . 
Did Khodorkovsky write the letter , or had he merely signed it ? 
If he was the author , was it his political manifesto or an act of repentance ? 
In the murky atmosphere surrounding Khodorkovsky &apos;s case , it is impossible to discover which theory is true . 
But the more relevant question is whom Khodorkovsky &apos;s letter aimed to address . 
Vedomosti readers may sympathize with Khodorkovsky &apos;s plight , but they account for only 60 thousand people . 
The public at large was basically unaware of Khodorkovsky &apos;s letter , because the state television networks did not report it . 
His missive was more likely an element in behind-the-scenes negotiations between Khodorkovsky and various Kremlin factions . 
Khodorkovsky &apos;s letter may have appeared in the public space , but it was not intended for public consumption . 
Rather , it was like the &quot; I love you &quot; billboard . 
For the time being , Khodorkovsky &apos;s love remains unrequited .
