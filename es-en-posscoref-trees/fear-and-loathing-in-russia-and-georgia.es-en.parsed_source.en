Fear and Loathing in Russia and Georgia 
Mikhail Saakashvili &apos;s victory in Georgia &apos;s presidential election was the predictable culmination of November &apos;s &quot; Revolution of the Roses , &quot; which forced Eduard Shevardnadze to step down after more than a decade in power . 
A more complicated question is what Georgia &apos;s northern neighbor , Russia , should expect from the new power triumvirate of Saakashvili , Nino Burdzhanadze , and Zurab Zhvania . 
Despite Russia &apos;s post-Soviet malaise , it has influenced Georgia &apos;s internal development at virtually every turn - including Shevardnadze &apos;s resignation , which was mediated by Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov - so how it perceives Georgia &apos;s new leaders is of crucial geopolitical significance . 
The three Georgian leaders declare bilateral relations a high priority , and in Russia , too , there is widespread hope that their victory will help repair ties between the two countries . 
But there is also concern about the previous occasional anti-Russian statements of this new generation of leaders , and fear that President Saakashvili might launch a military campaign to bring the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia back under Tbilisi &apos;s rule . 
As Russia &apos;s arch-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky put it , &quot; At least Shevardnadze was still our man , &quot; while the new leaders &quot; will flood Abkhazia and South Ossetia with blood . &quot; 
Although most Russians do not share this view , Russia is obviously concerned with the security threat that it faces from the South Caucasus - a threat that escalated sharply during Shevardnadze &apos;s rule . 
Most alarmingly , Chechen rebels enjoyed considerable freedom of operation in Georgia , creating supply bases on its territory and receiving medical help in Georgian hospitals before slipping back into Russia . 
This support was clearly sanctioned at the highest levels of Georgia &apos;s government . 
The Chechen separatists &apos; leader , Aslan Maskhadov , maintained a mission directly next door to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tbilisi , and various government bodies had direct contacts with Chechen field commanders operating in Georgia . 
In the fall of 2001 , for example , Georgian security officials provided transportation for the Chechen field commander Ruslan Gelaev from the Pankisi Gorge to Abkhazia . 
Georgia &apos;s new leaders have opposed such cooperation with the Chechen rebels . 
So it is to be hoped that they will take Russia &apos;s security concerns seriously , possibly providing partnership in controlling Georgian roads leading into Chechnya . 
For too long , these roads have served as arteries for international terrorism , conveying fighters and financing into Russia from the Arab world and other countries . 
But Saakashvili and his allies are all young . 
Do they have enough experience to guide the country towards political stability and economic prosperity ? 
Their desire to preserve and reestablish Georgian territorial integrity by asserting renewed control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia is understandable , but can they accomplish this goal as peacefully as they won their revolution ? 
Despite frequent accusations to the contrary , Georgia &apos;s viability as an independent state is very much in Russia &apos;s interests . 
Talk of re-establishing the Soviet Union or at least absorbing Abkhazia and South Ossetia has always been politically marginal . 
But the fact remains that both Abkhaz and South Ossetian leaders have occasionally approached Russia with annexation requests . 
Georgia &apos;s current economic collapse provides little incentive for either of these self-proclaimed independent republics to support reunification . 
Similarly , Georgia &apos;s inability to manage relations with its only autonomous republic , Adzharia , doesn &apos;t inspire much confidence . 
The Adzhar people consider themselves Georgians , but still have frequent squabbles with the central government , so how could ethnically distinct Abkhazia and South Ossetia feel assured that their relations with Georgia would work out any better ? 
President Saakashvili seems to understand the necessity of reviving Georgia &apos;s moribund economy , which requires , first and foremost , political stability . 
Russia was once blamed for arranging earthquakes in Georgia , so it would be difficult to resist accusing it of support for anti-Georgian separatists . 
This allegation is as baseless as the temptation to make it is strong . 
Simply put , it would be suicidal for Russia , having itself just stepped back from the brink of territorial disintegration , to build its strength on the collapse of its neighbor . 
On the contrary , Russia &apos;s profound interest in Georgia &apos;s reconstruction has led to a substantial increase in bilateral aid - more than any package ever offered by the West - in the form of enlarged electricity supplies and monetary assistance , which Russian President Vladimir Putin recently put at $ 2 billion annually . 
Indeed , the Saakashvili administration might complain about Russian meddling , but it is unlikely to try to remove Georgia from Russia &apos;s economic orbit . 
The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline - which will bypass Russia when it is completed - cannot re-define the country &apos;s economic strategy to the extent that Shevardnadze had sought . 
Instead , Georgia &apos;s long-term economic success will depend on exports to the Russian market : neither Georgian wine nor Georgian fruit is needed in the United States or Italy . 
Shevardnadze &apos;s emphasis on the BTC pipeline also clearly reflects Georgia &apos;s pro-Western strategic orientation . 
That , too , is unlikely to change under Saakashvili . 
On the other hand , this should become less of a burden on bilateral relations as Russia itself moves closer to NATO , the US , and the European Union . 
Let there be no mistake : Georgia &apos;s new leaders face daunting economic , political , and constitutional challenges in the years ahead .
