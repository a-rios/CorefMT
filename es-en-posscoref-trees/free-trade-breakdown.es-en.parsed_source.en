Free Trade Breakdown 
COPENHAGEN - Last month , the Doha negotiations , promising freer trade , broke down , ostensibly over a small technicality in safeguard rules . 
In reality , the talks collapsed because nobody - not Europe , not the United States , China , India , or the other main developing countries - was willing to take the political short-term hit by offending inefficient farmers and coddled domestic industries in order to create greater long-term benefits for virtually everyone . 
And they broke down because we really don &apos;t care . 
After a few exasperated editorials , the world has pretty much dropped the subject and gone back to its usual concerns . 
This is foolish . 
Establishing significantly freer trade would help the world combat almost all of its biggest problems . 
For an astonishingly low cost , we could improve education and health conditions , make the poorest people richer , and help everybody become better able to tackle the future . 
We have known for centuries that free trade almost always benefits both parties . 
The economist David Ricardo pointed out in 1817 that both Great Britain and Portugal would benefit if they exploited their comparative advantages . 
Portugal could produce wine cheaply , whereas Great Britain could produce cloth much more cheaply than wine . 
By selling cloth and buying wine , Great Britain obtains more of both , as does Portugal . 
The same holds true today , when countries , doing what they do best , produce more and exchange it for more of all other goods . 
Yet today , with international trade talks stalled and protectionist rhetoric rising , we are instead moving toward building bigger trade barriers . 
These barriers are supported by deep-pocketed , self-serving corporations and lobby groups , and defended by politicians who are scared that the redistribution of jobs , income , and wealth resulting from freer trade will reduce their chances of remaining in power . 
When the Doha trade round was launched shortly after September 11 , 2001 , there was plenty of international goodwill . 
But a recent Financial Times / Harris poll in the US , Germany , France , the United Kingdom , Italy , and Spain found people nearly three times more likely to say that globalization is negative than positive . 
Recently , the Copenhagen Consensus project gathered some of the world &apos;s leading economists to decide how to do the most good for the planet in a world of finite resources . The panel - including five Nobel laureates - found that one of the single best actions the planet could take would be completing the Doha negotiations . 
They based their conclusions on new research for the Copenhagen Consensus project by Australian economist Kym Anderson . 
Anderson showed that if developing countries cut their tariffs by the same proportion as high-income countries , and services and investment were also liberalized , the annual global gains could climb to $ 120 billion , with $ 17 billion going to the world &apos;s poorest countries by 2015 . 
This is a respectable sum , and certainly a benefit that the international community should try to achieve . 
As economies open up , as countries do what they do best , competition and innovation drive up rates of growth . 
More competition means that previously sheltered companies must shape up and become more productive , innovating simply to survive . 
Having more open economies allows more trade in innovation , so that new companies can almost instantly use smart ideas from around the globe . 
Instead of every closed market having to re-invent the wheel , once is enough to get everyone &apos;s economy going . 
This means that over time , the advantage of moving toward freer trade grows dramatically bigger : the $ 120 billion benefit in 2015 grows to many trillions of dollars of annual benefits by the end of the century . 
We have seen three very visible cases of such growth boosts in three different decades . 
South Korea liberalized trade in 1965 , Chile in 1974 , and India in 1991 ; all saw annual growth rates increase by several percentage points thereafter . 
If we recast these benefits as annual installments , a realistic Doha outcome could increase global income by more than $ 3 trillion every year throughout this century . 
There would , of course , be costs . 
Freer trade would force some industries to downsize or close , although more industries would expand , and for some people and communities , the transition would be difficult . 
Yet the overall benefits of a successful Doha Round would likely be hundreds of times greater than these costs . 
It is interesting to contrast global skepticism about free trade with support for expensive , inefficient methods to combat global warming . 
Many argue that we should act , even if such action will have no benefit for the next decades , because it will help lessen the impact of global warming by the century &apos;s end . 
But free trade also promises few benefits now and huge benefits in the future . 
Moreover , if we could stop global warming ( which we can &apos;t ) , the benefit for future generations would be one-tenth or less of the benefit of freer trade ( which we certainly can achieve ) . 
Still , there are few celebrity campaigners calling on politicians to sort out the Doha Round . 
Global fear about free trade leaves the planet at risk of missing out on the extraordinary benefits that it offers . 
Free trade is good not only for big corporations , or for job growth . 
It is simply good .
