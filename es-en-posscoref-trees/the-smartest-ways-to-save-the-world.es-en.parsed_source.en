The Smartest Ways to Save the World 
COPENHAGEN - If you had $ 75 billion to spend over the next four years and your goal was to advance human welfare , especially in the developing world , how could you get the most value for your money ? 
That is the question that I posed to a panel of five top economists , including four Nobel laureates , in the Copenhagen Consensus 2012 project . 
The panel members were chosen for their expertise in prioritization and their ability to use economic principles to compare policy choices . 
Over the past year , more than 50 economists prepared research on nearly 40 investment proposals in areas ranging from armed conflicts and natural disasters to hunger , education , and global warming . 
The teams that drafted each paper identified the costs and benefits of the smartest ways to spend money within their area . 
In early May , many of them traveled to Denmark to convince the expert panel of the power of their investment proposals . 
The panel &apos;s findings reveal that , if spent smartly , $ 75 billion - just a 15 % increase in current aid spending - could go a long way to solving many of the world &apos;s challenges . 
The single most important investment , according to the panel , would step up the fight against malnutrition . 
New research for the project by John Hoddinott of the International Food Policy Research Institute and Peter Orazem of Iowa State University focuses on an investment of $ 3 billion annually . 
This would purchase a bundle of interventions , including micronutrient provision , complementary foods , treatment for worms and diarrheal diseases , and behavior-change programs , all of which could reduce chronic under-nutrition by 36 % in developing countries . 
In total , such an investment would help more than 100 million children to start their lives without stunted growth or malnourishment . 
And comprehensive research now shows that such interventions would stay with them for life : their bodies and muscles would grow faster , their cognitive abilities would improve , and they would pay more attention in school ( and stay there longer ) . 
Studies show that , decades down the line , these children would be more productive , make more money , have fewer kids , and begin a virtuous circle of dramatic development . 
Such opportunities come sharply into focus when you ask some of the world &apos;s best minds to find the biggest bang for the buck . 
Micronutrient provision is rarely celebrated , but it makes a world of difference . 
Likewise , just $ 300 million would prevent 300,000 child deaths if it were used to strengthen the Global Fund &apos;s Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria financing mechanism , which makes combination therapies cheaper for poor countries . 
Put in economic terms , the benefits are 35 times higher than the costs - even without taking into account that it safeguards our most effective malaria drug from future drug resistance . 
Later this year , donors will decide whether to renew this facility . 
The panel &apos;s findings should help to persuade them to do so . 
For a similar amount , 300 million children could be dewormed in schools . 
By not sharing their food with intestinal parasites , they , too , would become more alert , stay longer in school , and grow up to be more productive adults - another cause that needs much more public attention . 
Expanding tuberculosis treatment and childhood immunization coverage are two other health investments that the expert panel endorses . 
Likewise , a $ 100 million annual increase in spending to develop a vaccine against HIV / AIDS would generate substantial benefits in the future . 
As people in the developing world live longer , they are increasingly experiencing chronic disease ; indeed , half of all deaths this year will be from chronic diseases in Third World countries . 
Here , the panel finds that spending just $ 122 million could achieve complete Hepatitis B vaccine coverage and avert about 150,000 annual deaths from the disease . 
Getting low-cost drugs for acute heart attacks to developing countries would cost just $ 200 million , and prevent 300,000 deaths . 
The expert panel &apos;s findings point to a compelling need to invest roughly $ 2 billion annually in research and development to increase agricultural output . 
Not only would this reduce hunger by increasing food production and lowering food prices ; it would also protect biodiversity , because higher crop productivity would mean less deforestation . 
That , in turn , would help in the fight against climate change , because forests store carbon . 
When it comes to climate change , the experts recommend spending a small amount - roughly $ 1 billion - to investigate the feasibility of cooling the planet through geo-engineering options . 
This would allow us to understand better the technology &apos;s risks , costs , and benefits . 
Moreover , the research could potentially give us low-cost , effective insurance against global warming . 
Another priority for investment is the establishment of effective early-warning systems for natural disasters in developing countries . 
For less than $ 1 billion a year , this would alleviate both direct and long-term economic damage , possibly securing some $ 35 billion in benefits . 
The $ 75 billion budget chosen for the Copenhagen Consensus project is large enough to make a real difference , but small enough that we must choose - as in the real world - the projects that can achieve the most good . 
The expert panel &apos;s list shows us that there are many smart solutions waiting to be implemented .
