Dump the Lisbon Agenda 
As soon as he takes office as President of the European Commission , Durao Barroso - Portugal &apos;s former Prime Minister - should devote urgent attention to restoring order and focus to the European Union &apos;s economic policies . 
The thickest file on his desk concerns the Lisbon agenda , an ambitious programme approved in 2000 by the EU heads of state and government with the goal of making the Union &quot; the most competitive and dynamic knowledge economy &quot; by 2010 . 
All major fields of economic policy are covered : innovation and entrepreneurship , welfare reform and social inclusion , skills and employability , gender equality , labour and product market liberalisation , and &quot; sustainable &quot; development . 
All of these are worthy goals , to be sure , but they belong intrinsically to the sphere of national political decisions . 
Indeed , under the European Treaties , the Union has no competence to enact legislation and policy in these domains , nor powers to enforce them . 
But the European Council , spurred by the European Commission , invented a new policy approach - called &quot; open coordination &quot; - in order to impinge on these fields . 
Open coordination entails the definition of common goals at the EU level , voluntary compliance by the member states , and peer review of results within the European Council . 
Inevitably , open coordination has failed to deliver on its promises . 
Moreover , the delusion that the European Council can somehow call growth and productivity into being has provided a diversion to national politicians who are unwilling to push for unpopular decisions back home . 
My first suggestion to Barroso , therefore , is to scrap the Lisbon agenda . 
Only this will make it clear that responsibility for national economic performance lies with national policy-makers . 
This brings me to the subject of macroeconomic coordination at the EU level . 
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged a simple policy framework for economic and monetary union . 
Monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent central bank , while fiscal policy was left to the member states . 
National governments were made subject - under the excessive-deficit procedure - to the twin constraints that fiscal deficits should not exceed 3 % of GDP and government debt should remain below 60 % of GDP ( or at least tend towards that value ) . 
Later on , the Stability and Growth Pact added a requirement that , over the medium term , government accounts should be &quot; close to balance . &quot; 
Essentially , this aimed to prevent irresponsible budgetary policies after the euro &apos;s launch , while leaving sufficient room for cyclical oscillations of the deficit within the 3 % limit . 
The credibility of this apparatus was badly damaged by the November 2003 public controversy between the Commission and the Ecofin Council over the application of the excessive-deficit procedure to France and Germany . 
This does not mean that it should be abandoned . 
On the contrary , a common external constraint on fiscal behavior is needed as a joint safeguard against an unsustainable accumulation of public debt that could affect financial stability and inflation throughout the EU - a risk aggravated by the impact of aging populations on pension systems . 
Such a constraint also provides a welcome anchor for domestic decision-making in member states with weaker political systems . 
But the system needs to be reviewed . 
I would not listen to those who advocate excluding investment from fiscal deficits : this would only offer new incentives for creative accounting and unsustainable accumulation of debt . 
Instead , the emphasis should shift from annual deficits to debt sustainability . 
The debt criterion , for example , could be supplemented by a limit on the ( trend ) growth rate of public spending , which would be kept below that of nominal GDP . 
The Commission &apos;s powers to initiate action when there is a risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened - provided , of course , that the Commission never again forgets that surveillance of national policies is a task that requires political judgment and cannot be left to accountants and lawyers . 
Finally , top priority should be assigned to completing the Single European Market , in which the Union has powerful legal instruments to pry open markets and sustain competition . 
The best therapy for reinvigorating growth is both direct , by increasing competitive pressure , and indirect , by triggering the necessary adaptation in national employment , welfare , and education policies . 
The job is far from finished . 
State aid to ailing companies remains ubiquitous , and common rules designed to ensure free circulation of goods and services are not fully respected by the member states - public procurement and energy markets being prime examples . 
Moreover , most markets for services - securities trading , wholesale and retail distribution , business services , and local utilities - remain sheltered from competition and free circulation rules . 
Empirical evidence indicates that these distortions in the market for services , which account for about two thirds of GDP , underlie most of the EU &apos;s productivity gap with the United States . 
In recent years the European Council has not devoted sufficient attention to these tasks , which require full and continuing commitment by member states to transpose and implement Community directives . 
All too often , the Commission has favored enacting new legislation and creating new spending programs over the effective administration of what already exists . 
So Barroso should forget the high-flying platitudes of the Lisbon agenda and focus instead on effective completion of the Single Market and keeping the member states &apos; fiscal policies in order . 
Let national governments take responsibility for their countries &apos; economic performance .
