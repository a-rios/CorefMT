Turkey &apos;s Democratic Dusk 
CAMBRIDGE - When questioned recently about a constitutional law professor who was arrested for lecturing at an institute run by the country &apos;s main pro-Kurdish political party , Turkey &apos;s interior minister , Idris Naim Sahin , couldn &apos;t hide his irritation : &quot; I am having a hard time understanding those saying a professor should not be arrested while thousands of other people are being arrested in Turkey . &quot; 
Presumably , Sahin meant to say that a professor cannot claim special treatment under the law . 
But his remark inadvertently underscored Turkey &apos;s new reality , in which any perceived opponent of the current regime can be jailed , with or without evidence , for terrorism or other violent acts . 
Special courts , tasked with prosecuting terrorism and crimes against the state , have been working overtime to produce charges that are often as absurd as they are baseless . 
For example , journalists have been imprisoned for producing articles and books at the behest of an alleged terrorist organization called &quot; Ergenekon , &quot; whose existence has yet to be confirmed , despite years of investigation . 
Likewise , military officers have been charged on the basis of blatantly fraudulent - indeed , amateurishly produced - documents containing obvious anachronisms . 
A senior police commissioner is currently languishing in jail for allegedly collaborating with far-left militants he spent his entire career hunting down . 
These prosecutions have cast an ever-widening net , ensnaring scores of journalists , authors , and academics , hundreds of military officers , and thousands of Kurdish politicians and activists , among others . 
Self-censorship has become routine . 
Media bosses anxious to retain Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s favor have fired many of those journalists who continue to criticize his regime . 
And government control now extends beyond the media , judiciary , and academia to the worlds of business and sports . 
Previously autonomous regulatory bodies ( such as the competition authority ) have been quietly subordinated to the government , with no debate or discussion . 
Even the Turkish Academy of Sciences has been targeted . 
A recent decree , widely condemned abroad , allows the government to appoint two-thirds of the Academy &apos;s members , thereby ending even the semblance of scientific independence . 
Erdoğan seems immune to criticism . 
His success at expanding access to health , education , and housing has enabled him to win three general elections - each with a greater share of the popular vote than previously . 
He has broken the power of the military old guard and the hold of its stale Kemalist ideology - the secular nationalism introduced by Turkey &apos;s first president , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk - thereby permanently altering the makeup of Turkish politics . 
He has presided over the emergence of a vibrant new class of Anatolian entrepreneurs . 
And , under his rule , Turkey has become a regional power . 
Yet , while Erdoğan may appear to be at the pinnacle of power , it is his government &apos;s &quot; Gülenist &quot; allies who have grown increasingly powerful . 
Members of the transnational Gülen movement - inspired by followers of Fethullah Gülen , a Pennsylvania-based Muslim theologian - are staffing Turkey &apos;s police , judiciary , bureaucracy , and universities . 
The Gülenist media now set the country &apos;s new ideological tone , producing a steady stream of disinformation in their vocal support of the country &apos;s show trials . 
These trials are , in fact , often staged to serve Gülenist ends specifically . 
Prominent detainees , such as the journalist Nedim Sener and police commissioner Hanefi Avci , landed in jail after exposing the wrongdoings of Gülenist police and prosecutors . 
Editorials in Zaman , the Gülen network &apos;s Turkish-language daily newspaper , no longer mince words : a new Turkey is being created ; those who stand in the way are getting what they deserve . 
Erdoğan has benefited greatly from Gülenist support , yet he detests sharing power and remains suspicious of the movement . 
Early on , he successfully exploited the Gülenist-supported political trials in order to demonize the opposition . 
But , as the charges have increased in scope and implausibility , the trials have complicated his relationships with the military , domestic liberals , and outsiders such as foreign media and the European Union . 
Moreover , individuals close to him and his administration have recently become entangled in the net of judicial manipulation , which suggests that he may be losing control over the police and the special courts . 
Given that the fight against the common enemy , the secularist old guard , has been decisively won , an eventual break between Erdoğan and the Gülenists is perhaps inevitable . 
Unfortunately , regardless of which side emerges victorious , the outcome will not be good news for Turkish democracy . 
For Turkey &apos;s friends abroad , it is time for some tough love . 
So far , the European Union and the United States have reacted to Turkey &apos;s descent into authoritarianism with little more than vague statements of concern . 
No official has offered criticism analogous to Swedish Foreign Secretary Carl Bildt &apos;s condemnation of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko &apos;s show trial in that country , or US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton &apos;s frank statements about Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin &apos;s erosion of the rule of law . 
Incredibly , the EU &apos;s progress reports on Turkey have continued to call the Ergenekon trials , which are heavily supported by the Gülenists , an opportunity to strengthen the rule of law . 
It wasn &apos;t long ago that Turkey appeared to be a bright beacon of democracy and moderation in a region accustomed to autocracy and radicalism . 
Now it looks more like a country heading towards authoritarianism at home and embracing adventurism abroad . 
It is understandable that Europeans and Americans do not want to offend a regional power . 
But playing Erdoğan &apos;s game only reinforces his sense of invincibility . 
It does not advance the cause of democracy in Turkey ; nor does it make Turkey a more reliable ally .
