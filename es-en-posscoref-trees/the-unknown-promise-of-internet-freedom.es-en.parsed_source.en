The Unknown Promise of Internet Freedom 
MELBOURNE - Google has withdrawn from China , arguing that it is no longer willing to design its search engine to block information that the Chinese government does not wish its citizens to have . 
In liberal democracies around the world , this decision has generally been greeted with enthusiasm . 
But in one of those liberal democracies , Australia , the government recently said that it would legislate to block access to some Web sites . 
The prohibited material includes child pornography , bestiality , incest , graphic &quot; high impact &quot; images of violence , anything promoting or providing instruction on crime or violence , detailed descriptions of the use of proscribed drugs , and how-to information on suicide by Web sites supporting the right to die for the terminally or incurably ill . 
A readers &quot; poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed 96 % opposed to those proposed measures , and only 2 % in support . 
More readers voted in this poll than in any previous poll shown on the newspaper &apos;s Web site , and the result is the most one-sided . 
The Internet , like the steam engine , is a technological breakthrough that changed the world . 
Today , if you have an Internet connection , you have at your fingertips an amount of information previously available only to those with access to the world &apos;s greatest libraries - indeed , in most respects what is available through the Internet dwarfs those libraries , and it is incomparably easier to find what you need . 
Remarkably , this came about with no central planning , no governing body , and no overall control , other than a system for allocating the names of Web sites and their addresses . 
That something so significant could spring up independently of governments and big business led many to believe that the Internet can bring the world a new type of freedom . 
It is as if an inherently decentralized and individualist technology had realized an anarchist vision that would have seemed utterly utopian if dreamed up by Peter Kropotkin in the nineteenth century . 
That may be why so many people believe so strongly that the Internet should be left completely unfettered . 
Perhaps because Google has been all about making information more widely available , its collaboration with China &apos;s official Internet censors has been seen as a deep betrayal . 
The hope of Internet anarchists was that repressive governments would have only two options : accept the Internet with its limitless possibilities of spreading information , or restrict Internet access to the ruling elite and turn your back on the twenty-first century , as North Korea has done . 
Reality is more complex . 
The Chinese government was never going to cave in to Google &apos;s demand that it abandon Internet censorship . 
The authorities will no doubt find ways of replacing the services that Google provided - at some cost , and maybe with some loss of efficiency , but the Internet will remain fettered in China . 
Nevertheless , the more important point is that Google is no longer lending its imprimatur to political censorship . 
Predictably , some accuse Google of seeking to impose its own values on a foreign culture . 
Nonsense . 
Google is entitled to choose how and with whom it does business . 
One could just as easily assert that during the period in which Google filtered its results in China , China was imposing its values on Google . 
Google &apos;s withdrawal is a decision in accordance with its own values . 
In my view , those values are more defensible than the values that lead to political censorship - and who knows how many Chinese would endorse the value of open access to information , too , if they had the chance ? 
Even with censorship , the Internet is a force for change . 
Last month , when the governor of China &apos;s Hubei province threatened a journalist and grabbed her recorder after she asked a question about a local scandal , journalists , lawyers , and academics used the Internet to object . 
A Web report critical of the governor &apos;s behavior stayed up for 18 hours before censors ordered it taken down . 
By then , however , the news was already widely dispersed . 
Likewise , in Cuba , Yoani SÃ¡nchez &apos;s blog Generation Yhas broken barriers that conventional media could not . 
Although the Cuban government has blocked access to the Web site on which the blog is posted , it is available around the world in many languages , and distributed within Cuba on compact disks and flash drives . 
The new freedom of expression brought by the Internet goes far beyond politics . 
People relate to each other in new ways , posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception . 
We discover new things about what people want to do and how they want to connect to each other . 
Do you live in an isolated village and have unusual hobbies , special interests , or sexual preferences ? 
You will find someone online with whom to share them . 
Can &apos;t get to a doctor ? You can check your symptoms online - but can you be sure that the medical Web site you are using is reliable ? 
Technology can be used for good or for bad , and it is too soon to reach a verdict on the Internet . ( In the eighteenth century , who could have foreseen that the development of the steam engine would have an impact on earth &apos;s climate ? ) 
Even if it does not fulfill the anarchist dream of ending repressive government , we are still only beginning to grasp the extent of what it will do to the way we live .
