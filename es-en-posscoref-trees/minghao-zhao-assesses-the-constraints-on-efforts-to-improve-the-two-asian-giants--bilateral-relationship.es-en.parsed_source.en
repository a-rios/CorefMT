China &apos;s Measured Embrace of India 
BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s three-day visit to India , the main leg of a recent tour of Central and South Asia , sheds new light on China &apos;s emerging approach to its neighbors , particularly Asia &apos;s other giant . 
Recent subtle changes in Sino-Indian relations could prove to be enormously consequential for the world in the coming decades . 
Under Xi , China is adopting a new grand strategy which can be called &quot; dual rebalancing &quot; : implementing bold domestic reforms to regain economic momentum while overhauling China &apos;s global posture and diplomacy , focusing on sources of risk in its near abroad . 
The Silk Road Economic Belt , which is focused on Central Asia , and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road , which concentrates on the countries bordering the Indian Ocean &apos;s shipping lanes , are leading initiatives on China &apos;s foreign-policy agenda . 
Their success will depend , in large part , on whether China gets support from other great powers , specifically Russia in Central Asia and India in South Asia . 
China understands that India &apos;s position on the world stage has been strengthening since the beginning of this century . 
India &apos;s new prime minister , Narendra Modi , an aspirational and authoritative leader from Gujarat , one of the country &apos;s most developed states , has promised to bring India &apos;s economy out of a half-decade funk , enhance the living standards of his country &apos;s have-nots , and boost the country &apos;s standing as a global power . 
The trick for Chinese policy is to reconcile Modi &apos;s ambitions with China &apos;s strategic goals . 
Since Modi came to power , India has been basking in the adulation of major powers like Japan and the United States . 
Partly motivated by a desire to counterbalance China &apos;s rising geopolitical influence , Japan and the US have sought to draw India into a multilateral alliance consisting of democratic countries in the Asia-Pacific region . 
Indeed , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has vowed to forge a &quot; democratic security diamond &quot; with the US , Australia , and India . 
During Modi &apos;s visit to Japan in early September , Abe offered to invest $ 35 billion in Indian infrastructure projects over five years , accelerate negotiations on civil nuclear deals , and boost bilateral maritime security cooperation . 
The two sides agreed to build up a &quot; Special Strategic and Global Partnership , &quot; leaving Chinese strategists to wrestle with the implications of deeper India-Japan ties . 
Likewise , despite an on-again off-again relationship with India since Bill Clinton &apos;s presidency , the US continues to view the country as a &quot; natural ally . &quot; 
US cabinet members - Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel - both visited India in recent months to try and woo Modi by promising improved economic and strategic ties . 
In the last three years , the US has surpassed Russia as India &apos;s largest arms supplier . 
Modi &apos;s government is desperate to diversity its sources of advanced weapons and become self-reliant in defense production . 
Barack Obama &apos;s administration is now expected to do whatever it can to strengthen relations with India during Modi &apos;s upcoming visit to Washington . 
As Nicholas Burns , a former under-secretary of state , has argued , US strategic interests in the century ahead will align more closely with India &apos;s than with those of any other continental Asian power , making India central to America &apos;s strategic rebalancing toward Asia . 
Xi is confident that China can understand and satisfy many of Modi &apos;s needs better than regional rivals like Japan . 
But China should not underestimate India &apos;s determination to uphold its strategic autonomy in Asia &apos;s shifting geopolitical landscape . 
During Xi &apos;s visit , the two leaders signed 15 agreements in the fields of trade , finance , and culture . 
Xi committed China to invest $ 20 billion in India over the next five years , particularly to modernize India &apos;s decrepit and overused railway system . 
This compares with just $ 400 million , or 0.18 % of India &apos;s inward foreign investment , in Chinese investment from 2000 to 2014 . 
China also promised to establish two industrial parks , in Gujarat and Maharashtra , as well as provide greater market access to Indian products , in an effort to allay India &apos;s worries over the widening bilateral trade deficit , which has soared from $ 1 billion in 2001 to more than $ 40 billion today . 
Modi &apos;s efforts to revive market-oriented reform and improve the country &apos;s business environment will help to attract Chinese corporations eager to capitalize on India &apos;s vast labor force , varied skill base , and geographical advantages . 
In addition , China wants to strengthen cooperation with India in regional and global affairs . 
India is likely soon to gain full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , the club of Central Asian and Asian states formed after the breakup of the Soviet Union . 
India &apos;s &quot; Connect Central Asia policy , &quot; and its efforts to build a North-South Transit Corridor , would benefit development in Central Asia , a region of major concern to China , because it abuts the restless Chinese province of Xinjiang . 
As major aid providers and investors in Afghanistan , China and India also have common interests in stabilizing that country , and countering religious extremism and terrorism after NATO troops leave . 
Moreover , the two countries share similar interests in reshaping global economic governance , particularly by further strengthening cooperation among the BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) and ensuring that climate change is addressed in a way that does not impede growth . 
But India &apos;s lingering bitterness over the 1962 war with China remains . 
On many occasions , Modi has voiced suspicions about China &apos;s growing footprint in disputed border areas . 
India &apos;s sensitivity to potential Chinese encirclement is similar to China &apos;s fears of encirclement by the US and its allies . 
That is why China is unlikely to develop its relations with India and Pakistan ( with which China still values its all-weather partnership ) on separate tracks , as the US did during the Bush administration . 
Xi &apos;s visit to India strongly suggests that China is determined to engage with Modi in ways that are intended to inhibit the bilateral rivalry from intensifying . 
But , despite Xi &apos;s investment pledges , it is far from certain that Asia &apos;s two giants , both with growing global aspirations , can bridge the differences that continue to burden their relationship .
