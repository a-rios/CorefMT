Zimbabwe &apos;s Permanent Guantánamo 
JOHANNESBURG - Last week , the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantánamo Bay have the right to habeas corpus - the right to challenge the factual and legal basis of their detention in a court of law . I was elated by the decision , having spent four years working on ensuring the rule of law in US detention and interrogation policy , including monitoring military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay . But my happiness is tempered by where I sit , close to the border with Zimbabwe - a country where the writ of habeas corpus and the rule of law have become obsolete . 
Habeas corpus , Latin for &quot; you have the body , &quot; is an old English common law principle incorporated into the US Constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state . 
It was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts . 
In Zimbabwe , this right - like so many other checks and balances - has been torn away by a repressive state . 
Just hours before the US Supreme Court ruling , Tendai Biti , the Secretary-General of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe . 
Despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him , his whereabouts remained unknown for days . 
The police dismissed an initial court order demanding that Biti be produced before the court . 
After Biti was finally produced before the court days later , the government announced that he will be charged with treason - which carries the death penalty - for unofficially announcing the results of the March 29 , 2008 , elections . Prior to his detention , Biti had responded to such allegations by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in Zimbabwe . 
It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court . 
Since 1999 , the MDC has offered a democratic alternative to President Robert Mugabe &apos;s regime . 
In the most recent elections , Zimbabweans made their choice known , despite serious obstacles and widespread repression , with the MDC &apos;s presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , gaining more votes than Mugabe . 
But , according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month-long delay , the MDC &apos;s margin of victory - 48 % to 43 % - fell short of the 50 % required to avoid a run-off election . 
Biti is not the only MDC member to be &quot; disappeared &quot; for a period of time by Mugabe &apos;s government . 
Over the past two years , police and government-supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed , beaten , and even killed MDC officials and suspected MDC members . 
Last year , Biti was detained and beaten along with Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC officials . 
The photos of Tsvangirai &apos;s pummeled body led to an international outcry . 
State-sponsored violence against the MDC and its supporters has escalated as the June 27 run-off vote draws near . Just weeks ago , Biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of Tonderai Ndira , an MDC youth leader . 
Ndira had been taken by the police from his home . 
He was missing for seven days ; when his body was found , it was recognizable only by a bracelet he always wore . 
Here in our offices in Johannesburg , we have two Zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights . 
At least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks . 
Most recently , the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence . 
It is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence . 
Indeed , even South African president Thabo Mbeki , who , despite an outcry from many of his citizens , has supported Mugabe , felt compelled to label it a &quot; cause for serious concern . &quot; 
In the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that &quot; Liberty and security can be reconciled ; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law . &quot; 
But there is no rule of law left in Zimbabwe - no habeas corpus and no check on arbitrary state action . 
It is time for the international community to step in , call for an end to the detention and disappearance of MDC officials and perceived supporters , and push for a democratic transition in Zimbabwe . 
Only then can the principles underlying the Supreme Court &apos;s decision come within reach of ordinary Zimbabweans .
