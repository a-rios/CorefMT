Tariffs and Tortillas 
BUENOS AIRES - Ever since Mexico &apos;s so-called &quot; Tortilla crisis &quot; this past January , street protests against food shortages and high prices , or against increasing taxes on agricultural production , have spread from Haiti to Central American countries , and across Latin America . 
Governments have sometimes reacted with protective measures or macroeconomic initiatives , but in some cases with repression . 
The paradox of Latin America &apos;s food crisis is that , although the region is a major food producer , it sometimes needs to rely on imports to prevent sporadic shortages . 
According to the World Bank , Latin America and the Caribbean exported $ 55 billion of foodstuffs in 2006 ; yet the continent &apos;s poorest families spend 50 % of their budgets on food , and this at a time when Latin America has been experiencing its best economic performance since the 1970 &quot; s . 
Food prices , which have shot up 83 % , are not likely to start falling until after 2009 . 
For Latin America , this is more than a challenge ; it is an opportunity . 
The central challenge is political : correcting state policies formulated when resources , including oil , natural gas and food commodities , were not considered a driving force in the global economy . 
The key here is to avoid the trap of protectionism and international isolation . 
Even before the current crisis , Latin America &apos;s recent &quot; left turn &quot; in politics was tied to the food problem . 
During his first term , Brazil &apos;s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva implemented a &quot; Zero Hunger &quot; plan targeting the most vulnerable people in Brazilian society . 
Around this time , Argentina &apos;s then President Nestor Kirchner was using price controls to keep food prices low . 
In Venezuela , Hugo Chávez took a further radical turn and launched a widespread plan of land reform . 
None of these measures was uncontroversial ; nor did they prevent the impact of today &apos;s global food price inflation . 
Lula was accused of corruption and patronage . 
The Kirchner government faced a serious challenge to its credibility when it came under suspicion of manipulating the inflation rate . 
In Venezuela , land reform and socialist rhetoric did not prevent chronic shortages of milk , sugar , and beef . 
Yet , despite these failings , such policies retained enough popularity to insure their continuity . 
Given this history , it is no surprise that the first reaction of Latin American governments to today &apos;s food crisis was unilateral . 
On April 23 , Brazil announced a temporary suspension of rice exports to prevent internal shortages . 
Bolivia prohibited the export of corn , rice , meat , and vegetable oil . 
Argentina &apos;s decision in March to drastically increase the tax on agricultural exports provoked a widespread clash with rural producers , leading to a novel and complex social polarization while generating a political crisis that is still ongoing . 
Some of the measures even endangered bilateral relations . 
To curb inflation , Argentina decided to suspend the sale of wheat to its principal export market , Brazil , where the price of bread had increased 20 % over the last 12 months . 
In Peru , social mobilization against higher food prices led to a renegotiation of the free-trade agreement with the US . 
Compared to other regions , the impact of the crisis in Latin America , with the exception of Haiti , has ( so far ) not been dramatic . 
The reason is the abundance of natural resources and persistent international demand , which has sustained growth . 
But regional cooperation to find creative solutions to a crisis that is in many respects interrelated remains absent . 
So far , the only initiative with a regional perspective has come from Caracas in the form of the so-called Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas ( ALBA ) . 
Mexico , Peru , and other nations were suspicious of the anti-American rhetoric of the ALBA grouping , but some practical proposals - such as the creation of a bank of agricultural products to reduce costs for small and midsize producers - have come out of it . 
One of the inevitable consequences of the current food crisis will be a re-consolidation of the state &apos;s role in agriculture . 
Pressure to place food security on the regional political agenda is clear evidence of this . 
After the last world food crisis in 1973 , agriculture was almost forgotten as a factor in growth . 
While liberalization was promoted in the late 1980 &quot; s and embraced during the 1990 &quot; s , food markets in the developed world remained highly protected , with Latin American countries suffering the consequences . 
One indirect , yet tragic , result has been Bolivian , Peruvian , and Colombian peasants &quot; continuing cultivation of coca leaves as a means of economic survival . 
For Latin American policymakers , assuring food security can really be achieved only if a new international regime of genuinely free trade for agricultural commodities is built . 
Without such a global agreement , the muddled interventions of today will continue , with little hope of any real improvement .
