The Dead-End of Corbynismo 
SANTIAGO - Latin America has a new export : populist backlash . 
It first landed on the warm and receptive shores of the Mediterranean , nurturing support for Greece &apos;s Syriza and Spain &apos;s Podemos . 
Now it has reached the United Kingdom . 
Corbynismo , the ideology of the long-marginalized British MP Jeremy Corbyn - who admired Venezuela &apos;s late president , Hugo Chávez , thinks Vladimir Putin was justified in invading Ukraine , and now heads Britain &apos;s venerable Labour Party - sounds familiar to anyone acquainted with Latin America . 
It calls for monetary financing of fiscal deficits ( now called &quot; people &apos;s quantitative easing &quot; ) , nationalization of industry ( beginning with the railroads ) , and an end to competition and the private provision of public services . 
This is the stuff that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his supporters thought - wrongly , it seems - they had consigned to the dustbin of history . 
Of course , this new populism ( Hillary Clinton &apos;s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders is also a card-carrying member ) has much fodder . 
As Martin Wolf has emphasized , the 2008-2009 financial crisis made voters understandably angry at &quot; greedy plutocrats and their lackeys in politics and media . &quot; 
Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman ( who sometimes sounds like a Corbynista , but isn &apos;t one ) and Wolfgang Munchau stress that Europe &apos;s moderate left lost popular support by being too ready to embrace the extreme version of fiscal austerity demanded by Germany and its orthodox allies . 
But being mad is not the same as being right . 
The new European populists are parlaying legitimate frustration into a misguided set of policies that can only produce more of the same . 
Latin Americans learned this the hard way in decades past . 
Europeans ( and perhaps Americans ) may be about to as well . 
Three conceptual confusions cause Corbynismo to get crucial matters completely wrong . 
The market for potatoes is not like the market for loans . 
Yes , bankers are greedy . 
And , yes , financial markets require close supervision and regulation . 
But what is true of financial markets need not be true of other markets . 
A transaction involving potatoes happens at one point in time only : the buyer parts with her money , the seller parts with his tubers , and that is it . 
A financial transaction , by contrast , happens over time : the borrower gets the money today and promises to repay in a month , year , or decade . 
This makes finance especially susceptible to crooks and con men . 
And because expectations and confidence about future events are crucial , governments must , like European Central Bank President Mario Draghi , stand ready to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to stabilize financial markets . 
As the great Cuban-Argentine-American economist Carlos Díaz-Alejandro pointed out long ago , financial markets are not disciplined by the threat of bankruptcy . 
When banks get into trouble , governments always save them or wish they had ( think Lehman Brothers ) . 
Regulation needs to provide the discipline that markets cannot . 
But followers of Corbynismo are wrong to infer that the ills of financial markets infect all other markets , all the time . 
Countries , whether rich or poor , do not need a Potato Supervisory Board with new and enhanced regulatory powers . 
It is great to be Keynesian - but during both halves of the cycle . 
Yes , orthodox economists of ( mostly ) Teutonic origin peddle a lethal fiscal-policy prescription . 
When the economy is booming , they claim , expenditure must be cut ( or , if all else fails , taxes raised ) in order to reduce demand . 
When the economy is tanking , expenditure also has to be cut in order to restore confidence and revive investment . 
For some European economies , this prescription has caused a needlessly long recession . 
But it does not follow that , as Corbynistas believe , large budget deficits and debts are harmless . 
On the contrary , when debts become unsustainable and governments have no option but to close hospitals and slash pensions , it is the poor and vulnerable who suffer most . 
The way to render an aggressively counter-cyclical fiscal policy feasible is by relying on modern budget rules . 
A modern Keynesian government does not hesitate to increase spending in the face of a recession . 
But , in order to do that , it needs the high credibility and low debt that follow from having saved and repaid debt during the upswing . 
We did this in Chile during the copper price boom of 2006-2008 , running budget surpluses of up to eight percentage points of GDP . 
When Wall Street melted down , we had the fiscal room to apply one of the most aggressive anti-crisis plans anywhere . 
A rigorous fiscal rule , designed and applied by center-left governments , made it all possible . 
Progressive ends are not the same as statist means . 
There is nothing inevitable or God-given about suffering , injustice , and inequality . 
That is why modern social democrats and progressive liberals are eager to right social wrongs . 
But effectiveness requires agnosticism about the policies required to achieve lofty ends . 
Consider health care . 
Different things work differently in different places . 
Britain has a single payer and a single service provider : the National Health Service . 
Canada has a single public payer but mostly private providers . 
Obamacare establishes a public mandate to buy private insurance ( with public subsidies for the poor ) to finance services provided by ( mostly ) private hospitals and clinics . 
The same is true in education , pensions , or housing for the poor . 
States are right to spend generously on education ; but , of the world &apos;s top ten universities listed by the Shanghai ranking , seven are private . 
Successful pension systems often have a solidarity pillar ( public ) and a contributory pillar ( private ) . 
And so on . 
This is old hat to students of modern public policy . 
That is the bad news . 
The good news is that the ideas already exist to provide a progressive alternative to 1960s-vintage Corbynismo . 
Some were developed in the rich world ; others in emerging countries . 
Political leadership - Italy &apos;s prime minister , Matteo Renzi , is one example - is now required to push those ideas forward .
