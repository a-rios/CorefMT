The Tails Wagging the Kremlin Dog ? 
MOSCOW - Imagine a crank who tries to pass himself off as a nineteenth-century Russian baron . 
He grows sideburns , wears a long frock-coat , and carries a walking stick . 
Anyone who runs into such a figure would sneer and mock him . 
Now , suppose that same crank attempted to treat passersby as if they were his serfs . 
In that case , he would risk getting a beating , though perhaps a few beggars would indulge his fantasies in the hope of duping him out of his money . 
Something of this sort now characterizes relations between Russia and several former Soviet republics , for the foreign-policy doctrine that guides today &apos;s Kremlin is a preposterous mix of nineteenth-century Realpolitik and early twentieth-century geopolitics . 
According to this view , every great power needs obedient satellite countries . 
Under such an approach , NATO &apos;s expansion is represented as an extension of America &apos;s sphere of influence , to the detriment of Russia , of course . 
In order to compensate for its growing inferiority complex , Russia has cobbled together the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) , which , by its title and constitutional principles , is a parody of NATO . 
For all this , the Kremlin is not in the least embarrassed by the fact that the CSTO is essentially a mechanical connection of bilateral military agreements between Belarus , Armenia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , and Russia . 
Nobody knows what vision of collective defense is to be implemented : one needs a fertile imagination to imagine Belarusian paratroopers defending the Tajik border . 
Moreover , the constitutions of a number of CSTO countries expressly prohibit sending troops outside national territory . 
But the Kremlin &apos;s myopic concentration on military matters , and its pointless attempts to play a zero-sum game with the West has turned Russia into an object for manipulation by its junior partners . 
The virtuoso of such manipulation is Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko . 
Belarus &apos;s economy can function only if Russia subsidizes energy prices and allocates non-repayable credits . 
Yet , despite all this , Lukashenko manages to avoid implementing economic projects profitable to Russia ( i.e. , a single currency ) . 
Whenever Russia applies pressure , he immediately starts yelling about Moscow &apos;s &quot; ingratitude &quot; - proclaiming that &quot; 10,000,000 Belarusians protect Russia from NATO &apos;s tanks . &quot; 
Worse , whenever Moscow persists in its demands , Lukashenko abrogates agreements without a twinge of conscience . 
Thus , when Russia banned imports of Belarusian dairy products ( in an attempt to punish Lukashenko for accepting a $ 2,000,000,000 credit but not fulfilling his promise to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia ) , Lukashenko refused to attend a CSTO summit or join its collective agreement for the establishment of an operational response force . 
Lukashenko avoids any major integration projects , even those in the military sphere . 
The most telling example is the creation of a joint air defense system . 
Both Russia and Belarus have been trying to realize this project for ten years ; countless agreements have been achieved - on paper . 
Yet no concrete action is taken . 
Lukashenko , simply , does not intend to allow even a small part of his army to become subordinated to Moscow . 
While the military threat in the West looks as illusory as it is , in Central Asia that threat is concrete . 
In the event that the coalition of NATO forces in Afghanistan is defeated , a wave of Islamic extremism will submerge the Central Asian states , inciting local civil wars . 
For Russia , this could mean ( in the best case ) tens of thousands of refugees or ( in the worst case ) the arrival of armed militias on its territory . 
As a result , the Kremlin has a vital interested in NATO &apos;s success in Afghanistan . 
Yet , for the last four years , Russia has tried to hinder NATO in every possible way . 
In 2005 , at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , Vladimir Putin pressed for the final declaration to include a demand for withdrawal of American bases from Central Asia . 
Kremlin strategists explained that they feared the US would oust Russia from Central Asia . 
But , now that a Russian-American agreement allows supply flights to Afghanistan to go through Russian airspace , it is clear that Russia sought only to monopolize the military cargo transportation routs in order to gain leverage over the United States . 
In February , the Kremlin gave Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev $ 500 million for a promise to close America &apos;s base in his country . 
Then the Americans offered Bakiyev $ 160 million a year , and now there may be no official base , but a &quot; transit center &quot; that serves the same functions . 
So the Kremlin paid out several hundred million dollars just to replace some signs . 
Soon after this , Russian Vice Premier Igor Sechin and Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov were sent to Bishkek in an effort to get something for Russia &apos;s money . 
Bakiyev seems to have said : so , you are worried about the American military presence in Central Asia , and you want to confront it . 
Fine , the Americans can have one base in Kyrgyzstan , and Russia can have two . 
The resulting &quot; military asset , &quot; however , is strategic gibberish , having been built in Kyrgyzstan &apos;s near-lawless Osh region , with its appalling poverty , drug trafficking , and ethnic tensions . 
Seizure of a Russian military base in order to acquire weapons is , indeed , likely to become a vital goal of &quot; extremists . &quot; 
But , in a way , the Russian soldiers there are already hostages - not least to the Kremlin &apos;s bankrupt foreign policy .
