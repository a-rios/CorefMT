Learning the Art of the Possible in Latin America 
Shortly after he was elected Uruguay &apos;s first left-leaning president , Tabaré Vázquez declared that , &quot; We have to reconstruct the future from the limitations of our own times . &quot; 
Reconstruction and transformation are occurring across Latin America . 
A &quot; pink tide &quot; has brought politicians like Vázquez to center stage , posing a challenge for North America and Europe . 
Reform and high commodity prices are buoying the region . 
Latin America &apos;s economies are doing better now than they have in a long time . 
But reconstruction doesn &apos;t happen overnight . 
The &quot; limitations &quot; that Vázquez spoke of are vast . 
Latin America is still far from being able to compete with the might of China or India . 
The richest 10 % of its people earn nearly half the total income , while the poorest 10 % earn just 1.6 % . 
In contrast , the top tenth in industrialized countries earn 29.1 % of total income , while those in the bottom tenth earn 2.5 % . 
Across Latin America and the Caribbean , one in four people survive on less than $ 2 a day . 
Fifty million - equivalent to the entire population of the United Kingdom - cope on less than $ 1 . 
Moreover , 14 % of the region &apos;s inhabitants lack enough income to afford basic healthcare . 
Perceptions of corruption and inefficiency are high , underpinning weak public trust in institutions , while infrastructure investment has recently declined sharply . 
Although Latin America has the will to solve its massive challenges , it lacks the resources to solve everything at once . 
So it is important to get an overview of how Latin America &apos;s scarce financial resources would be used most effectively . 
This October , together with the Inter-American Development Bank , the Copenhagen Consensus Center will host a conference - the Consulta de San Jose - that will look at what can be done throughout the continent . 
Of course , the region has seen many such well-meaning conferences . 
How much could be achieved if additional funds were spent on education , on making public administration more efficient , or on combating violence and crime ? 
The Consulta de San Jose will carefully examine these and other issues , ranging from healthcare to the future of the region &apos;s environment . 
A team of 20 regional specialist economic experts drawn from Latin America and elsewhere will weigh up options and carefully consider the costs and benefits of the identified solutions . 
The team consists of eminent academics , including economist and Chilean finance minister Andrés Velasco , United Nations Under-Secretary General José Antonio Ocampo , Harvard University professor and former Venezuelan Central Bank board member Ricardo Hausmann , and Nancy Birdsall , president of the Center for Global Development . 
In closed sessions , the panel will create a prioritized list of the most promising solutions . 
To draw in community participation and involve the region &apos;s future leaders , students from one of the top business schools in the region will weigh in . 
They will listen to the same experts on corruption , schooling , health , and the environment , but will bring the perspective of youth to their deliberations . 
Currently , Latin American policymakers and aid organizations spend money without the guidance of a coherent , explicit set of options . 
As a result , they don &apos;t know whether their resources help the most people possible . 
This conference underscores the region &apos;s desire to be self-sufficient . 
Latin America is undergoing an exciting transformation . 
The Consulta de San Jose may be able to help it construct a future with fewer limitations .
