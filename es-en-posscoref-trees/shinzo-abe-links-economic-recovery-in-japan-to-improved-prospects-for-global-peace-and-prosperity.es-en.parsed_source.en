Japan &apos;s New Dawn 
DAVOS - For years , pundits called Japan the land of the setting sun . 
They said that for an economy as mature as Japan &apos;s , growth would be impossible . 
They said that our public debt was unsustainable . 
They pointed to our supposed psyche of resignation as a symptom of relative decline . 
But now such voices are rarely heard . 
Japan &apos;s economy has swung from negative to positive growth and is on the verge of breaking free from chronic deflation . 
This spring , wages will increase - a long overdue development that will lead to greater consumption . 
Our fiscal position has also improved steadily , with my government on track to consolidate public finances . 
And , as the economy has turned around , Japan &apos;s people have become more vibrant and upbeat - a mood reflected in public enthusiasm over the choice of Tokyo to host the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games . 
So it is not twilight , but a new dawn , that is breaking over Japan . 
I have maintained that I am willing to act like a drill bit , strong enough to break through the solid rock of vested interests . 
For example , we will completely liberalize Japan &apos;s electricity market . 
By the time the Olympians arrive in six years , the power sector will be fully competitive , with electricity generation separated from distribution . 
We will also foster medical care as an industry . 
Japan is on the forefront of regenerative medicine , and we will make it possible to generate stem cells at private-sector labs . 
Moreover , we are eliminating the &quot; rice production adjustment &quot; system , which has been in place for more than 40 years . 
Barriers to private companies &quot; entry into the agricultural sector will be removed , and farmers will be allowed to grow the crops they want , without official control over supply and demand . 
Soon , our deregulation package will be set in motion . 
Over the next two years , in designated areas , no vested interests will remain impervious . 
For example , in Japanese cities aspiring to world-class status , limits on floor space will become a thing of the past . 
We will soon see high-quality housing , business complexes , and zero-emissions towns appearing , one after another . 
Likewise , the Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) will remain a central pillar of my economic policies , and we will press ahead with the Japan-European Union Economic Partnership Agreement . 
As a result , Japan &apos;s economy will become even more deeply integrated into global flows of knowledge , trade , and investment . 
Companies and people from abroad will find Japan among the most business-friendly places in the world . 
Japan &apos;s management of public funds - such as the Government Pension Investment Fund , which now holds about $ 1.2 trillion - will also undergo far-reaching change . 
We will press ahead with reforms , including a review of the GPIF &apos;s portfolio , to ensure that public funds contribute to growth-nurturing investments . 
We must also make our corporate taxes internationally competitive . 
And we will put in place tax incentives aimed at encouraging companies to use their cash for capital investment , research and investment , and wage increases . 
At the same time , we will reform labor-market rules that tie workers to old industries . 
New industries require innovative and creative human resources , and we will redirect our subsidies so that workers without meaningful employment in declining industries can move on and find rewarding work in rising sectors . 
Of course , given that Japan &apos;s population is rapidly aging , and the number of children is falling , investors find themselves asking an obvious question : &quot; Where will Japan find the innovative and creative human resources that it needs ? &quot; 
Arianna Huffington once quipped that if Lehman Brothers had been &quot; Lehman Brothers and Sisters , &quot; the firm would have survived . 
Japan &apos;s corporate culture is even more male-dominated - a world of pinstripes and button-downs . 
I was greatly encouraged when Hillary Clinton told me that Japan &apos;s GDP could be 16 % larger if women participated in the labor market at the same rate as men . 
Indeed , Japan &apos;s female labor force is the economy &apos;s most underused resource . 
Japan must become a place where women shine . 
By 2020 , we want women to occupy 30 % of leading management positions - a goal that presupposes a more flexible working environment , as well as support from foreign workers to take over domestic and personal services . 
A major impetus for change will come in the form of legal reforms , to be introduced at the next parliamentary session , that will increase the number of external directors on corporate boards . 
Next month , we will also propose a stewardship code that will enable institutional investors to play a greater role in corporate governance . 
I am confident that the combined effect of these reforms will enable Japan to double its inward direct investment by 2020 , rebooting the entire country and changing its economic landscape dramatically . 
But there is still much to do . 
Soon , three years will have passed since the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck northeastern Japan on March 11 , 2011 , causing the failure of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant . 
While the recovery is far from complete , the love and compassion reflected in the world &apos;s response touched us deeply , as has the survivors &quot; spirit of perseverance and mutual aid to overcome hardship . 
It is in the same spirit that Japan is now set to contribute even more positively to world peace and development . 
In our age , no single country can preserve peace by itself . 
None of us alone can solve the challenges that the world faces without helping one another . 
In Cambodia , for example , a Japanese-built hospital for mothers and newborns has helped to reduce the country &apos;s infant-mortality rate . 
In the Philippines , Japan &apos;s Self-Defense Forces mounted a major relief effort after the devastating typhoon in November . 
Japan is surrounded by neighbors with unlimited possibilities : China , South Korea , the ASEAN countries , India , Russia , and , across the Pacific Rim , the TPP partner countries . 
Indeed , with Asia becoming the engine driving the world economy , the need to achieve lasting peace and prosperity has never been greater , because the global knock-on effect of any threat to regional stability would be enormous . 
The foundation underpinning prosperity is freedom of movement for people and goods . 
On sea-lanes , in air space , and now in outer space and cyber space , freedom of movement must remain secure . 
The only way to maintain these indispensable public goods is by rigorously upholding the rule of law and promoting fundamental values like freedom , human rights , and democracy . 
There is no alternative . 
Asia &apos;s growth dividend must not be wasted on military expansion . 
We must use it to invest in innovation and human capital , which will further boost growth in the region . 
As is true elsewhere , trust among Asian countries is crucial for their peace and prosperity , and this can be achieved only through dialogue and adherence to international law , not through force or intimidation . 
In order to create a region of trust and order , I would like to appeal to Asia and the world . 
To prevent unchecked military expansion in Asia , defense budgets should be made completely transparent , with verifiable public disclosure . 
Moreover , Asian governments should create a mechanism for crisis management and strong communication channels among our armed forces . 
We must also establish rules that promote behavior based on international maritime law . 
Only then can we achieve lasting growth and prosperity in Asia , enabling all of us in the region to realize our great potential . 
Japan has pledged that it will never again wage war , and we have never stopped working for a world that is at peace . 
It is my fervent hope that Japan &apos;s economic revival , with its promise of increased global and regional prosperity , will help to bring such a world closer .
