Righting the EU Constitution 
The prospect of multiple referenda on the European Union Constitution has dramatically altered the betting on ratification . 
Both europhiles and eurocrats shudder at the prospect that rejection in several member states , particularly in a large one , might kill the project , leaving the Union to muddle through with the Nice Treaty . 
On the other hand , if the protagonists are patient , the winds of democracy could lead to a stronger constitution , free of the risks of economic and judicial nightmare that some aspects of the present draft entail . 
The EU urgently needs to democratize its procedures and reorganize its institutions to ensure that this year &apos;s enlargement does not lead to bureaucratic deadlock . 
The draft Constitution provides acceptable answers to many questions of governance . 
But the elevation of the Social Chapter , previously a list of good intentions , to the status of fundamental constitutional rights , threatens to encumber workers and businesses in the member states with burdensome judicial proceedings and expensive social entitlements written by judges in Luxembourg whose last word is beyond appeal . 
The inclusion in Part II of the draft on &quot; social rights &quot; - such as the right not to be unjustly dismissed , or the right to receive old-age pensions , unemployment compensation , and health benefits ( regardless of cost ) - is in no way necessary to the functioning of the whole . 
These social protections are laudable , but all have a cost . 
The very term &quot; social right &quot; is a misnomer . 
If something is a &quot; right , &quot; then cost is not an issue . 
For instance , no economic cost is too great for the defense of freedom of speech . 
The desirability of generous public pensions , on the other hand , cannot be dissociated from their cost to taxpayers . 
Social protections should be framed in laws enacted by democratically elected legislators , who are well placed to weigh the costs and benefits for their constituents . 
The most ardent advocate of expanded health care rights should agree that the forum for that advocacy is the Parliament , not the European Court of Justice . 
These protections have no place in a constitution , particularly one that cannot be easily amended . 
The fact that certain &quot; social rights &quot; have made their way into some national constitutions on the Continent is no reason to impose them , as the present draft does , on the entire Union . 
It is noteworthy that in the Scandinavian countries , which enjoy some of the most progressive social protections in Europe , these benefits are provided by statutory laws enacted by legislatures rather than by courts enacting constitutional &quot; rights . &quot; 
They are the social dividend , allocated by national parliaments , of real economic growth . 
Supporters of the European Constitution in France , on both the left and the right , shrug and say that including the Social Chapter in the draft is a compromise . 
The &quot; social rights &quot; in Part II are seen as compensating voters on the left for , say , enshrining &quot; competition &quot; as a fundamental objective of the Union in Part I. But neither provision belongs in the Constitution . 
Natural monopolies are sometimes economically desirable , and it is legislators , not judges , who should decide whether and when they are to be permitted . 
For a decade , Britain stood almost alone against expanding the Social Chapter . 
In the constitutional convention , the Blair government accepted the inclusion of its provisions in the body of the text , but insisted on language limiting their reach . 
The trouble is that the British safeguards do not work . 
Article II-52 states that the Fundamental Rights in the Constitution ( including its 12 &quot; social rights &quot; ) apply only to the actions of the Union , and of member states when they are implementing Union decisions . 
But as Europe integrates , these decisions will become pervasive . 
If EU environmental directives , for instance , call for the closure of a heavily polluting plant in Britain , the Constitution would give labor unions the right to judicial appeals against the resulting redundancies . 
Fortunately , this fault line in the British safeguards can be corrected without jeopardizing the document . 
The simplest solution is to remove the Fundamental Rights of Part II from the body of the text , and give them the status the Social Chapter had in the Treaty of Amsterdam : a declaration of intentions appended to the Treaty . 
All traditional individual rights are already covered in the Declaration of Human Rights , which will continue to be enforced by the court in Strasbourg . 
&quot; Social rights &quot; should not become mandates for judges ; they should remain a guide to legislators . 
If a political compromise is needed , &quot; competition &quot; should be removed as a fundamental Union objective . 
Free movement of goods , services , labor , and capital certainly suffices . 
If this preferred solution proves unacceptable , an alternative would be to strengthen Article II-52 , to state clearly that the twelve &quot; social rights &quot; of Part II apply to the Union , but not to the member states , even when these are implementing Union directives . If the Union decides , as it could , that all member states must provide public health care for all unemployed persons , it would be up to national parliaments , not 25 judges in Luxembourg , to determine how to address that objective . 
This would take some of the teeth out of the Union &apos;s social directives , and would give real substance to the principle of subsidiarity . 
By excising from the draft Constitution the prospect of a welfare state run by judges , its framers will increase the chances that Britain and other doubters will , in the end , ratify the final product .
