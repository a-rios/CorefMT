The Ethics of &quot; Biosecurity &quot; 
An ominous new word has crept into the life sciences and biomedical research : &quot; biosecurity . &quot; 
The term reflects a growing awareness that rapid developments in these fields offer the potential for great benefits , but that the knowledge , tools , and techniques that enable scientific advances also can be misused to cause deliberate harm . 
Any effort to address this &quot; dual use &quot; dilemma must ultimately be international , since biotechnology research is a genuinely global enterprise . 
The international scientific community has a key role to play in ensuring that efforts to manage the risks improve security and strengthen international collaboration to ensure non- maleficent use of scientific advances . 
Professor Ronald Atlas of the University of Louisville and I recently presented a proposed Code of Ethics for the Life Sciences in the journal Science . 
Our proposal what we need for a code and for its contents have both met with strongly conflicting views . 
The scientific community increasingly recognizes that science itself is not a value-free activity and , therefore , the choice of what research to undertake and how to undertake it must be governed by ethical principles . 
But there is still a nucleus of scientists who oppose that concept , arguing that there must be no restrictions on the search for new knowledge , and that ethical principles only become relevant in the application of that knowledge . 
In our Science article , we speculated on scientists &quot; reasons for holding such a view . 
But , as we noted , &quot; even those who question the value of a code agree that research in the life sciences , including biodefense research , must be conducted in a safe and ethical manner . &quot; 
Bodies speaking out publicly about this need include the General Assembly of the World Medical Association , the British Medical Association , the US National Research Council , the British Parliament , and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) leaders . 
A code of ethics is needed because the power of science to result in harm , if it is not well governed , has grown vastly . 
Society has entrusted scientists and scientific institutions to show respect for life , in particular human life . 
Safeguards are needed to ensure fulfillment of that trust , in particular , to ensure that science is not used in the cause of bioterrorism or biowarfare . 
A code of ethics offers several benefits . 
It would underscore the importance of ethics reviews of proposed scientific research and monitoring of ongoing research , especially research involving humans or animals as subjects . 
It can also establish a basic presumption of scientific openness and transparency , while allowing for exceptions when there is a real risk that scientific knowledge could be used to cause serious harm . 
Moreover , a code of ethics could help protect &quot; whistle blowers &quot; who bring ethical breaches to the attention of the relevant authorities or the public . 
Finally , it could allow for conscientious objection to participation in certain research . 
In short , a code can help to embed ethics in all aspects of scientific research from its inception . 
Although no consensus has yet emerged on a code of ethics , there is wide agreement among scientists that a robust public health system is an essential safeguard against biological threats , whether intentional or unintentional . 
Security and public health concerns now overlap , whereas traditionally they had been separate areas that elicited different kinds of policy responses . 
Strengthening the response to naturally occurring infectious diseases or poisoning is needed to protect against the deliberate misuse of science to spread disease or poison . 
In short , promoting public health , biosafety , and biosecurity , on the one hand , and protecting against bioterrorism , on the other , are linked , complementary activities . 
But contemplating potential new bioweapons raises deeply worrying possibilities that return us to the problem of how to ensure ethics in scientific research . 
For instance , &quot; synthetic biology &quot; involves the creation of living material from its DNA components , so that we can re-engineer life in the manner of our choosing . 
The technology making this possible will most likely become common within the next two years at a substantially reduced cost . 
Safeguards such as a moratorium on such developments or registering the equipment needed to implement them should be considered . 
There are ancient taboos on the use of &quot; poison or plague &quot; as weapons or for warfare , and doing so has long been stigmatized in many cultures and prohibited by customary international law and international treaties . 
The taboo is the companion to the sacred : that which we regard as sacred we protect with taboos . 
We have lost both concepts in relation to much conduct in our contemporary world , but we urgently need to re-find them in relation to the new possibilities opened up by the life sciences if we are to continue to respect all life , especially human life . 
The challenge is no less than to prevent the life sciences from becoming the death sciences . 
That will require complex , multiple , varied , and integrated responses from a very wide variety of sources at individual , institutional , societal , and global levels . 
Above all , it will require integrity , honesty , trust , courage , and sometimes restraint . 
This is no small order at the level of international relations and cooperation .
