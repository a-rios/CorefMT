Lessons from America \ u0027s Fiscal Recklessness 
George W. Bush has done more to wreck US economic policy than any other President in American history , exceeding even his mentor , Ronald Reagan . 
In just three years in office , he has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had taken a decade to construct , and that could take another decade to re-create . 
In doing so , Bush has risked America &apos;s long-term economic health and social stability . 
Because the long-term budgetary challenges that the US is so badly mismanaging are not unique , America &apos;s fiscal blunders provide important lessons for other countries . 
The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while running up massive public debts , leaving repayment to the future . 
This trick can last a few years , but sooner rather than later budget deficits and growing public debt force a painful policy reversal . 
Yet a cynical politician can buy himself re-election and perhaps be in retirement when the crisis arrives . 
One would imagine that after hundreds of such episodes of fiscal irresponsibility around the world in recent decades , voters would be allergic to such tricks . 
Yet Bush is doing it again , buying popularity today by doling out massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending and even raising expenditure on education and health . 
The result is a budget deficit equivalent to more than 5 % of GDP . 
What &apos;s worse is that America &apos;s long-term budgetary prospects were already troubling before Bush began his reckless policies . 
The US population is aging , so there will be a sharp increase in the costs of publicly funded health care and pension systems . 
Careful calculations show that future revenues under the tax policies favored by Bush are likely to fall tens of trillions of dollars short of the costs of public pensions , health care , and other fiscal spending expected by the public . 
At some point in the future , there will thus need to be steep increases in tax collections , sharp cuts in public spending , or both , to correct Bush &apos;s actions . 
So why does the public support his policies ? 
Because the public has little understanding or concern about these long-term consequences , even though they will eventually hurt most Americans . 
The richest taxpayers are , of course , happy because they received the bulk of the tax cuts . 
Amazingly , the richest 5 % of US taxpayers received almost half of the tax cuts , and these rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95 %  - the middle class and the poor - to bear most of the future spending cuts and tax increases . 
Meanwhile , Bush has convinced many poor and middle-class voters that they should be happy , too , without telling them that they will have to pay for their small tax cuts with much larger cuts in future government services if his administration &apos;s policies prevail in the long term . 
If Americans had a political memory , they would understand that they already rode this fiscal &quot; roller coaster &quot; once in the past 20 years . 
Ronald Reagan also came to office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending . 
The result was a huge budget deficit by the middle of the 1980 &apos;s . 
Tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and helped win him re-election in 1984 . 
It then took over a decade - starting in Reagan &apos;s second term , and continuing through the terms of George Bush , Sr. and Bill Clinton - to get the budget back to surplus . 
Of course , this meant approving fresh tax increases , which cost George Bush , Sr. his re-election and led to the polarized politics of the 1990 &apos;s . 
History will almost certainly repeat . 
Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that today &apos;s budget deficits will eventually force government social spending to be cut sharply . 
They hope to dismantle programs such as Social Security and Medicare . 
But the US public strongly supports these social programs . 
So the right-wing strategy of cutting taxes first in order to force cuts in social programs later will fail , and eventually tax rates will have to rise . 
Others in the Bush administration argue that tax cuts are important for pulling the US out of recession . 
This argument is also mistaken . 
America &apos;s economy could have recovered without the tax cuts , and perhaps even more robustly . 
In any event , it is a huge mistake to base long-term tax policies on the short-run business cycle . 
There are two vital lessons for other countries . 
The first is that the looming US budget deficits will sooner or later limit America &apos;s international power . 
Americans supported the Iraq war only because they didn &apos;t have to pay for it with increased taxes . 
When Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes , they will be much less likely to support expensive military operations abroad . 
Indeed , the US will be deeply divided internally as the public grapples with the fiscal mess left by Bush . 
The second lesson is that countries ought to plan their budgets taking into account the rising fiscal costs of an aging population . 
Long-term budgetary conditions are rarely in clear view of taxpayers or the parliament . 
Governments should be required to submit long-term budget assessments together with their annual budget proposals , in order to reduce the tendency towards short-run political manipulation of the budget . 
The US can serve as an early warning to other countries . 
The White House ought to provide others with the same caveat that magicians on television give their viewers : &quot; Do not try this at home . &quot;
