Cut Now , Save Later 
WASHINGTON , DC - Central banks around the world have finally reacted to the global financial crisis by engineering a coordinated half-point interest-rate cut . 
That is welcome , but far more is needed - and quickly . 
If implemented now , steep rate cuts can still have a significant positive effect . 
If delayed , their effect is likely to be minimal . 
Across the board , the world &apos;s major central banks have been slow to respond to the deepening crisis . 
This failure reflects the dominance of conventional economics , which has produced closed-minded group-thinking within the global central banking community . 
As a result , central banks failed to see the oncoming financial tsunami , and even after it arrived they continued to fight the last war against inflation . 
The European Central Bank and the Bank of England have been the worst offenders . 
That is no surprise , as European central bankers are the most conventional in their thinking and have been the most obsessed with inflation . 
It also explains why Continental Europe has had such high unemployment rates for so long . 
The United States Federal Reserve Board has done a much better job , though it , too , has moved in fits and starts , repeatedly playing catch-up with a crisis that has persistently remained one step ahead of policy . 
This pattern reflects the Fed &apos;s own obsession with price stability , which encourages preemptive interest-rate increases to head off inflation , but restrains equivalent preemptive reductions to head off unemployment . 
Consequently , the Fed left its interest rate unchanged throughout the summer of 2008 , despite the collapse of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , AIG &apos;s insolvency , and the emergence of global financial-market contagion . 
Moreover , Fed policy remained constant despite rapid deterioration in America &apos;s real economy , indicated by accelerating job losses and rising unemployment . 
The coordinated rate cut now undertaken by the world &apos;s major central banks begins the process of policy catch-up , but further cuts are needed . 
Whereas the bogey of inflation seems finally to have been laid to rest , another myth must still be challenged - that the Fed and other central banks should save their &quot; bullets &quot; for a rainy day and should therefore resist cutting rates . 
There is an old saying about monetary policy being useless in recession because the effect of lowering interest rates is like &quot; pushing on a string . &quot; 
That happens when confidence and wealth have been destroyed , at which point rate cuts do indeed become useless . 
This is because the destruction of confidence undermines the &quot; animal spirits &quot; of capitalism : borrowers are unwilling to borrow and lenders are unwilling to lend . 
The destruction of wealth also destroys collateral , which means that even those who wish to borrow cannot . 
Meanwhile , insolvencies and foreclosures triggered by excessive interest burdens are not reversed by later rate cuts . 
By failing to act in a timely fashion , central banks have allowed a dangerous erosion of confidence and wealth , which is creating &quot; pushing on a string &quot; conditions . 
Fortunately , there is still time for decisive rate cuts now to have a robust impact . 
If central banks save their &quot; rate cut &quot; bullets for a later day , they may find that their ammunition is useless . 
The time to shoot is now .
