Taming the Arctic Oil Rush 
VIENNA - The rapid shrinkage of Arctic ice cover is one of the most dramatic changes in nature currently occurring anywhere on the planet , with profound environmental and economic implications . 
On one hand , we stand to lose one of the Earth &apos;s largest and most significant ecosystems . 
On the other hand , the once fabled northeast and northwest passages will reduce shipping times and costs by as much as half , bringing China and Japan much closer to Europe and North America &apos;s east coast . 
More immediately , the Arctic &apos;s vast reserves of fossil fuels and minerals will become far more accessible than they are today . 
On land , oil fields in Alaska and gas fields in northern Russia have been producing hydrocarbons on a large scale for many years , but the estimated reserves under the Arctic Ocean are much larger . 
At today &apos;s prices , these reserves could be worth more than $ 7 trillion , according to international energy companies ; factoring in the accompanying natural gas , $ 10 trillion would probably be a conservative figure . 
Because much of the Arctic Ocean is shallow and located on continental shelves , the bordering countries are scrambling to stake claims to exclusive economic zones under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea . 
The political heat is also being turned up in the Arctic Council , a body set up to facilitate cooperation between states with Arctic territories . 
Besides the eight members - Canada , the five Nordic countries , Russia , and the United States - the Council has six permanent observers , including major countries like Germany , France , and the United Kingdom . 
Now China , India , and Japan are pressing to get in . 
Not only states are playing for position in the Arctic . 
In the wake of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and the subsequent US drilling embargo , the approval of Shell &apos;s drilling operations off the Alaskan coast received considerable media attention . 
However , this year &apos;s planned drilling of three wells in the Chukchi Sea and two in the Beaufort Sea was first reduced to one well and then postponed until next year after a containment dome - an emergency device for stopping a blowout - was damaged . 
In other parts of the Arctic , though , exploratory drilling has continued . 
Cairn Energy is drilling south and west of Greenland . 
In Russia , Rosneft and BP are involved in a complicated arrangement to exploit Arctic offshore oil and gas resources - for example , in the Pechora Sea . 
Rosneft has also signed exploration agreements with Statoil , ExxonMobil , and Eni . 
Of the large oil companies , only one - France &apos;s Total - has argued against Arctic oil exploration and exploitation on the grounds of environmental risks and economic costs . 
There are several oil-related environmental risks specific to the Arctic Ocean . 
For starters , there is the weather and climate . 
This , together with frequent , powerful , and icy storms that appear on short notice , increases the likelihood of blowouts and other spills . 
Then there are the problems associated with remoteness . 
The BP disaster in 2010 happened in the best possible place in terms of nearby resources for capping a blowout : the Gulf of Mexico contains the world &apos;s largest concentration of oil companies , subcontractors , petroleum engineers , equipment , workshops , etc . 
In the Arctic , all of those resources are thousands of kilometers away . 
In the Gulf , the cleanup operations engaged tens of thousands of people in Mississippi and nearby US states . 
Where are such people to be found in the Arctic ? 
Furthermore , in warm waters , most of the oil and its effects largely dissipate within five years . 
The rule of thumb that chemical and biochemical processes double in speed with each increase of ten degrees Celsius is a reasonable approximation here , too . 
Thus , processes that take five years in the Gulf of Mexico would take more than 20 in the Arctic . 
Meanwhile , in the low biodiversity ecosystems of the Arctic , with their simple food webs , so-called cascading effects are more pronounced than in temperate or warm regions . 
The demise of one species or trophic level ( which contains organisms performing the same function in the food chain ) , leads to changes in others in a rapid sequence that is difficult to foresee . 
The new US rules for offshore oil operations in the Arctic - which forced Shell to postpone drilling until next year - are certainly stricter than the old rules , and will reduce the risk of a blowout . 
But , if one occurs , the only reliable way to stop it and cap the well is to drill a relief well . 
There is , however , one way to shorten the time required to cap a well to a matter of days : drill two holes in parallel from the start . 
In case of a blowout in one hole , the other could quickly become the relief well . 
Obviously , this would cause the cost of drilling to increase significantly .
