Getting to Yes with Putin 
PARIS - In the showdown with Russia over Ukraine , the weaknesses and divisions in European policy have been as encouraging for Russian President Vladimir Putin as America &apos;s hesitant approach to Syria was . 
If Europe is to act responsibly , three key concepts should define its policy toward Russia : firmness , clarity , and a willingness to find an acceptable compromise . 
Without firmness , nothing is possible . 
To be sure , Europe and the US made mistakes in the aftermath of the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse . 
The US , in particular , can be accused of acting arrogantly and unnecessarily humiliating Russia . 
But the Soviet Union &apos;s demise was the result of a long string of missteps , beginning with pre-Soviet Russia &apos;s inability to come to terms with modernity . 
Post-Soviet Russian leaders have yet to confront those failures . 
By adopting an aggressive , revisionist stance , Putin has made a historic and strategic mistake . 
Putin &apos;s model should have been Peter the Great . 
His ambition should have been to tie Russia &apos;s future to that of Europe . 
Instead , Putin turned for inspiration to Nicholas I , the most reactionary of Russia &apos;s nineteenth-century czars . 
The failure of Putin &apos;s policy can be seen by comparing Russia with China . 
The gap between the two - in terms of each country &apos;s behavior and achievements - has never been greater . 
At the G-20 Summit in Brisbane this month , China played its hand masterfully , highlighting its goodwill , particularly on the issue of climate change . 
Russia , meanwhile , appeared self-isolated - pathetically so , given the impact of its seclusion on its economy . 
Russia &apos;s stock exchange is collapsing . 
Its currency has lost 30 % of its value . 
The price of oil and gas - the mainstay of the Kremlin &apos;s budget - has fallen by more than 25 % . 
In contrast to China , Russia &apos;s economy depends heavily on its energy resources , leaving it vulnerable when global energy markets head south . 
Putin &apos;s only strength lies in Europe &apos;s weakness and irresolution . 
So Europe &apos;s goal must be to set clear limits on Putin &apos;s ambitions . 
Whether he is seeking to weaken Ukraine or to enlarge Russia &apos;s territory , Europe &apos;s response must be firm . 
Putin must be convinced that he cannot do either without paying a cost that Russians will not willingly bear . 
Given the Kremlin &apos;s ambiguous behavior - if not its deliberate policy of deceit - it seems obvious that France should not deliver a Mistral-class assault warship , which it previously agreed to sell to Russia . 
It is far better for France to be perceived as an unreliable arms dealer than as an irresponsible strategic actor , caring only about its mercantile interests . 
Firmness must be accompanied by clarity . 
Putin is no longer the leader he was when he came to power in 2000 , nor even the leader he was in 2008 , when he grabbed pieces of Georgia by force . 
Under his increasingly centralized and authoritarian rule , he has combined ultra-religious nationalism with Soviet-era tactics and practices . 
It is a dangerous and volatile mix , relying on principles and methods that led Russia &apos;s empires - Czarist and Soviet - to failure and ruin . 
Firmness and clarity are indispensable . 
But they are not sufficient to formulate a coherent European policy . 
The goal cannot be simply to contain Russia . 
A compromise must be reached . 
True , Russia lacks the means to achieve Putin &apos;s aims . 
But the rest of the world nonetheless needs the Kremlin &apos;s cooperation and goodwill as it pursues efforts such as the containment of Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions and the fight against the Islamic State . 
As long as Russia remains intent on achieving unacceptable outcomes , accompanied by hints of nuclear saber rattling , reaching a compromise will be difficult . 
Putin is far from an ideal partner with whom to attempt to reconcile the two key principles of international law : the right of a people to self-determination and the sanctity of national borders . 
But doing so is not impossible . 
Any compromise will have to address the future of Crimea , now under Russian domination , and maintain Ukraine &apos;s independence . 
Putin must be convinced that by gaining Crimea , he has lost Ukraine . 
For their part , Ukrainian leaders will have to make a commitment not to join NATO , in exchange for Russia &apos;s acceptance of Ukraine &apos;s right to enter the European Union . 
The progressive removal of sanctions would follow , allowing all parties to concentrate their energies on other priorities , be they economic or strategic . 
In its negotiations with Russia , Europe holds the stronger cards . 
But as long as they are poorly played , as they have been up to now , Putin will continue to win every hand .
