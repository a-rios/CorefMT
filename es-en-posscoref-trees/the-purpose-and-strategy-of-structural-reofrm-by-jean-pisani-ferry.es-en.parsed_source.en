Whose Economic Reform ? 
PARIS - Together with fiscal consolidation , structural reform is the new European mantra . 
International organizations and European Union bodies regard such reform as a prerequisite of economic recovery , growth , and alleviation of the unemployment plague . 
Indeed , the agreement reached between the Greek government and the &quot; troika &quot; ( the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission ) includes a 48-page list of detailed reforms . 
Not all countries are given such a long to-do list , but , since new EU legislation was adopted in 2010 , specific recommendations are addressed to all . 
For example , the brief addressed to Italy includes recommendations on the efficiency of public administration , the fight against corruption , corporate governance in the banking sector , the labor market , schools , taxation , opening up the services sector , and infrastructure . 
To be sure , European countries urgently need to implement deep reforms . 
Poor productivity growth and stubborn unemployment are evidence that their economies require comprehensive transformation . 
But if this observation provides the rationale for reform , it does not provide a firm enough basis for drawing up effective economic-revival plans . 
The design of a reform strategy requires solving two problems . 
The first is one of purpose . 
Successful societies are a diverse lot . 
Some are unequal , and others are egalitarian . 
Some cherish large welfare states , and others starve them . 
Some rely on extensive collective agreements , and others exclude them altogether . 
Some are based on arm &apos;s-length transactions , and others rely on recurring relationships . 
Scholars refer to &quot; varieties of capitalism &quot; to highlight the absence of a single template for success . 
But if there are different models , what should the priorities for reform be ? 
International organizations generally point out - rightly - that in most cases a country can improve economic efficiency without changing its economic model . 
For example , there is often ample room for achieving the same income redistribution at lower budgetary cost , or for ensuring that collective wage agreements take into account the interests of those without a job . 
So national models can be reformed while retaining arrangements that meet social preferences . 
This answer , however , is somewhat facile . 
Countries are not only inefficient ; often , they are also inconsistent . 
For example , they pretend to become global hubs but do not welcome foreigners , which is what prevented Japan &apos;s emergence as a world financial center in the 1990 &quot; s ; or they hope to develop as knowledge-based economies but dislike academic freedom ; or they aim to nurture innovation but do not want innovators to become rich . 
Such inconsistency is often a major impediment to development . 
By contrast , the success of the United States as an innovation powerhouse relies on a high degree of consistency across fields ranging from education and immigration to taxation and the labor market . 
So pro-growth reform not only requires substituting efficient arrangements for inefficient ones ; it also demands confronting hard choices , which is , at bottom , a political endeavor . 
For this reason , it is not something that any international organization can even suggest in lieu of a country &apos;s voters . 
The second problem in designing structural reform is one of strategy . 
As the economist Dani Rodrik has pointed out , standard analysis generally results in a laundry list of desirable reforms that does not tell governments where to begin . 
Apprehensive leaders start with the most politically expedient items , while bold leaders start with the most challenging prescriptions ; but there is no guarantee that either of these approaches will deliver the expected result . 
Even a seemingly rational strategy of correcting the largest inefficiencies first is not necessarily the appropriate one . 
One reason is that the effectiveness of reform may depend on conditions prevailing in other sectors : good universities , for example , cannot remedy the consequences of poor secondary education . 
Moreover , eliminating one distortion may be ineffective or even counterproductive : in an economy plagued with rents , partial reform may simply result in shifting them across sectors and agents , rather than reducing them to the benefit of consumers . 
As a result , considerable political energy may be consumed in pushing through measures that deliver very little . 
Instead , reform should start with the most binding constraint to performance ( which one that is depends on the whole set of hindrances that confront the economy ) . 
In addition , outcomes may depend on cyclical conditions . 
Advocates of structural reform generally claim that they aim to increase output and welfare in the medium term , and that the short term does not matter . 
But , while some reforms - for example , those improving access to credit or eliminating rents that harm consumers - can indeed help to boost growth during a demand shortfall like the one that Europe is now experiencing , others can have the opposite effect . 
For example , labor-market reforms that make it easier for companies to reduce staff may weaken demand further , underscoring the importance of considering reforms &quot; short-term effects . 
What all of this suggests is that an economic-reform agenda cannot result from a mechanical exercise . 
At some point , hard choices about priorities and sequencing must be made . 
This is not to say that international organizations and the EU are of no help . 
On the contrary , these bodies can be very valuable insofar as they carry out international comparisons and point out deficiencies . 
But there is a line in the sand beyond which only governments can set priorities and act . 
That , after all , is what voters elect them to do .
