Europe &apos;s Essential Unity 
BRUSSELS - Over the past ten years , the European Union has endured a series of unprecedented crises , the likes of which we are unlikely to see again . 
But other , no less daunting challenges lie ahead , and we would do well to remember the lessons learned along the way . 
One lesson is that unity is not an option ; it is a condition sine qua non of the EU &apos;s economic prosperity and political relevance . 
It is remarkable that since 2004 , when I became President of the European Commission , the EU &apos;s membership has nearly doubled , from 15 countries then to 28 now . 
There have been no defections . 
From 2004 to 2014 , we enlarged both the EU and the eurozone . 
I fought hard for that unity , particularly when defending , often against the odds , Greece &apos;s continued membership in the eurozone , as well as when arguing against splitting the eurozone , as some people proposed . 
The Commission remained attentive not only to the dramatic impact of a &quot; Grexit &quot; on Greece , but also to its possible financial , economic , and political cascade effects . 
Unlike others , we never lost sight of the systemic effects of decisions across the eurozone or the EU . 
The EU is already an economic and political reality . 
This requires solidarity and responsibility - in particular , solidarity from the Union &apos;s more prosperous countries and responsibility on the part of those countries in need of reform . 
The Commission has been equally firm in demanding both . 
The same logic applies to another core concern that I faced throughout my decade at the Commission : the need to deepen the eurozone while maintaining the integrity of the EU as a whole . 
This will remain a critical issue in the near future , if only because of the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom &apos;s status in our Union . 
Allowing for flexibility while avoiding fragmentation is now a well-established approach within the EU . 
But it was not always so . 
Some have long advocated establishing a completely separate institutional framework for the eurozone . 
I remain convinced that multi-speed European cooperation has become a necessity , but that a multi-tier Europe must be avoided at all costs . 
While integration must deepen further , especially in the eurozone , this can and should be done in a way that preserves the integrity of Europe &apos;s single market . 
Fortunately , this logic has been widely accepted , as demonstrated by the decision that the European Council &apos;s next president , despite being from a country ( Poland ) that is not yet in the eurozone , will nonetheless preside over eurozone summits . 
A second lesson we learned is that openness to the world is an asset , not a liability . 
That thinking - which needs to be reaffirmed and politically supported - underpinned our active trade agenda . 
Indeed , it put the EU at the forefront of efforts to liberalize and regulate international trade , enabling us to reap the full benefits of globalization . 
This is not just about Europe &apos;s economic wealth , but also about its political relevance on the global stage . 
One presupposes the other , requiring vigorous defense of the EU &apos;s interests and views in bilateral relationships with strategic partners and in multilateral fora , such as the United Nations , the World Trade Organization , the G-20 and the G-8 / G-7 . 
If the EU as a whole engages internationally , it can help to shape the international order . 
Our current engagement in Ukraine is a case in point , as were our efforts to lead a global response to the 2008-2009 financial crisis , namely by collectively resisting the allure of protectionism . 
It was on the EU &apos;s initiative that the world acted in a concerted and convincing way by establishing the G-20 Leaders &quot; Summit , comprising heads of state or government . 
Since then , the G-20 has become the premier forum for economic policy coordination among its members , giving concrete form to many of the ideas - for example , on a framework for balanced and sustainable growth , on financial regulation and supervision , and on action against tax evasion and fraud - that the EU proposed . 
The emergence of the G-20 has transformed the global system , and certainly helped to prevent the realization of worst-case scenarios in the aftermath of the crisis . 
The third lesson is that making Europe stronger - institutionally , politically , and economically - demands continued reform . 
Credibly delivering on important EU-level reforms enabled Europe to put the most existential phase of the crisis behind it . 
The system of economic governance that we put in place guarantees that EU members put their public finances in order , increase their competitiveness , and tackle their macroeconomic imbalances . 
We created the instruments needed to assist distressed countries , and the ensuing adjustment programs are delivering results . 
In short , we seized the momentum of the crisis to provide a structural response to the challenges we faced , in particular by establishing a European banking union . 
Step by step , despite strong resistance , we have changed the rules that govern financial institutions , the institutions that oversee banking operations , and the mechanisms to coordinate resolution of failed banks . 
Taken together , the reforms adopted since the start of the crisis have changed the way that Europe &apos;s economies and financial sector are legislated , supervised , and regulated . 
The framework has been created . 
But we also need to go further in advancing structural reforms at the national level . 
We can see that the countries that have done the most in this respect now have better economic prospects . 
We must not relax these efforts . 
We must not take for granted the progress that has been made . 
At the end of a ten-year rollercoaster ride as Commission President , I can confidently declare that Europe has shown great resilience . 
We have shown that the forces of integration are stronger than the forces of fragmentation . 
Despite all of the challenges we had to face - indeed , partly because of them - Europe remains united and open , and is now stronger and better able to face globalization .
