China Needs a Service-Sector Revolution 
BEIJING - China is getting its exchange-rate adjustment whether it likes it or not . 
While Chinese officials have announced their intention of letting the exchange rate move , only time will tell whether their talk is accompanied by deeds . 
Honda has offered its transmission-factory workers in China a 24 % wage increase to head off a crippling strike . 
Foxconn , the Taiwanese contract manufacturer for Apple and Dell , has announced wage increases of as much as 70 % . 
Shenzhen , to head off trouble , has announced a 16 % increase in the minimum wage . 
Beijing &apos;s municipal authorities have preemptively boosted the city &apos;s minimum wage by 20 % . 
The result will be to raise the prices of China &apos;s exports and fuel demand for imports . 
The effect will be much the same as a currency appreciation . 
China should count these wage increases as a measure of its success . 
Higher incomes are an entirely normal corollary of economic growth . 
The only difference in China is that the adjustment has been suppressed , so it is now coming abruptly . 
It would have been better had Chinese officials encouraged earlier and more gradual adjustment , and if adjustment had come through currency appreciation , which would have enhanced workers &quot; command over imports , rather than inflation , which will make no one happy . 
With exports of manufactures becoming more expensive , China will have to grow by producing something else . 
It will have to move away from a strategy in which manufactures are the engine of growth toward the model of a more mature economy , in which employment is increasingly concentrated in the service sector . 
China will never rival India as an exporter of high-tech and business services , because it lacks that country &apos;s large population of native English speakers . 
This is a point that Morgan Stanley &apos;s chief economist Stephen Roach makes in recent new book , The Next Asia . 
The good news , as Roach observes , is that the service sector places less burden on natural resources and creates more employment than manufacturing . 
The former is good news for China &apos;s carbon footprint , the latter for its social stability . 
But the bad news is that the transition now being asked of China - to shift toward services without experiencing a significant decline in economy-wide productivity growth - is unprecedented in Asia . 
Every high-growth , manufacturing-intensive Asian economy that has attempted it has suffered a massive slowdown . 
The problem is more than just the tendency of productivity to grow more slowly in services than manufacturing . 
Service-sector productivity growth in formerly manufacturing-heavy Asian economies has been dismal by international standards . 
In both Korea and Japan , to cite two key examples , the problem is not simply that productivity in services has grown barely a quarter as fast as it has in manufacturing for a decade . 
Why is this ? 
In countries that have traditionally emphasized manufacturing , the underdeveloped service sector is dominated by small enterprises - mom and pop stores . 
These lack the scale to be efficient , the ability to exploit modern information technology , and the capacity to undertake research and development . 
In Korea , less than 10 % of economy-wide R D has been directed at the service sector in the last decade . 
Enough said . 
In both Korea and Japan , large firms &quot; entry into the service sector is impeded by restrictive regulation , for which small producers are an influential lobby . 
Regulation prevents wholesalers from branching downstream into retailing , and vice versa . 
Foreign firms that are carriers of innovative organizational knowledge and technology are barred from coming in . 
Accountants , architects , attorneys , and engineers all then jump on the bandwagon , using restrictive licensing requirements to limit supply , competition , and foreign entry . 
One can well imagine Chinese shopkeepers , butchers , and health-care workers following this example . 
The results would be devastating . 
Where value added in Chinese manufacturing has been growing by 8 % a year , service-sector productivity is unlikely to exceed 1 % if China is unlucky or unwise enough to follow the example of Korea and Japan . 
Employing workers in sectors where their productivity is stagnant would not be a recipe for social stability . 
China needs to avoid the pattern by which past neglect of the service sector creates a class of incumbents who use political means to maintain their position . 
Perhaps China will succeed in avoiding this fate . 
Here at least may be one not-so-grim advantage to not being a democracy .
