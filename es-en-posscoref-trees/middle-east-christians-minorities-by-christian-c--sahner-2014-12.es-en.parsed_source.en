The Arab World &apos;s Vanishing Christians 
PRINCETON - This Christmas , like every Christmas , thousands of pilgrims and tourists will travel to the Middle East to celebrate the holiday in the land of the Bible . 
In Bethlehem , the birthplace of Jesus , the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem will lead a midnight mass , while in Syria - where some Christians still speak dialects of Aramaic , similar to the ancient language Jesus spoke - celebrations are likely to be subdued , curtailed by the dangers of a war that is tearing the country apart . 
At a time when the Middle East is aflame with sectarian strife , the observance of the Christian holiday is a sad reminder that the region &apos;s distinctive religious , ethnic , and cultural diversity is rapidly disappearing . 
At the beginning of the twentieth century , Christians made up roughly 20 % of the Arab world . 
In certain areas - including southern Egypt , the mountains of Lebanon , and southeastern Anatolia - they formed an absolute majority . 
Today , just 5 % of the Arab world is Christian , and many of those who remain are leaving , forced out by persecution and war . 
Jews , too - once a vital presence in cities like Cairo , Damascus , and Baghdad - have all but disappeared from the predominantly Muslim parts of the Middle East , relocating to Israel , Europe , and North America . 
Even in Muslim communities , diversity has been dwindling . 
In cities like Beirut and Baghdad , mixed neighborhoods have been homogenized , as Sunni and Shia seek shelter from sectarian attacks and civil war . 
The waning of diversity in the Middle East goes back more than a century , to the bouts of ethnic and religious cleansing that took place during the Ottoman Empire , including the murder and displacement of 1.5 million Armenian and Syriac Christians in eastern Anatolia . 
After the empire &apos;s collapse in 1918 , the rise of Arab nationalism placed Arabic language and culture at the center of political identity , thereby disenfranchising many non-Arab ethnic groups , including Kurds , Jews , and Syriacs . 
Many Greeks who had been living in Egypt for generations , for example , lost their livelihoods in the 1950s , when President Gamal Abdel Nasser , the great standard-bearer of pan-Arabism , nationalized privately owned businesses and industries . 
Others were forced to flee the country altogether . 
The rise of political Islam following the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War in 1967 dealt another blow to religious minorities . 
By promoting Islamic revival as a solution to the region &apos;s ills , Islamism led to the marginalization of non-Muslims , including groups that had played outsize roles in the region &apos;s economic , cultural , and political life for centuries . 
As a result , in places like Egypt , Christians have faced harsh social discrimination and violence , sometimes at the hands of the nominally secular state . 
The Arab Spring upheavals have given rise to grave new challenges to cultural and religious diversity in the Middle East . 
Many of the authoritarian regimes now under threat of collapse cultivated the support of minorities . 
This was especially true in Syria , where the Alawite-dominated Baath Party fostered ties to Christians and other small communities by presenting itself as a bulwark of secularism and stability in the face of a supposedly threatening Sunni majority . 
Now that Syria &apos;s Sunnis have risen up against their Alawite rulers , Christians &quot; loyalty to the regime has become a liability , even a danger . 
In some corners , Christians are regarded as complicit in the government &apos;s brutal crackdown , making them targets for attack . 
The rise of the Islamic State over the last year has sparked even more violence against minorities . 
Powered by a fundamentalist Wahhabi ideology and a boundless appetite for bloodshed , the Islamic State seeks a return to an imagined pre-modern caliphate that subjugates Shia and treats non-Muslims as second-class citizens . 
When the Islamic State captures a city , its fighters give Christians the choice of paying a medieval tax known as the jizya , converting to Islam , or being killed . 
Many simply flee . 
The Yazidis of northern Iraq - whose plight on Mount Sinjar was much publicized this past summer - are even less lucky . 
The Islamic State regards them as pagans , and therefore , undeserving of the protections traditionally accorded to Christians or Jews under Islamic law . 
As a result , many Yazidis are murdered or enslaved . 
In addition to persecuting minorities , the Islamic State has set about erasing all physical traces of religious diversity . 
Its forces have demolished Sufi shrines , Shia mosques , Christian churches , and ancient monuments they consider to be remnants of a corrupt and profane past . 
Western governments &quot; protection of ethnic and religious minorities in the region has been a controversial matter for more than a century , and it remains so today . 
Many Sunnis , for example , accuse America of favoritism : the United States intervenes to protect Kurds , Yazidis , and Christians in northern Iraq , they say , but does little to stop the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Sunnis in Syria . 
In fact , America &apos;s complicated history of church-state relations at home has made it reluctant to intervene on the part of any religious groups abroad , especially when the population is small . 
The end of diversity in the Middle East is a tragedy not only for those who have died , fled , or suffered . 
The region as a whole will be worse off as a result of their absence . 
Minorities have historically served as brokers between the Middle East and the outside world , and if they disappear , the region will lose an important class of cultural , economic , and intellectual leaders . 
How a society handles ethnic and religious diversity can tell us a great deal about its capacity to negotiate disagreements and transform pluralism from a liability into an asset . 
Yet diversity is all too often considered a source of weakness in the Middle East . 
It should be considered a strength , and one that is worth protecting .
