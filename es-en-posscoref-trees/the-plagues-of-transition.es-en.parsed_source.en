The Plagues of Transition 
It seems hardly worth noting that dictatorship and war are harmful to health . 
Over 20 million died of starvation in Mao &apos;s Great Leap Forward ; untold millions died under Lenin , Stalin and Hitler ; 
Pol Pot murdered two million Cambodians . 
Accurate body counts from the cruel regimes presiding over Burma , Afghanistan and the Congo remain unavailable but are certainly huge . 
During the past decade or so , greater peace and the fragile beginnings of democracy came to such troubled nations as South Africa , Mozambique , Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union . 
Millions gained essential human and civil rights , including the right to criticize their leaders . 
For many , the main struggle nowadays is finding a decent job and building a decent life . 
You &apos;d think health might be improving in the places that recently became more democratic . 
But all is not well in such countries . 
In many , political and economic transition brought new plagues every bit as horrible as those associated with repression and war . 
During the 1980s , both Mozambique and South Africa , for example , were largely spared the HIV epidemic then devastating East and Central Africa . 
Mozambique was at war : villages were isolated , and migrant workers , who would eventually bring the virus into the country , were few . 
South Africa , too , had few cases before 1990 , largely because apartheid &apos;s influx controls , limited migration from countries where HIV was prevalent . 
After apartheid &apos;s fall and the end of the war in Mozambique , migration soared , so that the shanty-towns surrounding South Africa &apos;s cities and mines became among the fastest growing in the world . 
It is in such places - where the impoverished , lonely and displaced end up - that HIV puts down deep roots . 
South Africa now has more people living with HIV than any other nation . 
Meanwhile , in Russia , cases of drug resistant tuberculosis have risen sharply since 1990 , especially in the nation &apos;s overcrowded jails . 
TB is hard to cure , because patients must take a combination of up to four drugs for at least six months ; if patients do not complete the treatment , drug resistance commonly results . 
Under the Soviet regime , drug treatment was usually available to prisoners with TB . 
The collapse of the Soviet Union , however , saw health services collapse too ; now patients may receive only part of the curative regimen . 
Among ordinary Russians not in jail , alcoholic binges , drug abuse and other forms of self-destruction have incited a huge surge in death rates since 1990 , rates which studies indicate have been rising fastest where the effects of political transition are most pronounced ; that is , where unemployment and labor turnover rose most sharply . 
Dictators and warlords , terrible as they are , cannot be solely blamed for these plagues of transition . 
One pattern , however , seems to be emerging . 
The after-effects of transition are most deadly among populations made most vulnerable by generations of abuse and tyranny . 
In South Africa , more than a century of white rule stifled the indigenous economy and established a migrant labor system throughout Southern Africa that disrupted families and created a social ecology favorable to the spread of HIV . 
Health care systems that served blacks received a tiny fraction of the expenditure that white services did , so when HIV arrived , it encountered an extremely vulnerable population . 
In Mozambique , war , partly abetted by the Cold War superpowers , left the country profoundly under-developed without health services or employment for it &apos;s citizens . 
In Russia , the Soviet system , which once invested heavily in heath care , allowed health systems to disintegrate after the economy stalled in the 1970s . 
Then , in the 1990s , price increases and government spending cuts associated with the transition to a free market , served the coup de grace . 
By contrast , during the past ten years in Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , where Communist rule was less brutal than in Russia , health has improved . 
Dictatorial regimes leave a terrible vacuum . 
When they give way , disease , despair and death rush in . 
But the plagues of transition are more than a health crisis ; they signify a deeper malaise . 
So put aside the fact that these diseases are infectious and can easily spread , or the idea that the fortunate bear some moral responsibility for the welfare of the poor and sick , and merely consider the economic consequences of the plagues of transition . 
The World Bank calls AIDS &quot; the foremost threat to African development . &quot; 
Companies in South Africa stagger from losing so many workers to AIDS . 
A generation of children from families ruined by AIDS , grow up without the care and education needed to become producers , let alone consumers . 
Meanwhile , thousands of young Russians and Ukrainians languish in TB wards or succumb to alcohol and drug addiction . 
All this disease and despair deserves more than sympathy , if only because in this globalizing world , the prosperity of one nation increasingly depends on the prosperity of others . 
Confronting the AIDS epidemic in the developing world will cost billions ; so will rebuilding Russia &apos;s health care system . 
The longer we turn our backs , however , the more expensive solutions become and the less we can escape the fact that this is now our problem and our responsibility .
