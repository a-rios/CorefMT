Preventing the Euro &apos;s Next Crisis 
LUXEMBOURG - Much dedication and energy are currently being devoted to institutionalizing a crisis-management mechanism for the euro area . 
This is a good and important goal . 
But a far more significant challenge - largely covered in the accompanying debate - is the need for crisis prevention . 
At the European Union &apos;s pre-Christmas summit , European heads of state and government agreed in principle to replace the Luxembourg-based European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) , which was thrown together practically overnight in May 2010 , with a new , permanent European stability mechanism in 2013 . 
That decision - and the speed with which it was reached - reflects the insight that the euro area &apos;s institutional framework will remain incomplete until there are clear rules for handling financial crises . 
But , while it is clear that the euro area will have solid and well-equipped quarantine wards should it once again be afflicted by financial contagion , a vaccine to prevent the infection would be far more effective . 
Unfortunately , developing one is receiving too little attention in the political arena . 
The starting point should be the weaknesses of the euro area &apos;s rules and regulations . 
The monetary union &apos;s distinctive feature is the absence of a common state , despite the single currency . 
The euro &apos;s architects were well aware that the participating states &quot; maintenance of sound public finances was a vital precondition for the new currency &apos;s stability . 
A compromise was found with the Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) and its provisions for adhering to the Maastricht criteria , which sought to quantify the fiscal soundness of sovereign states without actually interfering with their budget and tax policies . 
Today , we know that this was a poor compromise . 
There has been a lack of political will to make a clear commitment to a stability-oriented fiscal policy , illustrated by the weakening of the SGP at the instigation of Germany and France in 2005 . 
And individual euro-area members have since neglected to observe even the discipline required under the weakened version of the pact . 
Indeed , there have been nearly a hundred violations of the SGP &apos;s deficit ceiling ( 3 % of GDP ) since the euro was introduced - and all have gone unpunished . 
Given these repeated breaches of the SGP &apos;s deficit requirements , together with a similar lack of commitment to the pact &apos;s debt limit ( 60 % of GDP ) , it is hardly surprising that punishment for some states has come from the markets . 
The debt crisis in the euro area has highlighted the unwillingness or inability of politicians to maintain a fiscal policy consistent with the stability requirements . 
Instead , both long-term objectives and sustainable public finances have been sacrificed for the short-term promise of electoral success . 
This implies the need to separate national debt management in the euro area from short-term electoral constraints . 
What is required is a stronger emphasis on automatic sanctions for fiscal profligacy and excessive debt than is contained in the EU Commission &apos;s current proposal for reform . 
It is all well and good to counter undesirable economic developments at an early stage , as the Commission &apos;s plan promises , but the time to begin is not when fiscal distortions actually threaten . 
Such distortions are generally preceded by a buildup of macroeconomic imbalances . 
For a while , booming or overheating real-estate markets and a thriving , but oversized banking sector can disguise a gradual loss of competitiveness and risks to fiscal sustainability , as occurred in the euro area . 
Only when it was too late did seemingly solid national budgets come under substantial pressure . 
Effective prevention must start when undesirable economic trends arise . 
An independent body of experts that publicly calls for member states to correct their macroeconomic course - based on objective and comprehensible indicators , such as unit labour costs - could make an important contribution in this regard . 
Of course , Europe &apos;s political class doesn &apos;t like suggestions like this , because they entail surrendering some degree of national sovereignty . 
After all , public finances are a major competency of politics . 
But wouldn &apos;t that loss be offset by greater solidarity in case of a crisis ? 
It is worth noting that sovereignty &apos;s defenders never complained when the euro brought their countries the low inflation and interest rates of the euro &apos;s most stable predecessor currencies in exchange for handing over their monetary-policy competencies to the European Central Bank . 
A stable currency and sound public finances are two sides of the same coin - that &apos;s just how it is . 
Recent experience offers us an opportunity to extend EU institutions in a way that markedly reduces the likelihood of a new crisis . 
That means improved rules and regulations that place greater emphasis on crisis prevention than on crisis management . 
Those unwilling to pay the price of handing over national sovereignty in some areas tacitly accept that the eruption of a new crisis is only a matter of time . 
When it does , better-equipped quarantine wards will be poor consolation .
