Hope for Hong Kong 
LONDON - Hong Kong &apos;s democracy movement has gained admiration worldwide . 
The principles , decency , and behavior of its youthful vanguard inspire confidence in the qualities of the generation that one day will run the great city . 
That said , it is time to move on to a sensible endgame . 
The longer the standoff between Hong Kong &apos;s Chief Executive and the demonstrators continues , the more likely it is that individual citizens - and Hong Kong itself - will be hurt . 
The Hong Kong government should demonstrate some statesmanship , which the so-called &quot; Umbrella Movement &quot; - occupying the moral high ground and not wishing to risk losing public support - would surely reciprocate . 
A substantive and successful dialogue with the government would not require the protesters to call off their campaign for democracy ; it would simply end the current phase of a campaign that eventually will succeed . 
Despite their protestations to the contrary , Hong Kong Chief Executive C. Y. Leung and his government have considerable room for maneuver . 
As many Hong Kong citizens have argued , the Chinese government &apos;s current position is based on a report , submitted by Leung &apos;s officials , which purported to reflect accurately the outcome of local consultations on constitutional development . 
But the report plainly understated the degree of public support for change . 
Given what has happened in the last few weeks , Leung could quite properly give a new report to the authorities in Beijing focusing on two issues not proscribed by Hong Kong &apos;s mini-constitution , the Basic Law . 
The first issue concerns not just the immediate question of the terms on which the Chief Executive will be elected in 2017 , but also how the Legislative Council should be elected in 2016 and after . 
The procedure is largely a matter for the Hong Kong government to decide . 
It is surprising that 17 years after the handover of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China , Hong Kong still does not have a directly elected legislature . 
In December 1992 , Margaret Thatcher suggested in a speech in the House of Lords that , if all went well , Hong Kong could have universal suffrage by 2007 . 
Unfortunately , all has not gone well . 
The legislature today comprises a mix of directly elected members and those representing functional constituencies : corporate interests and groups of employees . 
Some civic groups have advocated increasing the number of directly elected legislators and opening up the functional constituencies to broader electorates . 
Moreover , the brake that the functional constituencies can put on legislation should be scrapped , leaving decisions to a simple majority . 
This could be accompanied by a pledge to create a legislature composed entirely of directly elected members in 2020 . 
The second issue concerns the composition and the voting rules of the handpicked 1,200-member election committee that will choose the Chief Executive in the future . 
The current proposed arrangements would permit the Chinese government to veto any candidate that it did not like , prompting criticism that what is on offer is an Iranian-style election : &quot; You can vote for anyone we choose . &quot; 
The Hong Kong government could call for changes to increase the openness and fairness by which the Chief Executive is chosen , without abandoning its current method in favor of universal suffrage . 
According to the Basic Law , the election committee should be &quot; broadly representative &quot; - a provision that the committee &apos;s current composition violates . 
Its membership is chosen by only 7 % of the total Hong Kong electorate , and its voting procedures seek to prevent the nomination of any candidates who may harbor democratic sympathies . 
Since 1997 , 55-61 % of voters have voted for democratic candidates in Legislative Council elections . 
The last time a slightly smaller election committee met ( to choose Leung ) , less restrictive constraints on candidate selection were in place , and the leader of the Democratic Party was able to be nominated ( though he still received less than 7 % of the vote ) . 
So Leung and his team should put forward proposals to broaden the electoral base of the election committee and open up the nominating process for candidates . 
There are plenty of recommendations from civil-society groups about how to accomplish these objectives . 
Both sides will need to give a little to prevent the confrontation in the streets from escalating , with the police forced to provide a substitute for a sensible policy . 
The British government has said that it is important that &quot; the people of Hong Kong have a genuine choice . &quot; 
Leung and his colleagues can give them one . 
This would not be all that the Umbrella Movement has demanded , but it should encourage the protesters to reach a compromise without departing from their longer-term goal . 
That is why Leung should embrace dialogue and compromise . 
Even a ruler whose mandate comes from heaven should heed the words of the Confucian sage Mencius : &quot; Heaven sees with the eyes of its people . 
Heaven hears with the ears of its people . &quot;
