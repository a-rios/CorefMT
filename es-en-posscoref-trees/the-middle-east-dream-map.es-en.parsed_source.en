The Middle East Dream Map 
The recent push given by President George W. Bush to the so-called Middle East &quot; road map &quot; is welcome , and the fact that both Israel and the Palestinians have accepted it is a good omen . 
Yet the chances that it will bring real , as opposed to merely rhetorical , progress toward reconciliation remain slim . 
The reasons are manifold : first , what is called a &quot; road map &quot; is in reality little more than a wish list of what has to be done in order to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians . 
It is a noble set of goals , but it sometimes appears to be distant from the region &apos;s political realities . 
For example , the road map rightly acknowledges that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be solved in a void ; regional considerations must be taken into account . 
The plan calls for far-reaching Israeli concessions : withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza , dismantling of settlements , some compromise about Jerusalem . 
At the same time , the &quot; quartet &quot; that composed the road map - the US , the EU , Russia , and the UN - realizes that Israel cannot be convinced to make such concessions without a fundamental change in the general attitude of the Arab world to the existence of the Jewish state . 
Despite peace with Egypt and Jordan , Israel remains threatened by such countries as Syria and Libya , whose extremist regimes are deeply involved in violent terrorism against civilians in Israel and either possess or try to possess weapons of mass destruction . 
For this reason , the road map premises peace between Israel and the Palestinians on normalization of relations between Israel and all Arab countries . 
Can this really be achieved in the foreseeable future ? 
Does the US - or , for that matter the Quartet - really believe they know how to move Syria or Libya from their current closed-mind position , which threatens Israel &apos;s existence ? 
There is no indication in the road map that the initiators have thought this out beyond wishing out loud that it would happen . 
Similarly , the road map is an attempt to revive the Oslo peace process . 
But this process , based in the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and the PLO , has been in serious trouble since Yasser Arafat rejected the peace package offered to him by Prime Minister Ehud Barak , with the support of President Bill Clinton , at Camp David in December 2000 . 
This was a watershed in Middle East politics - a massive change for the worse . 
The Palestinians &apos; refusal to accept - or even continue to negotiate about  -  the most generous and comprehensive Israeli offer since l967 in exchange for an end-of-conflict agreement signified that the Palestinians are not ready to accept Israel &apos;s legitimacy . 
There is now much more bitterness , fear , and hatred on both sides than in 2000 , when the Camp David negotiations failed . 
The direct and indirect support given by the Palestinian Authority to suicide bombing against civilians in Israel suggested to most Israelis that the Palestinians still view attacks against civilians as a legitimate weapon . 
The sometimes-brutal Israeli responses to such terrorism further embittered the Palestinians against Israel . 
True , the sidelining of Arafat and the appointment of Abu Mazen as the Palestinian Prime Minister is an important step in the right direction . 
But Abu Mazen &apos;s real power has yet to be tested . 
Does he really control the murky financial resources of the PLO , which gave Arafat so much real power beyond the formal title of head of the Palestinian Authority ? 
Most importantly , does Abu Mazen have the political will and power to really suppress - harshly , if necessary - the murderous terrorist gangs that control so much of the Palestinian population ? 
Much depends on the answers to these questions . 
Last but not least : by the admission of its drafters , the road map will take a number of years to implement - in the best case two , in the worst case three or four . 
It would need constant follow-up on dozens of contentious points at the highest level , i.e. , the US President . 
Is President Bush - or any US President - capable of effectively exercising his enormous authority , day in and day out for two or three years , to ensure that the parties really translate what might be just a verbal acceptance of vague language into painful , and even politically dangerous , decisions ? 
Past experience is not encouraging . 
The attention span of a US President is limited on any issue . 
Yet without his constant attention , the road map will run into the Middle East sand dunes that have already buried so many well-intentioned peace plans . 
What , then , can be achieved ? 
Perhaps , as in Bosnia and Kosovo - where nobody talks about a permanent solution , but violence has been stopped - what is needed is stabilization , an end to daily bloodshed , de-escalation of hostility , and some mutual confidence building . 
Israelis and Palestinians are not yet ready for the tough political decisions envisaged by the road map . 
They need a series of stopgap measures to bring stability and safety for civilians on both sides . 
With such de-escalation , perhaps at some time in the future true reconciliation will be possible . 
However difficult or sad to admit , the moment is not ripe for more than this .
