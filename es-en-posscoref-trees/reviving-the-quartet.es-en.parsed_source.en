Reviving the Quartet 
Following the formation of a Palestinian unity government between Fatah and Hamas , and the Arab League summit which revived King Abdullah &apos;s peace plan of 2002 , it is time for the so-called Middle East Quartet , consisting of the European Union , Russia , the United Nations , and the United States , to get into action . 
The Quartet has been dormant since 2000 , because any peace process requires negotiations between the parties in conflict . 
Instead , the region has witnessed a policy of unilateral steps . 
Some measures - Israel &apos;s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 and from the Gaza Strip in 2005 , or Hamas &quot; year-long ceasefire - might be seen as constructive . 
But , however positive their aims , these steps were taken without consulting the opposite side , thereby entrenching the perception that no partner existed . 
By the summer of 2006 , with the Lebanon war and Israel &apos;s reoccupation of the Gaza strip , the failure of unilateralism was clear . 
Today , we know that only a political process that takes each party &apos;s legitimate national interests into account can reduce the risk of renewed violent conflict in the Middle East . 
Four steps are needed to restart such a process . 
The first step , revival of the Quartet , has already been taken . 
The Quartet remains the most appropriate format , as it combines European ideas and service with UN legitimacy and US leadership . 
It binds Russia and includes few enough participants to take quick decisions when necessary . 
But , aside from its revival , the Quartet should also widen its mandate to deal not only with the Israeli-Palestinian problem , but also with the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese conflicts . 
Currently , the US refusal to negotiate directly with Syria , or to encourage Israel to talk with Syria , prevents such a widening of the Quartet &apos;s mandate . 
Syria , however , cannot be ignored , since it is capable of undermining attempts at reaching an Israeli-Palestinian track or stabilizing Lebanon . 
Syria &apos;s behavior is closely related to its prospects for recovering its own occupied territory - the Golan Heights - and is clearly interested in a new peace process with Israel to achieve this national goal . 
Second , a &quot; goal map &quot; should replace the Quartet &apos;s largely outdated &quot; road map , &quot; and should state the basic legitimate interests of the parties to the conflict . 
These interests are not mutually exclusive and can be summarized as follows : Israel &apos;s security , Palestinian statehood , Lebanon &apos;s sovereignty and Syria &apos;s territorial integrity . 
The Quartet should consult with the individual parties and to specify them further . 
What does Israel &apos;s security mean and require ? 
How can Palestinian statehood be preserved ? 
Which guarantees are needed to safeguard Lebanon &apos;s sovereignty ? 
Third , dialogue must be re ‑ established . 
This may be the most difficult task , and it is mainly a responsibility for the Europeans . 
Again , the relationship between Syria and Israel is crucial here . 
The Israeli government needs to be convinced that resuming peace talks could lead to more constructive Syrian behavior vis-à-vis Lebanon and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
The Syrian government itself has realized that it must demonstrate its willingness for dialogue by offering Israel unconditional negotiations , receiving the Iraqi and Palestinian presidents for talks in Damascus , and supporting intra-Palestinian talks . 
In Lebanon itself , serious internal dialogue about the county &apos;s future remains stalled . 
External actors like the EU or individual EU states could offer their support and facilitate talks on political and constitutional reforms . 
They should also make clear that no regional deal can be made at the expense of Lebanon &apos;s sovereignty . 
With regard to the Palestinians , dialogue capacity of a different kind is needed . 
Since the Palestinian parliamentary election in January 2006 , the international community has been communicating with President Mahmoud Abbas while boycotting the Hamas-led government . 
If the EU wants to continue its state-building efforts in Palestine and contribute to a peaceful settlement , it must find ways to talk to and work with the elected government . 
The formation of a Palestinian national unity government enables the EU and its partners to resume cooperation with the Palestinian authorities without losing face . 
Based on the Saudi-sponsored agreement between Fatah and Hamas , the unity government meets the EU Council &apos;s demand that a legitimate Palestinian government &quot; adopts a platform reflecting the Quartet principles . &quot; 
According to its program , the government will respect all agreements signed by the PLO . 
Avoiding contact with individual Palestinian ministers who violate these commitments may be necessary , but ostracizing the entire Palestinian administration must end . 
A fourth step , albeit for the future , is an international conference at which all relevant parties would adopt the &quot; goal map &quot; and commence parallel bilateral negotiations on this basis , which would enhance the actors &quot; interest in seeing the entire process through to a successful conclusion . 
Meticulous preparation of such a conference is more important than convening it quickly , as initiatives by individual states could undermine the EU &apos;s and Quartet &apos;s effort . 
Naturally , the US , as the most important Quartet member , must participate actively . 
The current EU presidency was able to convince the US administration that reviving the Quartet could be useful . 
However , the Bush administration &apos;s priority in the region clearly remains Iraq , not the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
In these circumstances , the Europeans and the other Quartet partners could help Bush secure a more flattering legacy with regard to the Middle East . 
The EU must not , however , let US or Israeli lack of support thwart its efforts to devise a goal map that would be acceptable to all regional parties , or to push Syria onto a more constructive course by engaging it .
