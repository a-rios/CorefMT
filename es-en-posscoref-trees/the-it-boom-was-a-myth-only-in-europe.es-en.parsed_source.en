The IT Boom Was a Myth Only in Europe 
America &apos;s economy remains on the brink of a double dip recession , the dollar is weak , and Wall Street seems unable to recover . 
An apocalyptic scenario in the making ? 
Hardly . 
The US economy , it should be remembered , finished 2002 with an annual growth rate of 2.5 %  - above the long-run trend estimated for the Euro area by many experts , including the European Central Bank . 
The point is that , despite the excesses of 1999-2000 , the economic difficulties of the last two years , and the tendency to think of the technology boom of the 1990 &apos;s as mere hype , the US underwent deep structural changes in its economy during that decade . 
Productivity growth almost doubled , increasing from just above 1 % in the period 1990-95 to over 2 % in 1995-2000 . 
Moreover , we see no sign of a slowdown : in 2001-02 productivity growth averaged almost 3 % . 
New information technologies account for perhaps 80 % of the acceleration in US productivity . 
Moreover , because much of the recent technological progress seen in the US largely remains to be exploited , the acceleration of productivity is not a temporary phenomenon , but a lasting one . 
Looking ahead , this is of crucial importance , because the long-term economic well being of any country depends on steady productivity growth . 
Since the new information technologies are easily available in all advanced countries , one would think that productivity would have accelerated everywhere , not just in the US . 
But this did not happen . 
While productivity was accelerating in the US , it was slowing down markedly in the largest EU economies . 
What accounts for this divergence ? 
Why aren &apos;t the large EU economies benefiting from IT , despite its diffusion on the &quot; Old &quot; continent as well ? 
One reason , not necessarily worrying , has to do with labor-market reforms . 
Towards the end of the 1990 &apos;s , the large EU countries encouraged employment of less qualified workers through temporary work contracts . 
One partial result of this is that production in Europe has in many places become more labor-intensive , with the capital-to-labor ratio tightening markedly . 
This undoubtedly had a negative impact on productivity growth . 
A second reason is that IT investment in Europe is a more recent phenomenon than in the US . 
Even though in 2001 the share of GDP devoted to IT investment was about the same in the EU and in the US , this was due to recent , concentrated bursts in Europe , as well as to the rapid investment slowdown in the US after the dot.com bubble burst . 
Because the period of rapid IT spending in Europe coincided with a cyclical downturn in the world economy , it may still be too early to see its benefits . 
But there is a third , more worrisome , difference between Europe and the US . 
Between the first and second half of the 1990 &apos;s , the &quot; residual component of yearly productivity growth &quot; ( the part measuring the efficiency with which all the factors of production are used ) , declined by over 1 % in Italy , Spain , and the UK . 
It remained constant in France and Germany , while going up by 0.66 % in the US . 
Some of the data suggest that European performance was particularly disappointing in the sectors that are intensive users of IT . 
In wholesale and retail distribution , but also in financial services and in other advanced service sectors , productivity was roughly constant in Europe , while it was growing at 4-5 % a year on average in the US . 
Moreover , the hi-tech sectors that produce IT , and that typically grow faster than the rest of the economy , are much smaller and less dynamic in Europe than in the US . 
In other words , Europe has not been able to exploit the new technologies for productive purposes , both as a user and as a producer of IT . 
With regard to IT use , Europe has spent a lot of money investing in IT , but often not for productive purposes . 
For example , cell phones are widespread in Europe ; this probably improves the quality of free time , but does little to enhance labor productivity . 
With regard to IT production , the large EU countries lag far behind the US . 
Sectors producing advanced technologies are much smaller in Europe , and their share in world exports has shrunk . 
It is no coincidence that the only European countries with fast productivity growth in the second half of the 1990 &apos;s were Ireland , Finland , and Sweden , where IT production accounts for a large share of aggregate output and employment . 
But why does Europe find it so hard to exploit IT for productive purposes ? 
Perhaps this has to do with other differences between Europe and the US . 
Many of the institutions of the large EU economies stifle individual incentives , hamper the mobility of resources , and make it difficult to select the most efficient and dynamic enterprises . 
It would not be surprising if these institutions also retard efficient exploitation of the new technological advances in the workplace . 
If this interpretation is correct , the contrast between the dynamism of the US and the small countries in Northern Europe on the one hand , and the stagnation of the large EU countries on the other hand , is likely to become starker .
