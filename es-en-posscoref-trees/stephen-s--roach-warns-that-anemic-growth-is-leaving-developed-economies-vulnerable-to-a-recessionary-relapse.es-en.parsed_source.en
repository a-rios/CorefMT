The Stall-Speed Syndrome 
NEW HAVEN - Relapse is the rule in the post-crisis global economy . 
In the United States , Japan , and Europe , GDP growth faltered again in the first half of 2014 . 
Persistent sluggish growth throughout the developed world has left major economies unusually vulnerable to the inevitable bumps in the road . 
Sure , there are excuses - there always are . 
A contraction in the US economy in the first quarter of the year was dismissed as weather-related . 
Japan &apos;s plunge in the second quarter was blamed on a sales-tax hike . 
Europe &apos;s stagnant growth in the second quarter has been explained away as an aberration reflecting the confluence of weather effects and sanctions imposed on Russia . 
As tempting as it may be to attribute these developments to idiosyncratic factors , the latest slowdown in developed countries is not so easily dismissed . 
Lacking cyclical vigor in the aftermath of severe recessions , today &apos;s economies are finding it especially difficult to shrug off the impact of shocks and break out of anemic growth trajectories . 
Consider the US . 
Though annual GDP growth is estimated to have rebounded to 4 % in the second quarter of 2014 , following the 2.1 % first-quarter contraction , that still leaves average growth in the first half of the year at a measly 1 % . 
The problem is even worse in Japan , where consumers brought forward expenditures in anticipation of the sales-tax hike . 
The 6.1 % first-quarter growth surge to which this gave rise was more than offset by a 6.8 % second-quarter contraction . 
The net result in the first half of this year - an average decline of 0.3 % - is broadly in line with the 0.2 % contraction now estimated for the fourth quarter of 2013 . 
With the trajectory of real ( inflation-adjusted ) growth having moved into negative territory , on average , for three consecutive quarters , Japan may once again be reverting to recessionary form . 
Europe &apos;s fragile economy has similarly failed to recover strongly enough to ward off periodic growth setbacks . 
During the acute phase of the euro crisis , recession was concentrated in peripheral economies such as Greece , Portugal , and Spain . 
Now , however , the malaise has spread to the core economies of Germany and Italy , both of which contracted in the second quarter , and to France , which recorded zero growth . 
As a result , annual growth in the 18-country eurozone slipped to just 0.4 % in the first half of 2014 . 
This poor performance can only exacerbate the European Central Bank &apos;s deflationary concerns . 
Collectively , the annual growth rate in the major developed economies averaged a little less than 0.7 % in the first half of 2014 . 
America &apos;s paltry 1 % growth led the way , while Japan and Europe , whose combined GDP is roughly equal to that of the US in purchasing-power-parity terms , recorded no better than a 0.3 % increase . 
On balance , that is easily 1-1.5 percentage points below the developed world &apos;s longer-term , or potential , growth trend - a worrisome outcome , to say the least , for employment , deflation risk , global trade , and export-dependent developing economies , such as China , which remain heavily reliant on external demand in developed countries . 
But there is another problem with persistently subpar growth : It provides no cushion to shield economies from unexpected blows . 
That is especially true when growth falls below 1 % , leaving a thin margin between expansion and contraction . 
Such sluggish performance is the economic equivalent of &quot; stall speed &quot; - the heightened vulnerability that aircrafts can encounter at low velocity . 
Under such circumstances , it does not take much to lead to an aborted takeoff , or worse . 
The analogy is all too apt today . 
Shocks , whether traceable to weather , geopolitical disturbances , strikes , or natural disasters , are the rule , not the exception . 
When hit by them , vigorously growing economies have cushions to withstand the blows and the resilience to shrug them off . 
Economies limping along near stall speed do not . 
The odds of a recessionary relapse in an environment of unusually weak growth - very much the problem today - should not be minimized . 
The big question is what should be done about it . 
The current approach , centered on unconventional monetary policy , is not the answer . 
Though monetary policy provided a powerful antidote to frozen credit markets in the depth of the global financial crisis , it has failed to spark classic cyclical recoveries . 
That should be no surprise . 
The world &apos;s major developed economies are not suffering from cyclical deficiencies in aggregate demand that are amenable to a monetary cure . 
In the US , a lingering overhang of household debt implies that deleveraging and the rebuilding of savings continues to take precedence over discretionary consumption . 
In Japan , long-standing structural problems , such as aging , labor-market rigidities , and a generalized productivity malaise , can be addressed only through the so-called &quot; third arrow &quot; of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s reform agenda , which remains woefully incomplete . 
And Europe faces a desperate need to build pan-European institutions to ensure banking and fiscal union , and to address serious competitiveness problems in France and Italy . 
Unfortunately , the more that central banks give the impression that that they are on the case , and the more that markets cheer them on , the less pressure there is on politically gridlocked governments to deploy fiscal policy and push through structural reforms . 
Moreover , the fixation on monetary accommodation leaves slow-growth , balance-sheet-constrained economies stuck at stall speed , increasing the risk of yet another global growth relapse . 
Myopic authorities need to take less guidance from frothy financial markets and focus more on the structural repair of a post-crisis world . 
This is a time for heroes , not cheerleaders .
