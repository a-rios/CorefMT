American Crony Capitalists Go to War 
When financial crisis hit Asia in 1997 , America &apos;s leaders charged Asian governments with practicing crony capitalism . 
In retrospect , the charge seems like rank hypocrisy . 
America has shown itself to be second to none in practicing cronyism , first with its rotten corporate scandals of recent years , and now in Iraq . 
Asian capitalists may have stolen some borrowed loot , but at least they didn &apos;t mix finance with war . 
Whatever other goals lay behind the Iraq war , the Bush Administration seems keen to line the pockets of its cronies and to capture increased control over Middle East oil and pipeline routes . 
Only a few pesky obstacles - the UN , and the Iraqi people - stand in their way . 
The Iraq war was ostensibly launched because of Saddam &apos;s weapons of mass destruction , yet each passing day suggests that the threat was exaggerated . 
Another goal also loomed large : control over 11 % ( or more ) of the world &apos;s oil reserves and , in the longer term , control over pipeline routes between the Mediterranean , the Caspian Sea , and the Indian Ocean . 
The failure to locate Saddam &apos;s WMD &apos;s is putting America &apos;s grab for Iraqi oil into sharp focus . 
The Cheney-Rumsfeld team is so arrogant that it acts as if it can flaunt the takeover of Middle East oil while brushing aside questions . 
In Afghanistan last year , the US installed Hamid Karzai , a former consultant for oil giant Unocal , as interim leader . 
It also appointed Kalmay Khalilzad , another former Unocal consultant  - indeed , Karzai &apos;s boss - as special US envoy . 
Khalilzad and Karzai spent considerable efforts in the late 1990s to get an American-built pipeline to carry gas from Turkeminstan through Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Indian Ocean . 
Even before the bombs stopped falling on Baghdad , Khalilzad &apos;s writ as Special Envoy was extended to Iraq . 
Among his likely jobs in Iraq will be to secure a pipeline carrying Iraqi oil from Mosul , Iraq to Haifa , Israel via Syria . 
To stop Syria from objecting , the US is now threatening it as well . 
Khalilzad will have plenty of support in the Bush Administration , which is heavily loaded with oil industry executives . 
National Security Advisor Condeleeza Rice was a Director of Chevron-Texaco before coming to the National Security Council . 
She even had an oil tanker named after her . 
Commerce Secretary Don Evans is also an oil-company CEO . 
Vice President Richard Cheney was in effect lead conductor of the group when he served as Chairman of Halliburton , the world &apos;s largest oil services company . 
Halliburton is now at the front of the line for Iraqi reconstruction projects , for which contracts are being handed out without any transparent and competitive process whatsoever . 
But what is happening here is more than &quot; guilt by association &quot; with the oil industry . 
The Bush Administration is flouting every rule to give its cronies the inside track . 
Before joining the Pentagon , Donald Rumsfeld was a key player as well . 
A longstanding sidekick of Cheney , Rumsfeld traveled to Baghdad in 1983 and 1984 at the behest of former Bechtel Corporation President George Shultz , then passing a bit of non-corporate time as US Secretary of State . 
Rumsfeld &apos;s hidden mission was to win Saddam &apos;s support of a Bechtel-built oil pipeline to run from Iraq via Jordan to the Gulf of Aqaba . 
This is the same Bechtel which built Saddam &apos;s &quot; dual use &quot; chemical industry ; now it has been awarded a non-competitive $ 600 million mega-contract to rebuild Iraqi infrastructure . 
American newspapers now report that former Shell Oil CEO Philip Carroll will be appointed as the US czar of Iraqi oil . 
Carroll &apos;s most recent job was as Chief Executive of Fluor , the giant construction conglomerate , another company that , together with Bechtel and Halliburton , is in line for the big bucks that will soon be paid ( using Iraq &apos;s oil earnings ) for US-led reconstruction . 
The United Kingdom can &apos;t match the US in cronyism , but Britain &apos;s support for America in the war also has a commercial logic . 
While Saddam gave oil contracts to French , Russian , and Chinese oil firms , UK firms such as BP were frozen out . 
UK firms are no doubt counting on returning to Iraq on America &apos;s coattails . 
Only a few hurdles remain before the US can consummate its crony takeover of Iraq &apos;s oil . 
America will soon try to appoint an Iraqi regime that will aim to cancel many of Saddam &apos;s oil contracts with France , Russia , and China , in order to make room for US and UK firms . 
But this will be harder to accomplish than simply sending in the US army . 
The US can not legally market Iraqi oil , much less invest in new fields , until the old UN sanctions against Iraq are lifted . 
But the rest of the world believes that lifting the sanctions is tantamount to handing Iraq &apos;s oil future over to the US and UK occupying forces and their corporate cronies . 
More telling , and significant in the long term , is the remarkable anti-US and anti-UK sentiment now sweeping Iraq . 
Rather than being welcomed as liberators , the US and UK are seen as new colonial occupiers , and the Iraqis are mobilizing to push the occupiers out . 
The US may have done something few could have expected : united the Shi &apos;ites and the Sunnis in a common cause . 
Democracy may come to Iraq , and the will of the people will be to stop the plunder of their country &apos;s natural resources by US crony capitalists .
