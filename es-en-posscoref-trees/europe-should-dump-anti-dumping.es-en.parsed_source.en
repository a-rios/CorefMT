Europe Should Dump Anti-Dumping 
Stockholm - Defending Europe &apos;s economy against unfair international trade practices has long been a key element of the European Union &apos;s external policies . 
It is almost an instinct among some politicians and business leaders that if competition is deemed unfair , the European Commission should marshal new trade defenses . 
But what are Europeans defending against , and what are &quot; unfair &quot; trade practices anyway ? 
In the absence of international competition regulations to prevent predatory pricing and other anti-competitive activities , trade defenses are a second-best option . 
By far the most widely used instrument are anti-dumping duties aimed at imposing some restraint on companies that behave in an anti-competitive way . 
But , by increasing tariffs , prices also rise , which often means a welfare loss for society as a whole . 
This fact has long been ignored by firms seeking trade defence . 
What is new , however , is that the firms themselves might not gain from trade defense . 
The very word &quot; defense &quot; creates an image of a nation state that is commercially connected to the rest of the world only via traditional trade . 
For such a state , all imports would truly be foreign goods , and its trade defenses would consequently be directed only against foreign interests . 
But this is not true in today &apos;s globalized world . 
Although we still have traditional trade , we also have foreign direct investment , offshoring , and outsourcing . 
We have global supply lines in which goods are developed in one country , manufactured in another , and assembled in a third . 
Capital and know-how flows across borders , so traditional bilateral trade flows have been replaced by a complex web of international commercial relations . 
This has major implications for trade defense . 
If your mobile phone was assembled in India , but developed and designed in Finland , is it an Indian or a Finnish product ? 
When European corporations outsource labor-intensive manufacturing to low-cost countries but keep the rest of the production process in Europe , they greatly complicate matters for anyone trying to evaluate the economics of trade defense . 
To aim an anti-dumping measure against an Asian manufacturer may inflict most of the damage on a European producer . 
That happened in the October 2006 anti-dumping action against leather shoes , when the EU decided to impose anti-dumping tariffs against China and Vietnam . 
Sweden &apos;s National Board of Trade conducted a case study of five European shoe producers in different countries and market segments to establish where the value added in their production processes was created . 
Although manufactured in China and Vietnam , shoes were designed , developed , and marketed in Europe . 
These largely intangible production processes before and after the physical manufacturing sometimes constituted 80 % of the value added . 
In other words , shoes from China were 80 % European ! 
For less expensive shoes , with lower sums invested in the intangible parts of the production process , this figure was not as high , but still more than 50 % . 
The anti-dumping measures imposed by the EU therefore hit European companies in an unintentional way . 
Sectors with a higher human capital content - electronic consumer goods , for example - have much higher R D costs than the shoe sector , so manufacturing these goods on an assembly line in a low-cost country is probably not very costly in comparison to R D and other intangible costs . 
For more advanced goods , the EU value added ( if the intangible part of the production process is in Europe ) is quite high . 
Imposing trade defense against such goods , even if legally warranted , is likely to create problems for globalized European companies . 
Many say that these problems are the price to be paid for ensuring that companies do not engage in anti-competitive behavior , or receive trade-distorting subsidies . 
But , even if the measures worked as supposed , the majority of trade defense measures are probably not directed against anti-competitive business practices . 
More often it is the politics of protectionism that are the crucial factor behind trade defenses . 
Anti-dumping measures are frequently used against products that are simply so cheap that they pose a threat to European producers , even though that is no more than fair competition . 
This raises a fundamental criticism Europe &apos;s trade defense mechanisms . 
International trade is by definition a competition between companies on an uneven playing field . 
Some companies have easier access to capital , whereas their competitors cannot get access to finance at reasonable interest rates . 
Some have excellent infrastructure at their disposal , while their international competitors may have to contend with constant power cuts . 
Some must pay excessive taxes , while others operate out of tax havens . 
Some find it easy to recruit top-notch engineers , whereas for others enjoy an abundance of cheap labor . 
To create a completely level playing field in trade is impossible . 
Yet many politicians and business leaders are keen to focus on the differences they don &apos;t like and would like to see &quot; leveled . &quot; 
In reality , what they don &apos;t like is competition itself , and they fight it by deploying an instrument that can inflict even greater damage on themselves .
