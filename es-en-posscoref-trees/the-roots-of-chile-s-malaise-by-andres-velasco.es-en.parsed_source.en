The Roots of Chile &apos;s Malaise 
SANTIAGO - Margaret Thatcher famously once said that &quot; there is no such thing as society . &quot; 
Today , the people of Chile are showing just how wrong she was . 
For more than a year , young Chileans have been taking to the streets to protest . 
Many foreign observers have declared themselves surprised . 
Why would the citizens of a successful emerging country be so upset ? 
What could they be upset about ? 
Chile &apos;s student-led protest movement has generated much re-thinking within the country . 
Intellectuals of the old left , pointing to persistently high income inequality , have argued that the economic gains made in the 22 years since the return of democracy were more illusory than real . 
In this view , Chile &apos;s economic model has failed its citizens and is in the process of &quot; collapsing . &quot; 
Defenders of Chile &apos;s current rightist government , pointing to ongoing economic growth and unemployment under 7 % , have argued that there is no deep reason for discontent . 
In this view , if the government stays the course and the economy keeps growing , the malaise will pass . 
Recent survey data and a detailed study by the United Nations Development Program ( UNDP ) suggest that both of these oversimplified views are mistaken . 
In public-opinion polls , Chileans declare themselves to be quite happy , and say that they live much better now than they did a decade or a generation ago . 
They also overwhelmingly claim that education and hard work are the ways to get ahead in life . 
And many poorer citizens report growing satisfaction with the health care and pensions to which they have access . 
This is hardly the stuff of a country whose development model is on the verge of &quot; collapse . &quot; 
But , while Chileans are quite happy with their own lives , they are upset with the society in which they live . 
Respondents report that they are increasingly resentful of economic inequality and social segregation . 
They do not trust politicians and political parties , judges , captains of industry , or even members of the clergy . 
Many Chilean parents send their children to private schools , but polls report a growing demand for better public schools , which they value as a place where common values are forged among children of different backgrounds . 
Many are happy about growing home ownership , but are unhappy about the scarcity of public spaces - safe streets , parks , arts facilities , and community centers - where they can come into contact with their fellow citizens . 
This is where Thatcher &apos;s famous statement has proven to be so wrong : there is such a thing as society , and the quality of interactions within it matter profoundly for people &apos;s satisfaction with their lives . 
Uncertainty and fear are two reasons why many middle-class Chileans report being unhappy about their society . 
Making it into the middle class requires decades of hard work , but it can all come to naught as a result of an accident , an illness in the family , or the loss of a job . 
Chile &apos;s social insurance system , these citizens are saying , is insufficiently social and does not provide enough insurance . 
The other key source of malaise , the UNDP study reports , is the persistence of discrimination and mistreatment . 
Too many people report being mistreated on account of their gender , race , socioeconomic status , and even physical appearance . 
Discrimination in the labor market is widespread . 
Plum jobs , middle-class citizens report , seem to be set aside for people with certain last names , from certain neighborhoods , or from certain schools . 
So the issue is not that people are turning against a system that promises a better life for those willing to work hard and get a better education . 
Far from it . 
People are upset that - because of prejudice and abuse - the system is failing to deliver what it promises , even to people with many years of schooling who exert themselves day in and day out . 
This much is clear to those of us who are listening to what the citizens of Chile are saying . 
Traditional Chilean politicians , however , do not seem to be doing much listening . 
Their infighting continues to upset people , while most of their policy proposals have little to do with the problems that ordinary citizens face . 
For the sake of Chile &apos;s future , that will have to change .
