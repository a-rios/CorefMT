What is the Deficit Endgame ? 
REYKJAVIK - No one yet has any real idea about when the global financial crisis will end , but one thing is certain : government budget deficits are headed into the stratosphere . 
Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt . 
Although governments may try to cram public debt down the throats of local savers ( by using , for example , their rising influence over banks to force them to hold a disproportionate quantity of government paper ) , they will eventually find themselves having to pay much higher interest rates as well . 
Within a couple years , interest rates on long-term US Treasury notes could easily rise 3-4 % , with interest rates on other governments &quot; paper rising as much , or more . 
Interest rates will rise to compensate investors both for having to accept a larger share of government bonds in their portfolio and for an increasing risk that governments will be tempted to inflate away the value of their debts , or even default . 
In research that Carmen Reinhart and I have done on the history of financial crises , we find that public debt typically doubles , even adjusting for inflation , in the three years following a crisis . 
Many nations , large and small , are now well on the way to meeting this projection . 
China &apos;s government has clearly indicated that it will use any means necessary to backstop growth in the face of a free fall in exports . 
The Chinese have $ 2 trillion in hard currency reserves to back up their promise . 
President Barack Obama &apos;s new budget calls for a stunning $ 1.75 trillion deficit in the United States , a multiple of the previous record . 
Even those countries that are not actively engaged in a fiscal orgy are seeing their surpluses collapse and their deficits soar , mainly in the face of falling tax revenues . 
Indeed , few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections , typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios . 
Unfortunately , in 2009 , the global economy will not be a bed of roses . 
Income in the US and euro-area both appear to have declined at an annualized rate of roughly 6 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 ; 
Japan &apos;s GDP fell at perhaps twice that rate . 
China &apos;s claim that its GDP grew at a 6 % rate , during the end of last year , is suspect . 
Exports have collapsed throughout Asia , including Korea , Japan , and Singapore . Arguably India , and to a lesser extent Brazil , have been holding out a bit better . 
But few emerging markets have reached a stage at which they can withstand a sustained collapse in the developed economies , much less serve as substitute engines of global growth . 
With the credit crisis still making it difficult for many small and medium-size businesses to obtain even the minimal level of financing necessary to maintain inventories and conduct trade , global GDP is on a precipice in 2009 . 
There is a real possibility that global growth will register its first contraction since World War II . 
In all likelihood , a slew of countries will see output declines of 4-5 % in 2009 , with some. having true depression level drops , of 10 % or more . 
Worse yet , unless financial systems spring back , growth could disappoint for years to come , especially in &quot; ground zero &quot; countries such as the United States , Britain , Ireland and Spain . US long-term growth could be particularly dismal , as the Obama administration steers the country toward more European levels of welfare assistance and income redistribution , 
Countries with European-style growth rates could handle debt obligations of 60 % of GDP when interest rates were low . 
But , with debts in many countries rising to 80 % or 90 % of GDP , and with today &apos;s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon , trouble is brewing . 
Many of the countries that are piling on massive quantities of debt to bail out their banks have only tepid medium term growth prospects , raising real questions of solvency and sustainability 
Italy , for example with a debt-to-income ratio already exceeding 100 % , has been able to manage so far thanks to falling global rates . 
But as debts mount , and global interest rates rise , investors will become rightly nervous about the risk of debt restructuring . 
Other countries , such as Ireland , Britain , and the US , started with a much stronger fiscal position , but may not be much better off when the smoke clears . 
Exchange rates are another wild card . 
Asian central banks are still nervously clinging to the dollar . But with the US printing debt and money like it is going out of style , it would appear the euro is set to appreciate against the dollar two or three years down the road , if the euro is still around , that is . 
As debt mounts and the recession lingers , we are surely going to see a number of governments trying to lighten their load through financial repression , higher inflation , partial default , or a combinations of all three . 
Unfortunately , the endgame to the great recession of the 2000 &quot; s will not be a pretty picture .
