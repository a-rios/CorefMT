Who &apos;s Dependent Now ? 
If the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today , he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down . 
His hugely influential &quot; dependency &quot; theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports , they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth . 
Instead , they would become mired in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever-dwindling income shares . 
Prebisch &apos;s preferred policy response , protectionism , proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that heeded him . 
But the fact is that for many years , Prebisch seemed to have made the right call on long-term commodity price trends . 
Relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities , especially during the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
With few exceptions , countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally , whereas many resource-poor Asian countries raced ahead . 
Today , however , with Asia &apos;s giants , India and China , joining the global economy , prices for oil , gold , wheat , and virtually every other commodity are exploding . 
While there will always be cycles - oil prices , for example , will probably fall before they start rising again - the long-run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come . 
What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet , though Prebisch would have realized it instantly , is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power . 
Indeed , perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades . 
The questions are many . 
Are today &apos;s rich countries prepared for an era of co-dependency , in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial imports and technology ? 
Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier ? 
How will the world &apos;s two superpowers , China and the United States , come to terms with the fact that important commodity-exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill-formed nation states ? 
Some self-anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources , with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate . 
Nowadays , there are many adherents of the &quot; Hubbert &apos;s peak &quot; theory of oil production , which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity , the wells are running dry , and it is all downhill from here . 
However , as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out , prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already . 
Each time , radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate . 
In the late 1800 &quot; s , oil extraction involved dredging with a mule . 
Today , no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor . 
There have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture . 
No , the world is not about to run out of commodities . 
Instead , what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people ( China and India alone ) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to offset . 
So , for at least the next 50 to 75 years , and perhaps until humans start mining on Mars sometime in the coming centuries , prices for many natural resources are headed up . 
Will the rebalancing of global economic power that results from this destabilize world politics ? 
World War I , of course , was partly set off by Germany &apos;s concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies . 
Similarly , in World War II , Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources . 
Will similar tensions arise between resource-challenged China ( where even water scarcity is a problem ) and the West ? 
Fortunately , this does not seem likely for the moment , especially given the Chinese leadership &apos;s sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems . 
The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa , hoping to find stable trading partners . 
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans , who don &apos;t just want to trade with commodity exporters , but to convert them as well . 
Then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the US self-sufficient in energy supplies . 
But this is basically a joke : self-indulgent , maybe , but self-sufficient , never . 
Much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies . 
If they are right , one can only hope that America has a plan B. 
Meanwhile , commodity prices will continue to rise , with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America &apos;s gaping trade deficit . 
Maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity-exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy ! 
That is one twist that Prebisch would never have anticipated .
