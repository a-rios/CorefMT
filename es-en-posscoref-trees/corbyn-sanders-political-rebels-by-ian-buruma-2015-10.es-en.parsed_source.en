Back to Socialism 
LONDON - The remarkable thing about Jeremy Corbyn , the hard-left outsider who stunned the British establishment by capturing the leadership of the Labour Party , is not his alleged lack of patriotism . 
Whether he wishes to sing God Save the Queen at public events seems a rather trivial matter . 
The remarkable thing about his brand of leftism is how reactionary it is . 
Corbyn is an old-fashioned socialist who would like to soak the rich and put transport and utilities back under state control . 
His rhetoric of class war suggests a complete break with mainstream social democracy . 
Postwar European social democracy was always a compromise with capitalism . 
Left-wing ideology , especially in Britain , owed more to certain Christian moral traditions ( &quot; more Methodist than Marx &quot; ) than to any political dogma . 
Labour leaders like Clement Attlee , the first prime minister after World War II , were not opposed to a market economy ; they just wanted to regulate markets in such a way that might best serve working-class interests . 
During the Cold War , social democracy was Western Europe &apos;s egalitarian alternative to communism . 
Attlee , for one , was ferociously anti-communist . 
Lip service was paid at Labour Party conferences to the old symbols of socialism . 
Party leaders sang the Internationale with teary-eyed nostalgia . 
And , until Tony Blair struck it out in 1995 , Clause 4 of the party &apos;s constitution still promised &quot; common ownership of the means of production &quot; and &quot; popular control &quot; of industry . 
( Corbyn might well try to restore it . ) 
But when it came to national government , ideological socialists were swiftly shunted aside to make way for more pragmatic operators . 
By the time Blair , following the example of his friend US President Bill Clinton , became Prime Minister by promoting the &quot; third way , &quot; socialism seemed to be dead and buried . 
Clinton and Blair - who came to power after that other odd Anglo-American couple , Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher , had started to tear at the fabric of social democracy - made compromises of which Attlee would not have dreamed . 
The genius of Clinton and Blair was to combine genuine concern for the underprivileged with an unseemly devotion to the fat cats of Wall Street , the City of London , and some murkier places , too . 
Blair vacationed with Silvio Berlusconi , Italy &apos;s plutocrat prime minister . 
Clinton used his presidential pardon to allow wealthy cronies to elude justice . And after leaving office , both men swiftly put their reputations in the service of their bank accounts . 
One might say that by compromising with capitalism too much , the third-way leaders compromised themselves . 
This is one reason why , under Corbyn , the hard left struck back and finally managed to wrest power from the compromisers . 
Especially to many young people , Corbyn is the longed-for man of conviction , the &quot; authentic &quot; voice of the people . 
Never having had much of an ideology in the first place , the soft-left social democrats , faced with a real socialist , ended up having nothing much to say . 
Could Hillary Clinton be similarly punished in her quest to be the Democratic Party &apos;s nominee in next year &apos;s US presidential election ? 
Could the center left , which she represents , lose control of the party ? 
In recent opinion polls , her main opponent , Bernie Sanders , who proudly calls himself a socialist , is edging ever closer to Clinton - and is actually leading her in some states . 
Like Corbyn , he has the air of authenticity - a politician who says what he thinks , unlike the scripted professionals of mainstream Washington . 
And yet there is no Democratic left , including Sanders , that is remotely as hard as the Corbynites . 
Compared to Corbyn , Sanders is a moderate . 
More important , what a militant faction did to the Labour Party is being done now not to the Democrats , but to the Republicans . 
Indeed , the Republican rebels look far more extreme than Corbyn , let alone Sanders . 
The Republican Party is in danger of being taken over by fanatics who see compromise in government as a form of villainous treachery . 
Forcing the archconservative John Boehner to quit as Speaker of the House for being too soft was an act of war by Republicans against their own party . 
Most aspiring Republican presidential candidates are not only extreme , but also more reactionary than Corbyn . 
Their favored slogans - &quot; Take back our country &quot; or &quot; Make America great again &quot; - invoke a past when neither the New Deal nor the expansion of civil rights disturbed the peace of upstanding white Christians . 
These hard-right Republicans , too , prize &quot; authenticity &quot; - indeed , they prize it above anything else ( hence the appeal of Donald Trump ) . 
And they , too , are in angry revolt against party leaders , who are believed to have compromised themselves simply by trying to govern . 
It is too soon to predict who will win the Republican nomination . 
It is unlikely , but possible , that a hardliner like Ted Cruz , or a rank amateur with deep religious convictions , such as the neurosurgeon Ben Carson , will capture the party . 
But capturing the leadership of a political party is still easier than being elected US President . 
Few people expect Corbyn to win a national election in Britain , either ; that is why his parliamentary party is in such despair . 
So Clinton , despite her so far lackluster campaign , and despite a popular perception of inauthenticity , even outright shiftiness , will probably hang on to her party and scrape through in the end . 
She will prevail not because her views look any more convincing than those of the center-left professional pols of the Labour Party , but because her opponents look so much worse .
