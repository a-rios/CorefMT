Abe &apos;s Asian Gambit 
CANBERRA - With the world producing more history than most of us can consume right now , it is easy to lose sight of recent developments that could have even greater consequences for long-term peace and stability than recent alarming events in eastern Ukraine , Gaza , and Syria-Iraq . 
The outcome of the nuclear negotiations with Iran , the change of leadership in India and Indonesia - two of the world &apos;s three largest democracies - and the re-energizing of the BRICS group of major non-Western states ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) may all be such game-changers . 
But Japan &apos;s international muscle-flexing under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may be even more significant . 
Unless it is very carefully managed by all concerned , including the United States and Japan &apos;s other closest Asia-Pacific allies , Abe &apos;s makeover of Japanese foreign policy could undermine the fragile power balances that have so far kept the Sino-American rivalry in check . 
Japan is right to be concerned about China &apos;s new regional assertiveness , and Abe &apos;s recent diplomatic push to strengthen Japan &apos;s relations in Southeast Asia , and with Australia and India , is understandable in that context . 
Nor is it inherently unreasonable - despite opposition at home and abroad - for his government to seek to reinterpret Article 9 of Japan &apos;s &quot; peace constitution &quot; to permit wider engagement in collective self-defense operations and military cooperation with allies and partners . 
But the risks in all of this must be openly acknowledged . 
Opposition to any perceived revival of Japanese militarism is hard-wired in Northeast Asia . 
Abe is an intensely conservative nationalist , still deeply reluctant to accept the extent of Japan &apos;s World War II guilt ( even when acknowledging , as he did in Australia recently , &quot; the horrors of the past century &apos;s history &quot; and offering gracious condolences for &quot; the many souls who lost their lives &quot; ) . 
His refusal to rule out future visits to the Yasukuni Shrine , with its war-glorifying Yushukan Museum alongside , fuels hardline skepticism in China . 
It also makes common cause with South Korea much more difficult , and heightens the risk of maritime territorial disputes becoming explosive . 
Less noticed , but possibly more important in the long term , have been Japan &apos;s efforts to reshape regional security arrangements , which for many years have had three key elements . 
First , there have been the hub-and-spoke alliances of the US with Japan , South Korea , and Australia ( and more loosely with Singapore , Thailand , and the Philippines ) . 
These alliances are accepted and well understood , if not loved , by China . 
Second , there are national defense efforts , encouraged by the US , increasingly aimed at greater self-reliance in the event that China &apos;s rise becomes a military threat . 
This , too , has been accepted reasonably calmly , if not always quietly , by China , and has not undermined the continuing growth in bilateral economic relationships that every country in the region is developing with China . 
Finally , there have been multilateral security dialogues - the ASEAN Regional Forum and now the East Asia Summit the most prominent among them - designed to be vehicles for confidence building , and conflict prevention and management . 
These mechanisms have so far promised more than they have delivered , though not for want of continuing efforts to give them more clout . 
For all of the hype that has accompanied the US &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia - announced by President Barack Obama in the Australian Parliament in November 2011 - the delicate balances involved in this basic architecture have changed little for decades . 
But now Japan , with overt support from Australia in particular , seems determined to change the balance by establishing , as a counterweight to China , a much denser alliance-type relationship with selected partners . 
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott , who earlier this year described Japan as both our &quot; best friend in Asia &quot; and a &quot; strong ally , &quot; has warmly embraced the &quot; special relationship &quot; language . 
He consummated the love-in by expressing his admiration for &quot; the skill and sense of honor &quot; of the Japanese submariners who died attacking Sydney Harbor in 1942 , while saying of Japan &apos;s waging of aggressive war and wartime atrocities only that &quot; we disagreed with what they did . &quot; 
We have not yet seen any renewed attempt to re-establish the &quot; Quadrilateral Security Dialogue , &quot; comprising Japan , Australia , the US , and India , which conducted joint military exercises in 2007 and was seen by China as a hostile containment enterprise . 
The dangers should not be exaggerated . 
Countries like ours should take a clear stand when China overreaches externally ( as it has in the South China Sea with its indefensible &quot; nine-dashed line &quot; asserting historical rights with no known justification in international law ) . 
The same applies when China does not behave like a good international citizen on the UN Security Council , or should it commit egregious human-rights violations at home . 
But we should be cautious about moving beyond taking stands to taking sides in the region to a greater extent than has been the norm for decades . 
Kishore Mahbubani has argued recently that we need to recognize that in China , as elsewhere , a significant internal contest between hard- and softer-liners is taking place . 
To the extent that this is the case , it is smart policy for every state in the region to speak and act in a way that helps the doves and gives no encouragement to the hawks .
