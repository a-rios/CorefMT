Defining Terrorism 
Every age has its enemies . 
In the mid-20th century , Fascists were the evildoers . 
After WWII , Communists became civilization &apos;s nemesis . 
Now terrorists have become the designated masters of malevolence . 
The word &quot; terrorism &quot; appears in law books and legislation around the world . 
Various civil sanctions apply to &quot; terrorist organizations , &quot; and it can be a crime to assist one . 
But it is not always easy to determine who &quot; they &quot;  - the terrorists - are . 
Whether organizations are terrorist or not is largely a determination motivated by politics . 
The UN repeatedly passes resolutions against terrorism , but cannot agree on how to define the term . 
Official definitions of terrorism are unpersuasive . 
The US Congress , for example , defines terrorism as including a motive to coerce or intimidate a population or influence a government . 
But this formula does not clearly cover even the terrorist attacks of September 2001 . 
If the motive of the airline hijackers was simply to kill infidels , their attack would fall outside the Congressional definition . 
It is a mistake to try to define terrorism in the same way that we define theft or murder . 
There are too many contested issues . 
A better approach is to identify the issues that arise in thinking about terrorism and clarify why people experience terror from certain acts of violence . 
Then we can define terrorism with reference to all these variables , but without making any one of them decisive . 
The three primary points of controversy are : the identity of the victims , the perpetrators , and the relevance of a just cause . 
Must terrorism &apos;s victims be civilians ? 
Some think so , but Al Qaeda blew up the USS Cole and most people regarded the killing of the sailors onboard a terrorist attack . 
The same logic applies in the guidelines for President George W. Bush &apos;s military tribunals , which treat those who attack military personnel and civilians alike . 
There is a similar question about the perpetrators . 
Can terrorists be soldiers or state agents ? 
Islamic states within the UN favor this position , and I think they are right . 
The International Criminal Court will prosecute heads of states for war crimes . 
By the same logic , state officials should bear responsibility for acts of terrorism committed under their authority . 
The most controversial issue in defining terrorism is captured by the slogan : &quot; One person &apos;s terrorist is another &apos;s freedom fighter . &quot; 
The problem is whether a good cause justifies using horrendous means . 
Islamic states think that it does , which puts them at odds with Western opinion . 
Those who opt for terror always believe their cause is just . 
Sometimes it is , sometimes not . 
No American would be happy about branding the Boston Tea Party an act of terrorist aggression against British property . 
Nor would any Frenchman accept a description of the maquisards of the French Resistance as terrorists . 
Yet both committed acts of violence against property and people , and so do meet the conventional tests of terrorism . 
There are other troubling borderline cases . 
What about the Stern gang &apos;s blowing up of Jerusalem &apos;s King David Hotel in order to liberate Palestine from the British ? 
Is there good terror and bad terror ? 
For some the political cause counts heavily , but in fact there are only a few historical cases in which most people actually disagree . 
Behind the phenomenon , the nagging question remains : why is terrorism different , why does it require a special definition , why are we more afraid of this form of violence than other criminal acts ? 
One reason is that terrorism is typically organized activity . 
In July 2002 , when an Egyptian opened fire and killed two people waiting in line at the El Al counter at Los Angeles International Airport , the FBI decided that the suspect was not a terrorist because he was acting alone . 
Terrorists are organized , and the group can continue even after the individual is caught . 
That makes them more frightening than ordinary criminals . 
Another reason for our greater fear of terrorism is that whereas ordinary criminals prefer secrecy , terrorists crave publicity . 
Effective terrorism always captures headlines . 
It is unexpected , with great shock value . 
Like good theater , terrorism always acts out some moral drama , and to strike terror in the public mind , terrorists must act in public , without guilt or remorse . 
But suppose we try to define the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , as terrorism by using the following formula : a violent , organized , and public attack by private parties on other civilians , without guilt , regardless of the justice of the cause . 
Problems still remain , because there are counter-examples for each of these six dimensions . 
Sometimes the victims are military and the perpetrators are states , sometimes the cause appears to be just , and sometimes one person with enough weapons but no organization might wreak terror . 
A conspiracy to lace letters with anthrax might incite private terror . 
Some terrorists might feel remorse and guilt about their actions . 
These counter-examples should not be surprising . 
Many definitions face this problem . 
The great 20 th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed a different approach to troublesome definitions : explaining concepts by the analogy of &quot; family resemblances . &quot; 
Family members might share many physical features , such as height , skin tone , or hair color . 
Each member might share some of the common characteristics , but not all of them , with other members . 
There may be no single common feature , but all are readily identified as members of the same family . 
The same can be said of terrorism . 
At least six features are relevant , but exceptions occur in each of the six . 
Complex definitions with built-in exceptions may make lawyers uncomfortable , but in the real world , they are perhaps the best we can devise .
