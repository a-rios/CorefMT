Revolutionizing Arab Economies 
ISTANBUL - The ongoing showdown in Egypt between the country &apos;s Islamists and its military rulers is a clear reminder of how difficult democratic transitions in the Arab world are likely to be . 
Obviously , failure to reach a power-sharing agreement will prolong political instability . 
But the resulting economic inaction would be just as damaging to the consolidation of democratic rule . 
Emerging Arab leaders , from Islamists to re-invented former regime officials , are keenly aware of the need to improve their countries &quot; economic prospects . 
They know full well that their popularity can be sustained only if they are able to deliver growth , employment , and higher living standards . 
Even in countries like Tunisia and Egypt , where the transition to democracy is more advanced , political uncertainty has tended to plague economic achievements . 
For the first time since 1986 , Tunisia &apos;s economy shrank in 2011 , by 1.8 % . 
Unemployment reached 18 % last year , up from 13 % in 2010 . 
Meanwhile , the Egyptian economy contracted by 0.8 % , and one million Egyptians lost their jobs . 
Egypt &apos;s foreign-investment inflows have also dried up , falling from $ 6.4 billion in 2010 to a mere $ 500 million in 2011 . 
The combination of these negative trends is affecting these countries &quot; fiscal as well as external balances . 
Egypt &apos;s budget deficit reached 10 % of GDP , while its foreign-exchange reserves have fallen to $ 15 billion - barely enough to cover the country &apos;s import bill for the next three months . 
In Tunisia , too , the budget deficit has widened sharply in the wake of the revolution , rising from 2.6 % of GDP in 2010 to 6 % in 2011 . 
This rapid economic deterioration , combined with the high expectations raised by the onset of political transition , is creating a sense of urgency . 
Emerging political actors feel compelled to develop more detailed economic programs and to address their populations &quot; growing material grievances . 
For example , whereas the Islamists had essentially focused on political themes , highlighting participation , inclusiveness , and democratic reforms , the recent election campaigns witnessed a rhetorical shift to economic aspirations . 
Overall , the emerging political players - particularly the Islamist parties - have adopted a rather conciliatory tone regarding engagement with international actors . 
These parties &quot; economic programs are by and large pro-market , emphasizing the private sector &apos;s role in driving growth and the need to attract foreign capital . 
The state is seen as a vehicle for ensuring social justice , and there are scant references to sharia principles . 
Both in Tunisia and Egypt , for example , Islamist politicians have given assurances that the economically critical tourism sector will not be hindered by restrictions related to Islamic law . 
The Islamists &quot; economic programs also foresee a role for international institutions in helping their countries to overcome the challenges that they face . 
Indeed , whereas resistance to foreign intervention and assistance has been strong with respect to democratic reforms , new Arab leaders seem more receptive to a partnership with the West on economic objectives . 
Economic weakness thus provides an unprecedented opportunity for international engagement with the new Arab leadership , which should incorporate short- , medium- , and long-term goals . 
Short-term goals must have priority , because many Islamist parties are being pressed to produce positive results within a single electoral cycle . 
The new governments will face the immediate challenge of creating jobs , for which the only available recipe is investment in large-scale public-works projects . 
This type of government spending can create labor-intensive jobs that will help to stem rising unemployment . 
The international community can help the Arab governments to launch and sustain such initiatives in several ways . 
First , it can increase the amount of promised financial assistance . 
It can also provide technical expertise to Arab policymakers on debt management . 
Finally , the international community can help Arab governments to establish a secure and predictable legal and regulatory framework for public-private partnerships for large-scale infrastructure projects . 
International actors , jointly with Arab governments , can then help to market these opportunities , allowing Arab economies to benefit from infrastructure-focused long-term international financing . 
Only a combination of these options would allow Arab economies to create jobs in the short term , while avoiding the risks of destabilizing fiscal imbalances or a lack of financing for private-sector investment . 
The West , for its part , stands to gain in myriad ways from a solid partnership with the Arab world to improve its societies &quot; economic future . 
Even in the midst of a protracted currency crisis , European governments can surely sign on to an agenda that prioritizes transfers of know-how over cash infusions .
