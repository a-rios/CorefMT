Austerity and Debt Realism 
CAMBRIDGE - Many , if not all , of the world &apos;s most pressing macroeconomic problems relate to the massive overhang of all forms of debt . 
In Europe , a toxic combination of public , bank , and external debt in the periphery threatens to unhinge the eurozone . 
Across the Atlantic , a standoff between the Democrats , the Tea Party , and old-school Republicans has produced extraordinary uncertainty about how the United States will close its 8 % -of-GDP government deficit over the long term . 
Japan , meanwhile is running a 10 % -of-GDP budget deficit , even as growing cohorts of new retirees turn from buying Japanese bonds to selling them . 
Aside from wringing their hands , what should governments be doing ? 
One extreme is the simplistic Keynesian remedy that assumes that government deficits don &apos;t matter when the economy is in deep recession ; indeed , the bigger the better . 
At the opposite extreme are the debt-ceiling absolutists who want governments to start balancing their budgets tomorrow ( if not yesterday ) . 
Both are dangerously facile . 
The debt-ceiling absolutists grossly underestimate the massive adjustment costs of a self-imposed &quot; sudden stop &quot; in debt finance . 
Such costs are precisely why impecunious countries such as Greece face massive social and economic displacement when financial markets lose confidence and capital flows suddenly dry up . 
Of course , there is an appealing logic to saying that governments should have to balance their budgets just like the rest of us ; unfortunately , it is not so simple . 
Governments typically have myriad ongoing expenditure commitments related to basic services such as national defense , infrastructure projects , education , and health care , not to mention to retirees . 
No government can just walk away from these responsibilities overnight . 
When US President Ronald Reagan took office on January 20 , 1981 , he retroactively rescinded all civil-service job offers extended by the government during the two and a half months between his election and the inauguration . 
The signal that he intended to slow down government spending was a powerful one , but the immediate effect on the budget was negligible . 
Of course , a government can also close a budget gap by raising taxes , but any sudden shift can significantly magnify the distortions that taxes cause . 
If the debt-ceiling absolutists are naïve , so , too , are simplistic Keynesians . 
They see lingering post-financial-crisis unemployment as a compelling justification for much more aggressive fiscal expansion , even in countries already running massive deficits , such as the US and the United Kingdom . 
People who disagree with them are said to favor &quot; austerity &quot; at a time when hyper-low interest rates mean that governments can borrow for almost nothing . 
But who is being naïve ? 
It is quite right to argue that governments should aim only to balance their budgets over the business cycle , running surpluses during booms and deficits when economic activity is weak . 
But it is wrong to think that massive accumulation of debt is a free lunch . 
In a series of academic papers with Carmen Reinhart - including , most recently , joint work with Vincent Reinhart ( &quot; Debt Overhangs : Past and Present &quot; ) - we find that very high debt levels of 90 % of GDP are a long-term secular drag on economic growth that often lasts for two decades or more . 
The cumulative costs can be stunning . 
The average high-debt episodes since 1800 last 23 years and are associated with a growth rate more than one percentage point below the rate typical for periods of lower debt levels . 
That is , after a quarter-century of high debt , income can be 25 % lower than it would have been at normal growth rates . 
Of course , there is two-way feedback between debt and growth , but normal recessions last only a year and cannot explain a two-decade period of malaise . 
The drag on growth is more likely to come from the eventual need for the government to raise taxes , as well as from lower investment spending . 
So , yes , government spending provides a short-term boost , but there is a trade-off with long-run secular decline . 
It is sobering to note that almost half of high-debt episodes since 1800 are associated with low or normal real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rates . 
Japan &apos;s slow growth and low interest rates over the past two decades are emblematic . 
Moreover , carrying a huge debt burden runs the risk that global interest rates will rise in the future , even absent a Greek-style meltdown . 
This is particularly the case today , when , after sustained massive &quot; quantitative easing &quot; by major central banks , many governments have exceptionally short maturity structures for their debt . 
Thus , they run the risk that a spike in interest rates would feed back relatively quickly into higher borrowing costs . 
With many of today &apos;s advanced economies near or approaching the 90 % -of-GDP level that loosely marks high-debt periods , expanding today &apos;s already large deficits is a risky proposition , not the cost-free strategy that simplistic Keynesians advocate . 
I will focus in the coming months on the related problems of high private debt and external debts , and I will also return to the theme of why this is a time when elevated inflation is not so naïve . 
Above all , voters and politicians must beware of seductively simple approaches to today &apos;s debt problems .
