A Hundred Weltpolitiks 
NEW DELHI - Mao Zedong once famously called for the Chinese to &quot; let a hundred flowers bloom . &quot; 
Soon , however , he was recoiling from what he saw as a chaos of competing ideas . 
Today , the world seems to be entering a period when , if not a hundred , at least a dozen varieties of Weltpolitik are being pursued by great and emerging powers alike . 
Reconciling these competing strategic visions of the world , in particular of global crisis , will make international diplomacy more complicated than ever . 
The intervention by Turkey and Brazil into the globally divisive issue of Iran &apos;s nuclear program is but the latest , and also the clearest , sign of this new element in global affairs . 
In May , the Iranian , Turkish , and Brazilian leaders met in Tehran to conclude an agreement that would supposedly have Iran deposit 1,200 kilograms of lightly enriched uranium ( LEU ) in Turkey , which , in exchange , would send 120 kilograms of enriched fuel to be used in Iran &apos;s research reactor . 
Russia proposed this kind of swap earlier , but Iran declined the offer , and the version agreed with Brazil and Turkey was likewise intended to forestall Iran &apos;s ability to produce highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) , which can be used for nuclear warheads . 
But its other intention was probably to stymie American efforts to adopt new United Nations sanctions on Iran . 
It is too soon to tell if Iran &apos;s desire to obtain nuclear weapons has been delayed . 
The International Atomic Energy Agency has not ruled against the agreement , and I am informed that the Brazilian / Turkish brokered deal does not violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , to which Iran , as a signatory , is obliged to adhere . 
Nevertheless , the effort to preempt American strategy clearly failed , as new UN sanctions were implemented earlier this month . 
As the deal was intended to avoid a nuclear standoff with Iran , why was there so much outrage in the US and the West ? 
I fear it is because the US found itself denied its primacy in setting global policy on Iran . 
Instead of trying to explore the possibilities presented by the Brazilian / Turkish opening , the US quickly pushed the UN Security Council for more sanctions ( the fourth round so far ) on Iran . 
This forced Brazil and Turkey , both currently non-permanent members of the Security Council , to vote against the sanctions resolution . 
The result ? 
The UN sanction vote was also heavily influenced by another small country with a Weltpolitik : Israel . 
In February , a high-level Israeli delegation visited Beijing to present the Chinese leadership with &quot; evidence &quot; of Iran &apos;s atomic ambitions . 
The Israelis then explained to their hosts - in considerable detail - the potential economic consequences for China if an Israeli strike on Iran should become necessary in order to stop Iran from fulfilling its &quot; nuclear ambitions . &quot; 
China appears to have taken the message to heart , as it voted in favor of sanctions on Iran for the first time . 
Iran responded by calling China &apos;s vote &quot; two faced . &quot; 
The emerging stew of Weltpolitik thickened even more with Israel &apos;s pre-emptive move in international waters to stop a flotilla supposedly bringing relief aid to blockaded Gaza . 
To be sure , this complex web of interconnected events reflects the declining global role of the US . 
Brazil , Turkey , and , yes , Iran are all clearly keen to demonstrate their political and foreign-policy independence . 
Brazil wants to prove that it deserves a permanent seat on the Security Council . 
Turkey seeks to re-establish its Islamic identity and &quot; Ottoman &quot; influence over the Middle East , thereby flexing its diplomatic muscles for a European Union that has all but rejected Turkish membership . 
And Iran simply wants to show once again that it will not kowtow to the &quot; Great Satan . &quot; 
All of these motivations critically challenge US global diplomatic primacy . 
But America had better get used to these types of diplomatic cat &apos;s cradles . 
For there are other powers , both emerging and established , with global foreign policies of their own - India , Indonesia , Japan . 
And regional players like South Africa , Nigeria , Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Indonesia , and South Korea among others , will also have to be reckoned with in future regional disputes . 
This increasingly complex web of intersecting national interests is the face of international diplomacy in the twenty-first century . 
Ancient rivalries and atavistic feuds may or may not be part of this ; only future crisis will tell . 
But this amalgam of competing strategic visions probably marks the end of America &apos;s post-Cold War power . 
With the entire world affected by turmoil in the Persian Gulf and greater Middle East , perhaps that is all to the good . 
Surely , the national interests of the US and the West are not the only ones that matter . 
Why , then , should the rest of the world leave the resolution of these disputes to America alone ? 
The era of US diplomatic hegemony has drawn to a close . 
And it would be a grave mistake to think that a condominium between the US and China will impose global order in the way that the Cold War-era US / USSR superpower rivalry did . 
Too many powerful countries now feel able to flex their diplomatic muscles in defense of their interests . 
Mao &apos;s hundred flowers may have bloomed only briefly , but today &apos;s myriad species of Weltpolitik are certain to bloom perennially .
