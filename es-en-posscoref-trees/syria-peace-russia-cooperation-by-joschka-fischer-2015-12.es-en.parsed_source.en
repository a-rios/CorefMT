The Syrian Knot 
BERLIN - For four years , a bloody war has raged in Syria . 
What began as a democratic uprising against Bashar al-Assad &apos;s dictatorship has developed into a cat &apos;s cradle of conflicts , partly reflecting a brutal proxy struggle among Iran , Turkey , and Saudi Arabia for regional domination . 
This struggle , as the fighting in Yemen has shown , has the potential to destabilize the entire region . 
And now Russia , by means of its military intervention on Assad &apos;s behalf , is seeking to enhance its status as a global power vis-Ã -vis the West ( and the United States in particular ) . 
So the conflict in Syria is taking place on at least three levels : local , regional , and global . 
And , because the fighting has been permitted to fester and spread , around 250,000 people have died , according to United Nations estimates . 
This summer , the UN Refugee Agency put the number of refugees who had fled Syria at four million , in addition to 7.6 million internally displaced people . 
In the meantime , the flow of Syrian refugees to Europe has developed into one of the greatest challenges the European Union has ever faced . 
The Syrian civil war has also become one of the most dangerous breeding grounds for Islamist terrorism , as the Islamic State ( ISIS ) attacks in Ankara , Beirut , and Paris , and the bombing of a Russian passenger plane above the Sinai Peninsula , have shown . 
Moreover , Turkey &apos;s downing of a Russian warplane has heightened the risk that major powers will be drawn directly into the fighting . 
After all , Turkey , as a NATO member , would be entitled to the Alliance &apos;s military assistance were it to be attacked . 
For all these reasons , the Syrian war must be brought to an end as quickly as possible . 
Not only is the humanitarian disaster worsening almost on a daily basis ; so are the security risks emanating from the war . 
Following the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris , a new opportunity to end Syria &apos;s agony has emerged , because all the important players ( except ISIS ) are now willing to sit down together at the negotiating table . 
But , although all players have agreed to fight ISIS first and foremost , the big question remains whether they will in fact do so . 
The Kurds in northern Syria and Iraq are the most effective fighters against ISIS , but their own national ambitions put them at odds with Turkey . 
Iran and Saudi Arabia are fighting primarily against each other for regional predominance , relying on non-state actors . 
Russia is fighting for global status and against any form of regime change . 
Russia thus finds itself allied with Iran in supporting Assad &apos;s dictatorship , while Iran , in turn , is pursuing its own geopolitical interests by backing its Shia ally in Lebanon , Hezbollah , for which the Syrian hinterland is indispensable . 
France is more serious than ever about fighting ISIS , while Germany and other Europeans feel obliged to assist it - and to stem the flow of refugees emanating from the region . 
The US , meanwhile , is operating with handbrakes on . 
President Barack Obama primarily wants to avoid involving the US in another Middle East war before the end of his term . 
With the main global power remaining on the sidelines , however , the inevitable result has been a highly dangerous power vacuum , which Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking to exploit . 
In particular , because the US refuses to lead and Europe is too weak militarily to influence developments in Syria on its own , there is a threat of a de facto European alliance with Putin &apos;s Russia . 
That would be a grave error , given that any kind of cooperation with Russia wouldn &apos;t contain or end the war in Syria : In fact , there is reason to fear the opposite : Any military cooperation with Assad - which is Putin &apos;s aim and price tag - would drive a large majority of Sunni Muslims into the arms of radical Islamists . 
Such a tendency is already visible in Iraq . 
The Shia-dominated government of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki played a decisive role in radicalizing Iraqi Sunnis and convincing them to support ISIS . 
It would be extremely stupid to repeat the same mistake willfully in Syria . 
Indeed , striking such a bargain would have nothing to do with realpolitik , because the war in Syria cannot be ended with either ISIS or Assad still in the picture . 
Any Western collaboration with Russia must avoid two outcomes : the linking of Syria with Ukraine ( the negotiations with Iran on limiting its nuclear program succeeded without such a linkage ) and military cooperation with Assad . 
Instead , an attempt should be made to link a military intervention against ISIS , conducted under the auspices of the UN Security Council , with an agreement on a political transition process that moves from an armistice to a national unity government for Syria and the end of the Assad regime . 
And there are other big challenges looming beyond Syria : Iraq &apos;s descent into chaos , closely linked to the Syrian tragedy , threatens to turn into a new theater of conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia . 
Unless this fight for regional hegemony is contained , further proxy wars - with all the risks they entail - are inevitable . 
Ultimately , the decisive battle with Islamist extremism will take place within the Sunni community . 
Which form of Sunni Islam will prevail - the Saudi-Wahhabi version or a more modern and moderate one ? 
This is the decisive question in the fight against ISIS and its ilk . 
In this context , an important factor will be how the West treats its Muslims - as welcome citizens with equal rights and obligations , or as permanent outsiders and fodder for jihadist recruiters .
