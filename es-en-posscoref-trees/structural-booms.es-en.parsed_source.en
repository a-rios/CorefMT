Structural Booms 
Why are there economic booms and busts , those long swings between expansion and slowdown ? 
Traditional explanations focus on bad monetary policy . 
My research argues that they are usually structural , the result of powerful shifts in expectations about future productivity and profitability . 
In the Interwar period , big swings were marked by hyper-inflations and deep deflations . 
Small wonder that for the Austrian , Keynesian and Monetarist schools it was always &quot; cherchez la monnaie . &quot; 
After World War II , however , long swings in economic activity continued , while only moderate price and inflation patterns emerged . 
In the 1960s , unemployment nearly disappeared in several European countries , but without rising inflation . 
In the 1990s , employment soared in several industrial countries , again with little or no inflation . 
I see these powerful upswings as investment booms as having structural causes and effects . 
Entrepreneurs foresaw new opportunities for profitable use of capital in the medium-term future . 
So they stepped up investment in new facilities , new customers and new employees . 
Most business investing leads through non-monetary channels to higher employment - without inflationary over-heating . 
The turn-of-the-century German school , led by Arthur Spiethoff and Gustav Cassel , viewed the pre-WWI booms in the same non-monetary way . 
But they held that structural booms may die of natural causes - with no necessity for the over-building , purge and catharsis depicted by the later Austrian school . 
In recent research I conducted with Gylfi Zoega , we hypothesised that such shifts in expectations , and thus in future economic expansion , can be detected in advance from tell-tale shifts in the stock markets . 
Share prices may serve as a kind of proxy for the expectations and attitudes of businessmen . 
It turns out there that is extensive evidence that a sustained shift in share prices is followed by a gradual change in unemployment . 
Since 1900 at least , there has been a pronounced long-term relationship between share prices and employment in the US and the UK , and over a somewhat later period in France , too . 
Since 1960 , when figures for more OECD countries are available , there is the same statistical link in all of those countries except Sweden : the higher the share prices , the lower the unemployment rate . 
The strength of this relationship depends on a country &apos;s economic institutions . 
Some OECD economies have long been relatively capitalist - the US , the UK , the Netherlands , Canada and Australia . 
Within them , new businesses have relatively easy access to finance ( domestic and foreign ) and can enter or exit a wide range of industries without big hurdles . 
Other countries have long been more nearly corporatist - Italy , Germany , Austria and Japan . 
They have a rather closed system of big corporations and big labour unions loosely directed by an interventionist government with the collaboration of big banks . 
Statistical evidence shows that the same given change in share prices is followed by a greater change in employment in the more capitalist economies than in the more corporatist ones . 
To what particular labour and capital-market institutions might responsiveness to share prices be strongly linked ? 
We argued that more responsive economies have fewer employment protections to scare entrepreneurs away from starting new firms , and have less industry-wide or economy-wide wage bargaining , which may also deter entrepreneurs . 
Evidence confirms that the most responsive OECD economies scored well on these counts . 
We also hypothesised that more responsive economies would be less encumbered by bureaucratic &quot; red tape &quot; that raise the costs of starting and developing firms . 
Further , they would have a well-developed stock market , since stock options help motivate entrepreneurs to start new businesses and venture capitalists will want an exchange in which to sell the shares in the start-ups they acquire . 
Finally , they would show large numbers with a university education . 
Countries that scored poorly in responsiveness to share prices tend also to score badly on the OECD &apos;s index of &quot; red tape &quot; and on university education . 
We measured the progress of each country &apos;s stock-market by the level of stock-market capitalisation as a ratio to GDP in 1988 , a decade before the late 1990s investment booms began . 
We found that the greater the level of capitalisation , the more responsive employment was to share prices . 
With these capitalisation figures alone you could have predicted which OECD economies would boom in the late 1990s . 
If my thesis is right - the root cause of big booms in capitalist economies over recent decades ( as well as during the pre-WWI decades ) is a structural shift in expected future profitability - what does it mean for the choice of an economic system and for economic stabilisation ? 
Many Western nations react to perceived flaws by drawing back somewhat from capitalism through increased public sector employment , public expenditure , and social control over the private sector . 
Countries that , in the past , pursued some such policies include Norway , Austria , Italy , Germany , Sweden , and France . 
It is plausible - though not a certainty - that an economy dominated by large public expenditure and public employment is capable of greater stability . 
Yet countries that continued with these policies in the 1990s were deprived of the once-in-a-generation investment boom enjoyed in the more capitalist countries . 
Now a cultural shift appears underway in several of those economies , with more possibly to come . 
&quot; Shareholder value &quot; has gained force ; access to an organised stock exchange has widened . 
If so , these countries will be exposed to wider swings . 
It is doubtful that there is a positive benefit - net of future cost - from jiggling tax rates to stabilise employment . 
Yet governments can attack speculative excesses and thus reduce job instability by doing for capital markets what they have long done for product and labour markets : set up systems to monitor markets for the safety of investors , ensure transparency , and promote good corporate governance . 
The job instability that remains would be a small price to pay for the stimulus , excitement and progress that a well-designed capitalism brings .
