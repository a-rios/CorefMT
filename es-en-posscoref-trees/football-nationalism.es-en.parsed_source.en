Football Nationalism 
AMSTERDAM  -  
The feelings inspired by the latter are by far the stronger . 
Koestler himself , a proud and loyal British citizen , remained a lifelong Hungarian soccer nationalist . 
It is hard for Americans , whose &quot; world series &quot; are essentially domestic affairs , to understand the emotions engendered in European citizens when their nations compete for the European soccer championship every four years . 
For several weeks this summer , the stadiums in Austria and Switzerland , not to mention the streets of European capitals , from Madrid to Moscow , were given to an orgy of flag-waving , anthem-singing , drum-beating patriotism . 
Spain &apos;s victory was one of the rare occasions that Catalonians , Castillians , Basques , and Andalusians erupted together in an explosion of patriotic delight . 
Football , more than most sports , lends itself to tribal feelings : the collective effort , the team colors , the speed , the physical aggression . 
As a famous Dutch soccer coach once said , not in jest : &quot; Soccer is war . &quot; 
It was not supposed to be like this . 
After two world wars , displays of national fervor became more or less taboo in Europe . 
Nationalism was blamed for almost destroying the old continent twice in the 20th century . 
The kind of exalted patriotism , especially when combined with warrior pride , that is still entirely normal in the United States , was for a long time associated with mass slaughter . 
The English , who escaped occupation by a hostile power , and still believe they won World War II alone ( well , with a little help from the Yanks ) , still have a militaristic streak . 
They are exceptional . 
And yet , even as nationalistic emotions were suppressed in polite society all over Europe , the soccer stadiums remained stubbornly in the pre-WWII world . 
Just as killing continues to be celebrated in ritualized form in Spanish bull rings , illicit tribal feelings are given full vent in the soccer arenas . 
These feelings can be festive , even carnival-like , as they were in Euro 2008 . 
Games between Holland and Germany , for example , or Germany and Poland , tended , until very recently , to be reenactments of the war ; either - and most commonly - as melancholy replays of wartime defeat , or as sweet revenge . 
When Holland beat Germany in the semi-finals of the 1988 European Championship , it was as though justice finally had been done . 
More Dutch people turned out in the streets of Amsterdam for a night and day of celebration than when the country was actually liberated in May , 1945 . 
( Sometimes football history gets mixed up with &quot; real &quot; history ; the defeat of a superior Dutch team by Germany in the World Cup final of 1974 also needed to be redressed . ) 
The tribal feelings of Germans were considered , for obvious reasons , to be particularly toxic after Hitler &apos;s Reich , which is why German flag-waving , until recently , was exercised with a slight air of shame-faced restraint that was entirely absent in surrounding countries . 
Yet Germans , too , are unable to suppress such feelings . 
Older Germans can still remember their famous victory over a superb Hungarian team in 1954 . 
It was the first time since their ruinous wartime defeat that Germans were able to feel proud of themselves . 
Here was a victory they could celebrate . 
After years of guilt and deprivation , the Germans were back , as it were . 
Like everything else , forms of patriotism change over time . 
Reasons for national pride are varied . 
When France won the World Cup in 1998 , the French liked to point out the ethnic diversity of their team . 
Their main star , Zin√©dine Zidane , was of Algerian stock . 
Others had ancestral roots in various parts of Africa . 
The multi-ethnic nature of the 1998 champion was widely touted as a mark , not of a long and often bloody colonial past , but of national superiority born from the tolerance of the French Enlightenment and the fraternity of the French Revolution . 
In fact , the French were harbingers of a kind . 
If ethnic diversity is more and more common in national sides , it is even more marked in clubs . 
Clubs , too , often used to command tribal loyalty along ethnic or religious lines , depending on their location in large industrial cities : Irish clubs versus Jewish clubs in London , for example , or Protestants versus Catholics in Glasgow . 
Who would have predicted thirty years ago that British soccer fans would have cheered for a London team full of Africans , Latin Americans , and Spaniards , coached by a Frenchman ? 
Or that the national English team would be managed by an Italian ? 
But ethnic and cultural diversity is not all that has changed the face of European football . 
I have never seen such harmony between the supporters of different nations as in this year &apos;s championship . 
Perhaps it was due to the absence of England , whose fans include the last bands of amateur warriors . 
Not that national feeling is dying , even as a new European spirit is being born . 
No one much minds any more when Germany wins , as it so often does . 
The Germans are now much too nice for that . 
Yet I have to admit that I still could not suppress a tiny , keenly felt pleasure when Germany lost to Spain . 
Perhaps because Spain played more beautiful football .
