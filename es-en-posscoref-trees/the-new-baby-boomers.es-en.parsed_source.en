The New Baby Boomers 
Throughout the developing world , governments urgently need to devise the right mix of investments and policies to encourage their young people to get an education , find work , stay healthy , form families , and exercise citizenship . 
The payoff is huge if they get it right : accelerated development as economies reap the benefits of a burgeoning working-age population and lower dependency ratios . 
In East Asia , this &quot; demographic dividend &quot; is believed to have generated more than a quarter of the region &apos;s economic growth . 
Developing countries have already invested heavily in children . 
Their young people are therefore better-educated and healthier than previous generations . 
More than 80 % of children now attend primary school , up from 50 % in 1970 , and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10 % to 6.5 % over the same period . 
But now governments must go beyond investments in children and begin supporting the new generation of young people . 
Indeed , even in countries with high primary-school completion rates , many young people do not attend secondary school . 
Young people account for half of all new HIV infections . 
And , in the Middle East and North Africa region , about a quarter of all young people are unemployed . 
These problems raise thorny questions : What prevents more young people from attending secondary school ? 
Is it because they are sometimes close to being illiterate even after primary school , or because it is unaffordable ? 
Why don &apos;t more young people learn how to lower the risk of getting HIV / AIDS ? 
Why do businesses in these countries complain of a lack of skilled workers when so many university students are jobless ? 
To build successful youth-friendly policies , governments need to focus on three policy areas : expanding opportunities , enhancing capabilities , and providing second chances for young people . 
Governments must broaden opportunities for young people by improving access to , and the quality of , health and educational services . 
We know that the full benefit of primary school is realized only when children go on to secondary school . 
Yet many young people are ill prepared for secondary school , and places are scarce . 
Today &apos;s employers want highly skilled workers . 
More than 20 % of all firms , in countries as diverse as Algeria , Bangladesh , Brazil , China , Estonia , and Zambia , rate inadequate skills and education of workers as a major or a severe obstacle . 
If young people are not to become stuck in dead-end jobs , or end up without jobs at all , they need better education and skills that match those needed by employers . 
Several countries now facilitate access to secondary schooling , in particular through &quot; conditional cash transfer programs , &quot; which offer a stipend to poor families whose children regularly attend school . 
These programs have successfully increased secondary school enrollment in countries like Mexico , Ecuador , Bangladesh , and Cambodia . 
For these programs to work , however , children must be ready to enter secondary education . 
Yet , in Morocco , for example , more than 80 % of school children complete primary school , but fewer than 20 % have mastered the material . 
Second , policies should support young people as they strive to make good decisions . 
Governments cannot substitute for parents or for communities , but they can encourage young people and their families to invest in themselves . 
Armed with the right information and incentives , young people can make better decisions about their health and education . 
In Cameroon , Horizon Jeunes , a reproductive health program that targets urban youth , increased young people &apos;s knowledge of reproductive health and successfully changed their behavior , with condom use among females increasing from 58 % to 76 % in the treatment group . 
Similarly , the rate at which eighth graders from the Dominican Republic entered upper secondary levels increased when they were simply told how much more those who finished high school earned - an amount they had vastly underestimated . 
Bangladesh &apos;s Female Secondary Stipend Program was successful in helping girls aged 11 to 14 to delay marriage and remain in school . 
Governments must also begin to offer &quot; second chances &quot; for young people who have fallen behind due to difficult circumstances or poor choices . 
Such programs must be well designed , targeted , and coordinated to give the right incentives to beneficiaries . 
For example , sub-Saharan Africa has thousands of young combatants - 100,000 in Sudan alone - who hope to reconstruct their lives in peacetime but clearly require skills training and jobs , as well as medical and psychological support . 
Focusing political will and the efforts of young people themselves to expand opportunities , enhance capabilities , and provide second chances can help countries make the most of today &apos;s demographic advantage . 
Countries can either harness this growth - and in so doing , transform their development prospects - or face the risk of an alienated generation embittered by the unfulfilled chance of a better future .
