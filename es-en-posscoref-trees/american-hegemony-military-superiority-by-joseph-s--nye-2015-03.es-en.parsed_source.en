American Hegemony or American Primacy ? 
CAMBRIDGE - No country in modern history has possessed as much global military power as the United States . 
This historical analogy , though increasingly popular , is misleading . 
Britain was never as dominant as the US is today . 
To be sure , it maintained a navy equal in size to the next two fleets combined , and its empire , on which the sun never set , ruled over a quarter of humankind . 
By the outbreak of World War I , Britain ranked only fourth among the great powers in terms of military personnel , fourth in terms of GDP , and third in military spending . 
The British Empire was ruled in large part through reliance on local troops . 
Of the 8.6 million British forces in WWI , nearly a third came from the overseas empire . 
By World War II , protecting the empire had become more of a burden than an asset . 
The fact that the UK was situated so close to powers like Germany and Russia made matters even more challenging . 
For all the loose talk of an &quot; American empire , &quot; the fact is that the US does not have colonies that it must administer , and thus has more freedom to maneuver than the UK did . 
That brings us to another problem with the global hegemon analogy : the confusion over what &quot; hegemony &quot; actually means . 
Some observers conflate the concept with imperialism ; but the US is clear evidence that a hegemon does not have to have a formal empire . 
Others define hegemony as the ability to set the rules of the international system ; but precisely how much influence over this process a hegemon must have , relative to other powers , remains unclear . 
Still others consider hegemony to be synonymous with control of the most power resources . 
Similarly , those who speak of American hegemony after 1945 fail to note that the Soviet Union balanced US military power for more than four decades . 
Though the US had disproportionate economic clout , its room for political and military maneuver was constrained by Soviet power . 
Some analysts describe the post-1945 period as a US-led hierarchical order with liberal characteristics , in which the US provided public goods while operating within a loose system of multilateral rules and institutions that gave weaker states a say . 
They point out that it may be rational for many countries to preserve this institutional framework , even if American power resources decline . 
In this sense , the US-led international order could outlive America &apos;s primacy in power resources , though many others argue that the emergence of new powers portends this order &apos;s demise . 
But , when it comes to the era of supposed US hegemony , there has always been a lot of fiction mixed in with the facts . 
It was less a global order than a group of like-minded countries , largely in the Americas and Western Europe , which comprised less than half of the world . 
Given this , the US position in the world could more accurately be called a &quot; half-hegemony . &quot; 
Of course , America did maintain economic dominance after 1945 : the devastation of WWII in so many countries meant that the US produced nearly half of global GDP . 
That position lasted until 1970 , when the US share of global GDP fell to its pre-war level of one-quarter . 
Indeed , during this period , the US often could not defend its interests : the Soviet Union acquired nuclear weapons ; communist takeovers occurred in China , Cuba , and half of Vietnam ; the Korean War ended in a stalemate ; and revolts in Hungary and Czechoslovakia were repressed . 
Against this background , &quot; primacy &quot; seems like a more accurate description of a country &apos;s disproportionate ( and measurable ) share of all three kinds of power resources : military , economic , and soft . 
The question now is whether the era of US primacy is coming to an end . 
Given the unpredictability of global developments , it is , of course , impossible to answer this question definitively . 
The rise of transnational forces and non-state actors , not to mention emerging powers like China , suggests that there are big changes on the horizon . 
In short , while the era of US primacy is not over , it is set to change in important ways . 
Whether or not these changes will bolster global security and prosperity remains to be seen .
