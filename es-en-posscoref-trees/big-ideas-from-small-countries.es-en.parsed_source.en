Big Ideas from Small Countries 
CAMBRIDGE - Two decades ago , many people thought that the lesson of the 1980 &quot; s was that Japan &apos;s variant of capitalism was the best model , and that other countries around the world should and would follow it . 
The Japanese model quickly lost its luster in the 1990 &quot; s . 
A decade ago , many thought that the lesson of the 1990 &quot; s was that the United States &quot; variant of capitalism was the best model , and that other countries should and would follow . 
The American model lost its attractiveness in the 2000 &quot; s . 
So , where should countries look now , in 2010 , for models of economic success to emulate ? 
Perhaps they should look to the periphery of the world economy . 
Many small countries there have experimented with policies and institutions that could usefully be adopted by others . 
Costa Rica in Central America and Mauritius in Africa each pulled ahead of its regional peers some time ago . 
Among many other decisions that have worked out well for them , both countries have foregone a standing army . 
The results in both cases have been a political history devoid of coups , and financial savings that can be used for education , investment , and other good things . 
A panoply of innovations has helped Chile to outperform its South American neighbors . 
Chile &apos;s fiscal institutions insure a countercyclical budget . 
Many governments increase spending excessively in booms , and then are forced to cut back in downturns , thereby exacerbating the cyclical swings . 
There are two key elements to Chile &apos;s fiscal institutions : 
● A structural budget balance rule allows deficits only to the extent that the current price of copper is below its 10-year equilibrium or output is below its long-term trend . 
● Two panels of technical experts are the ones to judge trends in copper prices and output , respectively , insulated from the political processes that can otherwise succumb to wishful thinking . 
These institutions are particularly worthy of imitation by other commodity-exporting countries , in order to defeat the so-called &quot; natural-resource curse . &quot; Even advanced countries such as the US and UK could learn something from Chile , given that in the last expansion they evidently forgot how to run countercyclical fiscal policy . 
Singapore achieved rich-country status with a unique development strategy . 
Among its many innovations were a paternalistic approach to saving and use of the price mechanism to defeat urban traffic congestion ( an approach later adopted by London ) . 
Other small advanced countries also have lessons to offer . 
New Zealand led the way for much of the world &apos;s central banks with inflation targeting , along with many liberalizing reforms in the late 1980 &quot; s . 
Perhaps its Labor Party should be given credit for pioneering the principle that center-left governments can sometimes achieve economic liberalization better than their center-right opponents . 
Ireland showed the importance of foreign direct investment . 
Estonia led the way in simplifying its tax system by means of a successful flat tax in 1994 , followed by Slovakia and other small countries in Central and Eastern Europe and elsewhere ( including Mauritius again ) . 
Mexico pioneered the idea of Conditional Cash Transfers ( the OPORTUNIDADES program - originally PROGRESA - which was launched in 1998 ) . 
CCT programs have subsequently been emulated by many countries in Latin America , Asia , and Africa . 
Mexico &apos;s innovation was really two revolutions in one . 
First , there was the specific policy idea of making poverty benefits contingent on children &apos;s school attendance ( an idea which has been embraced even in New York City ) . 
Second , and perhaps more importantly , the Mexicans implemented the methodological idea of conducting controlled experiments to find out which policies work and which don &apos;t work in developing countries ( which has fed into the exciting Randomized Control Trials movement in the field of development economics ) . 
Also in the 1990 &quot; s , largely thanks to the leadership of then-President Ernesto Zedillo , Mexico adopted non-partisan federal electoral institutions that in 2006 proved able to resolve successfully a disputed election . 
( By contrast , it turned out in November 2000 that the US had no such mechanism in place , other than the preferences of political appointees . ) More recently , the current president , Felipe Calderón , has shut down the entrenched electric utility and pursued much-needed tax , pension , and other reforms . 
In highlighting some very specific institutions that could be usefully adopted elsewhere , I do not mean to suggest that they can be effortlessly translated from one national context to another . 
Nor do I mean to suggest that these examples are entirely responsible for the economic success of the countries where they are found . 
( Indeed , a few of these countries have recently been wrestling with severe problems . ) 
But a country does not have to be large to serve as a model for others . 
Small countries tend to be open to trade . 
Often , they are open to new ideas - and freer than large countries to experiment . 
The results of such experiments - even those that fail - include useful lessons for all of us .
