The New Middle East Order 
Sometime this month , President George W. Bush will - reluctantly - announce a new policy for the United States in Iraq . 
A new policy is needed not only in order to halt America &apos;s drift into impotence as it tries to prevent Iraq from spiraling into full-scale civil war , but also because the map of power in the Middle East has changed dramatically . 
That map has been in constant flux for the last 60 years , during which the main players - Egypt , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Israel , and Iran - have formed and broken alliances . 
Now , something like a dividing line is emerging , and if Bush finally begins to understand the region &apos;s dynamics , he may be able to craft a policy with a chance of success . 
This regional realignment is typified by the emergence of a de facto alliance that dare not speak its name . 
Israel and Saudi Arabia , seemingly the most unlikely of allies , have come together to contain their common enemy : Iran , with its mushrooming influence in Iraq , Lebanon , and Palestine . 
Iran not only threatens Israel ( and the region ) with its desire for a nuclear capability and its Shi &apos;a proxy militants ; it is also seeking to usurp the traditional role of moderate Sunni Arab regimes as the Palestinians &quot; defenders . 
After decades of using concern for the Palestinian cause to shore up popular support for their own ineffective and undemocratic regimes , these moderate Arab leaders have now been put on the defensive by Iran &apos;s quest for hegemony . If Iran succeeds in being seen as the genuine patron of Palestinian national aspirations , it will also succeed in legitimizing its claim for dominance in the Middle East . 
Israel , a country in shock following its failure to destroy Hezbollah last summer , and humiliated by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejhad &apos;s vow to &quot; wipe Israel off the map &quot; - a threat backed up by Iran &apos;s support of Hamas and Hezbollah - now talks about a &quot; quartet of moderates &quot; as the region &apos;s only hope . 
Indeed , Israel now sees its security as relying not so much on a US guarantee , but on Egypt , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and Turkey ( which is seeking regional influence in fear of rejection by the European Union ) restraining Iran and its paid proxies . 
According to Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres , Israel hopes to isolate and contain the Shi &apos;a / Farsi spheres of power by forging open cooperation with the Sunni / Arab domain . 
Saudi Arabia is just as eager to contain the Iranian threat and the growing &quot; Shi &apos;a crescent &quot; that , with the empowerment of the Shi &apos;a in Iraq , has moved westward to begin to include the Shi &apos;a regions of the Kingdom . 
So it should be no surprise that the Saudi regime was the first to condemn Shi &apos;a Hezbollah at the start of the war with Israel , and that it announced in December that it would support Iraq &apos;s Sunnis militarily should a precipitate US withdrawal incite a Sunni / Shi &apos;a civil war there . 
The Shi &apos;a threat to the Saudi government is ideological . 
Indeed , it goes to the heart of the Saudi state &apos;s authority , owing to the Al Saud royal family &apos;s reliance on Wahhabi Islam to legitimate its rule . 
Since the Wahhabis consider the Shi &apos;a apostates , the challenge from the Shi &apos;a - both within and without Saudi Arabia - represents a mortal threat . 
So Saudi Arabia is ready to cooperate with Israel not only against Iran , but also against other &quot; radicals , &quot; such as Hamas . 
Remarkably , Palestine &apos;s Hamas prime minister , Ismael Haniyeh , was not received in Saudi Arabia in December , when he was traveling through the region pleading for support for his beleaguered government . 
Conservative Saudi Arabia prefers dealing with traditional and predictable leaders , such as Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Lebanon &apos;s premier , Fouad Siniora , rather than firebrand populist leaders like Hezbollah &apos;s Hassan Nasrallah , Hamas &quot; Khalid Meshal , and Iran &apos;s Ahmadinejhad . 
Last year , Saudi Arabia &apos;s King Abdullah , worried by Shi &apos;a expansionism , was persuaded by Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the head of his National Security Council , to coordinate policy with Israel to counter Iran &apos;s growing influence . 
Israel , after all , is a &quot; reliable enemy &quot; for Saudi Arabia , having destroyed Nasser &apos;s Egyptian army in 1967 - a time when the Saudis were fighting Egypt by proxy in Yemen . 
So Prince Turki al-Faysal , the long time head of Saudi intelligence , has met with Meir Dagan , the head of Israel &apos;s Mossad , while Bandar met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jordan the same month . 
Yet covert support from Israel , America , and the Saudis for Abbas and Siniora does little to help them in their domestic battles . 
From Morocco , Algeria , Libya , and Sudan to Bahrain and Yemen - indeed , throughout the Muslim world from Jakarta to Nigeria - Islamic radicals have won the popularity sweepstakes . 
A recent poll in Egypt ranked Nasrallah , Meshal , and Ahmadinejhad as the three most popular figures . 
This leads to an unavoidable dilemma : Bush will have to choose between supporting democracy and backing those who want to fight Islamic radicalism . 
Yet Israel , America , and the region &apos;s moderates can benefit from the deepening schism in the Arab / Muslim world . 
That schism is being consolidated by Saudi support of all the region &apos;s Sunni Muslims . 
It is this sense of &quot; Sunni solidarity &quot; that is becoming the decisive factor in the war for the soul of Islam , and in the struggle for mastery in the Middle East that is now underway .
