The Impunity Trap 
NEW YORK - Ours is a world of impunity . 
Allegations of corruption swarmed around FIFA for decades , culminating in indictments of current and former officials last week . 
Yet FIFA President Sepp Blatter was re-elected four times , including after the indictments were filed . 
Yes , Blatter has finally resigned , but only after he and dozens of Federation members once again showed their scorn for honesty and the law . 
We see this kind of behavior all over the world . 
Consider Wall Street . 
In 2013 and 2014 , JPMorgan Chase paid more than $ 20 billion in fines for financial malfeasance ; yet the CEO took home $ 20 million in compensation in both 2014 and 2015 . 
Or consider corruption scandals in Brazil , Spain , and many other countries , where governments remain in power even after high-level corruption within the ruling party has been exposed . 
The ability of those who wield great public and private power to flout the law and ethical norms for personal gain is one of the more glaring manifestations of inequality . 
The poor get life sentences for petty crimes , while bankers who fleece the public of billions get invitations to White House state dinners . 
A famous ditty from medieval England shows that this is not a new phenomenon : 
The law locks up the man or womanWho steals the goose off the commonBut leaves the greater villain looseWho steals the common from the goose . 
Today &apos;s greatest thieves are those who are stealing the modern commons - raiding government budgets , defiling the natural environment , and preying on the public trust . 
When the indictments against the 14 FIFA officials were filed , the cast of characters included not only miscreants from the sports world , but also some familiar players : secret Swiss bank accounts , Cayman Islands tax havens , shell corporations - all of the financial appurtenances that are literally designed to shield the rich from scrutiny and the law . 
But they did so , in part , by penetrating the murky worlds of financial secrecy created and protected by the US Treasury , the Internal Revenue Service , and the US Congress ( ever-protective of Caribbean tax havens ) . 
In some societies and economic sectors , impunity is now so pervasive that it is viewed as inevitable . 
When unethical behavior by political and business leaders becomes widely viewed as &quot; normal , &quot; it then goes unpunished by public opinion , and is reinforced as normal - creating an &quot; impunity trap . &quot; 
For example , with politicians in the United States now so flagrantly and relentlessly on the take from wealthy donors , much of the public accepts new revelations of financial impropriety ( such as the Clinton Foundation &apos;s morally dubious financial dealings ) with a cynical yawn . 
The situation in the global banking sector is especially alarming . 
A recent careful study of ethical attitudes in the financial-services industry in the US and the United Kingdom showed that unethical and illegal behavior is indeed now viewed as pervasive . 
Some 47 % of respondents said that it is &quot; likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical and illegal activity , &quot; and 23 % believed that their fellow employees have engaged in such activities . 
The younger generation has learned the lesson : 32 % of respondents employed in the financial industry for less than ten years said that , &quot; they would likely engage in insider trading to make $ 10 million if there was no chance of being arrested . &quot; 
The chance of being arrested for such malfeasance is , alas , probably very low . 
Yet not all societies or sectors are caught in an impunity trap . 
Some societies , most notably in Scandinavia , maintain the expectation that their public officials and business leaders should and will act ethically and honestly . 
In these countries , ministers are forced to resign for petty infractions that would seem trivial in other countries . 
Convincing American , Russian , Nigerian , or Chinese citizens that corruption can indeed be controlled might seem to be a futile task . 
Recent studies have shown that when &quot; generalized trust &quot; in society is high , economic performance is improved and life satisfaction is higher . 
Among other reasons , commercial agreements are more easily reached and efficiently implemented . 
It is no coincidence that the Scandinavian countries rank among the world &apos;s happiest and most prosperous year after year . 
So what can be done to overcome an impunity trap ? 
Part of the answer is of course law enforcement ( such as the FIFA indictments ) and protection for whistleblowers . 
Yet law enforcement is not sufficient ; public attitudes also play a major role . 
If the public expresses contempt and revulsion for bankers who cheat their clients , oil executives who wreck the climate , FIFA officials who countenance kickbacks , and politicians who cozy up to all of them in exchange for campaign funds and bribes , illegality for the few cannot become the norm . 
Public scorn might not end corruption immediately , but it can make life far less pleasant for those who are stealing the commons from the rest of us . 
One candidate for US President in 2016 , former Maryland Governor Martin O &apos;Malley , recently launched his campaign by asking why not a single Wall Street CEO was convicted of a financial crime in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown . 
It is a good question , the kind that can help the US to overcome its impunity trap . 
Yet we can ask an even simpler question . 
Why are those same bankers still fÃªted by President Barack Obama , invited to glittering state dinners , and reverently interviewed by the media ? 
The first thing any society can and should do is deny respectability to political and business leaders who willfully abuse the public trust .
