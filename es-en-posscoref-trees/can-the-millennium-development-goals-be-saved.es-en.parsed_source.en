Can the Millennium Development Goals be Saved ? 
NEW DELHI - The target date for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals is 2015 , and the world knows it is not on course to meet those goals . 
So world leaders are set to gather at the United Nations to undertake a comprehensive review , with the aim of agreeing on a roadmap and a plan of action to get to the MDG finishing line on schedule . 
I was at the UN in September 2000 , when world leaders met at the Millennium Summit and pledged to work together to free humanity from the &quot; abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty , &quot; and to &quot; make the right to development a reality for everyone . &quot; 
These pledges include commitments to improve access to education , health care , and clean water for the world &apos;s poorest people ; abolish slums ; reverse environmental degradation ; conquer gender inequality ; and cure HIV / AIDS . 
It &apos;s an ambitious list , but its capstone is Goal 8 , which calls for a &quot; global partnership for development . &quot; 
This includes four specific targets : &quot; an open , rule-based , predictable , non-discriminatory trading and financial system &quot; ; special attention to the needs of least-developed countries ; help for landlocked developing countries and small island states ; and national and international measures to deal with developing countries &quot; debt problems . 
Basically , it all boiled down to a grand bargain : while developing countries would obviously have primary responsibility for achieving the MDGs , developed countries would be obliged to finance and support their efforts for development . 
This hasn &apos;t really happened . 
At the G-8 summit at Gleneagles and the UN World Summit in 2005 , donors committed to increasing their aid by $ 50 billion at 2004 prices , and to double their aid to Africa from 2004 levels by 2010 . 
But official development assistance ( ODA ) last year amounted to $ 119.6 billion , or just 0.31 % of the developed countries &quot; GDP - not even half of the UN &apos;s target of 0.7 % of GDP . 
In current US dollars , ODA actually fell by more than 2 % in 2008 . 
The UN admits that progress has been uneven , and that many of the MDGs are likely to be missed in most regions . 
An estimated 1.4 billion people were still living in extreme poverty in 2005 , and the number is likely to be higher today , owing to the global economic crisis . 
The number of undernourished people has continued to grow , while progress in reducing the prevalence of hunger stalled - or even reversed - in some regions between 2000-2002 and 2005-2007 . 
About one in four children under the age of five are underweight , mainly due to lack of quality food , inadequate water , sanitation , and health services , and poor care and feeding practices . 
Gender equality and women &apos;s empowerment , which are essential to overcoming poverty and disease , have made at best fitful progress , with insufficient improvement in girls &quot; schooling opportunities or in women &apos;s access to political authority . 
Progress on trade has been similarly disappointing . 
Developed country tariffs on imports of agricultural products , textiles , and clothing - the principal exports of most developing countries - remained between 5 % and 8 % in 2008 , just 2-3 percentage points lower than in 1998 . 
The time has come to reinforce Goal 8 in two fundamental ways . 
Developed countries must make commitments to increase both the quantity and effectiveness of aid to developing countries . 
Aid must help developing countries improve the welfare of their poorest populations according to their own development priorities . 
But donors all too often feel obliged to make their contributions &quot; visible &quot; to their constituencies and stakeholders , rather than prioritizing local perspectives and participation . 
There are other problems with development aid . 
Reporting requirements are onerous and often impose huge administrative burdens on developing countries , which must devote the scarce skills of educated , English-speaking personnel to writing reports for donors rather than running programs . 
And donor agencies often recruit the best local talent themselves , usually at salaries that distort the labor market . 
In some countries , doctors find it more remunerative to work as translators for foreign-aid agencies than to treat poor patients . 
Meanwhile , donors &quot; sheer clout dilutes the accountability of developing countries &quot; officials and elected representatives to their own people . 
We must change the way the world goes about the business of providing development aid . 
We need a genuine partnership , in which developing countries take the lead , determining what they most acutely need and how best to use it . 
Weak capacity to absorb aid on the part of recipient countries is no excuse for donor-driven and donor-directed assistance . 
The aim should be to help create that capacity . 
Indeed , building human-resource capacity is itself a useful way of fulfilling Goal 8 . 
Doing so would serve donors &quot; interest as well . 
Aligning their assistance with national development strategies and structures , or helping countries devise such strategies and structures , ensures that their aid is usefully spent and guarantees the sustainability of their efforts . 
Donors should support an education policy rather than build a photogenic school ; aid a health campaign rather than construct a glittering clinic ; or do both - but as part of a policy or a campaign , not as stand-alone projects . 
Trade is the other key area . 
In contrast to aid , greater access to the developed world &apos;s markets creates incentives and fosters institutions in the developing world that are self-sustaining , collectively policed , and more consequential for human welfare . 
Many countries are prevented from trading their way out of poverty by the high tariff barriers , domestic subsidies , and other protections enjoyed by their rich-country competitors . 
The European Union &apos;s agricultural subsidies , for example , are high enough to permit every cow in Europe to fly business class around the world . 
What African farmer , despite his lower initial costs , can compete ? 
The onus is not on developed countries alone . 
Developing countries , too , have made serious commitments to their own people , and the primary responsibility for fulfilling those commitments is theirs . 
But Goal 8 assured them that they would not be alone in this effort . 
Unless that changes , the next five years will be a path to failure .
