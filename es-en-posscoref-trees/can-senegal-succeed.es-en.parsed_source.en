Can Senegal Succeed ? 
DAKAR - Senegal &apos;s people are deeply disenchanted . 
In 2000 , they enthusiastically went to the polls to elect Abdoulaye Wade as their president . 
Wade had campaigned as an agent of change , but change never came to Senegal throughout his decade in power . 
Now the only change he wants to make is to the constitution , so that he can retain his hold on power . 
Unfortunately , Wade turned out to be almost a caricature of the dozy African potentate for whom power , nepotism , and embezzlement become indistinguishable . 
So deeply has he identified his and his family &apos;s interests with the state that he appointed his son , Karim Wade , to head four different ministries - international cooperation , air travel , infrastructure , and energy - simultaneously . 
To somehow make young Wade his successor , the 86-year-old president has resorted to every trick in the book . 
He staged a photo opportunity for his designated-heir with Barack Obama during the G-8 meeting in Deauville earlier this year , and followed that up with a trip to Benghazi - his flight escorted by French Mirage fighters - to lambast Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi . 
In doing so , Wade broke ranks with the rest of the African Union , naively expecting to gain French and Western support for his bid to retain power . 
Soon after , he launched his constitutional changes , which Senegalese view as an attempt to enshrine in law his son &apos;s victory in the 2012 presidential election . 
Thousands marched in protest to the National Assembly in June , and the amendment has since been withdrawn . 
Wade &apos;s shortcomings have also hurt Senegal &apos;s economy . 
Annual growth of 1.2 % in the agricultural sector , which employs 60 % of the population , cannot provide for a population that is growing at more than twice that rate . 
And this pathetic performance comes at a time when many African economies &quot; agricultural sectors are booming on the back of high world food prices . 
Senegal under Wade has succeeded in irrigating only 15 % of a planned 250,000 hectares , and now imports some 80 % of the rice that it consumes . 
Fishery resources are over-exploited ; animal husbandry suffers a similar lack of rigorous management ; and the country spends a fortune buying the meat and milk that it could easily produce for itself if farmers had the proper incentives . 
These are just a few examples of the vast misuse of the country &apos;s resources , owing to the marked preference of Senegal &apos;s elite to use import licenses to build up their own fortunes rather than develop import-substitution industries . 
As a result , Senegal , a cosmopolitan country , is missing out on Africa &apos;s best opportunity for growth since de-colonization . 
Indeed , Africa is at a turning point . Since 2000 , its sub-Saharan countries have achieved average economic growth of 5-7 % . 
In 2008 , Africa &apos;s combined economic output reached $ 1.6 trillion , and consumer spending totaled $ 860 billion . 
During the global recession in 2009 , Africa and Asia were the only two regions where GDP rose . 
The International Monetary Fund forecasts 5.5 % GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 , and 6 % growth in 2012 . 
Moreover , Africa now boasts more than 100 homegrown companies with annual revenue of more than $ 1 billion . Banking and retail are flourishing . 
Construction is booming , and foreign investment is surging . 
Telecom firms have signed up 316 million new subscribers since 2000 , more than the entire population of the United States . 
Wade &apos;s inertia is particularly damaging because instability elsewhere in West Africa - civil and foreign wars , coups d &quot; Ã©tat , predatory corruption , and trafficking of all kinds - gives Senegal a chance to position itself as a regional power . 
For example , with sufficient investment , a port at Bargny could serve not only as a West African export base , but also as a processing hub for minerals and a center for the liquefaction of natural gas . 
Such investments would drive a decisive shift from low-productivity to higher-productivity sectors , boosting employment and wages . 
Ghana , a newer democracy than Senegal , is an illuminating example . 
At independence , Senegal &apos;s endowment of infrastructure and human resources was the best in West Africa . 
But five decades of economic mismanagement - first by the Socialist Party for 40 years , and then by Wade &apos;s liberals for the last decade - eroded this heritage . 
Due to its superior infrastructure relative to Senegal , Ghana has attracted many billions of dollars more in foreign investment and records much higher trade volumes . 
With the right governance , Senegal , with its longstanding political stability as a 51-year-old democracy and its strategic position bordering Mauritania , Mali , Guinea and Guinea-Bissau on Africa &apos;s westernmost point , is ideally positioned to serve as the hub for natural-resource development in these countries - and in Burkina Faso , Gambia , and Niger as well . 
The economic benefits of such a strategy for Senegal are potentially vast : new industries in mineral processing , transport , and shipping , bringing higher-value-added employment ; budget revenues from transit fees for minerals exports and pipelines ; and improved infrastructure connecting the country &apos;s rural heartland to Dakar and the coast . 
There is hope that the popular protests of June will help bring Wade to his senses and allow the Senegalese to continue choosing their governments through transparent elections . 
Let us also hope that the next government will realize Senegal &apos;s huge potential as a West African regional economic hub .
