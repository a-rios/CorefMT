The European Banking Disunion 
BRUSSELS - The purpose of the euro was to create fully integrated financial markets ; but , since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008 , markets have been renationalizing . 
So the future of the eurozone depends crucially on whether that trend continues or Europe &apos;s financial markets become fully integrated . 
But either outcome would be preferable to something in between - neither fish nor fowl . 
Unfortunately , that is where the eurozone appears to be headed . 
The trend toward renationalization has been clear . 
Since the end of the credit boom in 2008 , cross-border claims of banks based in the eurozone core ( essentially Germany and its smaller neighbors ) toward the eurozone periphery have plummeted from about â‚¬ 1.6 trillion ( $ 2.2 trillion ) to less than half that amount . 
( Part of the difference has ended up on the European Central Bank &apos;s ( ECB ) balance sheet , but this cannot be a permanent solution . ) 
This trend might well continue until cross-border claims become so small that they are no longer systemically important - as was true before the introduction of the euro . 
At the current pace , this point might be reached within a few years . 
The financial integration brought about by the euro would be largely unwound . 
Officially , renationalization is anathema . 
But it has its benefits . 
The system-wide impact of national shocks is less severe when cross-border debt is low . 
A bank default in any one country would no longer trigger a crisis elsewhere , because any losses would stop at the border . 
Moreover , national banking systems can now separate more easily , because the peripheral countries &quot; current accounts have already achieved a rough balance , with all but Greece expected to record a small external surplus in 2014 . 
With the exception of Greece , the peripheral countries will not need any capital inflows in the near future . 
This is a key development . 
A few years ago , countries like Spain and Portugal were running large current-account deficits and needed capital inflows totaling roughly 10 % of their GDP . 
The breakdown of cross-border bank lending thus represented a powerful negative shock for them . 
But , with current-account surpluses , renationalization of banking , by limiting the international transmission of financial shocks , can be a stabilizing force . 
This is not a theoretical proposition . 
Italian savers , for example , still hold a significant volume of foreign assets ( including German bonds ) , and foreign investors still hold a sizeable share of Italian government bonds . 
But interest rates on longer-term Italian government bonds ( and Italian private-sector borrowing costs ) are about 250 basis points higher than those on the German equivalents ( this is the risk premium ) . 
Under full renationalization , Italian investors would sell their foreign assets and acquire domestic bonds , which would insulate Italy from financial shocks abroad and lower the interest-rate burden for the economy as a whole . 
Meanwhile , foreigners still hold Italian government bonds worth about 30 % of GDP . 
If these bonds were acquired by Italian investors ( who would have to sell an equivalent amount of low-yielding foreign assets ) , Italians would save the equivalent of 0.73 % of their country &apos;s GDP . 
Any risk premium that the Italian government might still have to pay would no longer go to foreigners , but to Italian savers , whose incomes would increase - a net gain for the country . 
Moreover , if Italians held all Italian public debt , any increase in the risk premium would be less burdensome . 
Even if the risk premium doubled , to 500 basis points , the Italian government &apos;s debt-service costs would rise , but the money would be paid to Italian investors ( whose higher incomes could then be taxed away ) . 
The opposite of the renationalization scenario is complete integration of eurozone financial markets . 
Officially , this is the aim of establishing a European banking union . 
With a full banking union , cross-border lending should resume and remain stable , as common institutions would absorb national shocks . 
Interest rates would then converge to a low level , fostering recovery in the periphery and making it easier to stabilize public finances . 
Unfortunately , a full-fledged banking union is unlikely to be achieved anytime soon . 
The ECB is set to take over supervision of the 120 largest banks , which account for the bulk of eurozone banking assets , but the next required steps are already in doubt . 
Most governments de facto oppose a &quot; single resolution mechanism &quot; ( SRM in Brussels jargon ) , because it would mean that they could no longer control their own banks . 
Deposit insurance is not even being considered . 
And there are legal and political obstacles to creating a true common backstop . 
As long as the fiscal backstops for banks remain national , there can be no level playing field . 
In this scenario , integration could at most take the form of &quot; colonization , &quot; under which banks from fiscally strong countries use their lower cost of capital to buy up banks in fiscally weak countries . 
Even in the unlikely event that colonization encountered no political resistance , it would not lead to a very efficient banking system . 
The eurozone thus risks becoming stuck in an unstable status quo , with banks &quot; cross-border claims large enough to transmit national shocks to the entire system , but financial integration not deep enough to ensure that capital flows freely throughout the currency area . 
If a full banking union proves impossible , it might be preferable to let the trend toward renationalization run its course . 
At least the eurozone would get some stability .
