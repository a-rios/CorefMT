Firebombing the Messenger in Armenia 
Late last month , while putting the finishing touches on the next edition of our newspaper , Haykakan Zhamanak ( The Armenian Times ) , we heard an explosion outside our office . 
That explosion was not unanticipated - nor was the announcement by Armenia &apos;s police that the car had caught fire due to technical problems . 
But the real problem is censorship , for the explosion was but the latest offensive in Armenia &apos;s hidden war against the press . 
For us the battle for press freedom began in 1999 , soon after founding our newspaper , then named Oragir ( Diary ) . 
It made an instant impact , but not in the way we hoped . 
Throughout 1999 there were more court cases against Oragir than against all other Armenian media combined since independence in 1991 . 
In one case , the prosecutor &apos;s office brought criminal charges against me as editor-in-chief : I was accused of slandering an Armenian political figure and of insulting a state official . 
As a result , the court sentenced me to one year in prison . 
By a lucky twist , however , on the day the court ruled , Lord Russell Johnston , Chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , was in Armenia . 
Lord Johnston expressed his opinion about my case in his talks with the authorities , which then decided not to send me to prison . 
I remained free , only to be monitored by the police . 
A second trial against our newspaper had worse consequences : a $ 25,000 fine ( a huge sum here ) based on allegations that we had damaged the reputation of the Mika Armenia Company , controlled by the so-called Karabakh clan that helps rule Armenia . 
The court &apos;s verdict was based on falsified documents . 
Following the verdict , bailiffs confiscated our equipment , prohibited the publishing house from printing our newspaper , and , most importantly , seized our business bank accounts , rendering us unable to pay the fine . 
These events were initiated by a court wrangle with Serzh Sargsyan , then the Minister of National Security and Internal Affairs . 
We demanded an apology for his impugning our paper &apos;s reputation ; he accused of us of libel . 
These manipulations worked : Oragir was closed down , which forced us to appear under the name Haykakan Zhamanak . 
When my time under police supervision ended , the prosecutor &apos;s office quickly brought a new criminal case of slander against me . 
This time , Armenia &apos;s chief of civil aviation had sued me . 
Investigations lasted several months , before pressure from international organizations and public opinion forced the prosecutor to drop the charges . 
Later , after his dismissal from his post , that same civil aviation chief confessed that Armenian President Robert Kocharyan had advised him to file his lawsuit . 
At a press conference just hours after my car exploded , I announced my suspicion that the explosion had been organized by Gagik Tsarukyan , an MP nicknamed &quot; Dodi Gago &quot; ( &quot; dod &quot; means stupid in Armenian ) and one of the country &apos;s richest men and a close friend of the president &apos;s family . 
Many Armenians believe that Tsarukyan has carte blanche to do whatever he wants , when he wants . 
Indeed , he even gets to write his own history . 
Indeed , there is something of a taboo on writing about Tsarukyan , and with good reason : not only is he rich , but also he controls an army of obedient skinheads . 
Armenia frequently sees skinheads attacking reporters covering opposition rallies and once severely beating a leading opposition politician . 
Five years ago , Tsarukyan himself led his thugs in a break-in at our office , taking my staff hostage for several hours . 
Recently , after reading some unflattering articles about him in our paper , Tsarukyan tried to invite me to a meeting . 
I refused . 
Armenia &apos;s paramount oligarch fumed . 
He promised to punish me , and that he would act the next time Haykakan Zhamanak criticized any well-known person . 
The car explosion occurred the day after we rebuked Armenia &apos;s Police Chief . 
None of us are surprised that the police are unwilling to investigate my car &apos;s explosion . 
They began to do so only ten days later , when the fire brigade stated that the fire was likely the result of an explosion incited by &quot; outside interference . &quot; 
Such harassment is the everyday stuff of journalism in what Vladimir Putin calls the &quot; post-Soviet space . &quot; 
Armenia may have adopted in 1995 a new Constitution with fine phrases about freedom of speech , but both the petty harassments and the mortal threats of the Soviet era remain . 
Of course , we never believed that press freedom would come easily . 
We understood from the start that we would have to fight for it everyday . 
We will not be defeated . 
An incinerated car is a small price to pay in the battle for freedom .
