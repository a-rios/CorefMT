Horse Trading and Climate Change 
AMSTERDAM - When the panda smiles , the world applauds . 
Or so it seemed after Chinese President Hu Jintao &apos;s recent speech at the United Nations . 
Judging by the way much of the media reported his words , it seemed as if China had actually made an important announcement on cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . 
It hadn &apos;t . 
All President Hu really said was that China would now &quot; endeavour &quot; to curb its carbon emissions by a &quot; notable &quot; margin . 
But how does one measure &quot; endeavour &quot; or &quot; notable &quot; ? 
As someone with close links to the Chinese administration told me when pressed : &quot; What was said was actually pretty meaningless . &quot; 
Indeed , there were no specific targets and , as any China watcher knows , the &quot; greening &quot; of the government is old news . 
Official Chinese policy in recent years has been to make GDP growth greener . 
At least the panda smiled . 
Poor Barack Obama didn &apos;t even have that to offer . 
He offered no pledge to cut emissions in the United States , and , with vote-sapping battles already underway over health-care reform , one wonders how much time and energy Obama will have for environmental imperatives . 
If all the world got out of this UN General Assembly meeting of government leaders was insubstantial rhetoric , the worse news is that it got more of the same at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh . 
As one finance minister told me rather wistfully , when I asked him what had actually been delivered on climate change : &quot; Words , &quot; he said , &quot; just words . &quot; 
Given that there are little more than two months until the Copenhagen summit on climate change , which is supposed to frame the successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol , this is depressing . 
Perhaps the only people not suddenly depressed are those immersed in the negotiations . With more than a thousand points still to be agreed , all the policymakers I &apos;ve spoken to recently say that they cannot see how a meaningful deal can be reached by December in Copenhagen . 
In reality , everyone is gearing up behind the scenes for a &quot; Copenhagen 2 , &quot; and what those involved in the negotiations are calling &quot; an even greater slog . &quot; 
Even if some sort of communiqu√© is cobbled together in December - and countries with elections coming up , such as the United Kingdom , will push for one - it is hard to believe that it will contain sufficient detail or reflect the proper level of commitment to have the impact so desperately needed . 
&quot; Copenhagen 1 &quot; was always bound to fail , partly because - and this may sound strange at first - it is all about climate change . 
Although cuts in CO2 emissions and agreement on funding and finance are necessary goals , the geopolitical reality is that climate change cannot be decoupled from trade or discussions on exchange rates , the IMF , reform of the UN , and so on . 
There is a quid pro quo that no one explicitly talks about but which must be addressed : trade-offs between these negotiations , not just within them . 
Meaningful action on climate change will not be seen until it is agreed within this broader framework . 
This means taking the issue out of its current compartment and being realistic enough to understand that Brazil &apos;s position on cutting down rainforests , for example , will be affected by whether or not it is given a seat on the UN Security Council . 
It means being sophisticated enough to understand that as long as China feels under pressure to stop propping up the renmimbi , it is unlikely to deliver commitments on emissions cuts . 
Widening the scope of the next round of negotiations so that much more can be used as bargaining chips would make the job of the negotiators considerably harder . 
In fact , there is no other way to prevent the process from remaining a zero-sum game . 
Worryingly , &quot; Copenhagen 2 &quot; will not only have to navigate this complicated terrain , but it must do so in less than five years . 
The climate bomb is ticking , and there is a palpable sense of urgency among policymakers . 
For , as the UN &apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has explicitly warned , if emissions do not fall before 2015 , and only fall from then onwards ( and the overall trend is that they have been rising ) , we will reach the point of no return . 
At that point , the Armageddon scenarios of droughts , rising sea levels , floods , energy and resource wars , and mass migration will become a reality . 
Just think of the images of recent storms and floods in the Philippines and Vietnam that displaced and killed thousands , and multiply those horrors manifold . 
That is what we are up against . 
Climate change negotiations are arguably the most important of our lifetime , because their outcome will determine the fate of our planet . 
It is essential that they take place within structures and frameworks that encourage agreement by putting other major multilateral issues up for discussion . 
The world &apos;s governments must be able to trade horses if pandas and presidents are to do more than smile .
