India \ u0027s Bollywood Power 
The world has heard much about India &apos;s extraordinary transformation in recent years , and even of its claims to a share of &quot; world leadership . &quot; Some of that is hyperbole , but in one respect , India &apos;s strength may be understated . 
What makes a country a world leader ? 
Is it population , military strength , or economic development ? 
By all of these measures , India has made extraordinary strides . 
It is on course to overtake China as the world &apos;s most populous country by 2034 , it has the world &apos;s fourth-largest army and nuclear weapons , and it is already the world &apos;s fifth-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity and continues to climb , though too many of its people remain destitute . 
All of these indicators are commonly used to judge a country &apos;s global status . 
However , something much less tangible , but a good deal more valuable in the twenty-first century , may be more important than any of them : India &apos;s &quot; soft power . &quot; 
Take Afghanistan , for instance - a major security concern for India , as it is for the world . 
But India &apos;s greatest asset there doesn &apos;t come out of a military mission : it doesn &apos;t have one . 
It comes from one simple fact : don &apos;t try to telephone an Afghan at 8 : 30 in the evening . 
That &apos;s when the Indian TV soap opera &quot; Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi &quot; , dubbed into Dari , is telecast on Tolo TV , and no one wishes to miss it . 
&quot; Saas &quot; is the most popular television show in Afghan history , with a 90 % audience penetration . 
It &apos;s considered directly responsible for a spike in the sale of generator sets and even for absences from religious functions which clash with its broadcast times . 
&quot; Saas &quot; has so thoroughly captured the public imagination in Afghanistan that , in this deeply conservative Islamic country where family problems are often literally hidden behind the veil , it &apos;s an Indian TV show that has come to dominate ( and sometimes to justify ) public discussion of family issues . 
That &apos;s soft power , and its particular strength is that it has nothing to do with government propaganda . 
The movies of Bollywood , which is bringing its glitzy entertainment far beyond the Indian diaspora in the United States and the United Kingdom , offer another example . 
A Senegalese friend told me of his illiterate mother who takes a bus to Dakar every month to watch a Bollywood film - she doesn &apos;t understand the Hindi dialogue and can &apos;t read the French subtitles , but she can still catch the spirit of the films and understand the story , and people like her look at India with stars in their eyes as a result . 
An Indian diplomat in Damascus a few years ago told me that the only publicly displayed portraits as big as those of then-President Hafez al-Assad were of the Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan . 
Indian art , classical music and dance have the same effect . 
So does the work of Indian fashion designers , now striding across the world &apos;s runways . 
Indian cuisine , spreading around the world , raises Indian culture higher in people &apos;s reckoning ; the way to foreigners &quot; hearts is through their palates . 
In England today , Indian curry houses employ more people than the iron and steel , coal and shipbuilding industries combined . 
When a bhangra beat is infused into a Western pop record or an Indian choreographer invents a fusion of kathak and ballet ; when Indian women sweep the Miss World and Miss Universe contests , or when &quot; Monsoon Wedding &quot; wows the critics and &quot; Lagaan &quot; claims an Oscar nomination ; when Indian writers win the Booker or Pulitzer Prizes , India &apos;s soft power is enhanced . 
Likewise , when Americans speak of the IITs , India &apos;s technology institutes , with the same reverence they accord to MIT , and the &quot; Indianness &quot; of engineers and software developers is taken as synonymous with mathematical and scientific excellence , India gains in respect . 
In the information age , as Joseph Nye , the guru of soft power , argues , it is not the side with the bigger army , but the side with the better story , that wins . 
India is already the &quot; land of the better story . &quot; 
As a pluralist society with a free and thriving mass media , creative energies that express themselves in a variety of appealing ways , and a democratic system that promotes and protects diversity , India has an extraordinary ability to tell stories that are more persuasive and attractive than those of its rivals . 
And there &apos;s the international spin-off of India just being itself . 
India &apos;s remarkable pluralism was on display after national elections in May 2004 , when a leader with a Roman Catholic background ( Sonia Gandhi ) made way for a Sikh ( Manmohan Singh ) to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim ( President Abdul Kalam ) - in a country that is 81 % Hindu . 
No strutting nationalist chauvinism could ever have accomplished for India &apos;s standing in the world what that one moment did - all the more so since it was not directed at the world . 
There &apos;s still much for India to do to ensure that its people are healthy , well fed , and secure . 
Progress is being made : the battle against poverty is slowly ( too slowly ) being won . 
But India &apos;s greatest prospects for winning admiration in the twenty-first century may lie not in what it does , but simply in what it is .
