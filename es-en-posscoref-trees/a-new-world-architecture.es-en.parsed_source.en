A New World Architecture 
NEW YORK - Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism , the world is facing another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization : international capitalism and state capitalism . 
The former , represented by the United States , has broken down , and the latter , represented by China , is on the rise . 
Following the path of least resistance will lead to the gradual disintegration of the international financial system . 
A new multilateral system based on sounder principles must be invented . 
While international cooperation on regulatory reform is difficult to achieve on a piecemeal basis , it may be attainable in a grand bargain that rearranges the entire financial order . 
A new Bretton Woods conference , like the one that established the post-WWII international financial architecture , is needed to establish new international rules , including treatment of financial institutions that are too big to fail and the role of capital controls . 
It would also have to reconstitute the International Monetary Fund to reflect better the prevailing pecking order among states and to revise its methods of operation . 
In addition , a new Bretton Woods would have to reform the currency system . 
The post-war order , which made the US more equal than others , produced dangerous imbalances . 
The dollar no longer enjoys the trust and confidence that it once did , yet no other currency can take its place . 
The US ought not to shy away from wider use of IMF Special Drawing Rights . 
Because SDRs are denominated in several national currencies , no single currency would enjoy an unfair advantage . 
The range of currencies included in the SDRs would have to be widened , and some of the newly added currencies , including the renminbi , may not be fully convertible . This would , however , allow the international community to press China to abandon its exchange-rate peg to the dollar and would be the best way to reduce international imbalances . 
And the dollar could still remain the preferred reserve currency , provided it is prudently managed . 
One great advantage of SDRs is that they permit the international creation of money , which is particularly useful at times like the present . 
The money could be directed to where it is most needed , unlike what is happening currently . 
A mechanism that allows rich countries that don &apos;t need additional reserves to transfer their allocations to those that do is readily available , using the IMF &apos;s gold reserves . 
Reorganizing the world order will need to extend beyond the financial system and involve the United Nations , especially membership of the Security Council . 
That process needs to be initiated by the US , but China and other developing countries ought to participate as equals . 
They are reluctant members of the Bretton Woods institutions , which are dominated by countries that are no longer dominant . 
The rising powers must be present at the creation of this new system in order to ensure that they will be active supporters . 
The system cannot survive in its present form , and the US has more to lose by not being in the forefront of reforming it . 
The US is still in a position to lead the world , but , without far-sighted leadership , its relative position is likely to continue to erode . 
It can no longer impose its will on others , as George W. Bush &apos;s administration sought to do , but it could lead a cooperative effort to involve both the developed and the developing world , thereby reestablishing American leadership in an acceptable form . 
The alternative is frightening , because a declining superpower losing both political and economic dominance but still preserving military supremacy is a dangerous mix . 
We used to be reassured by the generalization that democratic countries seek peace . 
After the Bush presidency , that rule no longer holds , if it ever did . 
In fact , democracy is in deep trouble in America . 
The financial crisis has inflicted hardship on a population that does not like to face harsh reality . 
President Barack Obama has deployed the &quot; confidence multiplier &quot; and claims to have contained the recession . 
If Obama fails , the next administration will be sorely tempted to create some diversion from troubles at home - at great peril to the world . 
Obama has the right vision . 
He believes in international cooperation , rather than the might-is-right philosophy of the Bush-Cheney era . 
The emergence of the G-20 as the primary forum of international cooperation and the peer-review process agreed in Pittsburgh 
What is lacking , however , is a general recognition that the system is broken and needs to be reinvented . 
After all , the financial system did not collapse altogether , and the Obama administration made a conscious decision to revive banks with hidden subsidies rather than to recapitalize them on a compulsory basis . 
Those institutions that survived will hold a stronger market position than ever , and they will resist a systematic overhaul . 
Obama is preoccupied by many pressing problems , and reinventing the international financial system is unlikely to receive his full attention . 
China &apos;s leadership needs to be even more far-sighted than Obama is . 
China is replacing the American consumer as the motor of the world economy . Since it is a smaller motor , the world economy will grow slower , but China &apos;s influence will rise very fast . 
For the time being , the Chinese public is willing to subordinate its individual freedom to political stability and economic advancement . 
But that may not continue indefinitely - and the rest of the world will never subordinate its freedom to the prosperity of the Chinese state . 
As China becomes a world leader , it must transform itself into a more open society that the rest of the world is willing to accept as a world leader . Military power relations being what they are , China has no alternative to peaceful , harmonious development . Indeed , the future of the world depends on it .
