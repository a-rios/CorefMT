Is Gordon Brown Electable ? 
Gordon Brown obviously wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister . 
But it is less obvious that he is willing to do what is necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the next general election . 
In some critical sense , he must repudiate Blair &apos;s legacy , which , at a minimum , means promising to take Britain out of the Iraq War . 
Brown has longed to be prime minister ever since May 12 , 1994 , the fateful day when John Smith , the Labour Party &apos;s leader in opposition , dropped dead of a heart attack . 
Two weeks later , on May 31 , Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London , and debated who should take over the party leadership . 
By the end of their discussion , they had made a double deal : Brown would stand aside and support Blair as the next party leader ; in return , Blair would later give up the leadership to him . 
Crucially , but inevitably , they did not agree when , or under what circumstances , Blair would fulfil his side of the bargain . 
Inevitably , they could not foresee that Blair would go on to win an unprecedented three successive election victories for Labour , in 1997 , 2001 , and 2005 , and thus keep Labour in power for a record-breaking period of possibly as long as 13 years . 
The key challenge for New Labour ( as Blair re-styled it with his characteristic gift for spin ) , was the management of the British economy . 
Since World War II , most British governments tried to manipulate the economy for short-term party advantage , usually with disastrous long-term results . 
This lamentable tradition was common to both Conservatives and Labour ; and yet , unfairly , it was the Labour Party that was most contaminated by the smear that it could not be trusted to manage the economy . 
Brown decisively changed that reputation . 
He has been probably the most outstanding Chancellor of the Exchequer in British history , not because of any inspiration or genius , but simply because he has built on a new tradition of prioritizing low inflation , low interest rates , and stable government finances . 
Brown understood that these priorities were essential , not just for the British economy , but also for the long-term prospects of Labour in power ; and he entrenched this agenda by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility for keeping inflation low . 
As a result , Britain has had an unprecedented decade of low inflation and relatively high economic growth , outperforming many of its European counterparts . 
Yet , despite economic success , it became steadily clearer that Blair &apos;s time was running out . 
The electorate grew increasingly disillusioned with the unavoidable shortcomings of an over-familiar government , and the party grew increasingly discontented with a leader who had outstayed his welcome . 
At first , Blair thought that he could claim the right to remain in power for a third full five-year term . 
But the pressure on him to go has steadily risen , to the point where he has now almost promised to give up in the summer of 2007 . 
But no one knows exactly when , or how , Blair will step down . 
If there is a formal leadership contest , it seems likely that several rival candidates will aim to stand . 
But almost all authoritative observers seem to agree that Brown is by far the most likely man to be the next Labour prime minister . 
That is the easy part . 
From that point on , no one seems certain whether Brown knows what to do , or has what it takes , to fight and win another general election for Labour . 
His reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged , but he has given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies . 
He has remained dour and almost silent , visibly chafing with impatience to come into his inheritance , but offering no hint of what difference he would make when he does . 
The one thing he cannot do is promises to continue Blair &apos;s policies . 
If Brown offers more of the same , he will lose . 
After ten years of Blair , he must offer one or more policies that mark a clear break . 
The most obvious candidate for such a policy switch is Iraq : if Brown wants to win an election as Labour leader , he must renounce Blair &apos;s policy and announce the withdrawal , in short order , of British troops . 
In tactical terms , this should be easy and obvious : whatever the deceitful and illegal reasons originally given for invading Iraq , everyone now knows that this war has proved a political , strategic , and moral catastrophe . 
Everyone knows that it cannot be &quot; won , &quot; whatever that means , and Brown knows that both the war and Britain &apos;s servile subordination to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in Britain . 
This is the issue that is crying out to be addressed : but so far none of the main political parties has dared touch it . 
In the past three weeks , Labour , the Liberal Democrats , and the Conservatives have all held their annual conferences . 
All of them concentrated on domestic policies ; none dared discuss Iraq , because they all know that to do so would raise the question of withdrawal , which in turn would unleash a major and possibly explosive debate about Britain &apos;s relationship with the US . 
Does Brown have the stomach to take on the risks involved in confronting the Iraq question ? 
Possibly not . 
He may decide that it is too difficult , in which case he will be a lame duck prime minister , condemned to serve out the three years remaining in Labour &apos;s current term with no hope of winning the next election . 
That is not what he planned when he struck his bargain with Blair back in 1994 .
