The Clean-Energy Moonshot 
NEW YORK - In May 1961 , President John F. Kennedy stirred America and the world with these words : &quot; I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth . &quot; 
Just eight years later , NASA did just that - with astounding benefits for science , technology , and the world economy . 
Now , a group of leading scientists , innovators , and economists has identified our era &apos;s moonshot : to replace fossil fuels with clean-energy technologies within this generation . 
Since a group of policy leaders from the United Kingdom initiated the Global Apollo Programme to Combat Climate Change earlier this year , I and many others have enthusiastically signed on . 
The program , named after the NASA moon mission , is built on the idea of &quot; directed technological change . &quot; 
In other words , through a conscious effort , backed by public funds , we can steer the development of the advanced technologies needed to ensure humanity &apos;s safety and wellbeing . 
At the top of the list is clean energy , which will enable us to head off the global warming caused by the combustion of massive amounts of coal , oil , and gas worldwide . 
The Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project ( DDPP ) has demonstrated that a low-carbon future is within reach , with huge benefits at a very modest cost . 
In the United States , for example , cutting emissions by 80 % by 2050 is not only feasible ; it would require added outlays of only around 1 % of GDP per year . 
And the benefits - including a safer climate , smarter infrastructure , better vehicles , and cleaner air - would be massive . 
Pathways to a low-carbon future focus on three main actions : improving energy efficiency , producing electricity from low-carbon energy sources ( such as solar and wind energy ) , and switching from petroleum to low-carbon energy for powering vehicles ( such as electric or fuel-cell vehicles ) and heating buildings . 
These are clear and achievable goals , and the public sector should play a major role in advancing them . 
Politicians need to end subsidies for coal , oil , and gas , and start taxing emissions from their use . 
Moreover , they must meet the need for new power lines to carry low-carbon solar , wind , geothermal , and hydroelectric power from remote areas ( and offshore platforms ) to population centers . 
But meeting these requirements presupposes advances in technologies that will enable low-carbon energy systems to compete with the alternatives . 
That is where the Apollo Programme comes in , with its bold goal of reducing the cost of renewable energy to below that of coal , oil , and gas . 
Of course , renewable energy is sometimes already cheaper than fossil fuels - when the sun is shining bright or the wind is blowing strong and consistently . 
The main challenge with renewables is energy storage , in two senses . 
First , we need to store renewable energy for use in vehicles in a low-cost and efficient way . 
While we already have high-quality electric vehicles , they require improvements in range and cost to be able to outcompete conventional vehicles . 
The highest technological priority is to develop batteries for transport that are cheaper , longer-lasting , faster-charging , and lighter . 
Second , we need to store intermittent energy for times when the wind is not blowing , the sun is not shining , and rivers are not flowing strongly enough to turn hydroelectric turbines . 
Many energy-storage technologies are already in use or in development . 
One example is pumped hydropower , in which excess wind and solar energy is used to pump water uphill into reservoirs that can later produce hydroelectric power . 
Another is the conversion of renewable energy into hydrogen ( by splitting water molecules ) or a synthetic liquid fuel made with carbon dioxide from the air . 
Others include compressed air and large-scale battery storage . 
Low-carbon technologies can be improved markedly in many other areas as well . 
Power grids running on renewables need more sophisticated systems for balancing energy supply and demand . 
Improvements in carbon capture and storage technologies would enable some fossil fuels to be used safely . 
And nuclear power plant designs can be made safer with passive ( automatic ) safety systems and fuel cycles that leave behind less radioactive waste and fissile material that could be turned into weapons . 
Given the trillions of dollars of potential losses from human-induced climate change , and the trillions of dollars invested annually in global energy systems , the world &apos;s governments would be wise to invest tens of billions of dollars each year in the research and development needed to achieve a low-carbon energy future . 
With this in mind , more than one politician should have already followed in JFK &apos;s footsteps , stepping forward to announce this generation &apos;s critical moonshot , and to offer the public finances needed to make it happen . 
So far , none has . 
In the US , for example , the government allocates around $ 31 billion per year to biomedical research ( with great returns to health ) , and roughly $ 65 billion per year for military R &amp; D , but only about $ 7 billion per year for non-defense energy , and , of that , less than $ 2 billion per year for renewable-energy R &amp; D. This is a shocking lapse on two counts : first , the US and the world are losing time on decarbonization ; and , second , the US is squandering the chance to develop its own future high-tech industries . 
Together , the Apollo Programme and the DDPP point the world &apos;s governments toward the agreement they should reach at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris this December . 
First , governments should pledge to decarbonize their economies in order to keep global warming below the extreme danger zone of two degrees Celsius . 
Second , they should promise to unveil , in the next couple of years , national &quot; pathways &quot; to deep decarbonization by 2050 . 
And , third , they should join together to fund the new global moonshot for clean energy . 
The pooled financing should start with a minimum of $ 15 billion per year , and rise sharply thereafter , as key , high-return technology breakthroughs come into view . 
As JFK showed , great progress begins with a great goal , one that is bold yet feasible . 
The goal today , backed by the Apollo Programme , is deep decarbonization . 
It is time for world leaders to commit to the planet-saving clean-energy moonshot .
