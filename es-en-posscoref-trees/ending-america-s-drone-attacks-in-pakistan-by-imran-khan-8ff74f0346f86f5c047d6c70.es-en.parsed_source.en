Ground the Drones in 2013 
LAHORE - Although 2012 saw an accelerating drawdown of United States and NATO forces &quot; in Afghanistan , a grim aspect of that decade-long war - reliance on air strikes by unmanned drones - continued unabated . 
Indeed , those attacks were stepped up , with America &apos;s use of drone warfare in Pakistan reaching an unprecedented height over the past year . 
With President Barack Obama re-elected and no longer facing the pressure of a campaign , it would be in America &apos;s interest - and certainly in the interests of my country , Pakistan - to use the first year of his new term to de-escalate the violence . 
America &apos;s drone strikes in Pakistan reflect an arrogant frame of mind that fails to distinguish between the guilty and the innocent , between the perpetrator and the afflicted , and between the criminal and the aggrieved . 
By banishing all trappings of justice , this mindset is oblivious to the suffering of the peace-loving civilians who comprise the vast majority of those living in Pakistan &apos;s tribal areas . 
The US drone strikes have left behind a long trail of death of innocent civilians , with no one being held accountable . 
These remote-controlled flying machines are programmed to decimate , brutally and indiscriminately . 
It is shameful that a country known for its democratic values and its unparalleled commitment to human freedom should stoop so low as to kill innocent men , women , and children . 
As a result , instead of winning hearts and minds , the US , with the constant humming of killer drones in the air , is driving fear into every living soul in the tribal areas . 
Indeed , the bloody irony is that the strategy is utterly counter-productive ; the people of the tribal areas , with their warrior past , end up joining the militants , justifying their actions as jihad against the forces occupying Afghanistan and their helpers in Pakistan . 
Indeed , according to a recent report by researchers at New York University School of Law and Stanford Law School , the people in the areas targeted by the drone campaign are being systematically terrorized . 
The drone strategy constitutes a campaign of terror - highly effective terror in which even funerals of drone victims have been targeted . 
In one particularly notorious case , 40 maliks ( tribal leaders ) holding a jirga ( tribal assembly ) were burned in an indiscriminate attack . 
Alongside many luminaries around the world , former US President Jimmy Carter has condemned Obama &apos;s barbaric drone policy . 
But the complicity of Pakistan &apos;s government is equally reprehensible . 
According to WikiLeaks , former Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani approved the US drone strikes , saying : &quot; I don &apos;t care if they do it as long as they get the right people . 
We &apos;ll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it . &quot; 
President Asif Ali Zardari went even further , saying that he did not care about the &quot; collateral damage . &quot; 
So Pakistan &apos;s government has failed in its principal responsibility , enshrined in its constitution , to safeguard the lives and property of its citizens , as well as the country &apos;s security and sovereignty . 
More than 40,000 citizens have been killed since the beginning of the US war in Afghanistan , because Pakistan &apos;s government criminally collaborates with forces that facilitated its rise to power . 
And , in the face of ongoing military operations , most schools in Waziristan have remain closed for the past 7 years , depriving a generation of children of education and opportunity . 
The road to peace in South Asia runs through restive Waziristan . 
Despite countless sacrifices in the face of the drone strikes &quot; arbitrary cruelty , the resolve of the tribal areas &quot; people remains undented . 
While they continue to seek peace , they are not willing to compromise their honor and self-respect , however daunting the challenges they confront . 
The true face of their cultural patrimony and proud traditions must be brought to the world &apos;s attention , so that their dream of peace with honor can be realized . 
But this can happen only when the US and Pakistani governments disengage from their &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
Indeed , only when Pakistan is no longer perceived as fighting a US war will local militants stop thinking of the conflict as a jihad against foreign intervention . 
Peace will come when the tribal people , in their hundreds and thousands , no longer see a reason to fight . 
In short , the drone strikes constitute a flawed policy that has only strengthened anti-US sentiment and the forces of extremism in Pakistan . 
America &apos;s killing machines have failed to subjugate the area &apos;s proud people - a failure that underlies the US decision to withdraw from Afghanistan by 2014 . 
I believe that the withdrawal should come even sooner , so that the US can avoid leaving behind a legacy of animosity that may continue to haunt it for generations . 
Only a rapid change of course by the Obama administration in 2013 can begin to counteract the enmity toward the US that has been generated by more than a decade of its forces &quot; lethal presence in the region . 
America &apos;s drone war , with its wanton destruction of families and communities , is deepening that antipathy . 
To get peace in Afghanistan , indeed all of South Asia , the US needs to give peace a chance !
