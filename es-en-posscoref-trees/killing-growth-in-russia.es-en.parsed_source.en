Killing Growth in Russia 
I want Russia to be a boring country - at least for the next few decades . 
In the twentieth century , Russia set an unquestionable record for all sorts of upheavals and social experiments that attracted the world &apos;s attention . 
A time-out is essential . 
This objective seemed to be entirely within reach - or at least possible - until the first half of 2003 . 
Foreign correspondents accredited in Moscow complained that nothing was happening in Putin &apos;s Russia . 
Investment in the Russian economy was growing fast . 
Unfortunately , Russia &apos;s rulers are not accustomed to leaving the country and the rest of the world for long without something surprising to gawk at . 
Instilling a feeling of insecurity is the best way to scare your population into submission and frighten away potential investors . 
How democratic or undemocratic a regime is usually doesn &apos;t bother investors . 
All they need and care about is stable , predictable rules . 
Indeed , the watchword among major investors is inertia . 
It takes time to reach a decision on whether or not to invest in a project , and once an investment decision is made , it becomes rather difficult to stop the process quickly . 
Russia &apos;s government is now doing its best to prove that , while difficult , it is possible to defy the laws of business physics and kill investments that are already in the pipeline . 
When Mikhail Khodorkovsky and other executives of Yukos , his oil company , were arrested last year , corporations investing or interested in investing in Russia were prepared to interpret the crackdown as an isolated incident brought on by the political agenda of the company and its CEO , who should have known better . 
Never mind that by the second half of 2003 , it had become obvious that the government intended to use legal means - in the form of massive tax claims - to destroy the company . 
When only one company faced legal and financial problems , investors who had made a decision to put their money in Russia were ready to ignore this kind of development . 
&quot; This must be an exception , &quot; they kept repeating , like a mantra or a prayer . 
I &apos;ve heard something similar when Russian problems are discussed : &quot; Just finish this Yukos affair . 
We don &apos;t care how it goes , just put an end to it . &quot; 
Unfortunately , the genie has been let out of the bottle . 
Throughout 2004 , it became abundantly clear that Russia &apos;s internal security apparatus had gained the upper hand in deciding how to manage economic and political problems . 
Security structures developed a taste for this kind of work , and welcomed new responsibilities . 
In many ways , they began to see fighting big business as akin to fighting terrorists . 
And , indeed , they share one thing in common : the fight never ends . 
More and more tax claims are being produced , and not only against Yukos . 
Tax claims against the telecommunications company Vympelkom ( one of Russia &apos;s leading firms , and the first to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 90 years ) send an unambiguous signal to investors : no one is safe . 
In fact , official documents have now even started questioning the legitimacy of the privatization of the leading Russian companies in the 1990 &quot; s , which has opened the way for discussions about revising the outcomes of these privatizations . 
Similarly , British Petroleum , which has invested more in Russia than any other company to date , has recently discovered that its rights to the Kovytkino gas field are not guaranteed at all . This property , it now seems , could be reclaimed by the state at any moment . 
It would be wrong to draw long-term conclusions from short-term economic information , even if this information confirms reality . 
The alarming tendencies we are seeing today may be short-lived and with no serious consequences . 
Post-socialist growth is a process that cannot ( and should not ) be easily stopped . 
If , however , the authorities continue their efforts to destabilize the Russian economy , today &apos;s disturbing tendencies may actually take root . 
Russia can then forget about attaining the fast , sustainable growth that China has achieved . 
Instead , we Russians will find ourselves trying to avert an impending economic crisis . 
Of course , no one can predict when such a crisis might occur . 
But one thing is certain : we will know which path the country &apos;s leaders have chosen sooner rather than later . 
Indeed , this year could be Russia &apos;s most fateful yet .
