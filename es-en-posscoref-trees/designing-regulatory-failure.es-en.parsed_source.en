Designing Regulatory Failure 
PRAGUE - At the close of last year , European Union finance ministers gave the green light to a new supervisory architecture for the EU &apos;s financial markets . 
Now it is up to the European Parliament to address this hypersensitive issue , the most controversial part of which is the powers and responsibilities to be given to the three new pan-European supervisory agencies for banking , securities , and insurance . 
The parliament &apos;s decision will be far-reaching , and will affect European finance for many years to come . 
Although some complain that December &apos;s compromise on financial regulation does not go far enough , there is a case to be made that the opposite is true . 
The springboard for this fundamental policy shift was the report issued in early 2009 by former French central banker and IMF chief Jacques de Larosière . 
But his report ignored many vital issues that were then largely overlooked in the subsequent debate on financial reform . 
As the crisis that began in 2008 has shown , there are too many , rather than too few , supervisory and regulatory institutions overseeing European financial markets - almost 70 in the EU as a whole . 
De Larosière and the political debate he fostered completely gave up on first simplifying and consolidating institutions at the national level , and only then perhaps building a supranational body on that pared-down foundation . 
Instead , we are starting directly with what will be entirely new Europe-wide institutions . 
This is a classic bureaucratic response : faced with a problem , create a new institution . 
What a mistake . 
If we merely add new institutions to EU countries &quot; already Byzantine arrangements , we will fail to address the effectiveness , flexibility , and smoothness of information transfer through the EU-level supervisory system . 
Recall the beginnings of the crisis : the British bank Northern Rock , for example , is now seen as a notorious example of how poor communication and information sharing among just three national authorities can easily make matters worse . 
We need to start with national supervisors ( as Germany wisely does ) , and then go to the European level if necessary , not the other way round . 
The new regulatory model also fails to address a persistent weakness of the single European financial market : how to pay the costs ( or &quot; share the burden &quot; ) when a multinational bank fails . 
A systemic solution must precede , not follow , the creation of new European institutions . 
We Europeans may proudly say that we have a single financial market , but it is configured for good times only . 
In bad times , it is national taxpayers who pay for any financial-sector trouble , because there is no pan-European taxpayer or plausible burden-sharing models . 
But it will be difficult to move forward without one . 
Last June , it was agreed at the EU level that European institutions &quot; decisions should not impinge on member states &quot; control of fiscal policy . 
How this can be reconciled with pan-European regulation is hard to say . 
Many of the decisions to be taken by the new European institutions may imply costs that will emerge only much later . 
There is an interesting paradox here . 
Many day-to-day cross-border services , ranging from freight transport to hairdressing , face major barriers and restrictions . 
Yet if the provider of such a service goes bankrupt or runs into difficulties , there is little likelihood that any national government would be called on to bail it out . 
After all , how many &quot; systemically important &quot; hauliers are there ? 
By contrast , banks and others can use European &quot; passports &quot; to provide financial services - which do have significant public-finance implications - throughout the EU.That is a nice idea , but it is half-baked : it fails to specify which taxpayers should be on the hook if something goes wrong and savers want their money back , as with the Icelandic banks in the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , or even Switzerland . 
With these crucial issues unresolved , we are creating a Europe-wide system that violates the golden rule of any institutional design : decisions should be made by those who bear responsibility and who ultimately must pay . 
With too much power at the European level , national authorities will be answerable to their citizens and be forced to foot the bill , yet they will lack power . 
Conversely , the European institutions will bear neither the costs nor the responsibility , but will make the decisions . 
How disturbing , then , that these institutions &quot; powers may be increased still further . 
The three new agencies will not only enforce common technical standards , which may eventually become binding throughout the EU if endorsed by the European Commission , but will also be allowed to settle disputes between national supervisors . 
More important , should the Council declare a state of financial emergency - such as the one we are in currently - the EU agencies might exceptionally be given a position of predominance over national supervisory authorities . 
Needless to say , &quot; disputes &quot; and &quot; emergencies &quot; are exactly the future situations likely to matter most to national policymakers and taxpayers . 
If decisions about systemically important national financial institutions are made at the European level in good times , while in bad times national taxpayers pick up the tab , the whole EU will lose . 
In good times , we probably would not be able to tell the difference , but the grim reality is that such an arrangement would be unlikely to prevent another crisis . 
Why , then is the EU building the house from the roof down ?
