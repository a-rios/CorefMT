Europe &apos;s Three Fault Lines 
PARIS - Ten or 20 years ago , the existential question facing the European Union was whether it still had a purpose in a globalized world . 
The question today is whether the EU can respond effectively to major external shocks . 
Europe &apos;s neighborhood is poor and dangerous . 
South of Gibraltar , income per capita drops more than fivefold . 
War has recently raged in Ukraine . 
The Israel-Palestine conflict has continued for more than 50 years . 
And the war in Iraq barely ended before the mayhem in Syria commenced . 
For several decades after World War II , Europe could afford to overlook what went on beyond its borders : security was the business of the United States . 
But things have changed . 
The US retreat from Iraq signaled the limits of its engagement , and the problems in the EU &apos;s immediate neighborhood - not just in Syria , but also to the east and the south - are now knocking on its door . 
So it would seem that the EU &apos;s top priority should be to protect itself and help stabilize its environment . 
Yet three internal fault lines are making it difficult for the EU to achieve these ends . 
Britain is wondering whether it should exit . 
Western and Eastern Europe are at odds over the refugee crisis . 
And France and Germany differ on priorities . 
Britain &apos;s torment over EU membership is rooted in history : In 1946 , Winston Churchill famously advocated a United States of Europe - but without Britain . 
Yet there is little substance to British Europhobia : nothing fundamental separates the United Kingdom from the rest of the continent . 
Tellingly , the British Foreign Office &apos;s rigorous review of how the EU operates did not deliver an agenda for the repatriation of competences . 
The only significant demand expressed by Prime Minister David Cameron in his recent letter to the EU concerns internal migration . 
Britain , the erstwhile champion of labor mobility , has now become wary of foreign workers and wants to limit their access to social benefits . 
This is a potential sticking point in the UK-EU relationship ; but it is hardly a reason to end a four-decade-old partnership . 
Polls suggest that Britain &apos;s referendum on continued EU membership , which Cameron has promised to hold by the end of 2017 , will be a close call . 
But it would be both a blunder and a tragedy were Britons to vote for &quot; Brexit &quot; as a form of protection against tumult on the continent . 
The second fault line appeared alongside the refugee crisis . 
By 2014 , the EU &apos;s &quot; big bang &quot; enlargement in 2004 could be hailed as a success story , having contributed significantly to swift and peaceful economic and political transition in Central and Eastern Europe . 
True European unification seemed to be in the making . 
Yet the refugee crisis has revealed that the EU &apos;s western and eastern members do not share the same concept of a nation . 
Most Western European countries have converged , at least de facto , on a non-ethnic , non-religious definition . 
This has not been an easy transformation , and there are differences in countries &quot; perceived ability to absorb more immigrants ; but the change is irreversible . 
Most Central and Eastern European countries , however , object . 
His Slovak counterpart , Robert Fico , announced in July that his country would accept only Christian refugees . 
Earlier this month , Czech President Miloš Zeman addressed a group called the Bloc Against Islam , telling its supporters that they were &quot; not extremists . &quot; 
And Poland &apos;s new European affairs minister , Konrad Szymanski , did not wait 24 hours after the Paris attacks before using them to denounce Europe &apos;s flaws . 
This is not a disagreement over policies . 
In Germany , especially , any person persecuted on political grounds has a constitutional right to asylum . 
Contrary to common misperceptions , German Chancellor Angela Merkel acted on the basis of moral values , not demographic self-interest , in letting in about one million refugees this year . 
Germany rarely expects solidarity from its European partners . 
At the height of the migrant crisis , it hoped , for once , to receive some . 
The public , categorical rejection of Germany &apos;s silent plea by countries that continue to benefit massively from European solidarity will not be easily forgotten . 
The third fault line lies between France and Germany . 
Since the November 13 attacks in Paris , security has become the overriding French objective . 
This divide is more circumstantial than essential . 
Terrorism may spread to Germany , and refugees may move across borders . 
Yet , at least for the time being , public concerns and government priorities differ . 
Both Merkel and French President François Hollande have expressed a commitment to mutual support . 
France will welcome some refugees , and Germany will dispatch some troops to Mali . 
But symbolic gestures are not enough . 
The risk remains that each country feels that it has been left alone at a critical juncture . 
More ambitious initiatives have been proposed . 
Sigmar Gabriel and Emmanuel Macron , the German and French economy ministers , recently called for a common fund to address Europe &apos;s refugee and security challenges and to finance joint policies . 
The fund would serve as a concrete risk-sharing mechanism and would be a modest , yet meaningful step toward overcoming the deadlock over EU initiatives , if not toward mutualizing defense and security , as some scholars recommend . 
Whatever form it takes , greater boldness is clearly needed . 
Otherwise , the failure to address common risks and challenges may well result in citizens placing exclusive faith in the nation-state , rejecting solidarity , and calling for the permanent restoration of national borders . 
It is no accident that the EU &apos;s three fault lines have appeared at the very moment when it is confronted with unprecedented challenges . 
External pressures reveal internal weaknesses . 
Europe can either overcome them or succumb to them . 
The EU &apos;s twin refugee and security crises constitute its moment of truth .
