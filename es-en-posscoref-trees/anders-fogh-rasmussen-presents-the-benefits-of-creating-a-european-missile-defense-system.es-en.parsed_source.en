NATO &apos;s New Frontier 
BRUSSELS - Last week , an American ship sailed into a Spanish naval base , making history . 
The arrival of the USS Donald Cook from Norfolk , Virginia , to its new home port in Rota , on Spain &apos;s Atlantic coast , marks the first time that a US Navy ship equipped with the high-tech Aegis ballistic missile-defense system will be permanently based in Europe . 
The USS Donald Cook is the first of four US Navy destroyers that , with around 1,200 sailors and personnel , will play a central role in NATO &apos;s missile-defense capability . 
But the ships will carry out many other tasks as well , such as maritime security operations , bilateral and multilateral training exercises , and participation in NATO operations and deployments , including the Standing NATO Maritime Groups . 
The arrival of the USS Donald Cook marks a step forward for NATO , for European security , and for transatlantic cooperation . 
It clearly demonstrates the strength of the bond between America and Europe in dealing with the complex and unpredictable security challenges of our age . 
Steady progress has been made since November 2010 , when , at its Lisbon summit , NATO decided to develop a missile-defense capability to protect all NATO European populations , territory , and forces . 
In April 2012 , at its summit in Chicago , NATO announced an interim capability as an operationally significant first step . 
The purpose of NATO &apos;s missile-defense system is to defend Europe against a real threat . 
At least 30 countries around the world either have ballistic missiles or are trying to acquire them . 
The know-how needed to build them is spreading , and their range is increasing , with some from outside the Euro-Atlantic region already capable of targeting European cities . 
The USS Donald Cook and the three other US destroyers have advanced sensor capabilities and interceptors that can detect and shoot down ballistic missiles directed at Europe . 
In the future , other important components of the missile-defense system will include additional radars , sensors , and interceptors - and more ships . 
Already , thanks to the US European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense , NATO can rely on a powerful radar based in Turkey . 
Work has already begun on construction of a land-based interceptor and radar site in Romania . 
Poland has announced plans to build up its air and missile-defense capabilities . 
The Netherlands is upgrading four radar frigates to make them capable of missile defense , and has offered its Patriot anti-missile systems . 
So has Germany . 
The Netherlands , Germany , and the US have already deployed Patriot missiles on NATO &apos;s southeastern border to help defend and protect Turkey from possible missile attacks from Syria . 
And , by hosting the four US Navy destroyers , Spain is making a vital contribution not just to NATO &apos;s missile defense , but also to security throughout the Mediterranean region . 
To link all of these national assets together , NATO has developed , and is expanding , a technologically advanced command-and-control system , based at Ramstein Air Base in Germany . 
The system already can connect satellites , radars , and interceptors to defend against missile attacks , and that capability will grow more complex and agile in the years ahead . 
This makes NATO unique : it is the only multilateral organization that can combine the most complex systems from the world &apos;s most capable countries to create an effective whole . 
Above all , this deployment is a step forward for transatlantic cooperation , because the US ships represent more than a military capability . 
Each one is an eight-thousand-ton reminder of America &apos;s commitment to security in Europe . 
At the same time , NATO &apos;s missile defense demonstrates European allies &quot; commitment to security as they develop their capabilities in this area . 
I encourage all allies to consider how they can contribute further to a system that will defend all of us in Europe . 
Missile defense heralds a new form of cooperation , with new capabilities against new threats . 
Where once we lined up tanks along borders , we are now building a complex system that requires a range of high-tech contributions from many allies - on land , at sea , and in the air . 
NATO &apos;s missile-defense system is what transatlantic teamwork looks like in the twenty-first century .
