The Bush Repression 
How will President George W. Bush &apos;s administration be remembered historically ? 
After five years in office , and with another three years to go , some answers are already apparent . 
Others are emerging gradually . 
The latter category includes an increasing assault on civil liberties within the United States that now compares to that of Richard Nixon &apos;s administration more than thirty years ago . 
Of course , civil liberties were bound to suffer in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
Throughout American history , threats to national security , whether real or imagined , have led to clampdowns on the rights of citizens and , to a far greater extent , on the rights of immigrants and others suspected of acting in the interests of alien forces . 
In the twentieth century , abuses of civil liberties were particularly severe during four periods . 
In the years 1917 to 1919 , US participation in World War I and anarchist bombings after the war led to almost two thousand federal prosecutions , mass roundups of aliens , and summary deportations . 
During World War II , Japan &apos;s attack on the US was followed by the internment of more than 120,000 Japanese-Americans because of their race , including many who were born in the US . 
In the late 1940 &quot; s and the 1950 &quot; s , the Cold War and fears that the Red Menace would sap American resolve from within led to myriad anti-subversive programs , with tens of thousands of Americans losing their livelihoods as a result . 
Finally , during the Nixon years , the president &apos;s paranoia about opposition to the Vietnam War and to his policies fuelled a pattern of abuses that eventually brought about his resignation in disgrace . 
The Nixon administration &apos;s legacy is particularly instructive in assessing the Bush record . 
Though Americans tend to lump Nixon &apos;s violations of civil liberties together under the heading of &quot; Watergate , &quot; much more was involved than the break-in at Democratic Party headquarters and the subsequent cover-up . 
The participants in those events included the &quot; Plumbers , &quot; a personal secret police established by Nixon and so named because one of their tasks was to eliminate leaks of information that the White House did not want to disclose . 
Another secret assault on civil liberties was Nixon &apos;s adoption of the &quot; Huston Plan &quot; which authorized political surveillance by burglary , electronic eavesdropping , and the use of the military to spy on civilians . 
Nixon used these methods against political opponents , journalists , and government employees suspected of disloyalty to the president . 
As far as we know , Bush has not gone that far . 
Nevertheless , electronic eavesdropping without court authorization , of the sort Bush ordered starting in 2002 , played a particularly important part in Nixon &apos;s downfall . 
One of the three counts against Nixon in the vote to impeach Nixon by the House of Representatives &quot; Judiciary Committee was based on such eavesdropping . 
In fact , Bush pursued his policy despite a 1978 law - adopted in response to the Nixon-era abuses - that specifically requires judicial approval , and in contradiction to his public assurance that no such eavesdropping takes place without a court order . 
Now that his electronic surveillance program has been exposed , Bush &apos;s Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the news became public , threatening the journalists who reported the information . 
But even before the latest revelations , the Bush administration &apos;s assaults on civil liberties were legion , including its imprisonment of hundreds of men without charges at Guantánamo Bay in an effort to evade judicial review of their cases . 
It also rounded up , jailed , and deported hundreds of aliens in an anti-terrorist drive none of whose targets was shown to have any link to terrorism . 
The list does not stop there . 
Bush &apos;s subordinates authorized methods of interrogation that led to torture , and his administration adamantly resisted legislation that would ban its use . 
It even insisted that it could imprison an American citizen , José Padilla , incommunicado for an indefinite period without criminal charges until , faced with the prospect of Supreme Court review , it suddenly pressed charges that had nothing to do with the allegations that had formed the basis for his detention . 
Indeed , a hallmark of the Bush administration &apos;s violations of civil liberties is that many involve efforts to evade judicial review . 
Guantánamo , the deportations , the Padilla case , and the electronic eavesdropping program all share this characteristic . 
At the same time , Bush has systematically packed the federal courts with judges chosen for their readiness to defer to presidential power . 
His latest nominee to the US Supreme Court , Judge Samuel Alito , exemplifies this trend . 
The mood in the US today is far from the point that it reached in 1973 and 1974 , when the drive to impeach Nixon and convict him in the US Senate forced him to resign . 
Unfortunately , given Bush &apos;s repeated assertions - in defiance of America &apos;s constitutional tradition of checks and balances - that his office endows him with unilateral powers to violate rights , he appears to be untroubled by that prospect .
