Can A Wimp Disarm Saddam ? 
The UN &apos;s weapons inspectorate chief and Iraq have agreed on tentative terms for the conduct of weapons inspections , which in theory could begin as early as two weeks from now . 
But the success of any such deal depends as much on the men who will carry out the inspections as on the details of when , where , and how they are carried out . 
Hans Blix will head the UN arms inspectorate charged with searching for , finding , and destroying Saddam Hussein &apos;s weapons of mass destruction . 
I have known Blix for over forty years . 
In 1960 he was my deputy when I was a leader of the Swedish Liberal Youth organization . 
Since then I have followed his career closely . 
He became Sweden &apos;s foreign minister for a year and was later a director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) in Vienna . 
Personally , Blix is amiable and has a sense of humor ; politically he is weak and easily fooled . 
I can think of few European officials less suitable for a showdown with Saddam Hussein . 
Indeed , it is with utter disbelief that I watch television news about Blix &apos;s negotiations with the Iraqi dictator &apos;s henchmen . 
The world has been amply warned about Blix &apos;s weaknesses because he has a track record of compounded failure . 
When Blix headed the IAEA before the Gulf War of 1991 , he blithely assured the world , after several inspections , that nothing alarming was happening in Iraq . 
He delivered the clean bill of health that Saddam had hoped for when he began hiding his atomic factories and ambitions . 
Since then , we have learnt all too unambiguously that Saddam is obsessed with procuring weapons of mass destruction - chemical and biological warheads as well as atomic bombs and the missiles to deliver them . 
Former experts of Iraq &apos;s nuclear weapons program , who have fled Baghdad for the West , confirmed this . 
They told us about determined and costly efforts to obtain doomsday devices . 
Indeed , it is now clear that Saddam was but a year away from securing his first atomic bomb when the Gulf War broke out . 
After that war , UN inspectors found and destroyed huge amounts of chemical and biological warheads as well as facilities to produce nuclear weapons . 
Despite his grave failings as IAEA chief before 1991 , Blix once again came to lead UN disarmament inspectors , this time in tandem with another Swede , Ambassador Rolf Ekéus . 
Blix , naive and relatively ignorant about technical details  -  his field is international law  -  is easily mislead . 
Even after the Gulf war , he failed to realize that the Iraqi officials , who were again assuring the UN that they were hiding nothing , were but consummate liars . 
Indeed , Blix believed that Iraq had no program at all for nuclear arms . 
David Kay , perhaps the most effective arms inspector , insisted that he did not trust them . 
But Blix reproached Kay for his attitude . 
You must believe in official information , Blix implied . 
The turning point came when Kay initiated inspections of suspect buildings without notifying the Iraqis about his intentions in advance . 
This new , aggressive inspection strategy had dramatic consequences : Kay discovered material which confirmed that Iraq was only 12 to 18 months away from producing a nuclear device . 
This historic discovery ended up in a confrontation at a parking lot in Baghdad . 
UN cars were surrounded by 200 Iraqi soldiers and a mob , ordered out to the scene by Iraqi officials . 
For four days and nights the siege continued , as Kay and his colleagues used satellite telephones to fax crucial documents to the West . 
Blix had opposed the raid . 
Fortunately , Ambassador Ekéus backed it and supported the inspectors during the siege . 
I have met a number of experts on Iraq &apos;s weapons of mass destruction , and they often compare the two Swedes : &quot; Ekéus is brilliant , &quot; they say , &quot; Blix is terrible . &quot; 
When the current UN inspectorate was being put together in 1999 , both Ekéus and Blix were among the candidates being considered to head the new group of inspectors . 
Friends of Iraq in Paris and Moscow consulted Baghdad to see whom Saddam would prefer . 
France and Russia then suggested Blix . 
Surprisingly the Clinton administration accepted that decision . 
Saddam &apos;s chemical and biological arms , and his determination to get nuclear weapons , are a threat to the world . 
The dictator could use these arms himself or make them available to terrorist organizations . 
And the issue of war and peace depends on a man repeatedly duped by the Iraqi regime . 
The Bush administration probably understands Blix &apos;s weaknesses . 
My guess is that the US will not allow Blix and the inspectors that he oversees to be deceived by Iraq again . 
Regardless of how this crisis develops from this point , the UN has neglected its duties by asking a wimp to lead the inspectors who are supposed to stand up to the brute of Baghdad .
