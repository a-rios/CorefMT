France &apos;s Little Big Man 
PARIS - National stereotypes do not fade easily , especially if those with the greatest influence seem to be doing their best to justify them . 
Consider the case of France . 
To outsiders , the land of Molière is a country where political leaders &quot; extramarital relationships are tolerated , while badly needed economic reforms are not . 
But the world could be in for a surprise - or at least half a surprise . 
When it comes to politicians &quot; liaisons , continuity may prevail in France ; but on the issue of reform , change may be around the corner . 
President François Hollande has announced measures that , if implemented , would amount to a peaceful revolution : a major reconciliation with the industrial and business world that even his more energetic predecessor , Nicolas Sarkozy , dared not attempt , despite - or precisely because of - his more conservative inclinations . 
The reality of change , however , has been hampered by the stereotype of continuity . 
Hollande &apos;s daring pledge of € 30 billion ( $ 40.6 billion ) in tax cuts to boost the economy has been hijacked , at least in part , by revelations about his private life . 
Public-opinion polls following the publication of photographs of a helmeted Hollande riding on a scooter behind one of his bodyguards to an assignation with a movie actress suggest that the French are mildly interested . 
But the reality is more nuanced . 
Though former President François Mitterrand &apos;s second family was virtually a state secret , known only to a select elite and hidden from the public by a reverential press , his mistress and their daughter attended his funeral . 
And Sarkozy &apos;s tumultuous private life at the beginning of his presidency was on open display . 
Unlike the British and the Americans , the French are much less obsessed with sex than they are with financial scandal . 
Public-opinion surveys reveal an interesting dualism : the French want maximum freedom in the private sphere and maximum protection in the public sphere . 
Thus , the French do not criticize Hollande on the ground of ethics , but on the ground of politics . 
The president of &quot; la Grande Nation , &quot; political heir of the Sun King and General de Gaulle , has made a fool of himself : he looked simply ridiculous on his scooter . 
Victor Hugo coined the formula &quot; Napoleon le petit &quot; to describe Napoleon III . 
Will Hollande , who seems to take so much inspiration for both his public and private life from his mentor and model , France &apos;s first-ever Socialist president , one day be described as &quot; Mitterrand le petit &quot; ? 
Vaudeville may be a French specialty , like bread , cheese , and wine , but it does not strengthen the dignity and credibility of an already spectacularly unpopular presidency . 
Hollande wanted to be a &quot; normal president . &quot; 
In the stolen images of him en route to a tryst , he seems to be outdoing himself . 
Hollande may be in love with another woman ; it does happen . 
One may regret the disappearance of boundaries between private and public life in our global Internet age , but one must adjust to it - and Hollande clearly has not . 
Of course , the key question is why Hollande waited 18 months before doing the right thing and helping the French economy by alleviating the tax burden that had been reducing French enterprises &quot; competitiveness . 
The official answer is that deteriorating global economic conditions left no other choice . 
For some , including me , Hollande was from the start a true social democrat . 
Whether one calls that realism or lack of political courage , a year and a half has been lost , seriously hampering France and its economy . 
Now , however , the country may at long last be headed in the right direction . 
Hollande now has three years to prove that , animated by the right ideas , he can transform his image - and that of France - with economic results , if not by his personal behavior .
