The Opportunity in Seoul 
SEOUL - Hubris usually gives birth to disaster . 
The root cause of the current global crisis was intellectual hubris in the form of the blind belief that markets would always resolve their own problems and contradictions . 
Thirty years after the Reagan-Thatcher revolution , the ideological pendulum has begun to swing in the opposite direction . 
Each time in the last hundred years that a shift of this magnitude has occurred in beliefs about state-market relations , a major political-economic upheaval has ensued . 
For example , World War I marked the end of the nineteenth-century &apos;s laissez-faire liberalism and ushered in a period of state-centered economic systems . 
The Great Depression and World War II opened the new era of the Bretton Woods system of a more balanced state-market relationship . 
Similarly , the 2008 global financial crisis ended three decades of neo-liberalism , characterized by free trade and financial globalization . 
We still do not know the nature of the era ahead of us ; we can only be certain that the global economy is in the middle of a major transition , and that the old ways will not work anymore . 
The main concern in this period of great uncertainty is whether the transition to a new paradigm can be managed without further destabilizing the international political-economic order . 
There are already some serious signs of distress - the currency war between the United States and China , and its spread to other countries , being a case in point . 
Indeed , current global conditions have more worrying similarities to the early 1930 &quot; s than they have differences . 
Then , every state looked inward , squandering valuable opportunities to achieve common prosperity through international policy coordination . 
The leadership vacuum caused by America &apos;s unwillingness to cooperate and Britain &apos;s sudden inability to lead resulted in the failure of the London Conference of 1933 , which is often seen as opening the way to the Great Depression and the catastrophe of World War II . 
Having learned the lessons of the 1930 &quot; s , the post-war global economic order was built on a network of international institutions , such as the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , and what ultimately became the World Trade Organization . 
In addition , the institutions created in the days following WWII no longer seem effective enough to meet the new challenges of the global economy , and thus have lost some of their legitimacy . 
For example , the IMF &apos;s authority has suffered in the recent decade - especially in Asia - from the fund &apos;s deep commitment to neo-liberal orthodoxy and the so-called &quot; Washington Consensus . &quot; 
Reinvigorating these institutions is the first step toward solving the global economy &apos;s current problems . 
We need their help to implement norms , principles , rules , and decision-making procedures , thereby mitigating the endemic free-rider problems in quasi-anarchical international society . 
Thus , the first task for the G-20 meeting on November 11-12 in Seoul must be to revitalize and strengthen the IMF and global financial regulation . 
If the G-20 leaders can also make meaningful progress towards resolving the Doha Round of trade negotiations , they will add momentum for global economic stabilization . 
There are signs that the Seoul meeting may be successful . 
The meeting of G-20 finance ministers and central bankers in the South Korean city of Kyeongju on October 22 produced some noteworthy achievements , such as shifting 6 % of the IMF &apos;s voting quota from overrepresented Europe to underrepresented emerging countries , doubling members &quot; quotas , and reducing Europe &apos;s representation on the Fund &apos;s executive board by two seats . 
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn declared the move &quot; historic &quot; and the most important decision on the Fund &apos;s governance since its establishment in 1944 . 
The IMF also was empowered to conduct the Mutual Assessment Process of each country &apos;s macroeconomic policies under the Framework for Strong , Sustainable , and Balanced Growth . 
That authority should allow the Fund to inspect even the world &apos;s mightiest economies , the US and China . 
The recent agreement by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on a new capital-adequacy framework is another positive step . 
But the key issues lingering in the minds of the G-20 leaders will be exchange rates and global imbalances . 
The Kyeongju meeting decided that the G-20 countries would move toward market-determined exchange rates and pursue &quot; politics conducive to reducing excessive imbalances and maintaining current-account imbalances at sustainable levels . &quot; 
These two issues may or may not be on the table for further discussion in Seoul . 
If G-20 leaders can reach specific and effective agreements on exchange rates and global imbalances without overshadowing other issues , the prospects for a soft-landing for the global economy will improve greatly . 
If not , protectionism and trade wars will intensify , and we will come one step closer to reliving the nightmare of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Either way , the Seoul G-20 summit will likely mark a watershed in the history of the post-war global political economy .
