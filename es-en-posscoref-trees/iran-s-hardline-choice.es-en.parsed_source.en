Iran &apos;s Hardline Choice 
Iran &apos;s choice for its next president , the hardline Mayor of Teheran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is likely to worsen relations with the West and the country &apos;s international isolation . 
Yet in domestic terms the Islamist regime is likely to be better off than it would have been with a more moderate result . 
Clearly , Ahmadinejad has a real base of support . 
But the fact that he ran as a populist , talked about helping the poor , condemned the government &apos;s performance , and acted almost like an opposition candidate are all irrelevant : he was the regime &apos;s choice , and , in the end , he received official help even against rival hardline candidates . 
The regime played its hand brilliantly . 
It turned the slightly more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani , who disagreed with some current policies , into the &quot; establishment &quot; figure and its own man into the rebel . 
The government thus used anti-establishment feeling to revitalize its own rule . 
Given the fact that the last president , Muhammad Khatami , was a supporter of the reform movement - albeit a timid one who ultimately accomplished nothing - only underlines how thoroughly the rulers turned around the political situation . 
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists in the anti-Shah revolution of a quarter-century ago . 
He was directly involved in the holding of American hostages in Iran , though exactly how much so remains a matter of dispute . 
Most worrisome of all , he is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran : the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij organization . 
The first is a parallel pro-regime army ; the second is an organization for intimidating opponents and anyone seeking a more open society . 
However , concern that an even more radical leadership has taken over in Iran is mitigated by two factors . 
First , Ahmadinejad is more likely to focus on domestic issues , trying - with whatever degree of success is unclear - to improve living standards for the poorest Iranians . 
Second , the same group that has been in control ever since the revolution will basically continue to run ideological and foreign policy . 
The president has fewer powers than it seems , overshadowed particularly by Supreme Guide Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . 
Nevertheless , Ahmadinejad &apos;s election starkly clarifies the challenge that Iran poses for Western policy and Middle East stability . 
First and foremost , it sends a signal to the most extreme elements in Iran and that country &apos;s terrorist clients - Lebanon &apos;s Hezbollah , the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad , and various small groups operating against Saudi Arabia , Iraq , and other Arab countries - that they have a green light for launching attacks . 
They are likely to assume that Iran will support them whatever they do . 
Outwardly , Iran has often been relatively cautious , but , at the covert level , it has been the world &apos;s leading sponsor of terror . 
Sometimes individual Iranian officials may have acted on their own to order and coordinate specific operations ; they will now feel freer to do so . 
Moreover , Ahmadinejad openly advocates Iran &apos;s crash program to obtain nuclear weapons . 
Most Iranian politicians - at least those allowed by the government to function openly - support the program , but favor a quieter and more cautious approach . 
Rafsanjani , for example , put building better economic relations with the West ahead of pushing forward on the nuclear front . 
If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran , he is more likely to use the weapons in an adventurous manner . 
This does not mean that he would fire them , but rather that he would use them for purposes of diplomatic blackmail , raising threats to crisis levels . 
Since Iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight the US ( Ahmadinejad stepped on a picture of an American flag on his way to vote ) , the risk of confrontation has increased . 
Finally , Ahmadinejad is likely to be bolder in subverting stability in Iraq , and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and extremists within Iraq itself . 
Iran is already sending many agents into Iraq and supporting clients seeking to turn that country into a clone . 
Iraqis , including Shia Muslims - who follow the same version of Islam as Iranians - generally reject such interference . 
A more militant Iranian posture is likely to increase friction with Iraq , as well as inspire more anti-American violence there . 
In short , Iran &apos;s electoral outcome is a dangerous one , though precisely how destabilizing it ultimately turns out to be will depend on Ahmadinejad &apos;s actions and the degree of power granted him by Khamenei . 
Moreover , dealing with such an openly extreme Iran - radical even by the hardline regime &apos;s standards - will be a challenge not just for the US , but for Europe as well . 
Will European countries try to pretend that Ahmadinejad &apos;s militant rhetoric and provocations don &apos;t matter and that some diplomatic solution to Iran &apos;s nuclear ambition can be found ? 
With Rafsanjani , either a real agreement or the pretense of cooperation would have been easy to maintain . 
But , with Ahmadinejad , a high level of appeasement will be necessary for even the most minimal diplomatic process to continue . 
Some Iranian reformers and exiles put a bright face on Ahmadinejad &apos;s election , arguing that his administration is more likely to show the regime &apos;s real face and disabuse any Western hopes of compromise . 
Yet it may also represent the regime &apos;s success at co-opting dissatisfaction with a quarter-century of radical Islamist rule . 
Whatever the outcome , for the West , Ahmadinejad &apos;s victory means that everything related to Iran is set to become even hotter .
