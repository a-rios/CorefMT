America &apos;s Coming Social Democracy ? 
Almost all of the world &apos;s developed countries consider themselves , and are , social democracies : mixed economies with very large governments performing a wide array of welfare and social insurance functions , and removing large chunks of wealth and commodity distribution from the market . 
The United States is something different . 
Or is it ? 
Whatever it has been in the past , the US in the future will have to choose whether , and how much , it will be a social democracy . 
Once upon a time , according to mythology at least , America had little downward mobility . 
On the contrary , before the Civil War you could start out splitting rails , light out for the Western Territory , make a success of yourself on the frontier , and wind up as President - if you were named Abraham Lincoln . 
In the generation after World War II , you could secure a blue-collar unionized manufacturing job or climb to the top of a white collar bureaucracy that offered job security , relatively high salaries , and long , stable career ladders . 
This was always half myth . 
Setting out for the Western Territory was expensive . 
Covered wagons were not cheap . 
Even in the first post-WWII generation , only a minority of Americans - a largely white , male minority - found well-paying stable jobs at large , unionized , capital-intensive manufacturing companies like GM , GE , or AT &amp; T. 
But if this story was half myth , it was also half true , particularly in the years after WWII . 
Largely independent of education or family , those Americans who did value stability and security could grasp it in the form of jobs with &quot; a future . &quot; 
Even for those not so lucky , economic risks were usually fairly low : the unemployment rate for married men during the 1960 &quot; s averaged 2.7 % , and finding a new job was a relatively simple matter . 
It was during this era - roughly from 1948 to 1973 - that sociologists found that a majority of Americans had come to define themselves not as working class , but as middle class . 
The post-WWII period stands as a reference point in America &apos;s collective memory , but it was in all likelihood an aberration . 
In the early postwar decades , foreign competition exerted virtually no pressure on the economy , owing to the isolation of America &apos;s continental market from the devastation of WWII . 
At the same time , the war left enormous pent-up demand for the products of mass production : cars , washing machines , refrigerators , lawn mowers , television sets , and more . 
Government policy back then began with a permanent military program of spending and R &amp; D and continued through massive public works program and suburbanization , underpinned by the Federal Highway Program and subsidized home ownership loans from the Federal Housing Administration . 
The regulatory institutions and behavioral norms that originated in the New Deal and developed during WWII came into full force : social security , a system of unionized labor relations , market regulation . 
Favorable macroeconomic circumstances , the absence of foreign competition , a system of government support and regulation , and large-scale private provision of what in Europe would have been public social insurance all combined to give post-WWII America many of social democracy &apos;s benefits without the costs . 
The economy did not stagger under the weight of ample benefits or high taxes . 
Americans - at least white , male Americans - did not have to worry about tradeoffs between security and opportunity , because the US offered the advantages of both . 
Corporate welfare capitalism substituted for what in Europe would have been government provided social democracy . 
America was thus a special place . 
It had its cake and ate it , too : a combination of security with opportunity and entrepreneurship . 
It seemed that this was the natural order of things . 
Hence there was little pressure for government-sponsored social democracy : Why bother ? 
What would it add ? 
Now things are very different . 
The typical American employer is no longer General Motors . 
Private businesses are providing their workers with less and less in the form of defined-benefit pensions , health insurance , and other forms of insurance against life &apos;s economic risks . 
Sharply rising income inequality has raised the stakes of the economic game . 
A government that cannot balance its own finances cannot be relied on to provide macroeconomic stability . 
Indeed , former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Paul Volcker sees the US as so macroeconomically vulnerable as to be running a 75 % chance of a full-fledged dollar crisis over the next several years . 
The coming generation will be one of massive downward mobility for many Americans . 
The political struggles that this generates will determine whether America will move more closely to the social democratic norm for developed countries , or find some way to accept and rationalize its existence as a country of high economic risk and deep divisions of income and wealth .
