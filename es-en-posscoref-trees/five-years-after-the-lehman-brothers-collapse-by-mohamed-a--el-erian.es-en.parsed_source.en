Lehman &apos;s Morbid Legacy 
NEWPORT BEACH - As the fifth anniversary of the disorderly collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers approaches , some analysts will revisit the causes of an historic global &quot; sudden stop &quot; that resulted in enormous economic and financial disruptions . 
Others will describe the consequences of an event that continues to produce considerable human suffering . 
As interesting as these contributions will be , I hope that we will also see another genre : analyses of the previously unthinkable outcomes that have become reality - with profound implications for current and future generations - and that our systems of governance have yet to address properly . 
With this in mind , let me offer four . 
The first such outcome , and by far the most consequential , is the continuing difficulty that Western economies face in generating robust economic growth and sufficient job creation . 
Notwithstanding the initial sharp drop in GDP in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 , too many Western economies have yet to rebound properly , let alone sustain growth rates that would make up fully for lost jobs and income . 
More generally , only a few have decisively overcome the trifecta of maladies that the crisis exposed : inadequate and unbalanced aggregate demand , insufficient structural resilience and agility , and persistent debt overhangs . 
The net result goes beyond the weak growth , worsening income inequality , high long-term unemployment , and alarming youth joblessness of the here and now . 
Five years after the global financial crisis , too many countries are being held back by exhausted and out-dated growth engines . 
As a result , prospects for a rapid , durable , and inclusive economic recovery remain a serious concern . 
Given this harsh reality , it is not surprising that the second previously unthinkable outcome concerns inadequate policy responses - namely , the large and persistent imbalance between the hyperactivity of central banks and the frustrating passivity of other policymakers . 
The big surprise here is not that central banks acted decisively and boldly when financial markets froze and economic activity plummeted . 
Given their relatively unrestricted access to the printing press and their high degree of operational autonomy , one would expect central banks to be active and effective first responders . 
And they responded in an impressive and globally coordinated fashion . 
This has pushed central banks away from their core competencies as they have been forced to use partial and imperfect policy tools for quite a long time . 
This outcome reflects domestic political polarization in the United States and the complexity of regional interactions in Europe , which have blocked comprehensive and balanced policy approaches . 
To appreciate the extent of the problem , consider the repeated failure of the US Congress to pass an annual budget ( let alone deliver medium-term reforms ) or incomplete eurozone-wide initiatives at a time of alarming unemployment and residual threats of financial disruptions . 
Such political dysfunction has undermined the responsiveness of other policymaking entities , including those that possess better tools than central banks . 
The result has been to expose Western economies to ever-more experimental measures , with considerable uncertainty about the longer-term impact of operating sophisticated market-based systems on the basis of artificial constructs . 
The third previously unthinkable outcome relates to how developing countries have fared . 
Having initially suffered from the financial crisis as much as Western countries did ( indeed , more in terms of output and trade ) , these historically less-robust economies staged a remarkable comeback - so much so that they became the engine of global growth . 
In the process , however , they slipped into an unbalanced policy mix that now threatens their continued growth and financial stability . 
Renewed risks of financial instability point to the fourth and final surprise : the failure to recast major contributors to the crisis in a credible , sustainable , and socially responsible manner . 
Consider large Western banks . 
Given their systemic importance , many were bailed out and , with continued official support , returned to profitability quite quickly . 
Yet they were not subject to windfall profit taxation , nor have policymakers sufficiently altered structural incentives that encourage excessive risk-taking . 
In the case of Europe , only now are banks being pushed to deal decisively with their capital shortfalls , leverage problems , and residual weak assets . 
Call me a worrywart , but I remain concerned by the extent to which our systems of economic governance have lagged in addressing these four outcomes . 
The longer this unusual environment persists , the greater the risk that the disruptive ramifications of the 2008 crisis will continue to reach far and wide , including to future generations .
