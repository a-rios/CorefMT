The Worst and the Best of Austerity 
BRUSSELS - In June , it was Greece . 
In August , it was France , Italy , Spain , and Portugal . 
In September , it was Greece again - and Spain . 
In November , France took another turn , before Italy again in December , this time in a major way . 
Every month , despite an ever-darker outlook for economic growth , countries announce new spending cuts and tax hikes in the hope of restoring confidence in the bond markets . 
Only Germany stands out , having recently announced a tax cut , albeit a modest one . 
In other words , while all indicators point to a severe economic downturn in Europe , the eurozone &apos;s current interest-rate spreads are provoking a shift to austerity . 
It looks like a no-brainer : accelerated budget cuts are preferable to a lethal interest-rate surge on public debt , even if the cuts increase the risk of recession . 
But there are caveats . 
First , while indiscriminate austerity may be the only option for those eurozone countries that no longer have access to capital markets , others have more choice of policy options . 
Consolidation is required , but governments are responsible for its speed and its design . 
Second , a sound fiscal strategy requires establishing , on the basis of prudent economic assumptions , an ambitious budgetary target for the medium term , determining what mix of taxation and expenditure cuts are required in order to achieve it , and then sticking to the plan throughout economic fluctuations . 
This allows the so-called &quot; automatic stabilizers &quot; - lower receipts in a slowdown , higher in a boom - to come into play , preventing the economy from overheating at the top of the business cycle and providing stimulus at the bottom . 
Third , headlong consolidation is not always the best way to reassure markets , which may worry more about growth . 
Italy is a case in point . 
The country &apos;s budget deficit this year , at 4 % of GDP , is far below that of Spain or France . 
Indeed , it was not the country &apos;s deficit that finally led investors to shun Italian bonds , but rather a forbidding cocktail of high debt , desperately slow growth , and political paralysis . 
In a situation like this , nibbling at the edges of a deficit is at best a sideshow . 
The markets are demanding reforms that lift growth rates durably and an approach to fiscal consolidation that is consistent with higher potential growth . 
Fourth , the cost of rushed austerity is that it generally relies on immediate fixes , such as indiscriminate spending cuts and tax hikes that are expected to yield revenue in the short term , but that have an economically damaging impact . 
Smart consolidation should , instead , minimize short-term economic damage and foster longer-term growth . 
Governments know this only too well . 
At the end of 2010 , most eurozone countries were penciling spending cuts into their consolidation programs while preserving the most productive areas , such as education and infrastructure . 
Moreover , they were planning to broaden the tax base rather than raise rates . 
But , since this summer , governments have done the opposite . 
Rather than focus on spending , they have zeroed in on tax measures , for the most part increasing existing rates . 
This is a bad sign for growth . 
What should they be doing instead ? 
Fiscal consolidation is unavoidable , but that is a medium-term process . 
Instead of undertaking knee-jerk cuts , eurozone governments must first reestablish their credibility through policy rules enshrined in national legislations , as recently decided by the European heads of state and government . 
Second , they should design and implement smart consolidations , even if they take a little more time to design and a little more time to implement . 
This entails finding the optimal balance between spending cuts and tax increases , and identifying the least harmful measures over the medium term . 
Doing so will take time , thought , and an iron will .
