Blinded by the Light 
NEW YORK - On the evening of March 23 , 1.3 billion people will go without light at 8 : 30 , and at 9 : 30 , and at 10 : 30 , and for the rest of the night - just like every other night of the year . 
With no access to electricity , darkness after sunset is a constant reality for these people . 
On the same evening , another billion will participate in the environmental event &quot; Earth Hour &quot; by turning off their lights from 8 : 30-9 : 30 . 
The organizers say that they are providing a way to demonstrate one &apos;s desire to &quot; do something &quot; about global warming . 
It may inspire virtuous feelings , but its vain symbolism reveals exactly what is wrong with today &apos;s feel-good environmentalism . 
Earth Hour teaches us that tackling global warming is easy . 
Yet , by switching off the lights , all we are doing is making it harder to see . 
Notice that you have not been asked to switch off anything really inconvenient , like your heating or air conditioning , television , computer , mobile phone , or any of the myriad technologies that depend on affordable , plentiful energy electricity and make modern life possible . 
If switching off the lights for one hour per year really were beneficial , why would we not do it for the other 8,759 ? 
Hypothetically , switching off the lights for an hour would cut CO2 emissions from power plants around the world . 
In fact , Earth Hour will cause emissions to increase . 
As the United Kingdom &apos;s National Grid operators have found , a small decline in electricity consumption does not translate into less energy being pumped into the grid , and therefore will not reduce emissions . 
Moreover , during Earth Hour , any significant drop in electricity demand will entail a reduction in CO2 emissions during the hour , but it will be offset by the surge from firing up coal or gas stations to restore electricity supplies afterwards . 
And the cozy candles that many participants will light , which seem so natural and environmentally friendly , are still fossil fuels - and almost 100 times less efficient than incandescent light bulbs . 
Using one candle for each switched-off bulb cancels out even the theoretical CO2 reduction ; using two candles means that you emit more CO2 . 
Electricity has given humanity huge benefits . 
Almost three billion people still burn dung , twigs , and other traditional fuels indoors to cook and keep warm , generating noxious fumes that kill an estimated two million people each year , mostly women and children . 
Likewise , just a hundred years ago , the average American family spent six hours each week during cold months shoveling six tons of coal into the furnace ( not to mention cleaning the coal dust from carpets , furniture , curtains , and bedclothes ) . 
In the developed world today , electric stoves and heaters have banished indoor air pollution . 
Similarly , electricity has allowed us to mechanize much of our world , ending most backbreaking work . 
The washing machine liberated women from spending endless hours carrying water and beating clothing on scrub boards . 
The refrigerator made it possible for almost everyone to eat more fruits and vegetables , and simply to stop eating rotten food , which is the main reason why the most prevalent cancer for men in the United States in 1930 , stomach cancer , is the least prevalent now . 
Electricity has allowed us to irrigate fields and synthesize fertilizer from air . 
The light that it powers has enabled us to have active , productive lives past sunset . 
The electricity that people in rich countries consume is , on average , equivalent to the energy of 56 servants helping them . 
Even people in Sub-Saharan Africa have electricity equivalent to about three servants . 
They need more of it , not less . 
This is relevant not only for the world &apos;s poor . 
Because of rising energy prices from green subsidies , 800,000 German households can no longer pay their electricity bills . 
In the UK , there are now over five million fuel-poor people , and the country &apos;s electricity regulator now publicly worries that environmental targets could lead to blackouts in less than nine months . 
Today , we produce only a small fraction of the energy that we need from solar and wind - 0.7 % from wind and just 0.1 % from solar . 
These technologies currently are too expensive . 
They are also unreliable ( we still have no idea what to do when the wind is not blowing ) . 
Even with optimistic assumptions , the International Energy Agency estimates that , by 2035 , we will produce just 2.4 % of our energy from wind and 0.8 % from solar . 
To green the world &apos;s energy , we should abandon the old-fashioned policy of subsidizing unreliable solar and wind - a policy that has failed for 20 years , and that will fail for the next 22 . 
Instead , we should focus on inventing new , more efficient green technologies to outcompete fossil fuels . 
If we really want a sustainable future for all of humanity and our planet , we shouldn &apos;t plunge ourselves back into darkness . 
Tackling climate change by turning off the lights and eating dinner by candlelight smacks of the &quot; let them eat cake &quot; approach to the world &apos;s problems that appeals only to well-electrified , comfortable elites . 
Focusing on green R D might not feel as good as participating in a global gabfest with flashlights and good intentions , but it is a much brighter idea .
