Latin America &apos;s Lessons for Nuclear Diplomacy 
BUENOS AIRES - In some ways , the latest negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program between it and the United Nations Security Council &apos;s five permanent members plus Germany ( the P5 + 1 ) , which are set to resume in Geneva on November 7 , seem to be more promising than previous rounds . 
At the very least , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has pledged to take a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor . 
But negotiators will have to navigate difficult circumstances , including economic uncertainty in the West and intense political turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa - not to mention a long history of mistrust and gridlock . 
In order to maximize the chance of success , they should consider &quot; best practices &quot; from successful nuclear negotiations of the past , with the nuclear-cooperation agreement between Brazil and Argentina providing an example of &quot; out-of-the-box &quot; thinking on non-proliferation . 
For many years , Brazil and Argentina were locked in a security dilemma . 
Both were eager to be recognized as nuclear powers ; indeed , there was active domestic support for proliferation in some circles in both governments . 
With both countries on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons , the rest of the world was understandably nervous . 
From a military perspective , the situation could have escalated catastrophically . 
But , since the mid-1980 &quot; s , the security threat has ebbed substantially . 
While smart strategic leadership , democratic political systems , and economic interdependence undoubtedly contributed to this shift , the transition from nuclear competition to nuclear partnership - facilitated by shared values , common interests , and pragmatic understanding among key scientists , policymakers , and military actors - played a decisive role . 
Argentines and Brazilians were never na√Øve about their aims and interests . 
Rather , they were able to explore and define a bargaining scenario that offered mutually beneficial outcomes . 
A credible and effective International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) and a relatively balanced and influential United Nations Security Council aided their non-proliferation efforts substantially . 
The end of the Cold War and domestic democratization were also essential , as they led to closer adherence to the rule of law and increased civilian control of the military . 
A series of initiatives by Argentina and Brazil - such as the establishment of the Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials ( ABACC ) in 1991 and both countries &quot; subsequent accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty - reinforced the demise of their military nuclear efforts . 
The ABACC - the only agency of its kind recognized by the IAEA - played a particularly important role , because it legitimized intrusive bilateral inspections , reinforced the right to civilian nuclear development , generated mutual trust , won popular approval in both countries , and earned international esteem . 
Today , Argentina and Brazil are developing a multi-purpose , non-military nuclear reactor together . 
They are far more autonomous in terms of foreign policy than they were four decades ago , when they equated independence with nuclear capabilities . 
Brazil has become a significant emerging power on the world stage , and Argentina has strengthened its civilian nuclear program and improved its external policies on that issue . 
To be sure , reaching this point was not easy - but it was the only option . 
During the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s , the frequency of diplomatic stalemate forced the leaders of Argentina and Brazil to rethink international negotiations . 
Their fundamental realization - that concrete deeds mean more than lofty intentions - shaped the talks between the two countries . 
In this sense , the history of deadlock in nuclear talks with Iran could serve as a catalyst for progress . 
The case of Argentina and Brazil suggests five important lessons for participants in the upcoming nuclear negotiations on Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Maximalist positions are doomed to fail , and cooperation is always possible.Partial , step-by-step solutions can build confidence and reciprocity more effectively than holistic , supposedly permanent strategies can.Realism is vital ; consistent and verifiable behavior is more important than idealistic pledges.International institutions and rules are decisive ; unilateral or bilateral commitments to avoid or suspend nuclear-weapons projects should be encouraged and secured by multilateral means.The strategic objective of all actors involved , whether directly or indirectly , must be to strengthen the global non-proliferation regime . 
Otherwise , sooner or later , self-interest , double standards , heightened international risks , and domestic political concerns will encourage proliferation.Major nuclear powers can survive in a world where minor powers possess small nuclear arsenals . 
It is the rest of the world - especially these countries &quot; neighbors - that suffers the consequences of a dysfunctional and illegitimate nuclear non-proliferation regime . 
For everyone &apos;s sake , participants in the upcoming talks on Iran &apos;s nuclear program should apply the lessons gained in Argentina and Brazil .
