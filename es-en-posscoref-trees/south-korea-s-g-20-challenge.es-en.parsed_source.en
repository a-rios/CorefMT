South Korea &apos;s G-20 Challenge 
BERKELEY - On January 1 , South Korea takes over the G-20 chairmanship from the United Kingdom . 
Korea is not the first emerging market to chair the G-20 , but it is the first to do so since the global financial crisis . 
G-20 chairs can have considerable influence . 
They coordinate the group &apos;s work . 
During the UK &apos;s year chairing the G-20 , Gordon Brown had a clear agenda . 
He saw the G-20 as a vehicle for building consensus on coordinated monetary and fiscal stimulus and financial regulation . 
He also viewed it as a forum to address the problems created for the poorest countries by the global financial crisis . 
And he used the chairmanship to elicit commitments to resist protectionism . 
Given the nature and gravity of the crisis , it was brutally obvious what the priorities for the G-20 should be . 
The priorities for President Lee Myung-bak are less obvious . 
Some will say that he should get G-20 countries to coordinate an orderly exit from their expansionary monetary and fiscal policies . 
But growth in the advanced economies will almost certainly remain weak in 2010 . 
With the United States , Europe , and Japan still suffering post-crisis hangovers , this issue can be safely left to the country that chairs the G-20 in 2011 . 
Others will say that a priority should be agreement on slowing climate change . But this is best addressed in Copenhagen , in the presence of all world leaders , not in the cozy confines of the G-20 . 
They are excluded from the G-20 , which is supposed to be made up of the 20 largest economies as a matter of design . 
Instead , President Lee should give priority to four issues , starting with financial reform , a problem that Brown targeted but did not solve . 
Progress here has been inadequate , despite much talk . 
In particular , there has been little action on issues like creating a cross-border resolution authority to deal with the failure of a large financial group , something that can only be done at the international level . 
The window of opportunity for financial reform is now closing , and business-as-usual will only result in more crises and more bailouts . 
South Korea must therefore do everything it can to reinvigorate the debate . 
The second priority should be more progress on global rebalancing . 
Asian countries need to do even more to stimulate spending , and they need to move together . 
China is incapable of solving this problem on its own , because its economy is still only one-third the size of America &apos;s . 
But if Asian countries move together , China will be more willing to let its exchange rate against the dollar become unstuck . 
The second factor contributing to the crisis could then be addressed once and for all . 
Third , the G-20 must address its own legitimacy deficit . 
After all , no one anointed these 20 countries as the designated representatives of the world . 
Who speaks for the other 173 internationally recognized countries ? 
Why should there be so many European G-20 members - other than the fact that they were incumbent members of the earlier &quot; G &apos;s &quot; - and not more African members ? 
Here , South Korea can propose an obvious solution . 
Big ones have their own seats , while smaller ones represent groups of countries , known as &quot; constituencies . &quot; 
In many cases , the constituencies rotate the chair among their members . 
Everyone is represented . 
Finally , the G-20 needs an emerging-markets caucus . 
The US and the Europeans are in constant contact , doing their best to agree on positions and table common proposals . 
Emerging markets , failing to do the same , have punched below their weight . 
This is the most delicate issue of all for South Korea . 
As chair , it needs to act as an &quot; honest broker . &quot; 
It can &apos;t be seen as giving emerging markets special encouragement . 
And , given its location , South Korea would be torn between encouraging an emerging-market caucus and encouraging an Asian caucus - for Asia , too , needs to organize itself better in order to represent its interests in the G-20 . 
Thus , the initiative here might best come from another G-20 country - maybe Brazil , South Africa , or even Russia . 
But South Korea could usefully drop a hint .
