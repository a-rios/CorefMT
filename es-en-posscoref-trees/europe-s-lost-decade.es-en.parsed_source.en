Europe &apos;s Lost Decade 
MILAN - &quot; Never confess a failure . 
Whenever you are about to miss a target , just move the deadline . 
Sooner or later , you will make it . &quot; 
This simple rule , largely followed in Eastern Europe in the socialist days , is also popular among European Union bureaucrats in Brussels today . 
On March 24 , 2010 , what all observers of European affairs have long known will be written in stone : the EU failed to attain the targets for economic growth , efficiency , and modernization set ten years ago in Lisbon . 
Rather than becoming &quot; the most dynamic economy in the world , &quot; the EU is losing ground . 
The gap in per-capita income of the EU15 ( the membership prior to the accession of mainly post-communist states in 2004 ) relative to the United States - taken as a reference in many targets - is unchanged at 30-40 % , depending on the adjustment to purchasing power parity . 
The EU as a whole has attained none of the 17 quantitative targets set in the Lisbon Strategy . 
And all the qualitative targets , added later in the process , have been used mainly to feed national bureaucracies preparing plans within the so-called &quot; open coordination method . &quot; 
Rather than digging into the reasons for this general failure , the EU is now issuing a document that calls for new ambitious targets for 2020 . 
For another ten years , it seems , we can talk big and dream . 
What failed in the Lisbon Strategy ? 
Basically , everything - and the method , above all . 
Rules without any monitoring and enforcement mechanism are merely empty rhetoric . 
The &quot; peer pressure &quot; that should have been exerted in the open coordination method has been a powerful tool to exert &quot; peer protection &quot; in justifying delays in attaining the targets . 
Second , the targets themselves were wrong , and there were far too many . 
Those who bravely tried to list them came out with three-digit totals . 
The only justification for such a long list is that every government could claim to have attained at least one target - a trophy to exhibit at home . 
Moreover , the targets mostly involved policies that do not require any supra-national coordination , such as labor policies , childcare , and pensions . 
Hence , the soft method , and the absence of sanctions for countries delaying the process . 
In addition , the targets were generally set in terms of outcomes rather than policy instruments . 
The government of a country hit by a positive shock could attain a target even without having done anything to achieve it . 
For all of these reasons , postponing Lisbon to 2020 is a no-brainer . 
Rather than wasting time and public money to set up or maintain the Lisbon bureaucracy , the EU should closely monitor the attainment of those national and EU-wide targets that involve significant spillovers across jurisdictions . 
A clear case is environmental protection . 
The 2012 Kyoto targets are attainable . 
Any delay by one country in moving in that direction would jeopardize efforts made in other countries . 
Another example is energy distribution . 
The EU is still very far from having a single energy market , which makes it more costly for business and households and reduces efficiency . 
Here , there is a strong case for having EU-wide targets rather than simply national objectives and sanctions for countries that do not liberalize their markets . 
Other targets could instead be set at the EU level , rewarding those countries that contribute the most to attaining them . 
One such target is skilled migration . 
Europe is losing out in the worldwide race for talent , and the global recession is providing an opportunity to redesign the geography of human capital endowments . 
Selective migration policies and talent-friendly environments supported at the European level could significantly improve the net skill migration balance , which is currently negative or zero in all EU countries . 
There is a pool of about 300 million graduates to build on , and , according to solid evidence , they react to changes in economic incentives with respect to their location choices . 
In this context , there are clear spillovers across jurisdictions , not least because talents go where there is a critical mass of job opportunities for them . 
People often move as &quot; power couples &quot; looking for good jobs for both adult members of the household . 
With popular destinations like the United States and Canada cutting back on research and public education and facing the need to raise top tax rates , Europe has a unique opportunity to attract skilled migrants and reduce the exodus of European researchers . 
The so-called &quot; blue-card &quot; process has so far been largely unsuccessful , because there was no incentive for individual states to coordinate their policies . 
How about conditioning EU support to national researchers on the adoption of selective migration policies ? 
That would be the first serious step towards creating a single market for labor in Europe . 
If Europe were to take such steps , it would look not only like the land of redistribution , but also like a place where the environment is taken care of , energy distribution is efficient , and talent is highly rewarded .
