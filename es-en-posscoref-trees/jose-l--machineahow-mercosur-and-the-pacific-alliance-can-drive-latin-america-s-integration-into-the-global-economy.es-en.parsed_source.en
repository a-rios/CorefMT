When Blocs Collide 
BUENOS AIRES - Latin America &apos;s two largest economic groupings - the Pacific Alliance and the Southern Common Market ( Mercosur ) - are pursuing further integration into the global economy in very different ways . 
Whether they succeed will depend not only on their individual strategies , but on whether these strategies complement each other . 
Only if they do can the region become a significant global player . 
The Pacific Alliance - comprising Chile , Colombia , Mexico , and Peru - represents nearly 40 % of Latin America &apos;s GDP , having grown at an average annual rate of 2.9 % since 2000 . 
Mercosur &apos;s five economies - Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay , Uruguay , and Venezuela - account for roughly 50 % of the region &apos;s GDP , and grew by an average of roughly 3.4 % per year during the same period , although growth has slowed since 2010 . 
But these economies &quot; full potential has yet to be unleashed . 
While Mercosur has been relatively successful in achieving commercial integration , with intra-bloc trade accounting for 15 % of member countries &quot; total trade ( and shares larger than 25 % for Argentina , Paraguay , and Uruguay ) , it has failed to deepen the integration of markets for goods and services . 
Moreover , though trade within the Pacific Alliance stands at only 4 % , member countries &quot; leaders were not particularly ambitious at their summit in May . 
While they agreed to eliminate in the short run all tariffs for 90 % of traded goods , the group has yet to make progress toward creating common rules on &quot; accumulation of origin &quot; ( whereby member countries treat the commodities that they import from each other as their own ) . 
It is not surprising that the Pacific Alliance , launched in 2012 , is lagging behind the two-decade-old Mercosur when it comes to commercial and other forms of integration . 
Indeed , Pacific Alliance members have the most free-trade agreements and are among the region &apos;s most competitive economies . 
Mercosur members , by contrast , remain wary of excessive trade liberalization and , with the exception of Brazil ( and to a lesser extent Uruguay ) , are significantly less competitive . 
As a result , over the last few years , the grouping has increasingly become a source of frustration , failing to advance integration and , in some areas , even regressing . 
In fact , despite some political and economic achievements , Mercosur has largely failed to advance the &quot; open regionalism &quot; - economic interdependence and further integration into the world economy through preferential liberalization and deregulation agreements - that the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean proposed two decades ago . 
Mercosur members have established almost no free-trade agreements with other countries , and the agreement that they have been negotiating for several years with the European Union remains out of reach , apparently because of opposition from Argentina . 
But Mercosur , too , is essential to Latin America &apos;s global economic integration , owing largely to its core country , Brazil , whose international connections and influence are unmatched in the region . 
If the Pacific Alliance &apos;s creation reflects waning support for Brazil as Latin America &apos;s leading voice in the international community , as seems likely , progress toward regional integration , as well as efforts to negotiate greater economic integration with Asia-Pacific countries ( one of the Alliance &apos;s core objectives ) , could be more difficult . 
Against this background , competition between the two groupings would be damaging to all . 
If Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance fail to devise complementary integration strategies , other countries may well decide that it is worth cooperating only with the Alliance , leaving Mercosur to fade into irrelevance . 
Even with a constructive approach , achieving deeper , higher-quality economic integration with Asia &apos;s emerging economies will be difficult . 
Latin America &apos;s exports to what is now the world &apos;s fastest-growing region are concentrated among primary goods . 
For example , 70 % of Latin America &apos;s exports to China in 2010 were commodities , and 25 % were goods manufactured from these materials , often with little added value . 
This highlights a significant problem for Latin America . 
Asian countries , like the developed economies , have a tariff-escalation system : the higher the value added to primary goods , the higher the protection . 
So , if Latin American countries wanted to export higher-value-added goods , they would face significantly higher tariffs , undermining their competitiveness in Asian markets . 
Given this , comprehensive free-trade agreements are essential . 
Increased regional cooperation would accelerate this process . 
Together , Latin America &apos;s economic groupings can provide an important platform from which to improve domestic economic stability , increase competitiveness , bolster regional integration , and gain a greater role in the global economy . 
Indeed , with bold , comprehensive , and harmonious strategies , Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance could finally secure Latin America &apos;s status as one of the world &apos;s major economic players .
