A Looming Anti-Depressants Crisis 
The widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly , right back to the days of opiates and cocaine , up through bromides , barbiturates , and tranquilizers : all proved to be highly addictive drugs , but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so . 
Now anti-depressants - global brands with household names - are the problem . 
The past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions . 
In England , prescriptions of anti-depressants now match Valium at its peak in 1979 . 
It is now clear that today &apos;s anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being . 
The sometimes intolerable withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-depressants also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects : substantial weight gain , loss of libido , and mood changes , to name just the most common complaints . 
Suspicions about such problems - especially about drug-induced suicidal behavior and sensitization to depression - have been rumbling for years , but searching scientific investigations have only just begun . 
An important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom &apos;s drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings . 
They will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug &apos;s use . 
This may help , it but won &apos;t address the real issue : how could regulators have allowed this problem to recur after so much bitter experience , and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves ? 
On the Richter scale of drug disasters , the looming anti-depressant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11 , where thalidomide rates a 10 . 
Time will tell , but the key point is this : the thalidomide disaster of the 1950 &apos;s and 1960 &apos;s happened because there was no independent control of drug safety , whereas the anti-depressant crisis has grown under the aegis of an elaborate , expensive , and global regulatory system . 
The nub of the anti-depressant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm , but that they were allowed to do so when the precedents were so plain . 
If and when this crisis is ever properly investigated , it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms , as expose questions about what medicine is and should be . 
These underlying issues seem all the more important because the Internet has for several years been groaning with evidence of the crisis to come . 
The explosive growth of the Internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering , presenting , and communicating evidence . 
It broadened and deepened understanding of the problems associated with anti-depressants , giving patients a collective voice , as never before . 
Previously , drug safety monitoring relied on occasional adverse reports from health professionals about patients &apos; reaction to medicines . 
But this crisis revealed these reports &apos; fundamental inadequacies , such that users &apos; experiences with drugs can never credibly be ignored again . 
United by the Internet , many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-depressant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that bore little resemblance to the labels &apos; warnings . 
The impact of this user intelligence has been profound : in 2003 , one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the incidence of withdrawal reactions from 0.2 % to 25 % ( even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is &quot; not habit forming &quot; at all ) . 
The anti-depressant crisis provides , for the first time , dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk . 
To be sure , user reports are not &quot; scientific &quot; and most , individually , might seem na√Øve , confused , exaggerated , mistaken , and / or just plain self-absorbed . 
Yet in this case they provided , collectively , more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials . 
So , now the question is not so much the value of patients &apos; reports , but the integrity of medical research and the state of science . 
&quot; Just how tainted has clinical medicine become , &quot; asked an editorial in the British medical journal 
The crisis now unfolding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science , the relationship between risk and benefit , and the conflict between imperatives of trade and health . 
The 1990 &apos;s saw &quot; depression &quot; formally redefined as a serotonin-deficiency disease and the scourge of millions - a convenient and seductive view , but deeply simplistic . 
The term &quot; drug dependence &quot; was also redefined , to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting . 
The ubiquitous term &quot; discontinuation symptoms &quot;  - Orwellian 
On the contrary , wishful thinking led experts to adduce &quot; discontinuation symptoms &quot; as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies . 
Later , suicides became routinely described as &quot; non-accidental overdoses , &quot; and the broad-spectrum term &quot; emotional lability &quot; came into vogue , despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and an outburst of tears . 
By contrast , user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality , rather than promote images that suit the vested interests involved . 
In the long run , the anti-depressant crisis thus may prove to be a blessing in disguise , but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve .
