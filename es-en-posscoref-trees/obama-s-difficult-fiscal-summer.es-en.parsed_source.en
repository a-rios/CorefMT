Obama &apos;s Difficult Fiscal Summer 
PALO ALTO - Barack Obama &apos;s administration suffered a string of fiscal setbacks this summer . 
But has it learned anything in recent months ? 
First , at the G-20 Summit in Canada , President Obama was soundly rebuffed by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , Great Britain &apos;s new prime minister , David Cameron , and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , among others , on his demand for additional fiscal stimulus ( more government spending ) . 
They are instead pursuing fiscal consolidation , following the immense explosion of public deficits and debt in the 2008-09 recession , and have called for cutting deficits in half by 2013 and stabilizing the government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2016 . 
Obama said at the summit that he will propose tough deficit-reduction measures next year . 
But talk is always cheaper than action . 
Thus far , the Obama administration has followed the opposite strategy , letting rip with new spending , while hoping that concern over deficits and debt will lead to pressure for higher taxes , possibly even a European-style value-added tax . 
But American voters aren &apos;t cooperating . 
To the surprise of many on the political left and most pundits , the clamor for a big expansion of government has not materialized . 
Instead , there has been a backlash against the barrage of federal government spending , deficits , and debt . 
Most political prognosticators are expecting large losses for Democrats in the November 2010 mid-term elections over this issue . 
Voters want less spending , not higher taxes . 
They sense that the American economy has out-performed the Western European economies largely because of its less expansive government . 
Second , the International Monetary Fund , under the G-20 &quot; s &quot; Mutual Assessment Process , &quot; suggested that the United States cut its fiscal deficit by 3 % of GDP more than planned - over $ 400 billion in additional cuts per year . 
The IMF believes current fiscal plans will deter US economic growth . 
Recently , the European Central Bank reiterated its position that serious fiscal consolidation would generate enough increase in private-sector confidence that gains in spending by households and businesses would more than offset lower spending by governments . 
The OECD , however , cautions governments not to consolidate too rapidly in a slow global recovery . 
America &apos;s major trading partners want the US to grow and buy more of their exports . 
As their economies recover , massive US government borrowing also will crowd out their government and private borrowers . 
The US deficit for 2010 is roughly $ 1.3 trillion . 
That is larger than the elevated borrowing by all other G-7 countries - the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , and Canada- combined , plus profligate Portugal and Greece . 
In short , the rest of the world wants the US to get its fiscal house in order as soon as possible . 
Third , the administration issued its mid-year budget update , which projects huge deficits as far as the eye can see . 
The proposed solution : a commission to recommend a path to balance the primary deficit ( the deficit excluding interest payments ) in 2015 . 
Presidents used to propose paths to a balanced budget . 
Now Obama wants to shift responsibility to an independent commission composed of Democrats and Republicans . 
Moreover , the goal of balancing the primary budget in 2015 is hardly encouraging . 
By then , Obama would have almost doubled the government debt-to-GDP ratio from an inherited safety zone of 40 % to a danger zone of almost 80 % , a level not seen since the immediate aftermath of World War II . 
And , of course , the longer-term deficits , driven by baby-boomer retirements and rising health and pension costs per beneficiary , grow progressively worse thereafter ( the commission will also recommend how to get the longer-term deficit under control ) . 
Fourth , the House of Representatives decided not even to attempt to pass a budget this year . 
This remarkable evasion is the first time the House has not passed a budget since the procedural reforms 35 years ago created the congressional budget committees and rules that legislators were supposed to use to control deficits . 
Fifth , Obama announced a new series of stimulus proposals just weeks before the mid-term elections . 
His political opponents quickly observed that this amounted to an admission that the first stimulus had failed . 
One proposal - immediate tax deductibility for capital investment - should be part of a permanent ( and overdue ) corporate-tax reform , but Obama has proposed it as a one-year measure to induce businesses to move capital spending forward to 2011 . 
Sixth , Budget Director Peter Orszag , the Obama administration &apos;s leading deficit hawk - at least prior to joining the administration - has resigned ( to be replaced by Jack Lew , a budget director under former President Bill Clinton ) . 
So who will now counsel Obama that piling on additional deficits and debt to fund a vast expansion of spending is bad economics , that the costs are likely to far outweigh the benefits , and that raising taxes will do permanent long-term damage to the economy ? 
Certainly not his effusive cheerleaders for the costly , ineffective February 2009 stimulus bill , a vast array of social engineering and pork that was ill suited to deal with the sharp contraction in private employment in the recession . 
Certainly not the businessmen and women in the Cabinet , based on their real world experience ; there aren &apos;t any . 
Let &apos;s hope that the late conversion to tough deficit rhetoric gets a lot of play . 
Voters have a way of holding elected officials accountable for their pronouncements . 
Without that , political leaders cannot be expected to show a lot of courage . 
Fortunately , it appears that voters in the US are far ahead of the politicians .
