Why Small Booms Cause Big Busts 
BERKELEY - As bubbles go , it was not a very big one . 
From 2002 to 2006 , the share of the American economy devoted to residential construction rose by 1.2 percentage points of GDP above its previous trend value , before plunging as the United States entered the greatest economic crisis in nearly a century . 
According to my rough calculations , the excess investment in the housing sector during this period totaled some $ 500 billion - by any measure a tiny fraction of the world economy at the time of the crash . 
The resulting damage , however , has been enormous . 
The economies of Europe and North America are roughly 6 % smaller than we would have expected them to be had there been no crisis . 
In other words , a relatively small amount of overinvestment is responsible for some $ 1.8 trillion in lost production every year . 
Given that the gap shows no signs of closing , and accounting for expected growth rates and equity returns , I estimate that the total loss to production will eventually reach nearly $ 3 quadrillion . 
For each dollar of overinvestment in the housing market , the world economy will have suffered $ 6,000 in losses . 
How can this be ? 
It is important to note that not all recessions cause so much pain . 
Financial blows in 1987 , 1991 , 1997 , 1998 , and 2001 ( when some $ 4 trillion of excess investment was lost when the dot-com bubble burst ) had little impact on the broader real economy . 
The reason why things were different this time can be found in a recently published paper by Òscar Jordà , Moritz Schularick , and Alan M. Taylor . 
Large credit booms , the authors show , can greatly worsen the damage caused by the collapse of an asset bubble . 
Historically , when a recession is caused by the collapse of an asset bubble that was not fueled by a credit boom , the economy is roughly 1-1.5 % below what it otherwise would have been five years after the start of the downturn . 
When a credit boom is involved , however , the damage is significantly greater . 
When the bubble is in equity prices , the economy performs 4 % below par , on average , after five years - and as much as 9 % below par when the bubble is in the housing market . 
Given these findings , it is clear that the distress experienced since the beginning of the economic crisis is not far out of line with historical experience . 
For many economists , recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle - the bust that necessarily follows , like a hangover , from any boom . 
John Maynard Keynes , however , had little time for this view . 
&quot; It seems an extraordinary imbecility that this wonderful outburst of productive energy should be the prelude to impoverishment and depression , &quot; Keynes wrote in 1931 , after the boom years of the 1920s had given way to the Great Depression . 
&quot; I find the explanation of the current business losses , of the reduction in output , and of the unemployment which necessarily ensues on this not in the high level of investment which was proceeding up to the spring of 1929 , but in the subsequent cessation of this investment . &quot; 
A few years later , Keynes proposed a fix to the problem . 
In The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , Keynes explained how booms are created when &quot; investments which will in fact yield , say , 2 % in conditions of full employment are made in the expectation of a yield of , say , 6 % and are valued accordingly . &quot; 
In a recession , the problem is flipped . 
Investments that would yield 2 % are &quot; expected to yield less than nothing . &quot; 
The result is a self-fulfilling prophecy , in which widespread unemployment does indeed drive the returns of those investments below zero . 
&quot; We reach a condition where there is a shortage of houses , &quot; Keynes wrote , &quot; but where nevertheless no one can afford to live in the houses that there are . &quot; 
His solution was simple : &quot; The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump ; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom . &quot; 
For Keynes , the underlying problem was a failure of the economy &apos;s credit channels . 
The financial reaction to the collapse of a bubble and the resulting wave of bankruptcies drives the natural rate of interest below zero , even though there are still many ways to put people productively to work . 
Today , we recognize that clogged credit channels can cause an economic downturn . 
There are three commonly proposed responses . 
The first is expansionary fiscal policies , with governments taking up the slack in the face of weak private investment . 
To these solutions , Keynes would have added a fourth , one known to us today as the &quot; Greenspan put &quot; - using monetary policy to validate the asset prices reached at the height of the bubble . 
Unfortunately , in a world in which fiscal austerity appears to exert a mesmerizing hold over politicians , and in which a 2 % inflation target seems set in stone , our policy options are rather limited .
