The Rise of Liberal Japan 
Most people looking at the rise of Asian power focus on China and India . 
They often forget that Japan &apos;s $ 5 trillion economy is the second largest in the world - more than China and India combined - with a per capita income that is ten times that of China . 
In addition , Japan spends $ 40 billion annually on defense , and has one of the top five military forces in the world . 
China &apos;s economy is growing more rapidly , and its total size will probably overtake Japan &apos;s in a decade or two , but any serious analysis of power in East Asia must include Japan as a major factor . 
Japan has played a unique role in world history . 
It was the first Asian country to encounter the forces of globalization , master them , and then make them serve its own interests . 
Moreover , Japan has reinvented itself twice . 
During the Meiji restoration of the nineteenth century , Japan scoured the world for ideas and technologies that allowed it to defeat a European great power in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 . 
Unfortunately , Japan moved onto militaristic imperialism in the 1930 &quot; s , which eventually led to its surrender and occupation in 1945 . 
But in the post-World War II period , Japan again used the forces of globalization to reinvent itself as an economic superpower that became the envy of the world . 
As Kenneth Pyle argues in his interesting new book Japan Rising , these reinventions were responses to external shifts in world politics . 
Now , with the growth of Chinese power , one of the great questions for this century will be how Japan responds . 
The Japanese are currently debating their role in global politics . 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has taken a more nationalistic stance than most of his predecessors , and his Liberal Democratic Party is committed to revising Article 9 of the constitution , which limits Japan &apos;s forces to self-defense . 
Public opinion is divided on the issue , and polls vary according to how the questions are asked . 
Nonetheless , many astute analysts believe that the constitution will be amended within the coming decade . 
While Abe wisely visited China and smoothed over relations ruffled by his predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , who repeatedly visited the Yasukuni Shrine ( where 14 class A war criminals from WWII are interred ) , many people are uncertain about his long-term vision . 
As one well-known Japanese intellectual told me during a recent visit to Tokyo , &quot; I can accept constitutional revision in the long run , but not while Abe is prime minister . &quot; 
In May , Asahi Shimbun , a major newspaper known for its left / liberal inclination , proposed an alternative vision for twenty-first century Japan in a series of 21 editorials . 
Asahi rejected the idea of revising Article 9 , and proposed instead that the Japanese Diet legalize the role of the Self-Defense Forces . 
The editorials accepted the treaty with the United States that serves as a basis for Japanese security , but rejected the idea that Japan has a right to collective self-defense . 
Interestingly , one of the reasons given for retaining Article 9 was that it would better enable Japan to resist American pressures to engage in military &quot; coalitions of the willing &quot; far from Japan &apos;s shores . 
Asahi worried about the precedent set when Koizumi sent Japan &apos;s Self-Defense Forces to Iraq , albeit in a non-combatant role , to please US President George W. Bush . 
Conservative voices argue just the opposite - that abolishing Article 9 is important for exactly such reasons . 
The alternative vision that Asahi offered was for Japan to become a world power as a provider and coordinator of global public goods from which all peoples can benefit and none can be excluded , such as freedom of the seas or a stable international monetary system . 
This would be a way for Japan to escape its reputation for insularity , avoid the mistakes of its military history , improve its relations with Asian neighbors who still remember the 1930 &quot; s , and increase Japan &apos;s &quot; soft &quot; or attractive power . 
More specifically , Asahi urged that Japan take the lead on managing global climate change by building on its record of successful innovation in energy conservation following the oil shocks of the 1970 &quot; s . 
In an interesting conjunction of events , shortly after the Asahi editorial was published , Abe committed Japan to halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , and to helping developing countries to join in a new post-Kyoto protocol climate regime . 
The liberal vision also includes a major Japanese role in stabilizing globalization by supporting international trade and monetary institutions ; alleviating global poverty by increasing overseas development assistance , particularly to Africa ; helping to develop instruments for conflict prevention and management such as the United Nations Peace-building Commission ; and participating in UN peacekeeping operations . 
As for the rise of Japan &apos;s giant neighbor , the liberal vision urges patience and tenacity in encouraging China to move toward greater transparency , the rule of law , and democratization , as well as adhering to international rules governing world order . 
While maintaining its alliance with America , &quot; Japan must always bear in mind the strategic importance of stabilizing its relationship with China . &quot; 
By helping China in the areas of energy and environmental issues , perhaps &quot; the scars left from the war with Japan may begin to heal . &quot; 
Japan has become more willing to use its power , and more aware of changes in the external balance of power . 
It is rising , but how ? 
As one Japanese liberal commented to me , &quot; this is our third response to globalization . 
What can we contribute this time ? &quot;
