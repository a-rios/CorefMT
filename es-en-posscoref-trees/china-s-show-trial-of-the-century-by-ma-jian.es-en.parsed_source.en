China &apos;s Show Trial of the Century 
LONDON - The trial , conviction , and suspended death sentence of Gu Kailai , the wife of purged Chinese leader Bo Xilai , has called into question not only China &apos;s legal system , but the very unity of the Communist Party leadership . 
Let us begin with the many questions raised at the trial . 
For starters , Gu claimed that she killed the British businessman Neil Heywood only to protect her son . 
But , given Gu &apos;s power as Bo &apos;s wife , she could have had someone like Heywood jailed or expelled from China at the snap of her fingers . 
No need for cyanide . 
Still , she not only admitted her guilt , but seemed to embrace it as a sort of historical necessity . 
&quot; In order to uphold the sanctity of the law , &quot; she told the court , &quot; I am willing to accept and calmly face whatever judgment I am given , and I also expect a fair and just judgment . &quot; 
Not since Stalin &apos;s show trials of the 1930 &quot; s has a defendant so effusively praised a judge who seemed bound to condemn her at a trial where no witness or evidence against her was presented . 
The bitter irony of Gu &apos;s high-speed trial is that she was a true believer in China &apos;s legal system . 
Indeed , following a victory in an American court , Gu , a lawyer , wrote a book in which she claimed that China provides &quot; the fairest method of trial . &quot; 
She continued , &quot; Chinese lawyers would not quibble over the meaning of each little word . 
Once they are sure that you murdered someone , you will be arrested , judged , and executed by firing squad . &quot; 
Indeed , Gu was an avatar of the Maoist form of legality that China has maintained long after Mao &apos;s death . 
Having failed the entrance examination to Peking University , Gu was nonetheless granted an exception and admitted to read law soon after the Communist Party restored the law departments . 
Prior to that , she sold pork in a Beijing market , where she earned the nicknamed , &quot; Yi dao zhun , &quot; meaning that she could hack off a desired slice of meat with one blow . 
Gu was one of the first lawyers to receive her license . 
But , with the Tiananmen Square incident of 1989 , the authorities clamped down on the profession &apos;s autonomy . 
The Party reasserted control over every aspect of justice through a core department : the Communist Party Central Committee &apos;s Political and Legal Affairs Committee ( PLAC ) . 
This totalitarian organ has no known address , yet it manages China &apos;s police , prosecutors , courts , and justice ministry , and appoints their leadership . 
All lawyers fall under its remit . 
Most important , all local PLAC secretaries simultaneously lead the local public-security bureau . 
Small wonder , then , that the artist Ai Weiwei could be detained in secret , Liu Xiaobo could be sentenced to 11 years in prison for starting a petition , and Li Wangya could &quot; commit suicide &quot; while in custody . 
But even this monolithic system of control is porous . 
Had Wang Lijun , the former Chongqing police commissioner and close ally of Bo Xilai , not feared for his life and fled to the United States &quot; consulate in Chengdu , Gu would still be helping Bo to rule the city . 
Wang is no saint . 
Before he became Bo &apos;s police commissioner , he was the director of the Field Psychology Research Center , where the condemned were executed and their live organs removed . 
Wang &apos;s paper , &quot; A Study of Organ and Receptor Transplantation after Execution by Injection , &quot; earned him the Guanghua Innovation Contribution Award . 
In the paper , he credits &quot; our achievements &quot; to the &quot; thousands of transplantations . &quot; 
Given his familiarity with the brutality of the Chinese system , Wang no doubt understood that , after falling out with Gu and Bo , the US consulate might be the only place he could find safety . 
After all , when it came to the public-security organs , the courts , and the prison system , Gu always had the final say . 
She acted as her husband &apos;s adviser for cracking down on crime and corruption , and was responsible for sending two people - including the PLAC secretary in Wushan County - to prison . 
In fact , a few days after killing Heywood , Gu donned a major general &apos;s uniform ( which could have belonged to her father , General Gu Jingsheng ) , convened police officers in Chongqing , and falsely claimed that she had received a secret order from the Ministry of Public Security to protect Wang &apos;s personal safety . 
The uniform , perhaps , was intended to intimidate the Chongqing police . 
But , in a strange and unexplained twist , Wang was whisked from the consulate to Beijing , where he presented the Party leadership with the evidence that brought about Bo &apos;s downfall and Gu &apos;s arrest . 
But revealing the skeletons in Bo &apos;s closet also meant revealing the secret world of the &quot; red aristocracy . &quot; 
So Wang can expect no leniency at his trial , which will most likely end with a commuted death sentence and forced labor . 
In order to protect the red aristocracy , the PLAC made no mention during Gu &apos;s trial of her myriad economic crimes . 
So , in the PLAC &apos;s rewrite of history , Heywood was murdered so that Gu could protect her son , Bo Guagua . 
And Wang did not defend China &apos;s honor by revealing Bo &apos;s and Gu &apos;s criminality , but aired his stories to hostile foreign forces . 
Only through his punishment can popular indignation be contained . 
But the Bo Xilai and Gu Kalai affair may only be a prologue , because the only clear truth to emerge from it is that the Party leadership is fractured . 
The wolves are now turning on each other .
