The Post-Crisis Crises 
NEW YORK - In the shadow of the euro crisis and America &apos;s fiscal cliff , it is easy to ignore the global economy &apos;s long-term problems . 
The most serious is global warming . 
While the global economy &apos;s weak performance has led to a corresponding slowdown in the increase in carbon emissions , it amounts to only a short respite . 
And we are far behind the curve : Because we have been so slow to respond to climate change , achieving the targeted limit of a two-degree ( centigrade ) rise in global temperature , will require sharp reductions in emissions in the future . 
Some suggest that , given the economic slowdown , we should put global warming on the backburner . 
On the contrary , retrofitting the global economy for climate change would help to restore aggregate demand and growth . 
At the same time , the pace of technological progress and globalization necessitates rapid structural changes in both developed and developing countries alike . 
Such changes can be traumatic , and markets often do not handle them well . 
Just as the Great Depression arose in part from the difficulties in moving from a rural , agrarian economy to an urban , manufacturing one , so today &apos;s problems arise partly from the need to move from manufacturing to services . 
New firms must be created , and modern financial markets are better at speculation and exploitation than they are at providing funds for new enterprises , especially small and medium-size companies . 
Moreover , making the transition requires investments in human capital that individuals often cannot afford . 
Among the services that people want are health and education , two sectors in which government naturally plays an important role ( owing to inherent market imperfections in these sectors and concerns about equity ) . 
Before the 2008 crisis , there was much talk of global imbalances , and the need for the trade-surplus countries , like Germany and China , to increase their consumption . 
That issue has not gone away ; indeed , Germany &apos;s failure to address its chronic external surplus is part and parcel of the euro crisis . 
China &apos;s surplus , as a percentage of GDP , has fallen , but the long-term implications have yet to play out . 
America &apos;s overall trade deficit will not disappear without an increase in domestic savings and a more fundamental change in global monetary arrangements . 
The former would exacerbate the country &apos;s slowdown , and neither change is in the cards . 
As China increases its consumption , it will not necessarily buy more goods from the United States . 
In fact , it is more likely to increase consumption of non-traded goods - like health care and education - resulting in profound disturbances to the global supply chain , especially in countries that had been supplying the inputs to China &apos;s manufacturing exporters . 
Finally , there is a worldwide crisis in inequality . 
The problem is not only that the top income groups are getting a larger share of the economic pie , but also that those in the middle are not sharing in economic growth , while in many countries poverty is increasing . 
In the US , equality of opportunity has been exposed as a myth . 
While the Great Recession has exacerbated these trends , they were apparent long before its onset . 
Indeed , I ( and others ) have argued that growing inequality is one of the reasons for the economic slowdown , and is partly a consequence of the global economy &apos;s deep , ongoing structural changes . 
An economic and political system that does not deliver for most citizens is one that is not sustainable in the long run . 
Eventually , faith in democracy and the market economy will erode , and the legitimacy of existing institutions and arrangements will be called into question . 
The good news is that the gap between the emerging and advanced countries has narrowed greatly in the last three decades . 
Nonetheless , hundreds of millions of people remain in poverty , and there has been only a little progress in reducing the gap between the least developed countries and the rest . 
Here , unfair trade agreements - including the persistence of unjustifiable agricultural subsidies , which depress the prices upon which the income of many of the poorest depend - have played a role . 
The developed countries have not lived up to their promise in Doha in November 2001 to create a pro-development trade regime , or to their pledge at the G-8 summit in Gleneagles in 2005 to provide significantly more assistance to the poorest countries . 
The market will not , on its own , solve any of these problems . 
Global warming is a quintessential &quot; public goods &quot; problem . 
To make the structural transitions that the world needs , we need governments to take a more active role - at a time when demands for cutbacks are increasing in Europe and the US . 
As we struggle with today &apos;s crises , we should be asking whether we are responding in ways that exacerbate our long-term problems . 
The path marked out by the deficit hawks and austerity advocates both weakens the economy today and undermines future prospects . 
The irony is that , with insufficient aggregate demand the major source of global weakness today , there is an alternative : invest in our future , in ways that help us to address simultaneously the problems of global warming , global inequality and poverty , and the necessity of structural change .
