The Old in the New Anti-Semitism 
Why do so many Holocaust survivors sense emerging anti-Jewish threats before seeing them ? 
Because they know how supposedly &quot; innocent &quot; insinuations grow into accusations and that accusations can become discrimination and soon after legislation . 
It is then that hysteria is set loose . 
Survivors sound the alarm because they know what is at stake . 
By doing so they strengthen our democracies in ways that no other people can . 
We listen to the survivors so that we survive . 
That we have cause to listen is clear , as the results of the first round of the French presidential elections demonstrate . 
But not only demagogues like Jean-Marie Le-Pen and Europe &apos;s other lumpen extreme rightists incite trouble . 
Throughout the 20 th century people who regarded themselves as &quot; intellectuals &quot; often became fellow travelers of fascism or communism without joining political parties based on those ideologies . 
In the 21 st century - in the &quot; chattering classes &quot; linked to the mass media , to politics , government and universities - we encounter people who condemn Israel in language that reminds us of the fellow travelers of those fallen anti-democratic movements . 
These are not majority voices in the Western world - not yet , thankfully - but are powerful and influential minority ones . 
Take the case of the French Ambassador to Britain . 
At a dinner party in London not long ago he described Israel as &quot; that shitty little country . &quot; 
His vulgar comments are not particularly frightful . 
What is worrying is the response . 
He was not recalled by his government ; 
Tony Blair &apos;s government did not request his recall ; popular opinion treated the matter as merely another scandal . 
Indeed , the French press thought the ambassador a victim of Britain &apos;s tabloid press , not of his contemptible sentiments . 
Sadly , the French ambassador to the Court of St. James has many allies among Europe &apos;s elites . 
But Ambassador Bernard did provide a service ; he helped us to recognize how widespread this new anti-Jewishness is . 
As one columnist notably said , Israel has become &quot; the object of hate that dare not speak its name . &quot; 
But we must not only dare , we are obliged to speak . 
We must not be silent about the daily attacks in France against Jews and synagogues . 
It is a shame for all of Europe that many French Jews cannot send their children to school without worrying about their security . 
Anti-Semitic outrages are also reported elsewhere : in Berlin and London , in Switzerland , Italy , Sweden , the Netherlands , and in parts of Eastern Europe . 
We must not be silent about the fact that denial of the Holocaust is becoming routine ; so too the parallels that anti-Semites / anti-Zionists draw between Israel and the Third Reich . 
We must &quot; confront the new Nazi plague which is nesting in Israel , &quot; wrote a Syrian paper as Palestinian TV portrays Israeli soldiers as rapists and cold-blooded murderers . 
The Mufti of Jerusalem stated that &quot; it &apos;s not my fault that Hitler hated the Jews , they hate them just about everywhere . &quot; 
One Friday sermon on Palestinian TV told Muslims &quot; to have no mercy on the Jews , no matter where you are ... kill them ... and those Americans who are like them . &quot; 
What we must remember about anti-Semitism is that , although it always starts with Jews , it never stops with Jews . 
Jew-hatred , if not contained , almost always develops into assaults on other groups and minorities and finally undermines democratic institutions and the rule of law . 
So the struggle against anti-Semitism is a task for Jews and non-Jews alike . 
But it is now a more diffuse struggle than ever because an astonishing element in today &apos;s anti-Semitism is its flexibility . 
Although anti-Semitism never changes its goal - to attack Jews - it does change its face , its strategy , its rationalizations , even its vocabulary . 
Once Jewish religion was the target . 
When Judaism did not surrender , Jews were expelled or killed . 
In the 19 th century , when race became an intoxicating theory , Jews were attacked for being an evil race . 
Today , with Israel a source of pride and protection for most Jews , Zionism is slandered as a racist ideology . 
I do not equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism . 
It is as legitimate to oppose certain Israeli policies and decisions as it is to scrutinize any nation . 
But anti-Zionism is becoming akin to anti-Semitism . Sometimes anti-Zionists claim that they are not against Jews but are &quot; only &quot; against the Jewish state . 
But suppose someone said : &quot; I am only against the existence of Great Britain , I am not anti-British ! &quot; 
Or if somebody told me that &quot; I love Swedes , but Sweden should be abolished . &quot; 
You would not believe them . 
It is hard to love or respect a people and hate their state . 
Yet people pretend that they can where Israel is concerned . 
In several UN agencies , Israel-bashing is routine . 
This demonization of the only democracy in the Middle East is a central part of the new anti-Jewishness . 
When Israel is described &quot; as the enemy of all good and the repository of all that is evil , &quot; says Professor Irwin Cotler , a member of Canada &apos;s parliament , it becomes a &quot; teaching of contempt &quot; within the UN . 
This constant singling out of one nation as humanity &apos;s enemy is in fact a campaign directed against the Jewish people . 
Indeed , many anti-Jewish outbursts in a number of countries are rooted in condemnations of Israel that exploit anti-Semitic terminology . 
Attacks on synagogues are often triggered by a defaming language about the Middle East . 
Compared to previous anti-Jewish outbreaks , today &apos;s anti-Semitism is less an attack on individual Jews than an attack on the &quot; collective Jew , &quot; the state of Israel . 
Such attacks , however , have started a chain reaction of assaults across Europe and Latin America on individual Jews and Jewish institutions . 
In the past the most dangerous anti-Semites were those who sought to make the world Judenrein , free of Jews . 
Today the most dangerous anti-Semites are those who want to make the world Judenstaatrein , free of a Jewish state .
