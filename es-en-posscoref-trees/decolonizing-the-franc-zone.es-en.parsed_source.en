Decolonizing the Franc Zone 
DAKAR - France is wrestling with a burden of debts and public deficits that led Standard 
Poor &apos;s recently to downgrade its credit rating . 
Even as the risk of recession looms , the country has been forced to implement a drastic austerity program . 
But France &apos;s woes are also being felt far beyond its borders , sparking rumors of a possible devaluation of the CFA franc , the common currency of the franc zone , which comprises 14 African countries and the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean . 
The franc zone is , in fact , an appendage of the French economy . 
The CFA franc &amp; is convertible in &amp; euros and freely transferable to France , whose companies control the lion &apos;s share of the franc zone &apos;s private sector and receive most of its public contracts . 
In effect , this is a formula for perpetual mass capital flight . 
The &amp; CFA &amp; franc &apos;s &amp; fixed exchange rate is pegged to the &amp; euro and &amp; overvalued in order to shield French companies from euro &amp; depreciation . 
But the currency &apos;s overvaluation also underlies the lack of competitiveness that curbs franc-zone countries &quot; capacity to diversify their economies , create added value , and develop . 
Scandalously , they still have to surrender 50 % of their foreign-exchange reserves to the French Treasury as a guarantee of the CFA franc &apos;s limited convertibility and free transfer to France . 
To curb the public deficits that such policies entail , the franc-zone countries underwent drastic structural-adjustment programs throughout the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank . 
The CFA franc was sharply devalued in 1994 , and outstanding debts &amp; were &amp; reduced . 
Since then , the IMF and the Bank have kept franc-zone budget deficits under tight surveillance , which has limited the direct impact of sovereign-debt worries on these countries . 
As a result , there is no need to devalue &amp; the currency &amp; again , &amp; unless France unilaterally decides to do so , as &amp; it has several times over the past decades . 
From the end of World War II until the adoption of the euro , France devalued its own franc 14 times in order to bolster competiveness &amp; and exports , with the CFA franc devalued along with it each time . 
The French economy , with its strong industrial base and dynamic private- and public-sector companies , benefited from these devaluations , thanks to increased exports ( including to its former African colonies ) . 
But the franc-zone countries did not fare nearly so well . 
Lacking well-developed industrial production and intra-community trade , devaluation brought &amp; them higher &amp; import prices , inflation , and &amp; rising unemployment . 
France has always drawn on its &amp; African reserves , especially during economic downturns . &amp; It did so in the 1930 &quot; s , when the franc zone &amp; helped France to &amp; survive &amp; the Great Depression , and again during World War II , when the zone bankrolled General Charles de Gaulle &apos;s &amp; resistance to the German occupation . 
Another devaluation of the CFA franc today might deflate France &apos;s debts to the franc zone and boost its African-based export industries , but it would worsen the &amp; franc-zone &amp; countries &quot; miseries . 
It is no wonder that the franc-zone countries have been unable to &amp; catch up with the performance of neighboring economies , most of which are undergoing the &amp; most prosperous &amp; period &amp; in their history . 
Since 2000 , sub-Saharan African countries &quot; annual GDP growth has averaged 5-7 % , compared to 2.5-3 % for the franc zone . 
This gap should encourage the franc zone &apos;s member countries to reject their relationship with France . 
There are two ways that they might go about it . 
First , franc-zone countries could issue their own currencies - a radical approach that would face serious obstacles . 
France wields overwhelming political clout in its former African colonies , including veto power over the franc zone &apos;s two central banks . 
France can thus block any move that it deems a threat to its interests . 
Moreover , the franc-zone countries that are small and produce no oil prefer to pool their reserves in order to reduce their vulnerability to external shocks . 
The second way implies a &amp; thorough overhaul of the &amp; system . &amp; This would entail pegging the &amp; CFA &amp; franc &amp; not only &amp; to the &amp; euro , &amp; but also to a basket of other &amp; currencies , abolishing the fixed exchange rate and the CFA franc &apos;s convertibility , and fast-tracking economic integration . 
But , as the euro &apos;s current troubles demonstrate , a common currency requires unified and centrally established monetary and fiscal policies , which presupposes political integration - a process that is likely to be no less difficult in Africa than it has proved to be in Europe . 
There is no easy answer . 
But it is time for &amp; the franc zone &apos;s two leading regional groupings - the West African Economic and Monetary Union and the Central African Economic and Monetary Community - to &amp; begin playing a decisive role in overhauling the franc zone &apos;s architecture . 
France may not like it , but the best interests &amp; of the franc zone &apos;s citizens should come first .
