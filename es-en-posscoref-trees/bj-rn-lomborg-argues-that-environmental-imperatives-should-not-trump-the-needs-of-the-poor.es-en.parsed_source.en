The Power to Develop 
CANBERRA - Trade-offs are an inherent part of life . 
We all recognize this from our private budgets . 
To fix the roof , we may have to accept a less extravagant summer vacation . 
When we pick a cheaper wine , we can splurge on dessert . 
Trade-offs also pervade environmental policy : Cutting more of one pollutant , for example , leaves fewer resources to address other issues . 
For example , coal is phenomenally polluting , but it also provides for cheap and reliable power , which drives development . 
Over the past 30 years , China has lifted 680 million people out of poverty , mostly through the use of coal . 
The average Chinese has become more than 13 times richer . 
At the same time , Beijing and numerous other Chinese metropolises are experiencing debilitating smog , reminiscent of London in the 1950 &quot; s . 
About 1.2 million Chinese die prematurely each year because of outdoor air pollution . 
Measurements from Beijing show that upwards of 16 % of the air pollution comes from coal . 
The World Bank estimates that China &apos;s total annual air-pollution costs - based on what Chinese themselves indicate they are willing to pay to reduce their risk of dying - could be as high as 4 % of GDP . 
And yet the Chinese trade-off has been phenomenally beneficial . 
In 1982 , the average Chinese earned $ 585 a year ; last year , she earned $ 7,958 . 
Meanwhile , the annual per capita environmental cost is $ 318 . 
Of course , the Chinese could do more to cut air pollution . 
It is estimated that meeting the World Health Organization &apos;s interim standards could reduce damages by $ 80 per capita . 
But that pales in comparison to the $ 600 increase in per capita income in 2013 . 
Nonetheless , many who live in rich countries confidently declare that this trade-off is not in the interest of the poor . 
The United States , the United Kingdom , and other European countries announced this year that they will not support international finance for coal-fired power plants in developing countries . 
These countries abstained in 2010 when the World Bank helped finance South Africa &apos;s Medupi coal-fired power plant . 
Today , they would vote it down . 
But Medupi will provide 10 % of South Africa &apos;s electricity and prevent rolling blackouts . 
As the South African finance minister , Pravin Gordhan , explained , &quot; to sustain the growth rates we need to create jobs , we have no choice but to build new generating capacity - relying on what , for now , remains our most abundant and affordable energy source : coal . &quot; 
The US government even acknowledged that , without a coal-fired power plant , South Africa &apos;s &quot; economic recovery will suffer , adversely impacting electrification , job creation , and social indicators . &quot; 
Energy poverty is even more acute for the three billion people - almost half of the world &apos;s population - who burn dung , cardboard , and twigs indoors to cook and keep warm . 
The WHO estimates that while outdoor air pollution in developing-country cities may be ten times higher than in advanced-country cities , average indoor air pollution , caused by burning wood and dung , is a hundred times higher . 
Indeed , indoor air pollution kills 3.5 million people each year , making it the world &apos;s deadliest environmental problem . 
The world &apos;s three billion energy-poor people need cheap electricity to cook and keep warm . 
And , for the foreseeable future , that electricity will be generated by fossil fuels . 
Some environmental campaigners argue for cleaner stoves . 
But , while this might be part of the solution , it is essentially telling the poor to live with slightly less polluting open fires in their homes . 
Moreover , studies indicate that even significant air-pollution reduction starting at high levels will have only a minor impact . 
Others claim that renewables are the way to go . 
Green energy , especially wind , can indeed help African countries , for example , get some electricity to remote , rural areas ; but the grid will do the most good for the most people . 
According to a recent World Bank study , distributed renewable energy &quot; will be the lowest cost option for a minority of households in Africa , even when likely cost reductions over the next 20 years are considered . &quot; 
Popular solar lights cost almost $ 2 per kWh . 
Using hydro , gas , and oil , the grid cost for the main population centers in Ethiopia , Ghana , and Kenya will likely be $ 0.16-25 per kWh . 
In South Africa , where coal powers 90 % of electricity , the cost is just $ 0.09 per kWh . 
True , electricity from coal will cause extra air pollution . 
But pollution from indoor air pollution , which would disappear with electrification , accounts for 16 % of outdoor air pollution . 
Even assuming ( unrealistically ) that coal produces all of the world &apos;s air pollution , we could generate 250 kWh / year with coal for every one of the three billion energy-poor people and still end up with lower air pollution . 
Moreover , it is easy and fairly cheap to cut coal pollution 90 % or more with scrubbers . 
For many opponents of coal , the issue is global warming . 
According to Christiana Figueres , the United Nations climate chief , coal-fueled development has &quot; an unacceptably high cost to human and environmental health . &quot; 
She argues that we need to close 75 % of the planet &apos;s coal-fired power plants , including all of South Africa &apos;s , because they emit too much CO2 . 
Al Gore &apos;s climate adviser , James Hansen , argues that if we allow developing countries to &quot; come up to the level of the developed world , then the planet is done for . &quot; 
Yes , the world needs to address global warming ( mainly through higher investments in green research and development , and by promoting exploitation of cheap , less-polluting shale gas ) . 
But global warming will cause damage worth possibly 1-5 % of GDP by the end of the century , when the UN expects developing-world incomes to have risen by 1,400-1,800 % . 
Meanwhile , poverty is killing millions right now , with an impact on global GDP that is likely an order of magnitude higher . 
And too many people , however well-intentioned , are unwilling to acknowledge the tradeoffs needed to improve poor people &apos;s lives .
