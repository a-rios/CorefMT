The Water Hegemon 
NEW DELHI - International discussion about China &apos;s rise has focused on its increasing trade muscle , growing maritime ambitions , and expanding capacity to project military power . 
One critical issue , however , usually escapes attention : China &apos;s rise as a hydro-hegemon with no modern historical parallel . 
No other country has ever managed to assume such unchallenged riparian preeminence on a continent by controlling the headwaters of multiple international rivers and manipulating their cross-border flows . 
China , the world &apos;s biggest dam builder - with slightly more than half of the approximately 50,000 large dams on the planet - is rapidly accumulating leverage against its neighbors by undertaking massive hydro-engineering projects on transnational rivers . 
Asia &apos;s water map fundamentally changed after the 1949 Communist victory in China . 
Most of Asia &apos;s important international rivers originate in territories that were forcibly annexed to the People &apos;s Republic of China . 
The Tibetan Plateau , for example , is the world &apos;s largest freshwater repository and the source of Asia &apos;s greatest rivers , including those that are the lifeblood for mainland China and South and Southeast Asia . 
Other such Chinese territories contain the headwaters of rivers like the Irtysh , Illy , and Amur , which flow to Russia and Central Asia . 
This makes China the source of cross-border water flows to the largest number of countries in the world . 
Yet China rejects the very notion of water sharing or institutionalized cooperation with downriver countries . 
Whereas riparian neighbors in Southeast and South Asia are bound by water pacts that they have negotiated between themselves , China does not have a single water treaty with any co-riparian country . 
Indeed , having its cake and eating it , China is a dialogue partner but not a member of the Mekong River Commission , underscoring its intent not to abide by the Mekong basin community &apos;s rules or take on any legal obligations . 
Worse , while promoting multilateralism on the world stage , China has given the cold shoulder to multilateral cooperation among river-basin states . 
The lower-Mekong countries , for example , view China &apos;s strategy as an attempt to &quot; divide and conquer . &quot; 
Although China publicly favors bilateral initiatives over multilateral institutions in addressing water issues , it has not shown any real enthusiasm for meaningful bilateral action . 
As a result , water has increasingly become a new political divide in the country &apos;s relations with neighbors like India , Russia , Kazakhstan , and Nepal . 
China deflects attention from its refusal to share water , or to enter into institutionalized cooperation to manage common rivers sustainably , by flaunting the accords that it has signed on sharing flow statistics with riparian neighbors . 
These are not agreements to cooperate on shared resources , but rather commercial accords to sell hydrological data that other upstream countries provide free to downriver states . 
In fact , by shifting its frenzied dam building from internal rivers to international rivers , China is now locked in water disputes with almost all co-riparian states . 
Those disputes are bound to worsen , given China &apos;s new focus on erecting mega-dams , best symbolized by its latest addition on the Mekong - the 4,200-megawatt Xiaowan Dam , which dwarfs Paris &apos;s Eiffel Tower in height - and a 38,000-megawatt dam planned on the Brahmaputra at Metog , close to the disputed border with India . 
The Metog Dam will be twice as large as the 18,300-megawatt Three Gorges Dam , currently the world &apos;s largest , construction of which uprooted at least 1.7 million Chinese . 
In addition , China has identified another mega-dam site on the Brahmaputra at Daduqia , which , like Metog , is to harness the force of a nearly 3,000-meter drop in the river &apos;s height as it takes a sharp southerly turn from the Himalayan range into India , forming the world &apos;s longest and steepest canyon . 
The Brahmaputra Canyon - twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the United States - holds Asia &apos;s greatest untapped water reserves . 
The countries likely to bear the brunt of such massive diversion of waters are those located farthest downstream on rivers like the Brahmaputra and Mekong - Bangladesh , whose very future is threatened by climate and environmental change , and Vietnam , a rice bowl of Asia . 
China &apos;s water appropriations from the Illy River threaten to turn Kazakhstan &apos;s Lake Balkhash into another Aral Sea , which has shrunk to less than half its original size . 
In addition , China has planned the &quot; Great Western Route , &quot; the proposed third leg of the Great South-North Water Diversion Project - the most ambitious inter-river and inter-basin transfer program ever conceived - whose first two legs , involving internal rivers in China &apos;s ethnic Han heartland , are scheduled to be completed within three years . 
The Great Western Route , centered on the Tibetan Plateau , is designed to divert waters , including from international rivers , to the Yellow River , the main river of water-stressed northern China , which also originates in Tibet . 
With its industry now dominating the global hydropower-equipment market , China has also emerged as the largest dam builder overseas . 
From Pakistani-held Kashmir to Burma &apos;s troubled Kachin and Shan states , China has widened its dam building to disputed or insurgency-torn areas , despite local backlashes . 
For example , units of the People &apos;s Liberation Army are engaged in dam and other strategic projects in the restive , Shia-majority region of Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-held Kashmir . 
And China &apos;s dam building inside Burma to generate power for export to Chinese provinces has contributed to renewed bloody fighting recently , ending a 17-year ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army and the government . 
As with its territorial and maritime disputes with India , Vietnam , Japan , and others , China is seeking to disrupt the status quo on international-river flows . 
Persuading it to halt further unilateral appropriation of shared waters has thus become pivotal to Asian peace and stability . 
Otherwise , China is likely to emerge as the master of Asia &apos;s water taps , thereby acquiring tremendous leverage over its neighbors &quot; behavior .
