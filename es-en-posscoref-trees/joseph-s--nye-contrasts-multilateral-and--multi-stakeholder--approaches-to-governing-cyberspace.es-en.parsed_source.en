Safeguarding Cyberspace 
CAMBRIDGE - Brazil recently hosted NETmundial , the first global conference on Internet governance , attended by 800 representatives of governments , corporations , civil-society organizations , and technologists . 
Based on the notion of &quot; multi-stakeholderism , &quot; the meeting produced a 12-page &quot; outcomes &quot; document . 
Nonetheless , at the end of the conference , there was still no consensus on global cyber governance . 
Many governments continued to advocate traditional United Nations voting procedures for making global decisions , and defend their right to control domestic cyber activities . 
In a sense , this is not surprising . 
After all , though the Internet is a complex , fast-evolving , and all-encompassing global resource , it has not been around for very long . 
While the World Wide Web was conceived in 1989 , it was only in the last 15 years that the number of Web sites burgeoned , and Internet technology began to transform global supply chains . 
Since 1992 , the number of Internet users has exploded from one million to nearly three billion . 
Just like that , the Internet became a substrate of economic , social , and political life . 
In its early days , the Internet was often characterized as the ultimate egalitarian conduit of free-flowing information - a harbinger of the end of government controls . 
Ultimately , however , the Internet poses a major governance challenge , exemplified in ongoing efforts to understand the implications of ubiquitous mobility and the collection and storage of &quot; big data . &quot; 
The governance challenge stems from the fact that cyberspace is a combination of virtual properties , which defy geographical boundaries , and physical infrastructure , which fall under sovereign jurisdictions . 
Control of the physical layer can have both territorial and extraterritorial effects on the virtual layers . 
At the same time , attacks can be launched from the low-cost virtual realm against the physical domain , where resources are scarce and expensive . 
The Internet began as a small village of known users , where an authentication layer of code was unnecessary and the development of norms was simple . 
Though cyberspace offered the advantages of access to information and easy communication to a growing number of people , it became a breeding ground for crime , hacker attacks , and threats to governments . 
Efforts to limit the risks incurred in this volatile environment have focused on creating private networks and &quot; walled gardens &quot; ( closed platforms ) - cyber equivalents to the seventeenth-century enclosures that were used to solve that era &apos;s &quot; tragedy of the commons . &quot; 
Given that security is a traditional function of the state , some observers believe that growing insecurity will lead to a greater role for governments in cyberspace . 
Indeed , accounts of cyber war may be exaggerated , but cyber espionage is rampant , and more than 30 governments are reputed to have developed offensive capabilities and doctrines for the use of cyber weapons . 
Ever since the Stuxnet virus was used to disrupt Iran &apos;s nuclear program in 2009-2010 , governments have taken the threat posed by cyber weapons very seriously . 
Governments also want to protect their societies from what comes through the Internet . 
For example , China &apos;s government has not only created a &quot; Great Firewall &quot; of software filters ; it also requires that companies take responsibility for censoring their public content . 
But China &apos;s government - and others that practice Internet censorship - still want to reap the economic benefits of connectivity . 
That tension leads to imperfect compromises . 
A similar tension exists in the effort to create international Internet-governance norms . 
While authoritarian countries like China and Russia seek &quot; information security , &quot; including the kind of overt censorship that would be prohibited in countries like the United States , Western democracies pursue &quot; cyber security . &quot; 
This divergence was starkly apparent in 2012 , at a conference convened in Dubai by the UN &apos;s International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) . 
Though the meeting was ostensibly about updating telephony regulations , the underlying issue was the ITU &apos;s role in Internet governance . 
Authoritarian regimes and many developing countries believe that their approach to sovereignty , security , and development would benefit from the multilateral processes that the ITU employs . 
The vote in Dubai was 89 to 55 against the &quot; democratic &quot; governments . 
This outcome raised concerns about a crisis in Internet governance - concerns that the recent conference in Brazil alleviated , but only slightly . 
Stayed tuned . 
There are many more conferences scheduled on cyber governance - and a lot more work to be done .
