Seeing Double at Central Banks 
OXFORD - Central banks are now targeting liquidity , not just inflation . 
The credit boom of the past decade highlighted the inadequacy of focusing only on prices , and underscored the need for the monetary authority of a country ( or group of countries in the case of the European Central Bank and the eurozone ) to monitor the financial sector . 
Macroprudential regulation is the new term of art among central bankers , supplementing their well-established inflation-targeting regimes . 
This shift in focus could radically change monetary policy , but for better or worse ? 
The Bank of England may be blazing the way in this transition , but the ECB and the United States Federal Reserve Board are taking on more financial regulation as well . 
Indeed , the ECB &apos;s European Systemic Risk Board serves a function that is similar to the United Kingdom &apos;s new Financial Policy Committee ( FPC ) . 
At the end of a recent discussion with Andy Haldane , the Bank of England &apos;s Executive Director for Financial Stability and a member of the FPC , I asked : What happens if inflation is high and lending is low ? 
Under this scenario , the Bank of England &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) would favor an increase in interest rates , while the FPC would want to loosen monetary conditions . 
I am still pondering the question that I posed to Haldane , because the potential for such contradictory policy imperatives appears unavoidable - never more so than now . 
The last decade - until the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 - was known as the Great Moderation , a period of low inflation and strong growth that reflected major new developments , such as global integration of emerging markets and major central banks &quot; adoption of inflation-targeting regimes during the 1990 &quot; s . 
In the United Kingdom , the Bank of England was made independent in 1997 , and given a target of 2 % annual inflation . 
Price stability during the 2000 &quot; s explained the low interest rates that supported strong growth . 
But , it also meant that a credit boom with international dimensions was not monitored , resulting in the most spectacular bust of modern times , including the near collapse of the banking system . 
Amid the UK &apos;s institutional changes in 1997 , financial regulation was put in the hands of the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) . 
But the FSA is soon to be replaced by the FPC , resulting in a system that aims to avoid an &quot; underlap &quot; of authority that leaves no one in charge . 
The FPC is now part of the Bank of England , which is meant somehow to ensure that monetary policy takes into account the financial sector . 
The change reflects central bankers &quot; argument that to target credit or liquidity requires another tool . 
Interest rates are too blunt an instrument , and risk damaging the wider economy when used to prick a housing bubble , as recent research by BOE Deputy Governor Charlie Bean has shown . 
So the FPC would wield instruments such as capital ratios or loan-to-value ratios to manage liquidity , and placing two instruments for two targets - liquidity and inflation - within the BOE would ensure coordination . 
But what if the two targets are in conflict ? 
During the pre-crisis Great Moderation , restraining lending through regulatory tools probably would have worked , because it was unlikely to push the economy into deflation , as hiking interest rates would have done . 
But that is not the problem now . 
The current issue is that the monetary aggregate ( M4 ) measure of lending to the private sector is at its lowest level in a decade , while inflation is more than double the BOE &apos;s target . 
If the FPC lowers capital requirements to encourage lending , but the MPC raises rates to cope with inflation , banks would face competing pressures . 
Looser lending rules would conflict with the higher cost of money . 
Because both the FPC and the MPC rely on a monetary-transmission mechanism that operates through banks , it isn &apos;t clear that inflation-targeting and liquidity maintenance can be so neatly separated . 
There is also the added complexity of global regulation . 
The idea is that countries would coordinate counter-cyclical regulatory measures , thereby preventing capital from skirting them by moving across borders . 
But , what if - and this is very likely - business cycles are not coordinated ? 
After all , China is tightening credit while the UK is encouraging more of it . 
Closer to Britain , the ECB is potentially embarking on a tightening cycle and withdrawing hundreds of billions of euros in liquidity provided during the crisis , owing to concerns about &quot; addicted &quot; banks . 
Will it really loosen capital requirements in order to align itself with the BOE ? 
Again , such policies would have worked a decade ago , in an environment of low inflation and rapid lending growth . 
But times have changed , and monetary policy will , of course , shift accordingly . 
The problem is that if bodies like the FPC become as important to central banks as monetary policy committees , we may be left wondering which target takes precedence when they clash .
