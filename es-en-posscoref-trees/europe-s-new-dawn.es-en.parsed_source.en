Europe \ u0027s New Dawn 
Today in Rome , the heads of state and government of the EU &apos;s 25 member states will sign the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe . 
We have come a long way since the six founding members formed the European Economic Community back in March 1957 - also in Rome . 
After the Treaty is signed , it will go before the national parliaments for approval . 
So it is crucially important to understand why the Treaty deserves to be ratified . 
Simply put , it places the interests of Europe &apos;s citizens more than ever at the heart of the European Union &apos;s activities . 
It does so in four ways . 
First , the Constitutional Treaty guarantees that the Union &apos;s institutions will respect the fundamental rights of everyone within the EU . 
The &quot; catalogue of fundamental rights &quot; included in the Constitution is extensive , centering on respect for human dignity , freedom , and equality , and also on the principles of democracy and the rule of law . 
By enshrining them in the Constitution , these fundamental rights and principles become legally binding , and citizens will have greater scope for bringing appeals to the Court of Justice . 
In this respect , the EU leads the world in the protection of fundamental rights . 
Second , the Treaty makes the EU more democratic and brings government closer to Europe &apos;s citizens . 
The Union has no business interfering in matters that can be dealt with successfully at the local , regional , or national level . 
The EU &apos;s objectives are precisely those that countries are unable to achieve on their own , for example , a stronger economy and greater security . 
The Constitutional Treaty includes guarantees to ensure that the EU adheres to this principle strictly . 
National parliaments will be able to call a time-out if Brussels makes proposals that seem to interfere unnecessarily . 
Should one-third of national parliaments so wish , the European Commission will be required to reconsider a proposal . 
In addition , the Constitutional Treaty gives citizens the right to ask the European Commission to take action on a specific point . 
A citizens &apos; initiative of this kind will require one million signatures , obtained in different countries . 
At the same time , the European Parliament will have far greater powers . 
It will have joint decision-making authority in many more areas , including the budget . 
As a result , European citizens &apos; elected representatives will be better able to scrutinize the work of the Commission . 
Third , the Treaty makes the EU more open and more transparent . 
Citizens want powers to be clearly defined and decisions to be taken openly in a way that they can understand . 
Many people despair of finding their way through the maze of current EU treaties and their numerous amendments . 
Outside Brussels , few people can explain the &quot; pillar &quot; structure and the distinction between the Union and the Community . 
The Constitution consigns these complexities to history . 
It also gives people far greater access to official information , extending their right of access to documents from all institutions , organs , and bodies . 
Finally , the Treaty will make Europe more effective . 
Two themes that people consider crucial are a stronger European economy ( more jobs and more growth ) and greater security ( reducing cross-border crime ) . 
European countries are heavily reliant on each other in addressing these issues . 
People are counting on Europe to take action . 
But , because EU decisions often have to be taken unanimously , this can be difficult . 
The Treaty introduces major improvements here , enabling us to work together more effectively to achieve our aims . 
In sum , the Constitutional Treaty firmly enshrines fundamental rights in law , and also makes the EU more democratic , more transparent , and more effective . 
This makes it a good deal for everyone - for people who expect more cooperation and more concrete results from the Union , but also for those concerned about excessive interference by Europe in questions that can be better dealt with by the member states themselves . 
Next year , we will celebrate 60 years of peace across a large part of Europe . 
Never before in our history have we enjoyed such a long period of concord , a period that has seen an enormous growth in prosperity . 
Democracy has taken root in almost every corner of Europe , and Europeans now have far greater freedom to live , work , and study where and how they wish . 
These achievements are largely due to European cooperation . 
The Constitutional Treaty is a reflection of our wish to continue in the same vein , to carry on working together . 
We want to reaffirm our commitment to a life without war and injustice , and to the freedom that we hold so dear . 
The Constitutional Treaty provides solid foundations for our shared future . 
Peace , security , and prosperity are as vulnerable as they are valuable . 
This Treaty makes them stronger . 
The signing ceremony is therefore a message of hope . 
It is a new beginning .
