How Does the Weak Dollar Affect Oil Prices ? 
Around the world , there is anguished hand-wringing about the high price of oil . 
But if political leaders and policymakers want lower oil prices , they should be promoting policies that strengthen the dollar . 
The implications of pricing oil in any single-currency are more far-reaching than most people think . 
For example , some oil-producing countries ask their customers to pay in euros , but that does not mean that their oil is priced in euros . 
And even if dollar prices were to be replaced by euro prices , the impact of single-currency pricing on the oil market would be the same . 
While oil-exporting countries receive revenues in dollars ( or their euro equivalent ) , they use different currencies to import goods and services from various countries . 
Any change in the exchange rate of the dollar affects the purchasing power of these countries , and therefore their real income . 
Likewise , international oil companies sell most of their oil in dollars , but they operate in various countries and pay some of their costs in local currencies . 
Any change in the value of the dollar therefore affects their cost structure and profitability . 
In turn , it affects reinvestment in exploration , development , and maintenance . 
The relationship between the value of the dollar and oil prices is very complex . 
While they can feed on each other to produce a vicious cycle , their short-term relationship is distinct from their long-term relationship . 
In the short-term , dollar depreciation does not affect supply and demand , but it does affect speculation and investment in oil futures markets . 
As the dollar declines , commodities - including oil - attract investors . 
Investing in futures becomes both a hedge against a weakening dollar and an investment vehicle that could yield substantial profit , particularly in a climate of vanishing excess oil production capacity , increasing demand , declining interest rates , a slumping real estate market , and crisis in the banking industry . 
OPEC might be correct to blame American policies and speculators for higher prices . 
It is also correct that if OPEC had excess capacity , it would have already used it to flush out speculators to bring oil prices down . 
OPEC can regain control in one of two ways : use its &quot; claimed &quot; excess capacity to flush out speculators , or use its financial surpluses to overtake them . 
Recourse to the latter option means that , even without excess capacity , OPEC can still be in the driver &apos;s seat . 
In the long run , however , statistical analysis of various oil industry variables indicates that a weaker dollar affects supply by reducing production , regardless of whether oil is owned and produced by national or international oil companies . 
A weak dollar also affects demand by increasing consumption . 
The result of a decrease in supply and an increase in demand is higher prices . 
The lower dollar also reduces the purchasing power of oil exporters . 
If nominal oil prices remain constant while the dollar declines , the real income of the oil-producing countries declines , resulting in less investment in additional capacity and maintenance . 
The same is true of oil companies . 
Consequently , oil prices increase . 
Indeed , because oil prices were rising while the dollar was declining , capacity expansion by oil firms failed to meet forecasts for non-OPEC production in the last three years . 
Even oil production in the United States has not matched the increase in oil prices , as rising import costs for tools and equipment - partly a reflection of the dollar &apos;s weakness and other factors - have forced project delays and cancellations . 
Of course , the lower dollar means cheaper oil in Europe , Asia , and all countries with appreciating currencies . 
Oil prices hit records in the US in 2004 and 2005 , but not in Europe , which partly explains why economic growth there has not been affected . 
When Americans paid $ 120 per barrel , Europeans paid only about â‚¬ 76 per barrel . 
Several factors have prevented high oil prices from affecting the demand for petroleum products in the US in recent years , such as increased government spending , low interest rates , tax breaks , and an increase in real incomes . 
To be sure , the weaker dollar has forced some American families to spend their vacations in the US instead of Europe . 
But , since many Americans use gas-guzzling SUV &apos;s for their vacations , demand for gasoline has remained high . 
Unless and until US consumption patterns change or a rebounding dollar increases oil production , Americans will bear the brunt of single-currency oil pricing .
