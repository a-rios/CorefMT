Why India is Riskier than China 
NEW HAVEN - Today , fears are growing that China and India are about to be the next victims of the ongoing global economic carnage . 
This would have enormous consequences . 
Asia &apos;s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.5 % average annual rate over 2010-11 - nearly triple the 3 % growth elsewhere in the world . 
If China and India are next to fall , Asia would be at risk , and it would be hard to avoid a global recession . 
In one important sense , these concerns are understandable : both economies depend heavily on the broader global climate . 
China is sensitive to downside risks to external demand - more relevant than ever since crisis-torn Europe and the United States collectively accounted for 38 % of total exports in 2010 . 
But India , with its large current-account deficit and external funding needs , is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets . 
Yet fears of hard landings for both economies are overblown , especially regarding China . 
Yes , China is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus undertaken in the depths of the subprime crisis . 
The banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending , and thus is exposed to any deterioration in credit quality that may have arisen from such efforts . 
There are also concerns about frothy property markets and mounting inflation . 
While none of these problems should be minimized , they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing . 
Long fixated on stability , Chinese policymakers have been quick to take preemptive action . 
That is particularly evident in Chinese officials &quot; successful campaign against inflation . 
Administrative measures in the agricultural sector , aimed at alleviating supply bottlenecks for pork , cooking oil , fresh vegetables , and fertilizer , have pushed food-price inflation lower . 
This is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate receded from 6.5 % in July 2011 to 4.2 % in November . 
Meanwhile , the People &apos;s Bank of China , which hiked benchmark one-year lending rates five times in the 12 months ending this October , to 6.5 % , now has plenty of scope for monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate . 
The same is true with mandatory reserves in the banking sector , where the government has already pruned 50 basis points off the record 21.5 % required-reserve ratio . 
Relatively small fiscal deficits - only around 2 % of GDP in 2010 - leave China with an added dimension of policy flexibility should circumstances dictate . 
Nor has China been passive with respect to mounting speculative excesses in residential property . 
In April 2010 , it implemented tough new regulations , raising down-payments from 20 % to 30 % for a first home , to 50 % for a second residence , and to 100 % for purchases of three or more units . 
This strategy appears to be working . 
In November , house prices declined in 49 of the 70 cities that China monitors monthly . 
Moreover , it is a serious exaggeration to claim , as many do today , that the Chinese economy is one massive real-estate bubble . 
Yes , total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50 % of GDP , but residential and nonresidential real estate , combined , accounts for only 15-20 % of that - no more than 10 % of the overall economy . 
In terms of floor space , residential construction accounts for half of China &apos;s real-estate investment . 
Identifying the share of residential real estate that goes to private developers in the dozen or so first-tier cities ( which account for most of the Chinese property market &apos;s fizz ) suggests that less than 1 % of GDP would be at risk in the event of a housing-market collapse - not exactly a recipe for a hard landing . 
As for Chinese banks , the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local-government debt , which , according to the government , totaled $ 1.7 trillion ( roughly 30 % of GDP ) at the end of 2010 . 
Approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis . 
Some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired , but ongoing urbanization - around 15-20 million people per year move to cities - provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction . 
That tempers the risks to credit quality and , along with relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios of around 65 % , should cushion the Chinese banking system . 
India is more problematic . 
As the only economy in Asia with a current-account deficit , its external funding problems can hardly be taken lightly . 
Like China , India &apos;s economic-growth momentum is ebbing . 
But unlike China , the downshift is more pronounced - GDP growth fell through the 7 % threshold in the third calendar-year quarter of 2011 , and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1 % in October . 
But the real problem is that , in contrast to China , Indian authorities have far less policy leeway . 
For starters , the rupee is in near free-fall . 
That means that the Reserve Bank of India - which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still-serious inflation problem - can ill afford to ease monetary policy . 
Moreover , an outsize consolidated government budget deficit of around 9 % of GDP limits India &apos;s fiscal-policy discretion . 
While China is in better shape than India , neither economy is likely to implode on its own . 
It would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in Asia . 
One obvious possibility today would be a disruptive breakup of the European Monetary Union . 
In that case , both China and India , like most of the world &apos;s economies , could find themselves in serious difficulty - with an outright contraction of Chinese exports , as in late 2008 and early 2009 , and heightened external funding pressures for India . 
While I remain a euro-skeptic , I believe that the political will to advance European integration will prevail . 
Consequently , I attach a low probability to the currency union &apos;s disintegration . 
Barring such a worst-case outcome for Europe , the odds of a hard landing in either India or China should remain low . 
Seduced by the political economy of false prosperity , the West has squandered its might . 
Driven by strategy and stability , Asia has built on its newfound strength . 
But now it must reinvent itself . 
Japanese-like stagnation in the developed world is challenging externally dependent Asia to shift its focus to internal demand . 
Downside pressures currently squeezing China and India underscore that challenge . 
Asia &apos;s defining moment could be hand .
