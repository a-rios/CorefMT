Russia &apos;s European Home 
MOSCOW - Last spring , after Russia annexed Crimea and began intervening in eastern Ukraine , the United States and the European Union introduced sanctions against Russian individuals and businesses . 
But if sanctions are to be an effective tool in countering Vladimir Putin &apos;s ambitions - a topic of ongoing debate in the West - they must combine a firm hand toward Russia &apos;s president with an open one toward its people . 
To understand the role that sanctions can play in managing the Kremlin , one need only consider the importance of money to its occupant . 
From the beginning of the century until very recently , Russia was flooded with petrodollars ; as the flow of money increased , so did Putin &apos;s audacity and aggression . 
In 1999 , oil and gas revenues contributed $ 40.5 billion to Russia &apos;s GDP . 
As prices rose and production increased , this contribution increased substantially , averaging $ 73.5 billion annually from 2001 to 2004 . 
Russia &apos;s growing wealth emboldened Putin , a change exemplified in his decision to arrest and imprison Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the owner of oil giant Yukos , in 2003 . 
And the trend continued . 
From 2005-2008 , annual hydrocarbon revenues were $ 223.6 billion higher than in 1999 ; at the end of this period , Russia invaded Georgia . 
In 2011-2013 , Russia &apos;s annual oil and gas income peaked at $ 394 billion above 1999 levels , setting the stage for the Kremlin &apos;s interventions in Ukraine . 
In all of these cases , Putin acted on the conviction that Russia &apos;s oil wealth meant that rules - even international laws - did not apply to him . 
But with the introduction of sanctions , financial markets are closed , for the most part , to Russian businesses . 
Oil prices are plummeting ; 
Russia &apos;s strategic currency reserves are being pulled apart by Putin &apos;s friends and may be exhausted by the end of the year . 
Moreover , the ruble has lost close to 50 % of its value over the last six months . 
But , though the sanctions clearly are starting to bite , it will be some time before the bulk of the Russian public actually feels their impact . 
So the West needs to wait . 
There is little point in engaging in a search for diplomatic solutions . 
Putin has chosen to act without regard for territorial integrity . 
He has declared himself a defender not only of Russian citizens , but of all ethnic Russians , Russophones , and even Orthodox Christians . 
He believes that he possesses the right to intervene in his neighbors &quot; affairs , because , as he put it , &quot; the Soviet Union was the same Russia , just called by another name . &quot; 
In other words , Ukraine is merely a breakaway region of historical Russia . 
The Russian people , however , are modern enough to question these policies . 
The &quot; Putin consensus &quot; was built on the promise of rising prosperity - a promise that is quickly evaporating under the heat of sanctions . 
Most Russian elites think and act like businesspeople , not like romantic nationalists : As the economy sinks into prolonged recession , scrutiny and criticism of Putin &apos;s policies will increase . 
The goal of Western sanctions should be to detach Russia &apos;s pre-modern rulers from its modern population . 
This strategy may be of little use in tightly controlled societies like Iran or North Korea ; but Russia is essentially European . 
Instead of wasting time trying to negotiate , the West should focus on elaborating and publicizing a post-Putin agenda . 
For starters , the West should explicitly deny any Russian claim to a right to interfere in the affairs of the EU and NATO . 
Ukraine should be embraced - even if Crimea and Donbas are lost . 
A &quot; new Marshall plan &quot; should be rolled out , one that can transform Ukraine into a free , prosperous country that can join the EU and NATO , should it so desire . 
Even more important , the West should make it clear that it extends its definition of Europe not just to Russia &apos;s borders , but across them . 
Russia should be acknowledged as an integral and natural part of Europe - a country that might eventually join the EU . 
The grand strategy for the coming decades should be centered on a simple idea : Though Russia can never be allowed to influence Europe from outside , it will be welcome to gain a place of influence from within , if it accepts Europe &apos;s rules and norms . 
Russians should be made to understand that they can choose one of two paths . 
The West &apos;s biggest mistake regarding Russia and Ukraine was to choose the path of indifference after the end of the Cold War . 
That led to the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991 and the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in 1994 . 
If , instead , Russia and Ukraine had been encouraged to work toward joining the European Economic Community and were invited to join NATO , the arc of history would have been bent in a much more peaceful direction . 
History rarely offers a second chance . 
The mistakes of the 1990s should be remedied , and the starting point should be to offer those who want to join the West the opportunity to work toward doing so . 
If Ukraine is brought into the European fold , the Russian people will want to follow - much sooner than anyone can now imagine .
