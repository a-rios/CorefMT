The World \ u0027s Runaway Train 
CAMBRIDGE - The global economy is a runaway train that is slowing , but not quickly enough . 
That is what the extraordinary run-up in prices for oil , metals , and food is screaming at us . 
The spectacular and historic global economic boom of the past six years is about to hit a wall . 
Unfortunately , no one , certainly not in Asia or the United States , seems willing to bite the bullet and help engineer the necessary coordinated retreat to sustained sub-trend growth , which is necessary so that new commodity supplies and alternatives can catch up . 
Instead , governments are clawing to stretch out unsustainable booms , further pushing up commodity prices , and raising the risk of a once-in-a-lifetime economic and financial mess . 
All this need not end horribly , but policymakers in most regions have to start pressing hard on the brakes , not the accelerator . 
Don &apos;t look to the US for leadership in a presidential election year . 
On the contrary , the US government has been handing out tax-rebate checks so that Americans will shop until they drop , and now Congress is talking about doing more . 
Don &apos;t look to emerging markets , either . 
Desperate to sustain their political and economic momentum , most have taken a wide variety of steps to prevent their economies from feeling the full brunt of the commodity price hikes . 
As a result , higher commodity prices are eating into fiscal cushions rather than curtailing demand . 
I am puzzled that so many economic pundits seem to think that the solution is for all governments , rich and poor , to pass out even more checks and subsidies so as to keep the boom going . 
Keynesian stimulus policies might help ease the pain a bit for individual countries acting in isolation . 
A general rise in global demand will simply spill over into higher commodity prices , with little helpful effect on consumption . 
Isn &apos;t this obvious ? 
Yes , there is still a financial crisis in the US , but stoking inflation is an incredibly unfair and inefficient way to deal with it . 
Some central bankers tell us not to worry , because they will be much more disciplined than central banks were in the 1970 &quot; s , when the world faced a similar commodity price spike . 
This time is different , though . 
The commodity price problem has snuck up on us , despite notable institutional reforms in macroeconomic policymaking all over the world . 
The historic influx of new entrants into the global work force , each aspiring to Western consumption standards , is simply pushing global growth past the safety marker on the speed dial . 
As a result , commodity resource constraints that we once expected to face in the middle of the twenty-first century are hitting us today . 
Wait a second , you say . 
Why can &apos;t our wonderfully flexible market economies roll with the punches ? 
Won &apos;t high prices cause people to conserve on consumption and seek out new sources of supply ? 
Yes , and that eventually happened with energy supplies in the 1980 &quot; s . 
But the process takes time , and , because of the rising weight of relatively inflexible emerging market economies in global consumption , adjustment will probably take longer than it did a few decades ago . 
Oil exporters and China have been accounting for two-thirds of global oil demand growth in recent years . 
Rich country consumers are responding to higher energy prices , and it helps . 
New York City , for example , has seen a reduction of perhaps 5 % in private vehicles entering the city over the past six months . 
Gridlock has abated , and you can almost get around the city by car these days . 
But the response is slower elsewhere . 
It certainly is not getting any easier to drive around in places like SÃ£o Paulo , Dubai , and Shanghai . 
For a variety of reasons , mostly related to government intervention , few emerging market economies can be categorized as having flexible resource demand , so commodity price spikes are not having a particularly big effect on demand . 
The central bankers who tell us not to worry about inflation point to relative wage stability . 
Expansions usually start collapsing when labor gets too scarce and too expensive . 
But the current expansion is unusual in that , due to unique ( in the modern era ) circumstances , labor constraints are not the problem . 
On the contrary , the effective global labor force keeps swelling . 
No , this time , commodity resources are the primary constraint , rather than a secondary problem , as in the past . 
That is why commodity prices will just keep soaring until world growth slows down long enough for new supply and new conservation options to catch up with demand . 
This runaway-train global economy has all the hallmarks of a giant crisis in the making - financial , political , and economic . 
Will policymakers find a way to achieve the necessary international coordination ? 
Getting the diagnosis right is the place to start . 
The world as a whole needs tighter monetary and fiscal policy . 
It is time to put the brakes on this runaway train before it is too late .
