Does Redistributing Income Reduce Poverty ? 
NEW YORK - Many on the left are suspicious of the idea that economic growth helps to reduce poverty in developing countries . 
They argue that growth-oriented policies seek to increase gross national product , not to ameliorate poverty , and that redistribution is the key to poverty reduction . 
These assertions , however , are not borne out by the evidence . 
Since the 1950 &quot; s , developmental economists have understood that growth in GNP is not synonymous with increased welfare . 
But , even prior to independence , India &apos;s leaders saw growth as essential for reducing poverty and increasing social welfare . 
In economic terms , growth was an instrument , not a target - the means by which the true targets , like poverty reduction and the social advancement of the masses , would be achieved . 
A quarter-century ago , I pointed out the two distinct ways in which economic growth would have this effect . 
First , growth would pull the poor into gainful employment , thereby helping to lift them out of poverty . 
Higher incomes would enable them to increase their personal spending on education and health ( as seems to have been happening in India during its recent period of accelerated growth ) . 
Second , growth increases state revenues , which means that the government can potentially spend more on health and education for the poor . 
Of course , a country does not necessarily spend more on such items simply because it has increased revenue , and , even if it does , the programs it chooses to fund may not be effective . 
In almost willful ignorance of the fact that the growth-centered model has proved itself time and again , skeptics advocate an alternative &quot; redistributive &quot; developmental model , which they believe will have a greater impact on reducing poverty . 
Critics of the growth model argue that it is imperative to redistribute income and wealth as soon as possible . 
They claim that the Indian state of Kerala and the country of Bangladesh are examples where redistribution , rather than growth , has led to better outcomes for the poor than in the rest of India . 
Yet , as Columbia University economist Arvind Panagariya &apos;s recent work shows , Kerala &apos;s social statistics were better than those in the rest of the country even before it instituted its current redistributive model . 
Moreover , Kerala has profited immensely from remittances sent home by its émigré workers in the Middle East , a factor unrelated to its redistributive policy . 
As for Bangladesh , the United Nations &quot; Human Development Index , admittedly a problematic source , ranks it below India . 
In impoverished countries where the poor exceed the rich by a huge margin , redistribution would increase the consumption of the poor only minimally - by , say , a chapati a day - and the increase would not be sustainable in a context of low income and high population growth . 
In short , for most developing countries , growth is the principal strategy for inclusive development - that is , development that consciously includes the marginal and poorest members of a society . 
But the political sustainability of the growth-first model requires both symbolic and material efforts . 
While growth does benefit the poor , the rich often benefit disproportionately . 
So , to keep the poor committed to the system as their economic aspirations are aroused , the wealthy would be well advised to indulge less in conspicuous consumption . 
At the same time - and more importantly - the poor need greater access to education in order to increase their economic opportunities and social mobility . 
&quot; Less excess and more access &quot;
