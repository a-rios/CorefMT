Europe &apos;s Procrustean Nightmare 
MANNHEIM - The European Union &apos;s policy of saving the euro at all costs is enough to guarantee the euro &apos;s survival . 
But is preserving the &quot; one-size-fits-all &quot; euro really worth sacrificing the eurozone &apos;s competitiveness and , ultimately , European solidarity ? 
It was the single market &apos;s establishment in 1992 - not the euro &apos;s introduction seven years later - that brought free trade , increased competitiveness , and new wealth to Europe . 
In fact , the monetary union has become a political and economic nightmare , plagued by recession , record-high unemployment , social unrest , and rising distrust among member states . 
But , even as politicians and economists run out of arguments in favor of the euro , few dare to challenge its fundamental structure , let alone propose alternatives . 
To escape the crisis , EU leaders must recognize the shortcomings of the eurozone &apos;s one-dimensional framework , and develop a system better suited to managing a multi-faceted monetary union . 
Excessive centralization and harmonization are decimating the subsidiarity and competition needed to drive Europe &apos;s economies , as the socialization of debt undermines weaker economies &quot; accountability . 
Furthermore , closing competitiveness gaps - essential to saving the euro - would not only require weaker economies to become more productive ; strong economies , like Germany , would face pressure to become less efficient , diminishing Europe &apos;s overall competitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world . 
At the same time , the euro crisis is inciting suspicion , antagonism , and new divisions in the eurozone . 
German-French relations , once the cornerstone of European integration , are at their lowest point in decades . 
And unemployed young people in Greece , Portugal , and Spain routinely protest against &quot; German dictates . &quot; 
Likewise , the rift between the eurozone &apos;s 17 members and the other ten EU countries is widening . 
Most notably , the United Kingdom is seeking to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership , with a referendum on the outcome that will determine whether it leaves the EU altogether . 
Historical precedents indicate that forcing disparate nations and states to unite under a single idea - whether communism in the Soviet Union , socialism in Yugoslavia , or a shared currency in the eurozone - generates centrifugal forces that can trigger the union &apos;s collapse . 
A one-size-fits-all approach to integration is simply unsustainable . 
But the eurozone is not only replicating other unions &quot; mistakes ; it is repeating its own . 
While 25 of the EU &apos;s 27 governments agreed to the &quot; fiscal compact , &quot; aimed at imposing fiscal discipline on member states , there is no guarantee that governments will not violate the rules , just as they violated those established by the Maastricht Treaty . 
Similarly , although the one-size-fits-all monetary policy contributed to Greece &apos;s excessive indebtedness , and to Spain &apos;s real-estate bubble , eurozone leaders have consistently sought to re-align interest rates , for example , by compelling holders of Greek debt to accept &quot; haircuts &quot; ( write-downs on principal ) . 
But the impact is severely limited without external devaluation , which is impossible within a monetary union . 
While Greece &apos;s eurozone partners may be able to carry it for decades this way , and even to bail out Spain , the system would surely collapse under the weight of a larger economy . 
And such an economy - France - is in serious jeopardy . 
In 2011 , France &apos;s ratio of new debt to GDP was three times higher than Germany &apos;s , with the public sector accounting for more than 56 % of national income . 
Currently , 9 % of French citizens are employed by the government , compared to 5 % in Germany . 
And unemployment hovers above 10 % , with youth unemployment far higher , at roughly 25 % . 
While some of France &apos;s largest companies - like Michelin , LVMH , and Air Liquide - remain successful , they cannot offset the economy &apos;s lack of a solid base of small and medium-size enterprises . 
Indeed , its ranking on the World Economic Forum &apos;s Global Competitiveness Index fell from 18th last year to 21st this year ( Germany ranked sixth both years ) . 
Recent actions taken by President François Hollande &apos;s government - including raising the minimum wage , increasing taxes on business , and lowering the retirement age for some workers - threaten to exacerbate the situation . 
Given this , it is no surprise that Moody &apos;s downgraded France &apos;s credit rating last year . 
But , like the struggling countries of southern Europe , France has few options . 
Austerity programs have been largely counterproductive , generating vicious cycles of slow or no growth , business closures , skyrocketing unemployment , and tax-base erosion . 
As a result , the eurozone &apos;s fiscally sound countries are being asked repeatedly to compromise their prudent policies in order to finance endless bailouts . 
This situation is untenable . 
Europe &apos;s leaders must pursue a controlled segmentation of the eurozone , in which the most competitive countries - Austria , Finland , Germany , and the Netherlands - adopt a new currency , the &quot; northern euro . &quot; 
This new monetary union would be managed according to the original Maastricht Treaty , with a truly independent central bank responsible for regulating the northern euro &apos;s exchange rate against the euro , which less competitive countries would retain . 
The rump euro &apos;s weakened exchange rate would lead to renewed economic growth , job creation , and a stronger tax base in southern European countries . 
Initially , to facilitate debt reduction , bondholders would face another haircut . 
Countries departing for the northern euro should make a one-time contribution to these debt-reduction efforts . 
A flexible membership system would enable countries to join the northern euro when their economic and fiscal conditions became strong enough . 
Europe &apos;s leaders must stop treating the eurozone as a homogeneous entity , imposing one-size-fits-all policies on vastly different countries . 
The euro &apos;s framework should be adjusted to suit current fiscal and economic realities - not the other way around .
