The Age of Bobby Fischer 
CAMBRIDGE - The brilliant new Hollywood movie &quot; Pawn Sacrifice &quot; portrays the life of tormented chess genius Robert James &quot; Bobby &quot; Fischer from his early days as a prodigy to his historic 1972 match , at age 29 , with Russian world champion Boris Spassky . 
Actor Toby Maguire portrays Fischer with remarkable authenticity - indeed , pitch-perfect for those of us who met Fischer in his prime . 
The film depicts a match that became a signature event in the Cold War between Russia and the United States . 
It also makes one wonder whether a creative genius like Fischer , deeply troubled yet supremely functional at the chessboard , would be able to exist in today &apos;s unforgiving online world . 
Fischer certainly got attention back then , but information was filtered very differently than it is today . 
Journalists used to lead the way , rather than slavishly following the flow of superficial Internet traffic . 
The story of an erratic kid from Brooklyn taking on the Soviet empire in its national sport made good copy for journalists , who understood the significance of the event . 
The match garnered front-page headlines in major newspapers around the world on a daily basis for two months , with commentators providing live move-by-move analysis for up to five hours each day . 
Back then , there were only a few television channels . 
There were no DVD players or pay-per-view services . 
Still , that was not the only reason people remained glued to their TV sets to watch the match . 
The surreal environment , the amazing chess turns , and the Cold War backdrop made Fischer one of the most famous people in the world that summer . 
I won &apos;t humor myself that it was the chess analysis that drew attention , although I was a commentator for public television on the pivotal 13th game . 
For the American champion , the match was the consummation of two decades of chasing the title , starting from his days as a child prodigy . 
After a lifetime of living in relative poverty for a superstar ( even though he frequently appeared on the cover of major magazines ) , Fischer finally found himself playing in a match with a $ 250,000 purse . 
Of course , it was a pittance compared to the $ 2.5 million that each fighter was guaranteed in the 1971 Ali-Frazier fight . 
But Fischer recognized that US culture marginalizes any pursuit that does not produce big money , so he viewed the six-figure cash prize as the ultimate symbol of advancement in his sport . 
For Russia , the match was not about money ; it was about hearts and minds . 
The chess world had long been the perfect battleground on which to prove the superiority of the Communist system . 
Although most Westerners today pretend that we always knew that Russian-style Communism would fail , it was not so obvious back then . 
The leading introductory economic textbook of the time , by Nobel laurate Paul Samuelson , was still predicting that Russia might overtake the US as the world &apos;s largest economy . 
To be fair , Russians valued chess enormously , even if it did not produce a lot of income . 
In many ways , chess was Russia &apos;s national sport . 
No wonder Fischer &apos;s quixotic pursuit of the championship led American policy mastermind Henry Kissinger to call Fischer and urge him not to back out , as he had threatened to do . 
Whatever his status in the US , Fischer was certainly the most beloved American in Russia . 
The majesty of his play transcended propaganda in a country where everyday people could appreciate and understand the innate beauty of the game . 
In the run-up to the championship , Fischer trounced two very good opponents with unheard of 6-0 scores , an astonishing result when so many grandmaster games end in draws . 
Russian fans were so excited by Fischer &apos;s unprecedented achievement that they reportedly jammed Moscow telephone exchanges to get information . 
After a while , operators would simply pick up the line and say &quot; 6-0 &quot; and hang up . 
In the end , even Spassky paid the ultimate tribute to Fischer &apos;s genius , clapping along with the audience after Fischer &apos;s inspired sixth-game victory , as portrayed in the movie . 
The American might have been the ultimate chess genius , but the Russian was the class act . 
Director Edward Zwick does not shirk from showing the demons that plagued Fischer . 
He was justly concerned that the Russians would go to great lengths to prevent him from being champion , but ultimately rational concerns tipped into paranoia , and Fischer started to turn on his closest friends and confidants . 
He became anti-Semitic , despite being Jewish himself . 
One suspects that in today &apos;s online world , Fischer &apos;s paranoia and personal flaws would have tripped him up long before he became champion . 
After Fischer became champion and simply stopped playing competitive chess , his mental illness became much worse . 
Though no one can condone Fischer &apos;s virulent rants and dark thoughts in his later years ( he died in 2008 ) , it is sad to realize that someone of such towering creativity and genius , who inspired so many people through his chess , might have had his career ended at a much earlier stage today . 
We live in a different world . 
&quot; Pawn Sacrifice &quot; recalls the world in which Fischer &apos;s feats were possible .
