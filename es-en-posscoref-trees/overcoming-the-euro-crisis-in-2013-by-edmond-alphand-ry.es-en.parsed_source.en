The Eurozone &apos;s Agenda in 2013 
PARIS - European Union leaders concluded 2012 with a landmark agreement that places all eurozone banks under a single supervisor . 
But the difficult negotiations that led to the agreement eclipsed European Council President Herman Van Rompuy &apos;s recent report , Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union , which calls for unity far beyond a banking union . 
Although &quot; no door was closed , &quot; in the words of European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso , EU leaders have clearly refused , at least for now , to hold a serious discussion about deeper integration . 
Van Rompuy &apos;s report raises a fundamental question : What factors are preventing the eurozone from functioning as everyone would wish ? 
Answering this question requires , first and foremost , comparing the dynamics at play during the euro &apos;s first decade , 1999-2009 , when the eurozone ostensibly performed well , with those of the last three years , which have been marred by crisis . 
At first , the eurozone seemed to function like a true currency union : capital-market integration was accelerated ; cross-border activity increased ; and the per capita income gap between member countries decreased . 
But , unlike in a complete currency union , such as that of the United States , eurozone members retained full financial sovereignty , meaning that they controlled all of the levers of macroeconomic policy . 
Without external constraints , public and private expenditure grew precipitously in many countries on the eurozone periphery , while wages rose faster than productivity . 
As these countries posted current-account deficits , northern European countries accumulated current-account surpluses , exposing a widening competitiveness gap . 
In a genuine currency union , wealth transfers and automatic stabilizers mean that such discrepancies do not pose a problem . 
With the eurozone as a whole benefiting from a relatively solid balance-of-payments position , European leaders initially failed to foresee the risk incurred by letting competitiveness differentials grow , and underestimated the threat posed by some countries &quot; accumulation of significant external debt . 
Indeed , for ten years , north-to-south income transfers and lending financed excessive aggregate demand , making the eurozone seem stable . 
As markets underpriced risk in order to lend to increasingly indebted countries , pressure on interest rates diminished . 
( Over the course of the euro &apos;s first decade , interest-rate spreads between ten-year government bonds nearly disappeared . ) 
The global financial crisis exposed the eurozone &apos;s underlying flaw . 
Meanwhile , international bodies , including the International Monetary Fund and the G-20 , encouraged struggling countries to implement loose fiscal policies , claiming that they were needed to overcome the crisis . 
But fiscal stimulus merely aggravated the problem . 
Financial investors soon recognized that risk had been underestimated in some countries , causing interest rates to rise , sometimes to unsustainable levels , as in Greece , Portugal , and Ireland . 
While the decline in aggregate demand led to reduced imports , the combination of higher interest rates , lower public expenditure , tax increases , and wage deflation boosted unemployment and triggered recession . 
Normally , by decreasing prices relative to their more fiscally sound neighbors , struggling countries can boost exports , thereby reducing their current-account deficits . 
But , in the case of the euro crisis , price stickiness caused inflation to increase more in debtor countries than in creditor countries , making adjustment even more painful . 
In this context , Van Rompuy &apos;s report is crucial . 
It maps out the architecture needed to &quot; guarantee the minimum level of convergence required for the EMU to function effectively , &quot; and calls for a more integrated financial , budgetary , and economic policy framework . 
Specifically , the report highlights the need for the eurozone to make two fundamental commitments . 
First , eurozone countries must implement reforms aimed at boosting wage and price flexibility through enhanced competition and improved labor and capital mobility within and between member countries . 
Second , wealth transfers to peripheral countries , while controversial , are necessary . 
To surmount the associated political hurdles , eurozone leaders must create a limited &quot; fiscal capacity , &quot; which should act as a &quot; common but limited shock-absorption function &quot; that would &quot; contribute to cushioning the impact of country-specific shocks and help to prevent contagion across the euro area and beyond . &quot; 
This mechanism should also provide financial support for structural reforms through &quot; limited , temporary , flexible , and targeted financial incentives . &quot; 
But Van Rompuy &apos;s minimal proposal may be insufficient . 
Currency unions require a mechanism for permanent transfers to poorer regions . 
The EU budget should facilitate such transfers in the eurozone , using structural funds . 
Tax transfers should also act as an automatic stabilizer in the case of asymmetric shocks . 
Such reforms undoubtedly require a much more politically integrated , or federalized , eurozone . 
Facing up to that reality will be the main challenge for Europe &apos;s leaders in 2013 .
