Sarkozy &apos;s Secret Rupture 
PARIS - A year ago , when Nicolas Sarkozy was campaigning for the French presidency , he promised a &quot; rupture &quot; with the past . 
So far , few French people can see the sort of rupture that Sarkozy promised . 
But they are wrong to think that nothing has changed in the first year of his presidency . 
Sarkozy has , in fact , brought about a rupture , albeit in an unexpected area : the foreign policy consensus that has prevailed since the days of Charles de Gaulle . 
Of course , it is impossible at this early stage to evaluate with any degree of precision the long-term strategic repercussions of Sarkozy &apos;s apparent decision to return France to NATO &apos;s integrated military command and strengthen the French military commitment to NATO &apos;s out-of-theater engagement - its first ever - in Afghanistan . 
But the implication of these decisions is clear : France under Sarkozy is now back at the heart of the Atlantic Alliance . 
Although this may seem mundane outside France , Sarkozy &apos;s foreign policy revolution has incited fierce opposition at home . 
Indeed , all left-wing parties denounce Sarkozy &apos;s rupture with the Fifth Republic &apos;s military / diplomatic heritage . 
Of course , the left &apos;s real quarrel with Sarkozy &apos;s policy has at its roots in his conception of France &apos;s relationship with the United States . 
Wariness of America was , to be sure , not just a leftist pose ; many Gaullists over the decades have been tinged with anti-Americanism , too . 
But , although Sarkozy may not have sold his party on the merits of George Bush &apos;s America , he has softened its once habitual suspicions about the US . 
As a result , a left-right divide has opened in this central area of French diplomacy - a division that has not been seen in France for four decades . 
The French left , not surprisingly , rejects Sarkozy &apos;s Atlanticist impulses and frequently charge him with betraying General de Gaulle &apos;s legacy . 
The majority of French people , however , appear to favor improving ties with the US . 
There is more than a little irony here . 
In the year that the Socialists are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the May 1968 demonstrations against de Gaulle , they are also trying to steal his diplomatic clothes by proclaiming themselves the defenders of the independent French foreign policy that he championed . 
In the 1960 &quot; s , both Socialists and Centrists denounced de Gaulle &apos;s &quot; anti-Americanism . &quot; 
On NATO , France &apos;s Middle East policy , or the constitution , Francois Mitterrand ( the Socialist leader in the 1960 &quot; s ) and the opposition sharply criticized de Gaulle &apos;s go-it-alone ways for shattering the Alliance consensus . 
Indeed , the Socialists opposed de Gaulle &apos;s decision to withdraw France from NATO &apos;s unified military command , opposed the creation of an independent French nuclear arsenal ( they preferred the American nuclear guarantee ) , and were hostile to de Gaulle &apos;s rupture with Israel after the Six Day War . 
But the Socialists began to change their stripes in the late 1970 &quot; s , rallying around the concept of nuclear dissuasion as a guarantee of national independence and beginning to distance themselves from America . 
Although Mitterrand did stand firm with the US on the stationing of Pershing missiles in Europe in the early 1980 &quot; s , which won him respect from President Ronald Reagan , by this point the Gaullist consensus on the fundamentals of French foreign policy had spread across all political groups . 
Even the Communist Party could be said to have basically embraced its tenets . 
Sarkozy has now broken with this so-called &quot; Gaullist- Mitterrandist &quot; orientation , which was based on the persistence of a belief in French &quot; exceptionalism &quot; in the field of foreign affairs . This does not mean that Sarkozy &apos;s France will toe the American line on all international issues . 
But it does mean that France will no longer oppose America just for the sake of opposing America .
