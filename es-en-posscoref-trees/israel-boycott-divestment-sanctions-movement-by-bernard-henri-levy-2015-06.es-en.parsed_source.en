A Yellow Star for the Jewish State ? 
PARIS - The world has recently seen a rapid succession of efforts to delegitimize Israel . 
Earlier this month , the CEO of French telecommunications company Orange declared at a press conference in Cairo his desire to part ways with an American partner that is too closely tied to Israel . 
In May , Palestinians tried to have the Israeli soccer federation expelled from FIFA . 
And Britain &apos;s National Union of Students recently approved a resolution supporting boycotts and sanctions against Israel . 
Meanwhile , a campaign to ban Israeli products has been gaining strength in the United States and Europe . 
And then there are the many performers who - following the lead of Brian Eno , Elvis Costello , Vanessa Paradis , Roger Waters , and others - wonder out loud whether or not to appear in &quot; occupied Palestine . &quot; 
None of these developments is , in itself , of great moment . 
But , taken together , they create a climate - and perhaps form a watershed . 
And this is no accident . 
All of the recent episodes can be traced , more or less directly , to the global Boycott , Divestment , and Sanctions ( BDS ) movement , established in 2005 by 171 Palestinian nongovernmental organizations . 
So they provide a good occasion to remind those who support this campaign of its true nature . 
BDS is supposedly a worldwide civil-society movement embodying respect for law , democracy , and human rights . 
If that is true , why target the only country in the region that was founded on those values , and that has continued , for better or worse - and despite a nearly 70-year state of war with its neighbors - to be broadly faithful to them ? 
How is it that these scrupulous humanists have had nothing whatsoever to say about the 200,000 victims of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad , the crimes of the Islamic State , or the massive deportation of Christians from the Plain of Nineveh , to name just a few contemporaneous issues ? 
BDS is an &quot; anti-apartheid &quot; movement , comes the reply , adopting the methods and spirit of Nelson Mandela in South Africa . 
That sounds splendid . 
But then , once again , why the focus on Israel ? 
With its multiethnic polity and society - a mix of Western and Eastern Europeans , Americans and Russians , Ethiopians and Turks , Kurds , Iranians , and Arabs ( 17 of whom sit in the Knesset ) - Israel is precisely the opposite of an apartheid state . 
By contrast , in Qatar , whose foundations ( together with Saudi think tanks ) provide most of the financing for the BDS movement , 95 % of the labor force consists of Asian non-citizens working in slave-like conditions under the kafala system , which is a close cousin to apartheid . 
Perhaps the goal is to pressure Israel to conclude a peace deal with the Palestinians , which surely is worth a little accommodation with Qatar . 
In that case , it is a peculiar peacemaking strategy that puts pressure on only one of the belligerents , and that , instead of strengthening the hand of the many Israelis who favor negotiation , imposes collective punishment in the form of exclusion from the community of nations . 
Only one real formula for peace exists , and everyone knows it . 
That formula , enshrined in the Oslo Accords , is the two-state solution . 
One has only to read the declarations of Omar Barghouti , Ali Abunimah , and other promoters of the BDS movement to see that this solution is precisely what they do not want . 
They prefer a &quot; one-state solution &quot; ( Abunimah &apos;s term ) - under a Palestinian flag , of course . 
Is this just a detail that can be safely ignored on the grounds that BDS targets &quot; only &quot; the territories , the Jewish settlements being built there , and the goods that the settlers produce ? 
This is another sucker trap . 
Here , too , it is enough to read the movement &apos;s founding declaration of July 9 , 2005 , which specifies that one of its &quot; three objectives &quot; is to &quot; protect &quot; the &quot; rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194 . &quot; 
In fact and in law , that would amount to establishing on those lands a new Arab country that could be counted on , in short order , to undergo an ethnic cleansing that would make it judenfrei . 
And , finally , how can I refrain from reminding those whose memory is as full of holes as their thinking that the idea of boycotting Israel is not as new as it appears ? 
In fact , it is older than the Jewish state , having emerged on December 2 , 1945 , from a decision by the Arab League , which then wasted no time in relying on that decision to reject the United Nations &quot; dual resolution to establish two states . 
Among the promoters of this brilliant idea were Nazi war criminals who had settled in Syria and Egypt , where they gave their new masters lessons in marking Jewish shops and businesses . 
A comparison is not an argument . 
But words do have a history . 
And it is better to know that history , if we wish to avoid repeating its ugliest scenes . 
The truth is that the BDS movement is nothing more than a sinister caricature of the anti-totalitarian and anti-apartheid struggles . 
It is a campaign whose instigators have no aim other than to discriminate against , delegitimize , and vilify an Israel that in their mind never stopped wearing its yellow star . 
To activists of good faith who may have been taken in by duplicitous representations of the movement , I would say only that there are too many noble causes in need of assistance to allow oneself to be enlisted in a dubious one . 
Those worthy causes include fighting the jihadist decapitators , saving the women and girls enslaved by Boko Haram , defending the Middle East &apos;s imperiled Christians and Arab democrats , and , of course , striving for a just peace between Israelis and Palestinians .
