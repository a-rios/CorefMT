When the Yankees Go Home 
ISLAMABAD - Relations between the United States and Pakistan have continued to fray since a US Special Forces team killed Osama bin Laden in a comfortable villa near a major Pakistani military academy . 
But the tit-for-tat retaliation that has followed the raid reflects deeper sources of mistrust and mutual suspicion . 
The latest round has focused on the alleged activities of the Pakistani military &apos;s powerful intelligence agency , Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , in the United States . 
ISI is accused of watching over the Pakistani diaspora and of sponsoring unregistered lobbyists working to shape congressional opinion . 
Indeed , this is not the first time that Pakistan &apos;s relations with the US have been on a slippery slope . 
In 1965 , after helping the country to build up its economy and its military strength , the US walked out over the war with India that Pakistan had provoked by sending &quot; freedom fighters &quot; into Kashmir . 
In 1989 , following the Soviet Union &apos;s exit from Afghanistan , the US lost interest in what it now calls AfPak - Afghanistan-Pakistan . 
The Americans began returning to Pakistan until , in 1998 , the Pakistani government decided to follow India in testing an atomic bomb . 
This led to the imposition of US sanctions - and America &apos;s third exit from Pakistan . 
That situation remained unchanged when Afghanistan-based Al Qaeda struck America on September 11 , 2001 . 
After receiving a &quot; you are either with us or against us &quot; warning from President George W. Bush &apos;s administration , General Pervez Musharraf &apos;s Pakistan decided to side with the US . 
It severed relations with Afghanistan &apos;s Taliban regime , which it had helped to install five years earlier , and allowed America to use its air space to launch strikes on Afghanistan . 
For more than a decade , Pakistan and the US were close allies . 
Pakistan let the US use its air bases to launch drone attacks on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan ; allowed its territory to be used as a supply route for NATO forces in landlocked Afghanistan ; and , less enthusiastically than the US wished , launched military operations against Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the porous border with Afghanistan . 
In return for its help , Pakistan received large doses of economic and military assistance . 
According to the US Congress , Pakistan was provided $ 20 billion in aid between 2001 and 2011 . 
In addition , Congress passed the Kerry-Lugar bill , which promised $ 7.5 billion in economic aid from 2009-2014 . 
The US also encouraged the International Monetary Fund to give Pakistan emergency financial assistance equivalent to $ 11 billion , to be disbursed starting in late 2008 . 
This cozy relationship created a &quot; moral hazard &quot; in Pakistan , as the generous flow of US aid insulated the government and military from any sense of urgency about economic reform : some foreign friend would always rescue the country from its perennial shortage of cash . 
So far , that friend has been America , but the US could well pull out of Pakistan for the fourth time in the countries &quot; turbulent relationship - a threat that several influential figures in the US Congress have already made . 
The dynamic that has brought Pakistan-US relations to this point arguably began on December 1 , 2009 , when President Barack Obama , announcing a surge in the number of US troops in Afghanistan , also indicated his intention to start pulling back American troops beginning in July 2011 - a pledge that he reiterated two months ago . 
This alerted Pakistan to the fact that , with the imminent departure of US troops , it would be left alone to fight the insurgency on both sides of its border with Afghanistan . 
To do that , Pakistan would need help from some of the Afghan Pashtun tribes with which it had developed strong relations during the war against the Soviet Union . 
The Jalaluddin Haqqani group , which was allowed to base itself in a sanctuary in Pakistan &apos;s North Waziristan tribal agency , was one such ally that Pakistan &apos;s government thought could be used to further its interests in Afghanistan . 
But the Haqqanis were also the group that threatened the Americans the most . 
The US pressed Pakistan to move against them . 
Pakistan resisted . 
And , in the midst of this tussle , the US sent Navy Seals to find Bin Laden at a compound deep in Pakistani territory , informing Pakistan &apos;s government only after the raid was over . 
Pakistan &apos;s embarrassed military pressed the government to begin distancing itself from the US . 
After the identity of the CIA &apos;s station chief in Pakistan was exposed ( probably by Pakistani military officials ) , America made it known that it had good evidence that a prominent Pakistani journalist was ordered murdered by ISI . 
This time around , the break between the US and Pakistan might not be easily repaired . 
Pakistan has turned to China for economic and military help , clearly hoping for a less volatile relationship than the one that it has with America . 
On one hand , Pakistan is seeking large investments from China to improve its physical infrastructure and exploit its considerable mineral wealth . 
On the other hand , the Chinese have been invited to develop Gwadar port on the Balochistan coast , and to use it as a base for their fast-expanding navy . 
While China has not responded to these overtures with the degree of enthusiasm that accompanied them , the Chinese would be happy to fill the strategic vacuum likely to be created by America &apos;s accelerated departure from AfPak . 
A major realignment of forces in the region is looming , and , with it , a new round of Asia &apos;s old Great Game .
