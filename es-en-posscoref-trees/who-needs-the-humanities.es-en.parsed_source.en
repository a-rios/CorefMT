Who Needs the Humanities ? 
WARWICK , UK - Nowadays , in country after country , policymakers have become obsessed with the need to strengthen science education . 
But what about the humanities - all those disciplines ( literature , history , languages , and so forth ) whose relevance to economic competitiveness is not so obvious ? 
We need the humanities only if we are committed to the idea of humanity . 
If the humanities have become obsolete , then it may be that humanity is losing its salience . 
I do not mean that we are becoming &quot; less human &quot; in the sense of &quot; inhumane . &quot; 
If anything , we live in a time when traditionally human-centered concerns like &quot; rights &quot; have been extended to animals , if not nature as a whole . 
Rather , the problem is whether there is anything distinctive about being human that makes special demands of higher education . 
I believe that the answer continues to be yes . 
Today , it sounds old-fashioned to describe the university &apos;s purpose as being to &quot; cultivate &quot; people , as if it were a glorified finishing school . 
However , once we set aside its elitist history , there remains a strong element of truth to this idea , especially when applied to the humanities . 
Although we now think of academic disciplines , including the humanities , as being &quot; research-led , &quot; this understates the university &apos;s historic role in converting the primate Homo sapiens into a creature whose interests , aspirations , and achievements extend beyond successful sexual reproduction . 
What was originally called the &quot; liberal arts &quot; provided the skills necessary for this transformation . 
By submitting to a common regime of speaking , writing , reading , observing , and calculating , the &quot; upright ape &quot; acquired the capacity to reason in public . 
This enabled first him and then her to command authority regardless of birth , resulting in the forging of networks and even institutions whose benefits cut deeply across bloodlines . 
We too easily forget that our heterogeneous societies rely on at least a watered-down version of this training to maintain political and economic order . 
The university began with the humanities at its heart , but today it is playing catch-up with the natural sciences . 
This is largely because the natural sciences have most closely imitated the productivity measures associated with industry . 
The result is a &quot; bigger is better &quot; mentality that stresses ever more publications , patents , and citations . 
Yet , this agenda tends to be pursued without much concern for how - or if - these measures feed into something of greater social , cultural , and even economic relevance . 
The Science Citation Index , originally designed to help researchers discern aggregate trends in increasingly complex subject domains sciences , has helped measure productivity . 
But now these trends are routinely converted into norms against which the performance of particular universities , departments , and even individual researchers is judged . 
What is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring . 
But , more profoundly , this entire line of thinking neglects the distinctly transformative capacity of the knowledge in which the humanities specializes . 
An adequate assessment of this capacity requires looking at its multiplier effects . 
As with John Maynard Keynes &apos;s notion that returns on public investment must be measured as the long-term consequence of other investments that it stimulates across the economy and society , so , too , with the knowledge generated by the humanities . 
This idea is lost in today &apos;s cost accounting for universities , which treats what transpires between teacher and student in the classroom as akin to what happens between producer and consumer in the market . 
In both cases , it is assumed that the value of the exchanged good is decided shortly after its delivery according to how it satisfies an immediate need . 
Not surprisingly , students value their degree by the first job it gets them rather than the life it prepares them for over the next half-century . 
Today , it is hard to believe that in the heyday of the welfare state , universities were both more elite and more publicly funded than they are today . 
Back then , it was assumed that the benefits of academic training accrued not only , or even primarily , to those who experienced it but also , and more importantly , to the rest of the population , whose lives were variously enriched by the application of the arts and sciences . 
Of course , this enrichment included such practical benefits as medical breakthroughs and labor-saving technologies . 
But the enrichment provided by the humanities was no less enduring , though its subtler nature makes it harder to track . 
Nevertheless , to paraphrase Keynes , every time we turn on the radio or television , read a newspaper , pick up a novel , or watch a movie , we are in the thrall of one or more dead humanists who set the terms of reference through which we see the world . 
In its long history as the premier form of academic knowledge , the humanities were frequently criticized for their subversive character . 
That some would now question whether the humanities have any impact at all merely reflects the crude and short-sighted way in which the value of academic knowledge is measured and judged today . 
Perhaps that befits creatures whose lives are &quot; solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short , &quot; to recall Thomas Hobbes &quot; description of the state of nature . 
But it does a grave injustice to those of us who still aspire to full-fledged humanity .
