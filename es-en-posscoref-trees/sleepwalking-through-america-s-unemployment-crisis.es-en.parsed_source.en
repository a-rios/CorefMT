Sleepwalking through America &apos;s Unemployment Crisis 
NEWPORT BEACH - It was relegated to the Q A session , rather than featured prominently in the opening statement , at last week &apos;s first-ever press conference of US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke . 
It is an issue that too many in Washington , DC are willing to dismiss as &quot; transitory , &quot; despite visible evidence to the contrary . 
It is extremely vulnerable to high oil and food prices . 
And it undermines the operational assumptions that underpin the long-standing characterization of the US economy as vibrant and responsive . 
The issue is the scope and composition of unemployment in America - a problem that is yet to be sufficiently recognized for its increasingly detrimental impact on the country &apos;s social fabric , its economic potential , and its already-fragile fiscal position and debt dynamics . 
Let us start with the facts : 
· At 8.8 % almost three years after the onset of the global financial crisis , America &apos;s unemployment rate remains stubbornly ( and unusually ) high ; 
· Rather than reflecting job creation , much of the improvement in recent months ( from 9.8 % in November last year ) is due to workers exiting the labor force , thus driving workforce participation to a multi-year low of 64.2 % ; 
· If part-time workers eager to work full time are included , almost one in six workers in America are either under- or unemployed ; 
· More than six million workers have been unemployed for more than six months , and four million for over a year ; 
· Unemployment among 16-19 year olds is at a staggering 24 % ; 
· With virtually no earned income and dwindling savings , the unemployed are least able to manage the current surge in gasoline and food prices , they are effectively shut off from credit , and many have mortgage debt that exceed the value of their homes . 
These and many other facts speak to an unpleasant and unusual reality for the United States . 
The country now has an unemployment problem that is large in magnitude and increasingly structural in nature . 
The consequences are multifaceted , involving immediate personal anguish , rising social and political tensions , economic losses , and budgetary pressures . 
This is much more than a problem for the here and now . 
High and intractable unemployment has serious negative long-term consequences that threaten to become exponentially worse . 
This is a crisis . 
Substantial international research shows that the longer one is unemployed , the harder it is to get a job . 
This erodes an economy &apos;s skills base and saps its long-term productive capacities . 
And , if unemployment is particularly acute among the young , as is the case today , too many of the unemployed risk becoming unemployable . 
Undoubtedly , the Great Recession triggered by the global financial crisis has contributed to this worrisome situation . 
Unfortunately , the problem is much deeper , as it was long in the making . 
At its root , America &apos;s jobs crisis is the result of many years of under-investment in human resources and the social sectors . 
The education system has lagged the progress made in other countries . 
Job retraining initiatives have been woefully inadequate . 
Labor mobility has been declining . 
And insufficient attention has been devoted to maintaining an adequate social safety net . 
These realities were masked by the craziness that characterized America &apos;s pre-2008 &quot; Golden Age &quot; of leverage , credit , and debt entitlement , which fueled a gigantic but unsustainable boom in construction , housing , leisure , and retail . 
The resulting job creation , though temporary , lulled policymakers into complacency about what was really going on in the labor market . 
As the boom turned into a prolonged bust , the longer-term inadequacies of the job situation have become visible to all who care to look ; and they are alarming . 
Left to its own devices , America &apos;s unemployment problem will deepen . 
This will widen the already-large gap between the country &apos;s haves and have-nots . 
It will undermine labor &apos;s skills and productivity . 
It will accentuate the burden imposed on the gradually declining number of people who remain in the labor force and have jobs . 
And it will make it even harder to find a medium-term solution to America &apos;s worsening public-debt and deficit dynamics . 
The US government has little time to waste if it is to avoid an even more protracted and entrenched unemployment problem . 
It must move now to address the problem &apos;s sources through multi-year programs that range from educational restructuring and worker retraining to productivity enhancement and housing-sector reform . 
And it must do so while better protecting the long-term unemployed , many of whom bear little responsibility for their current , once unthinkable , and unfortunately long-lasting predicament . 
It is past time for the US to wake up and confront in a holistic fashion its unemployment crisis . 
As everyone who has ever had an unpalatable job knows , shutting off the alarm and pulling the blanket over one &apos;s head is not a solution .
