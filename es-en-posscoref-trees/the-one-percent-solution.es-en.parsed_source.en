The One Percent Solution 
More than a billion people now live on less than the purchasing power equivalent , in their own country , of what can be bought in the US for $ 1.00 . 
In the year 2000 , Americans made private donations for foreign aid of all kinds totaling about $ 4 per person , or roughly $ 20 per family . 
Through their government , they gave another $ 10 per person , or $ 50 per family . 
That makes a total of $ 70 per family . 
In comparison , in the aftermath of the destruction of the World Trade Center , the American Red Cross received so much money that it abandoned any attempt to examine how much help potential recipients needed . 
It drew a line across lower Manhattan and offered anyone living below that line the equivalent of three months &apos; rent ( or , if they owned their own apartment , three months &apos; mortgage and maintenance payments ) . 
If recipients claimed to have been affected by the destruction of the Twin Towers , they received money for utilities and groceries as well . 
Most residents of the area below the line were not displaced or evacuated , but they were offered mortgage or rent assistance nonetheless . 
Red Cross volunteers set up card tables in the lobbies of expensive apartment buildings where financial analysts , lawyers , and rock stars live , to inform residents of the offer . 
The higher the rent people paid , the more money they got . 
New Yorkers , wealthy or not , living in lower Manhattan on September 11 , 2001 , were able to receive an average of $ 5,300 per family . 
The difference between $ 70 and $ 5,300 may be a solid indication of the relative weight that Americans give to the interests of their fellow citizens compared with what they give to people elsewhere . 
Even that underestimates the difference , since the Americans who received the money generally had less need of it than the world &apos;s poorest people . 
At the UN Millennium Summit , the nations of the world committed themselves to a set of targets , prominent among which was halving the number of people living in poverty by 2015 . 
The World Bank estimated the cost of meeting these targets to be an additional $ 40- $ 60 billion per year . 
So far the money has not been forthcoming . 
Although described as &quot; ambitious , &quot; the millennium goals are modest , for to halve the number of people living in poverty , all that is required - over 15 years - is to reach the better-off half of the world &apos;s poorest people , and move them marginally above the poverty line . 
That could , in theory , leave the worst-off 500 million people in poverty just as dire as they are now experiencing . 
Moreover , during every day of those 15 years , thousands of children will die from poverty-related causes . 
How much would it require , per person , to raise the necessary $ 40-60 billion ? 
There are about 900 million people in the developed world , 600 million of them adults . 
A donation of about $ 100 per adult per year for the next 15 years could achieve the Millennium goals . 
For someone earning $ 27,500 per annum , the average salary in the developed world , this is less than 0.4 % of annual income , or less than 1 cent out of every $ 2 that they earn . 
Of course , not all residents of rich countries have income to spare after meeting their basic needs . 
But there are hundreds of millions of rich people who live in poor countries , and they could also give . 
We could , therefore , advocate that everyone with income to spare , after meeting their family &apos;s basic needs , should contribute a minimum of 0.4 % of their income to organizations working to help the world &apos;s poorest people , and that would probably be enough to meet the Millennium goals . 
A more useful symbolic figure than 0.4 % would be 1 % , and this , added to existing levels of government aid ( which in every country of the world except Denmark fall below 1 % of GNP , and in the US is only 0.1 % ) might be closer to what it would take to eliminate , rather than halve , global poverty . 
We tend to think of charity as something that is &quot; morally optional &quot; - good to do , but not wrong to fail to do . 
As long as one does not kill , maim , steal , cheat , and so on , one can be a morally virtuous citizen , even if one spends lavishly and gives nothing to charity . 
But those who have enough to spend on luxuries , yet fail to share even a tiny fraction of their income with the poor , must bear some responsibility for the deaths they could have prevented . 
Those who do not meet even the minimal 1 % standard should be seen as doing something that is morally wrong . 
Anyone who thinks about their ethical obligations will rightly decide that - since , no matter what we do , not everyone will give even 1 % - they should do more . 
I have in the past advocated giving much larger sums . 
But if , in order to change our standards in a manner that stands a realistic chance of success , we focus on what we can expect everyone to do , there is something to be said for setting a donation of 1 % of annual income to overcome world poverty as the bare minimum that one must do to lead a morally decent life . 
To give that amount requires no moral heroics . 
To fail to give it shows indifference to the continuation of dire poverty and avoidable , poverty-related deaths .
