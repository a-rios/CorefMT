The Global Economy &apos;s Tale Risks 
TOKYO - Fluctuations in the world &apos;s economies are largely due to the stories we hear and tell about them . 
These popular , emotionally relevant narratives sometimes inspire us to go out and spend , start businesses , build new factories and office buildings , and hire employees ; at other times , they put fear in our hearts and impel us to sit tight , save our resources , curtail spending , and reduce risk . 
They either stimulate our &quot; animal spirits &quot; or muffle them . 
Since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assumed office in December 2012 and launched his program of monetary and fiscal stimulus and structural reform , the impact on Japanese confidence has been profound . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , the output gap - the difference between actual and potential GDP - narrowed from -3.6 % in 2011 to -0.9 % in 2013 . 
Most of the rest of the world lacks a comprehensive , easily understood narrative of positive change similar to Japan &apos;s &quot; Abenomics . &quot; 
The output gap for the world &apos;s major advanced economies , as calculated by the IMF , remains disappointing , at -3.2 % in 2013 , which is less than half-way back to normal from 2009 , the worst year of the global financial crisis , when the gap was -5.3 % . 
We seem to be at the mercy of our narratives . 
Ever since 2009 , most of us have just been waiting for some story to turn our hearts aglow with hope and confidence - and to reinvigorate our economies . 
Think of the story of the real-estate boom in the United States and other countries in the first half of the 2000 &quot; s . 
This was a story not of a &quot; bubble &quot; ; rather , the boom was a triumph of capitalist enterprise in a new millennium . 
These stories were so powerful because a huge number of people were psychologically - and financially - invested in them . 
Most families owned a house , so they were automatically participating in the boom . 
With the abrupt end of the boom in 2006 , that ego-boosting story also ended . 
We were not all investing geniuses after all . 
It was just a bubble , we learned . 
Our confidence in ourselves , and hence in our futures , took a hit , discouraging economic risk-taking . 
Then the financial crisis erupted , scaring the entire world . 
A story of opportunity and riches turned into one of corrupt mortgage lenders , overleveraged financial institutions , dimwitted experts , and captured regulators . 
The economy was careening like a rudderless ship , and the sharp operators who had duped us into getting on board - call them the 1 % - were slipping away in the only lifeboats . 
By early 2009 , the plunge in stock markets around the world reached its nadir , and fear of a deep depression , according to the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey , was at its highest level since the second oil crisis in the early 1980 &quot; s . 
Stories of the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s were recalled from our dimmest memories - or from our parents &quot; and grandparents &quot; memories - and retold . 
To understand why economic recovery ( if not that of the stock market ) has remained so weak since 2009 , we need to identify which stories have been affecting popular psychology . 
One example is the rapid advance in smartphones and tablet computers . 
Apple &apos;s iPhone was launched in 2007 , and Google &apos;s Android phones in 2008 , just as the crisis was beginning , but most of their growth has been since then . 
Apple &apos;s iPad was launched in 2010 . 
Since then , these products have entered almost everyone &apos;s consciousness ; we see people using them everywhere - on the street and in hotel lobbies , restaurants , and airports . 
This ought to be a confidence-boosting story : amazing technologies are emerging , sales are booming , and entrepreneurship is alive and very well . 
This time , in fact , the smartphone / tablet story is associated with a sense of foreboding , for the wealth that these devices generate seems to be concentrated among a tiny number of tech entrepreneurs who probably live in a faraway country . 
And now that our phones talk to us ( Apple launched Siri , the artificial voice that answers your spoken questions , on its iPhones in 2010 ) , they fuel dread that they can replace us , just as earlier waves of automation rendered much human capital obsolete . 
I had the pleasure of meeting with Abe on this trip . 
He sticks to the script , telling a story of taking aggressive and definitive action against an economic malaise that has plagued Japan for decades . 
He inspires confidence ; 
Abe is also described as reviving national patriotism , even nationalism . 
Though I heard none of this from him in my meeting , I think it may be a central part of his story , too . 
Nationalism , after all , is intrinsically bound up with individual identity . 
It creates a story for each member of the nation , a story about what he or she can do as part of a successful country . 
Some of Abe &apos;s most controversial steps , such as visiting the Yasukuni Shrine despite Chinese and Korean objections , only increase the story &apos;s impact . 
Still , it is not easy for national leaders , even those with Abe &apos;s talents , to manage such stories , just as it is hard for film producers to make a blockbuster every time . 
No leader can consistently shape the narratives that affect the economy .
