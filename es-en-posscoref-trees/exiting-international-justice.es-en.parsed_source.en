Exiting International Justice 
I recently took part in a conference in Belgrade entitled &quot; Dealing with the Past in ex-Yugoslavia . &quot; 
Although the rest of postcommunist Europe confronted such questions a decade ago , the Balkan wars of the 1990 &quot; s left both perpetrators and victims stuck in a time warp of justice delayed . 
As the conference &apos;s participants made their way into Belgrade &apos;s Hyatt Hotel , an angry band of mostly older protesters bearing posters that read , &quot; Free Milosevic &quot; greeted them . 
In a flurry of media and security , they confronted Carla Del Ponte , chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) in The Hague . 
Del Ponte is pressing Serbia &apos;s government to cooperate in the still unresolved cases of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic , who ordered , implemented , and oversaw the massacre of 7,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995 . 
The protesters are not unrepresentative of Serb opinion . 
Almost a decade after the start of the ICTY &apos;s work , debate still rages over responsibility for war crimes , with little agreement on even the most basic facts of the conflicts in Bosnia , Croatia , and Kosovo . 
Serbian Prime Minister ( then President ) Vojislav Kostunica &apos;s attempt in 2001 to set up a truth commission was doomed from the outset by allegations of bias , and was disbanded within a year . 
The ICTY is also in trouble . 
To be sure , Milosevic is on trial in The Hague for war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide . 
After all , at Nuremberg , the top rung of the Third Reich was tried and convicted within months . 
By contrast , Milosevic has taken advantage of the ICTY &apos;s procedures to delay his trial , while challenging its jurisdiction and legitimacy . 
Indeed , Serbia &apos;s last presidential election became something of a referendum on Milosevic - and hence on Serbia &apos;s relations with the West and the wider world . 
The pro-Milosevic candidate , Tomislav Nikolic , lost , but he received 46 % of the vote . 
Despite his campaign promises , Serbia &apos;s President Boris Tadic has so far failed to cooperate with the ICTY by assisting in turning over Mladic ( Karadzic is probably not in Serbia ) , who would surely testify against Milosevic . 
One understands his trepidation : the first post-Milosevic prime minister , Zoran Djindjic , cooperated with the tribunal , and paid for it with his life . 
Such foot-dragging exposes the ICTY &apos;s fundamental weakness : unlike the Nuremberg tribunal , the international community convened it 
This continues to impede the case against Milosevic , raising questions about whether there is sufficient proof directly linking him to the policy of genocidal ethnic cleansing , although this is likely to be less problematic since the charges against him turn not on &quot; command responsibility , &quot; but instead on the ICTY &apos;s charter principles of individual responsibility . 
But time is running out . 
The ICTY must wrap up new indictments this year , and disband by 2008 . 
It enters this end game facing diminished resources and waning political will within the international community . 
What will be the Tribunal &apos;s legacy ? 
From the start , the ICTY &apos;s aims were ambitious , having been launched under the UN Security Council &apos;s peacemaking powers . 
If this meant that the Tribunal was intended to deter further violence , then it failed , at least in the short run . 
After all , atrocities - including the Srebrenica massacre - continued after the ICTY began operating . 
What about ethnic reconciliation ? 
The ICTY &apos;s first chief prosecutor , Richard Goldstone , called for condemnation of ethnic persecution in order to enable all sides to transcend identity politics and move towards a more liberal political order . 
Individual accountability would somehow break the chain of ethnic identity and communal vengeance . 
But fostering ethnic reconciliation is a tall order for any court , and the ICTY hasn &apos;t yet delivered . 
A liberal political order implies a rule of law that recognizes precedents and analogical thinking . 
Indeed , the coincidence of the NATO bombing in 1999 with the indictment of Milosevic helped convert both events into &quot; attacks on the Serbian people . &quot; 
Historical denial is no less evident in Croatia , where the polarities of blame and suffering have simply been reversed . 
There , too , the ICTY will not be missed . 
So the talk nowadays is of the right &quot; exit strategy &quot; from international justice . 
When the ICTY closes its doors , where should its unfinished cases go ? 
Del Ponte has called for &quot; new partnerships for justice . &quot; 
That sounds fine , but what , realistically , are the choices ? 
Can the ICTY &apos;s investigations and indictments really be turned over to national courts ? 
So far , the picture is not promising : the few domestic trials in the region continue to reflect the fractious politics and pervasive ethnic bias that surround them . 
As in many parts of the world , it may be several generations before the region &apos;s crimes can be worked through . 
The ICTY &apos;s responsibility should be to forge and disseminate a record that limits the possibility of historical denial .
