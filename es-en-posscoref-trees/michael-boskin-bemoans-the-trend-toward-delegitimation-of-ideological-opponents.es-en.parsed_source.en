Policy &quot; Crimes &quot; 
STANFORD - When the Berlin Wall fell a quarter-century ago this November , pundits led by Francis Fukuyama proclaimed the end of history - the triumph of democratic capitalism over all rival systems . 
America &apos;s economic success and the collapse of communism fed the narrative . 
The long political , intellectual , and , at times , military confrontation that we knew as the Cold War was over . 
Indeed , at a meeting in Warsaw in the winter of 1990 , General Wojciech Jaruzelski , Poland &apos;s President and communist party boss , declared to me and my cabinet colleagues that &quot; The forces of history have inevitably led us to capitalism . &quot; 
He could not free himself of the Hegelian dialectic , but he admitted that communism had gotten history &apos;s end point entirely wrong . 
A couple of decades later , various forms of capitalism have worked wonders for some former communist and socialist countries . 
Poland is an excellent example of a successful economic and political transition . 
But capitalism is far from flourishing everywhere . 
North Korea , which never had a transition and maintains heavy-handed central planning , is an economic basket case . 
And soft socialism combined with subsidized &quot; national champions &quot; is decaying in France . 
Moreover , in many countries , capitalism arrived without democracy . 
China is an obvious example of capitalist success and lagging political reform . 
For these countries , honest competition at the ballot box , free and open debate , and respect for minority rights - the foundation of liberal democracy - are not currently on the agenda . 
The champagne corks were popped prematurely in 1989 . 
Indeed , precisely because liberal democracy did not triumph worldwide , many pressing crises now require attention and action . 
But we must also focus - in the media and in the classroom - on the less dramatic but nonetheless dangerous attacks on democracy and democratic values , including in the Americas , where statist regimes and others have been attacking freedom of speech and of the press . 
As a result , policy disputes can become criminal . 
In a pernicious recent example , Venezuela &apos;s President Nicolás Maduro , in a nationally televised speech , ordered the country &apos;s attorney-general and public prosecutor to take &quot; action &quot; against the Harvard economist Ricardo Hausmann for daring to ask , &quot; Should Venezuela Default ? &quot; 
Hausmann was right to ask that question . 
Research overwhelmingly shows that successful economic development requires inclusive property rights , the enforcement of contracts , and even-handed rule of law . 
Venezuela currently has none of these ingredients . 
So it is not surprising that massive government deficits financed by explosive monetary growth have caused the currency to collapse , with multinationals writing down the value of their Venezuelan subsidiaries each time the official exchange rate is lowered . 
Nor is it surprising that , with inadequate foreign exchange , the country is having difficulty paying its bills , or that price controls and police-state regulation have severely worsened food shortages . 
Finally , amid widespread speculation that Venezuela may indeed default on up to $ 80 billion of foreign debt , it is not surprising that yields on its sovereign debt have hit 15 % . 
Venezuela , with some of the world &apos;s largest hydrocarbon reserves , should be enjoying an era of prosperity amid high oil prices . 
But corruption , political control of the national oil company , and nationalization of foreign-owned oil assets have caused exactly the opposite . 
( Disclosure : I serve on the board of one such company , ExxonMobil , which is awaiting the results of arbitration in international court . ) 
The combination of authoritarian rule , extreme populism , socialist ideology , and incompetence under former President Hugo Chávez and Maduro has wreaked havoc on Venezuela . 
But when Hausmann , a Venezuelan citizen and former government minister , discusses an important question that is being asked by investors around the world , he is not merely chastised , but threatened . 
The implication is clear : Speak out and you may be jailed . 
This is not the first such treatment of a prominent economist in Latin America . 
A decade ago , it was Domingo Cavallo , who , as Argentina &apos;s finance minister , had pegged the peso to the dollar to bring down the 1,000 % inflation that was destroying the economy - and the fabric of society . 
When he abruptly ended the peg in 2001 , a severe recession followed , and he was arrested and jailed . 
Fortunately , international outrage , including a campaign organized by North American economists , helped to free Cavallo . 
I do not agree with all of the policies advocated by Cavallo or Hausmann , or any other policymaker for that matter . 
But should we really criminalize not corruption or self-dealing , but policy disagreements ? 
Do we want every new government to jail its political opponents - as Ukraine &apos;s deposed President Viktor Yanukovych did to former Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko - because it rejects the policies they enacted or condemns the perceived outcomes ? 
We have not fallen so far yet in the United States . 
But even here , it has become far too common to impugn the motives and values , not just the ideas , of those with whom we disagree . 
Journalists , politicians , and public intellectuals who should know better routinely argue not just that policies and proposals are wrong-headed , but that the proponents themselves must be evil to have enacted or suggested them . 
Criticism and disagreement should not be allowed to curdle into the hateful vitriol that demeans so much public discourse today . 
Words have consequences and can inflame thuggery or worse . 
Even attempted suppression of free and open debate , or official delegitimization of those with alternative policy proposals , is dangerous . 
Such outrages must be resisted , before more people like Cavallo and Hausmann are threatened - and before the disease spreads to North America and Europe .
