Israel &apos;s Debacle at Sea 
HAIFA - Israel was dead wrong in launching an attack by naval commandos against a flotilla carrying pro-Palestinian activists who were making an attempt to break the Israeli-Egyptian siege of Gaza . 
That long-term siege , put in place after Hamas assumed sole control of the government in Gaza - breaking with the Palestine National Authority in the process - is a humanitarian catastrophe and a grave moral error . 
There can be no excuses , no &quot; but we didn &apos;t intend . &quot; 
The Israeli government of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu must apologize to the victims , investigate what happened on the blood-stained decks of the flotilla &apos;s boats , and move on to honest peace talks with willing Palestinian leaders , like Abu Mazen , the president of the Palestine National Authority . 
The fact that Hamas is refusing to make peace has nothing to do with the recent travesty in the sea en route to Gaza . 
The fact that Gazan militants have fired missiles on Israeli civilians , and continue to do so , is irrelevant . 
The fact that the flotilla did not carry only &quot; peace activists , &quot; but also many people who wish to see Israel destroyed and Israelis perish , is no reason to drop soldiers upon them . 
Even the fact that some of the &quot; humanitarian aid workers &quot; turned on the soldiers with a rather un-peaceful array of knives and clubs is no justification for shooting to kill . 
The trespassers on the scene , the true-blue pirates , were unfortunately the uniformed Israeli commandos acting in my name . 
Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak sent top combatants into a seafaring crowd of aggressive protesters and thought that they would win . 
What were they thinking ? Other cabinet ministers had been promised that no fatalities would occur . 
The Israeli public woke up to a justified storm of global outrage . 
Once again , an army intended for self-defense on the battlefield was sent on a mission that only diplomacy , humanity , and tact could resolve . 
Has Israel lost the remainder of its wisdom ? 
Are we witnessing a classic case of sheer political stupidity ? 
If so , then here &apos;s further proof that only peaceful and stable countries can afford the luxury of incompetent decision-makers . 
In a hypersensitive reality , stupidity equals malice . 
But I am afraid that something more than stupidity ( though less than plain evil ) is at work here . 
Israel &apos;s current leaders , and a segment of Israeli society , are trapped in an idiosyncratic logic of fear and self-centeredness . 
This deviant logic has expanded Israel &apos;s justifiable acts of self-defense ( such as targeting rocket launchers in Gaza and Lebanon ) into all-out attacks . 
It has eroded the Israeli ethos of respect for the lives of civilians , even when militants hide among them . 
It has forced innocent Gazan civilians to pay dearly for their rulers &quot; crimes . 
And it has muddied the Jewish moral legacy demanding the active pursuit of both justice and peace . 
In short , Israel &apos;s current leadership has inflated &quot; security &quot; into a surreal new cult , trumping morality . 
Not all Israelis share this logic . 
Not all of us feel more secure when civilian protesters are shot in our name . 
Israel should apologize and make amends . 
In this particular case , we must even apologize to those who openly loathe us and our state . 
Hatred , after all , is not a punishable crime . 
Moderate Israeli citizens , who had nothing to do with the flotilla fiasco , should lower their heads in shame for their government &apos;s act . 
And then we should raise our eyes again , proudly meet the gaze of those Palestinians who are willing to talk peace with us , and tell them : &quot; Let &apos;s get on with it . 
No time to lose . &quot;
