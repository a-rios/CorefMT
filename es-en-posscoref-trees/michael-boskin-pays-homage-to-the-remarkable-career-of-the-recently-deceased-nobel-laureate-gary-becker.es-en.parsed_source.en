An Economist for the Ages 
STANFORD - Like many others , I first met the Nobel laureate economist Gary Becker , who died earlier this month , by reading his seminal works Human Capital and The Economics of Discrimination . 
Several dozen outstanding economists have won the Nobel Prize in Economics since Sweden &apos;s central bank began awarding it in 1969 , but Becker is among the handful who have fundamentally transformed how economists ( and social scientists more generally ) think about a wide array of important economic issues . 
Becker was remarkable for applying his penetrating insights , especially concerning economic incentives , to issues that had been mostly underexplored by economic analysis . 
This included viewing education as an investment , asking who gained and lost from discrimination , examining how families allocated their time , and explaining women &apos;s fertility decisions . 
His research on any one or two of these issues might well have won him a Nobel Prize on its own ; to develop important insights into such a wide range of questions is truly remarkable . 
He amply deserved the rare accolade accorded to him by his long-time mentor and friend , the late Milton Friedman ( himself a Nobel laureate who , like Becker , transformed economists &quot; thinking in many areas ) . 
Becker , declared Friedman , was &quot; the greatest social scientist who has lived and worked in the last half-century . &quot; 
Becker &apos;s constant focus was on the main forces driving human behavior and people &apos;s interaction both in markets and in non-market activities . 
Early in his career , his work was often criticized for being overly dependent on economic analysis in dealing with big social problems , sometimes touching raw nerves on very sensitive issues . 
For example , the notion of modeling children as a durable good seemed crass to some but led Becker to analyze the allocation of parental time and financial resources . 
He showed how this insight could predict trends in female labor-force participation and birth rates , and led to the policy conclusion that the best way to lower high birth rates in poor countries was to educate women . 
Better education would raise women &apos;s wages , making staying at home more costly , and would lead to higher female labor-force participation and a voluntary decline in birth rates . 
This analysis reflected Becker &apos;s deep belief in the power of incentives to lead people , in pursuit of their own interest and interacting within and outside markets , to achieve great things with minimal government input . 
In this sense , he was very much in the tradition of the great eighteenth-century Scottish economist Adam Smith , whose writings Becker regarded as one of the greatest influences on his career . 
Equally off-putting to some was the notion that education was an investment - that an important reason to pursue post-secondary schooling , for example , was to raise one &apos;s future earnings . 
The education establishment recoiled at what it considered a less-than-noble reason to seek higher education . 
And the idea that one could model the economics of racial discrimination as rational , if deplorable , behavior and trace out the implications was sometimes misconstrued as paying insufficient attention to the character and behavior flaws of those who discriminate . 
Truth will out , as Shakespeare reminds us , and eventually even Becker &apos;s harshest early critics came around to appreciating his deep insights and conclusions . 
For example , the education industry now touts the economic value of a college degree . 
And governments around the world conduct vast surveys of households &quot; time use . 
Few economists today work on these and related problems without building on Becker &apos;s foundations or laboring under his strong influence . 
On a personal note , some of my early research on the best way to tax families and on the effects of taxes on human-capital investment built on Becker &apos;s insights . 
Becker was a rarity among economists in recent decades . 
He often looked at broad , long-range trends and data , comparing things like family structure , number of children , and women &apos;s roles in the home and the market across many decades and even from one century to the next , or across very different societies . 
Cumulatively , his work yielded powerful conclusions , not only explaining trends in birth rates , but also showing that preferences for discrimination led to a tradeoff with profits . 
Workers who did not face discrimination in sectors where animus was rife would win , while the losers would include not just those directly being discriminated against , but also workers forced to compete when those workers sought employment elsewhere . 
Becker relied on rigorous standards in evaluating government policy . 
He knew , and documented , that government solutions to market failures could themselves fail , with the cure turning out to be worse than the disease . 
He sought to compare what was likely to be the actual government program , tax , or regulation to the problem it purported to solve , not to the idealized textbook solution academics favor but that is rarely adopted . 
The basic economic analysis that Becker developed was applicable everywhere , for everyone , and for all time . 
Conditions in the US in the nineteenth and late twentieth centuries - or in North America and Europe and developing Asia , Africa , or Latin America - might differ ; but the same economic models could be used to understand changing events and circumstances . 
In this sense , Becker was a great economist and a truly remarkable social scientist . 
His work stands as a testament to the power of deep thinking and the courage to follow it to its logical conclusions . 
That seems especially relevant in today &apos;s world , in which technology tempts us merely to scratch the surface of so many issues . 
He was a tremendous colleague at the Hoover Institution , a true and supportive friend , and admirably humble despite his incredible intellectual influence . 
He will be sorely missed .
