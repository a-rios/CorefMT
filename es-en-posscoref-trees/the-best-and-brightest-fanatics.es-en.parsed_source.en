The Best and Brightest Fanatics 
In Britain and Australia , several Muslim medical doctors and engineers have been arrested following a series of failed car bombings . 
The arrest of these well-educated professionals , together with the Egyptian doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri &apos;s role as al-Qaeda &apos;s deputy leader , raises questions that go far beyond disaffection among Muslims and the consequences of America &apos;s misadventures in the Middle East . 
Doctors and engineers , after all , are professionals . 
They are well-off , well-established members of society , not marginal figures whom we might expect to be drawn to desperate acts of violence . 
Moreover , they come from a scientific background , and science is usually not associated with religious zeal or political fanaticism . 
Of course , only a minority of zealous Muslims espouses political violence , and only a tiny number of Muslim professionals set off bombs . 
Nevertheless , the presence of doctors and engineers in fundamentalist movements stands out . 
In fact , fundamentalist leaders often have professional backgrounds . 
Doctors who organize groups based on literalist readings of scripture and engineers who lead Islamist political parties are familiar figures throughout the Muslim world . 
One reason for this is the difference between the cultures of basic science and applied science . 
Throughout the world , physicists and biologists tend to be more skeptical and less religious . 
Among engineers and biomedical professionals , however , conservative , even fundamentalist religious leanings are not so unusual . 
This phenomenon is not unique to Islam . 
In the United States , literalist Christians with engineering backgrounds have long led opposition to Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution . 
Compared to biologists , the ranks of medical doctors include a much larger proportion of creationists . 
Likewise , in Muslim countries , it is not unusual for engineering professors to denounce Darwin as a fraud , and many well-known doctors argue that modern technological and scientific developments are prefigured in the Koran . 
In the Muslim world , applied science has even more religious and political entanglements . 
In their effort to overcome centuries of military and commercial backwardness , Muslims have sought to industrialize , rationalize administration , and adopt modern forms of political life . 
However , a constant concern has been to adopt these changes without corrupting Muslim culture - to become technologically adept and yet remain devout Muslims . 
In this effort , professionals in applied science , as people who would help Muslim countries catch up with the West , have enjoyed enormous prestige . 
Engineering programs are in high demand , and engineers enjoy a status comparable to lawyers and doctors in the West . 
The best and the brightest young Muslims go into applied science , while basic science languishes . 
With their important role in modernization , applied scientists engage in cultural debates as well . 
A doctor may choose a secular path , or try to integrate a traditional faith with a modern profession . 
Such choices are directly connected to debates over the direction the whole society should take . 
To complicate matters further , the Islamic world is in a period of religious experimentation . 
Traditional doctrines and supernaturalism remain vigorous , but the structures of religious authority are changing . 
Today &apos;s fundamentalism is a modern way of being religious , more suitable to a literate , urban population than a peasantry guided by traditional religious scholars . 
Traditionally , Muslim scholars achieved status by mastering socially useful knowledge , which was Islamic law . 
Today , however , applied science is also useful knowledge for the modern world . 
As a result , in a modernizing environment , doctors and engineers can find themselves in positions of religious authority , leading a Koran study group and interpreting scripture . 
The Muslim world is home to many successful movements that combine doctrinal conservatism with a modern outlook that supports capitalism and embraces technology . 
Professionals have been integral parts of such movements , because modernization encourages action rather than resignation . 
Political ideas are easily translated into religious language , and in extreme circumstances , violent jihadism is used to express political frustrations . 
But the possibility of violence should not distract us from noticing that fundamentalist convictions also motivate positive political activism . 
Islamists ( such as those in Hamas ) gain credibility among Muslim populations because of the social services and community support that they help to organize . 
Indeed , fundamentalist professionals often excel in such activism . 
Their puritanical religious style sets forth an ideal morality with clear-cut rules that are similar to the constraints of an engineering project . 
Engineers set out to change the world according to a blueprint , as they were trained to do . 
Religiously colored political violence will always attract some professionals . 
But , again , it is a tiny number . 
The majority of observant Muslims are peaceful , and most Islamists today have adopted more moderate , democratic politics . 
Increasingly Islamism is becoming a form of right-wing populism . 
But , like right-wing Christians in the US , Islamists can be legitimate parts of a democratic political landscape . 
Indeed , one virtue of democracy is its ability to dampen violent tendencies . 
If we are to encourage democratic trends in political Islam , we must learn to think of Islamists as political opponents rather than as violent adversaries who may have medical and engineering degrees .
