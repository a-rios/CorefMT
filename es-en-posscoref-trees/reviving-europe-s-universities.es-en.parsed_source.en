Reviving Europe &apos;s Universities 
COPENHAGEN  -  
The world &apos;s first university was Plato &apos;s Academy in Athens , venerable old universities are scattered across Europe from Coimbra to Cambridge to Copenhagen , and the modern university , uniting research and education , was pioneered by Wilhelm von Humboldt in Berlin . 
Yet today , universities in the United States easily outperform their European counterparts . 
Less than 2 % of the European Union &apos;s GDP is devoted to research , compared to 2.5 % in the US and 3 % in Japan . 
Spending per student on tertiary education is just over $ 9,000 in France , slightly under $ 11,000 in Germany , and almost $ 12,000 in the UK . 
Some EU countries , such as Denmark , do better , but still lag far behind the US , which spends more than $ 25,000 . 
Measuring the quality of output is difficult , although The Times Higher Education Supplement attempts to do so every year . 
Only three European universities - Oxford , Cambridge , and Imperial College in London - made it into the top ten in the most recent list ; all the rest were American . 
Only ten universities from the entire EU have ever made it into the top 50 . 
Germany &apos;s top university , Heidelberg , ranks 58th . 
As a result , roughly 400,000 European scholars currently reside in the US , and almost 60 % of European citizens who received doctorates in US from 1998 to 2001 chose to remain there . 
There are twice as many Europeans studying in the US as there are Americans studying in Europe . 
Europe &apos;s &quot; education gap &quot; doesn &apos;t stop at the Atlantic . 
China and India represent more than mushrooming factories and low-cost semi-skilled labor . 
Just as in Europe , the industrial revolution in &quot; Chindia &quot; is also creating an ambitious new middle class that is willing and able to send its children to university . 
But in today &apos;s world , students and researchers choose a university much as consumers shop in the international marketplace . 
Europe has made some modest efforts to regain university competitiveness . 
In March 2000 , EU leaders meeting in Lisbon set the goal of making Europe the world &apos;s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010 , and two years later they agreed that investment in R D must reach 3 % of GDP by 2010 . 
Such ambitious goals , however unrealistic , can have a disciplining effect , leading some EU countries to increase their spending , while the EU itself has launched a number of promising schemes . 
The seventh Framework Program , worth some â‚¬ 50 billion - a 40 % increase over the sixth program - is perhaps the most prominent funding source tool through which the EU supports R D activities . 
But the EU and European governments must do more . 
Overall spending is still dwarfed by US federal research and development spending , which will total $ 137 billion in the 2007 fiscal year . 
European leaders must therefore substantially increase research funding when the EU budget is next due for revision in 2008 and 2009 . 
Although the core financial burden will be on the member states , the EU level can make an important contribution . 
Moreover , although the European Commission clearly has a duty to prevent mismanagement and fraud , every application for EU funding requires extremely onerous procedures . 
Eliminating bureaucratic red tape , as the Commission has now pledged to do , would be a substantial boon to European researchers . 
Finally , Europe must place more emphasis on basic research . 
Of course , our scientists should respond to current problems in society . 
But if basic research is neglected , attempts to produce quick innovations through applied research will be futile . 
The European Research Council , which is to award research grants on the basis of peer-reviewed excellence , will therefore be an important step forward , and the EU should further increase its funding . 
But just throwing money at universities isn &apos;t enough . 
As the former Financial Times editor Richard Lambert , together with Nick Butler , commented in a report published by London &apos;s Centre for European Reform entitled The future of European universities : Renaissance or decay ? , EU governments are stuck in a vicious circle : &quot; The universities will get no more money unless they reform , and they cannot reform without more money . &quot; 
The Danish government has sought to break free from this vicious circle by introducing reforms before pledging to increase budgets . 
In 2003 , Denmark &apos;s universities were turned into self-governing institutions run by governing boards dominated by external representatives . 
Last year , the government merged 12 universities into eight in order to achieve substantial economies of scale , and the Danish parliament approved a nearly 50 % increase in government spending on research by 2010 . 
The Danish case highlights the pivotal role of governance reform if Europe is ever to meet its Lisbon goals . 
The University of Copenhagen &apos;s mergers with the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University and the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences have made it the largest university in Scandinavia . 
We now aspire to becoming the most significant health and life science research center in Europe , owing to a remarkable cluster of knowledge based 5,000 researchers , an excellent medical school , 11 university hospitals , and a thriving biotech business environment that already includes market leaders in diabetes and neuroscience . 
Until we embarked on governance reform , this would probably have been impossible . 
Our experience so far has taught us that university managers should not accommodate rising student populations by inflating their core business . 
However fierce the global competition , they should concentrate on safeguarding quality and achieving excellence in research and education .
