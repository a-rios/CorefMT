Forget Inflation 
MUNICH - To paraphrase Winston Churchill , never have so many billions of dollars been pumped out by so many governments and central banks . 
The United States government is pumping $ 789 billion into its economy , Europe $ 255 billion , and China $ 587 billion . 
The US Federal Reserve increased its stock of base money in 2008 by 97 % , the European Central Bank by 37 % . 
The Federal funds rate in the US is practically zero , and the European Central Bank &apos;s main refinancing rate , already at an all-time low of 2 % , will likely fall further in the coming months . 
The Fed has given ordinary banks direct access to its credit facilities , and the ECB no longer rations the supply of base money , instead providing as much liquidity as banks demand . 
Since last October , Western countries &quot; rescue packages for banks have reached about $ 4.3 trillion . 
Many now fear that these huge infusions of cash will make inflation inevitable . 
In Germany , which suffered from hyper-inflation in 1923 , there is widespread fear that people will again lose their savings and need to start from scratch . 
Other countries share this concern , if to a lesser extent . 
But these fears are not well founded . 
True , the stock of liquidity is rising rapidly . 
By providing extra liquidity , central banks merely reduce the amount of money withdrawn from expenditure on goods and services , which mitigates , but does not reverse , the negative demand shock that hit the world economy . 
This is a trivial but important point that follows from the theory of supply and demand . 
Think of the oil market , for example . 
It is impossible to infer solely from an increase in the volume of transactions how the price of oil will change . 
With the increase in the aggregate stock of money balances , things are basically the same . 
If this increase resulted from an increase in supply , the value of money will go down , which means inflation . 
Obviously , the latter risk is more relevant in today &apos;s conditions . 
If the underlying price trend is added to this , it is easily understandable why inflation rates are currently coming down everywhere . 
In the US , the annual inflation rate fell from 5.6 % in July 2008 to 0.1 % in December 2008 , and in Europe from 4.4 % in July 2008 to 2.2 % in January 2009 . 
At the moment , no country is truly suffering deflation , but that may change as the crisis deepens . 
Germany , with its notoriously low inflation rate , may be among the first countries to experience declining prices . 
The most recent data show that the price index in January was up by only 0.9 % year on year . 
This deflationary tendency will create serious economic problems , which do not necessarily result from deflation as such , but may stem from a natural resistance to deflation . 
In each country , a number of prices are rigid , because sellers resist selling cheaper , as low productivity gains and wage defense by unions leave no margin for lower prices . 
Thus , deflationary pressure will to some extent result in downward quantity adjustments , which will deepen the real crisis . 
Moreover , even if prices on average exhibit some downward flexibility , deflation necessarily increases the real rate of interest , given that nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero . 
The result is an increase in the cost of capital to firms , which lowers investment and exacerbates the crisis . 
This would be a particular problem for the US , where the Fed allowed the Federal funds rate to approach zero in January 2009 . 
The only plausible inflationary scenario presupposes that when economies recover , central banks do not raise interest rates sufficiently in the coming boom , keeping too much of the current liquidity in the market . 
Such a scenario is not impossible . 
This is the policy Italians pursued for decades in the pre-euro days , and the Fed might one day feel that it should adopt such a stance . 
But the ECB , whose only mandate is to maintain price stability , cannot pursue this policy without fundamental changes in legislation . 
Moreover , this scenario cannot take place before the slump has turned into a boom . 
So , for the time being , the risk of inflation simply does not exist . 
Japan provides good lessons about where the true risks are , as it has been suffering from deflation or near-deflation for 14 years . 
Since 1991 , Japan has been mired in what Harvard economist Alvin Hansen , a contemporary of Keynes , once described as &quot; secular stagnation . &quot; 
Ever since Japan &apos;s banking crisis began in 1990 , the country has been in a liquidity trap , with central bank rates close to zero , and from 1998 to 2005 the price level declined by more than 4 % . 
Japanese governments have tried to overcome the slump with Hansen &apos;s recipes , issuing one Keynesian program of deficit spending after the other and pushing the debt-to-GDP ratio from 64 % in 1991 to 171 % in 2008 . 
But all of that helped only a little . 
Japan is still stagnating . 
Not inflation , but a Japanese-type period of deflationary pressure with ever increasing public debt is the real risk that the world will be facing for years to come .
