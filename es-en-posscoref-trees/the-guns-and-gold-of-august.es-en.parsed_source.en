The Guns and Gold of August 
CAMBRIDGE - China and Russia have just provided the world with sharp contrasts in the use of power . 
As the French analyst Dominique Moisi recently put it , &quot; whereas China intends to seduce and impress the world by the number of its Olympic medals , Russia wants to impress the world by demonstrating its military superiority - China &apos;s soft power versus Russia &apos;s hard power . &quot; 
Some American analysts , such as Edward Luttwak , have concluded that Russia &apos;s invasion of Georgia proves the &quot; irrelevance &quot; of soft power , and the dominance of hard military power . 
In reality , the story will turn out to be more complicated for both countries . 
Soft power is the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payment . 
It is not the solution to all problems . 
North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il &apos;s fondness for Hollywood movies is unlikely to affect his nuclear weapons program . 
And soft power got nowhere in dissuading Afghanistan &apos;s Taliban government from supporting Al Qaeda in the 1990 &quot; s . 
But other goals , such as the promotion of democracy and human rights , are better achieved by soft power , which can also create an enabling or disabling environment , as the United States discovered in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq . 
Skeptics who belittle soft power because it does not solve all problems are like a boxer who fights without using his left hand because his right hand is stronger . 
Soft power is rarely sufficient , but it is often crucial to combine soft and hard power to have an effective &quot; smart power &quot; strategy . 
As the American Defense Secretary Robert Gates said last year , &quot; I am here to make the case for strengthening our capacity to use soft power and for better integrating it with hard power . &quot; 
Military force is obviously a source of hard power , but the same resource can sometimes contribute to soft power behavior . 
The impressive job by the American military in providing humanitarian relief after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and the South Asian earthquake in 2005 helped restore America &apos;s attractiveness . 
On the other hand , misuse of military resources can undercut soft power . 
The Soviet Union had a great deal of soft power in the years after World War II , but destroyed it by the way the Kremlin used its hard power against Hungary and Czechoslovakia . 
Russia is now going through a period of nationalistic reaction to what it regards as the humiliation it suffered after the Soviet empire collapsed . 
With the rise in energy prices boosting its economy , Russia has seen an opportunity to reassert its power over its neighbors . 
In addition , it felt aggrieved by plans for further expansion of NATO , a proposed ballistic missile defense system in Eastern Europe , and Western recognition of Kosovo &apos;s secession from Russia &apos;s ally , Serbia . 
Russia has sought to weaken Georgia &apos;s government for some time . 
In early August , Russia set a trap in South Ossetia , and Georgia foolishly walked into it . 
If the Russians had used their &quot; peacekeeping &quot; force solely to protect South Ossetians &quot; &quot; self-determination &quot; ( citing the precedent of Western actions in Kosovo ) , they would have done little damage to their soft power , and the benefits could have exceeded the costs . 
By bombing , blockading , and occupying many parts of Georgia , delaying its withdrawal , parading blindfolded Georgian soldiers , and failing to protect Georgian citizens , Russia lost its claims to legitimacy and sowed fear and mistrust in much of the world . 
Neighbors such as Ukraine have become more wary . 
An immediate cost was Poland &apos;s reversal of its resistance to an American anti-ballistic missile system . 
When Russia appealed for support of its Georgia policy to its fellow members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization , China and others refused . 
Longer-term costs may include the failure of Russia &apos;s proposal for a new European security system , a revived European interest in the Nabucco and White Stream gas pipelines that skirt Russia , and a decline in foreign investment . 
In contrast , China ended August with its soft power enhanced by its successful Olympic Games . 
In October 2007 , President Hu Jintao declared China &apos;s intent to increase its soft power , and the Olympics were an important part of that strategy . 
With its establishment of Confucius Institutes to promote Chinese culture , increased international broadcasting , attraction of foreign students to its universities , and softer diplomacy toward its neighbors in Southeast Asia , China has made major investments in soft power . 
Opinion polls show an improvement in its international reputation . 
But China &apos;s government did not achieve all its Olympic objectives . 
By not keeping its promises to allow peaceful demonstrations and free Internet access , China undercut its soft-power gains . 
It will take more than a successful Olympics to overcome these self-imposed limits . 
For example , a recent Pew poll showed that despite China &apos;s efforts to increase its soft power , the US remains dominant in all soft-power categories . 
So , while China won the most gold medals , the Beijing Olympics did not turn the tables on the US outside the sports arenas . 
One hopes that China &apos;s leaders will learn the importance of free expression for establishing soft power . 
Of course , only time will tell the ultimate outcomes of the guns and gold of August for Russia and China . 
Unlike an Olympic competition , their recent performance will not be given a final score until well after their power games have been played .
