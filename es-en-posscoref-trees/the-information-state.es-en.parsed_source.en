The Information State 
MOSCOW - The new American administration of Barack Obama is planning to appoint a chief technology officer , following the lead of most large corporations nowadays . 
Should other countries have one , too ? 
Rather than slavishly copy the United States , I think most countries should have a chief information officer - someone who thinks about information as an agent of change , not just as an agent of efficiency . 
The free flow of information constrains official power and gives individuals the power to act for themselves . 
It is the essence of a free market , and it should also be the essence of a free democracy . 
People should know what their officials are doing , what their government &apos;s policies cost , who pays for them , and who benefits . 
Of course , such a government CIO couldn &apos;t make all that happen alone . 
But he or she could encourage it - everywhere information is used and everywhere it &apos;s hidden . 
The CIO wouldn &apos;t have policymaking authority per se , but he or she should sit high in the government - ideally with little bureaucratic encumbrance . 
The CIO would not have a fiefdom and would not compete for power or turf with other senior officials , but would simply remind the president or other people of the role of information every time it was appropriate . 
To the extent that more than persuasion is required , that would be up to the president &#91; head of government &#93; . 
Indeed , the CIO would illustrate the power of information &apos;s power by using it , rather than legal power , to persuade people to do the right thing . 
No governmental &quot; information agency &quot; is needed . 
The CIO would operate more like a &quot; virus , &quot; spreading everywhere , rather than being an additional appendage grafted onto the government . 
This virus would continuously nudge government agencies to become more effective and accessible , rather than merely more efficient . 
Ideally , it would affect employees and citizens by changing their expectations . 
It wasn &apos;t laws that created online banking ; it was changed expectations and consumer demand . 
( Yes , there were a few laws about liability , but they played only an enabling role . ) 
In short , the CIO would not press the government on &quot; tech policy , &quot; such as the rollout of broadband , but would set strategy about how to collect , manage , and disseminate information for public use and analysis . 
The CIO would consult agencies on their public relations - but public relations would be redefined , as in the non-government world , to mean listening as well as talking , and to mean admitting faults as a way to correct them . 
What the CIO should not do is almost as important . 
He or she should not attempt to centralize information , but rather to make it flow more smoothly . 
Call it information liquidity , akin to financial liquidity . 
What specific goals should the CIO pursue ? 
Openness and transparency do not mean simply making everything available online , but making information easy to get to , compare , and analyze . 
This includes everything from actual data to how those data are represented , facilitating comparisons of data across organizations and across time . 
The data also need to be easy to manipulate so that third parties - whether commercial data services or journalists - can create compelling and revealing visualizations . 
A government CIO also needs to remind us that as wonderful as the Internet is , it is most useful to people who can read and write . 
The digital divide isn &apos;t much of a divide anymore ; it &apos;s the literacy divide that is holding many people back . 
The CIO should not be the minister of education , but he or she can provide advice on the use of information technology for everything from curriculum content to the institutional changes that can be wrought by better teacher-parent-student communications concerning homework assignments , grades , and even school-bus schedules and lunch menus . 
Just as consumers can rate products , parents and students should be able to rate and provide feedback on the performance of individual teachers . 
The CIO also needs to take a serious look at information security - in conjunction with the CIOs of other countries ( since cybercrime knows no borders ) . 
A big factor that contributes to the existence of viruses , spam , and the like is their lucrativeness . 
Unlike the drug trade , legalization would not make much of the problem go away , but the issue is similar , because economics plays a much bigger role than is generally acknowledged . 
Two big changes are necessary . 
First , sending an e-mail will need to cost more than it does currently . 
Second , Internet service providers , which are in the best position to manage the security of individual users &quot; machines , need to get more involved - again with a system that understands the costs of poor security and charges those costs back to the people responsible . 
( Just as we require drivers to have insurance , maybe we should require users either to buy security services from their ISP or to post some kind of bond / insurance . ) 
There are many such examples ; all we need is better information to find them and take action , whether inside the government or in the private sector . 
A government can do three major things : make ( and enforce ) laws , spend ( or take ) money , and inspire people . 
Every country needs a CIO who can inspire its people with the power of information .
