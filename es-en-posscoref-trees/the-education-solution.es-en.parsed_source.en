The Education Solution 
WASHINGTON , DC - The world is assailed by problems that defy easy answers . 
Economic shocks are destabilizing countries and regions , and inflicting great social and financial hardships on families and their communities . 
Environmental damage threatens our food supplies , the air we breathe , and the rich biodiversity that sustains the balance of life . 
Wars and conflict produce millions of new refugees . 
Moreover , new health risks are emerging , with diabetes , obesity , and other non-communicable diseases now stalking low- and middle-income countries - even as many of those countries are still locked in combat with tuberculosis , HIV / AIDS , malaria , and other infectious diseases . 
Hundreds of millions of young people around the world are searching for jobs in a very uncertain labor market . 
The infrastructure we use to produce our energy , transport our goods , and transact our business is under stress . 
This list of worries is not meant to discourage , but to challenge . 
As the world &apos;s physical resources grow scarcer , we must increasingly rely on the best and most proven renewable resource available - human ingenuity . 
Just as they confronted problems in the past , our scientists and entrepreneurs have brought us solutions by way of the Green Revolution , new vaccines , communications technology , and cleaner energy . 
Scholars and leaders have given us the means to identify and resolve social and economic dilemmas . 
Rising levels of education have given people more control over their own health , household circumstances , governments , and culture . 
The global challenges that we face today are proof that we need a world of problem solvers . 
We need a world of people who are productive , resilient , creative , and versatile enough with technology and culture to find solutions to the many challenges we face . 
Education helps to build that world . 
Households with more education cope better with economic shocks and with extreme weather events . 
People with higher levels of education earn more , have more control over their fertility , and have healthier and better-educated children . 
Education gives people the skills to earn a living , to innovate , to invent , and to access culture - all of which allows them to live more fulfilling lives . 
The good news is that the global community has united to help all people acquire these skills - and with real results . 
In 1990 , a broad coalition of governments , the World Bank , United Nations agencies , and civil-society organizations committed to a strategy called &quot; Education for All . &quot; 
Twenty years later , there has been significant progress in enrolling children in school and expanding access to secondary school and universities . 
Globally , 88 % of children now complete primary school , and 67 % go on to enroll in secondary school . 
But low-income countries are still far from meeting the goal of ensuring that all children complete primary school : only 63 % of children in those countries achieve that milestone . 
Poor children , children with disabilities , girls , and ethnic minorities still face daunting barriers to education . 
Many countries struggle simply to build schools quickly enough to keep up with population growth . 
Severely overcrowded classrooms , lacking in trained teachers and basic supplies , are not uncommon . 
In the rush to expand services , school systems have sometimes neglected teachers &quot; professional development , student assessment , and even basic building standards . 
Over the years , we have learned that the real challenge is not just to enroll children in school , but to help them to acquire the skills necessary for employment , entrepreneurship , family life , and citizenship . 
The World Bank &apos;s new education strategy , &quot; Learning for All - Investing in People &apos;s Knowledge and Skills to Promote Development , &quot; highlights this imperative . 
It emphasizes the need to invest early , nurturing young children to ensure that they arrive at school healthy and ready to learn ; to invest smartly , transforming schools with good teachers , good materials , and good management ; and to invest for all , laying the foundation for just and equitable societies . 
The strategy rightly recognizes the importance of building systems that support the development of education on a large scale . 
Sufficient numbers of teachers , school buildings , and textbooks are all essential , but accelerating learning requires much more . 
We need well-designed systems of finance , student assessment , professional development and management , quality assurance , and monitoring and evaluation . 
We need more robust and transparent relationships between central and local governments , state and private education providers , and households and communities . 
And we need stronger links between schools and employers to ensure that graduates acquire skills that are relevant to a changing job market . 
We have much to learn from systems that have demonstrated continuous improvement , in contexts as varied as Singapore , Chile , Ghana , Slovenia , and England . 
While each of these countries had very different starting points , progress has been aided by the political will to measure outcomes and learn from results , define a sustainable path for change , and make smart , effective investments . 
To foster learning about how systems improve , the World Bank is embarking on a major initiative to assess the quality of education policies around the world . 
Its new databases will catalogue which policies countries have adopted to promote learning in each part of the education system , in areas ranging from teacher policies to student assessment to school financing mechanisms . 
Our goal is to facilitate the spread of good policy and practice , allowing countries to learn from a variety of approaches and to understand which ones might work in their own context . 
The case for improving education systems is urgent . 
Imagine our world , 20 years from now , if we could educate a new generation of young people so that they have the skills and creativity to take on the great economic and technological challenges of the day . 
Imagine , in particular , that all girls are educated , with all the profound benefits that this would yield in the areas of population growth , health and welfare , poverty alleviation , human rights , and politics . 
Now imagine the alternative and ask yourself : Which world do I want to live in ?
