Surviving Motherhood 
Mothers &quot; Day is upon us in many countries around the world . 
Children of all ages will give flowers , make breakfast , call home . 
This is as it should be . 
On my travels around the world , particularly to its poorest and most troubled places , I have learned that it is mothers who keep families together - indeed , who keep entire societies intact . 
Mothers are society &apos;s weavers . 
They make the world go round . 
Yet too often , the world is letting mothers down . 
Becoming a mother - the rite of passage that Mothers &quot; Day celebrates - can carry a terrible burden of fear , anxiety , and loss for many women and their families . 
Women such as Leonora Pocaterrazas , 21 , who died in childbirth not long ago in the mountain village of Columpapa Grande , Bolivia , leaving her husband to raise three other children on his own . 
Or Sarah Omega , just 20 , who spent 18 hours in labor at a hospital in Kenya . 
Her baby died , but she survived , despite terrible injuries , determined to speak out so that others would not have to endure the same ordeal . 
&quot; Life lost its meaning , &quot; she told American lawmakers in 2008 . 
Her testimony helped persuade Congress to commit more development aid to maternal health . 
These are just two of the very personal stories behind the shocking statistics reported by the United Nations &quot; Population Fund . 
The figures show the chasm that exists between rich and poor countries where motherhood is concerned . 
It is a divide that the UN is determined to bridge . 
In the rich world , when a mother dies giving birth , we assume that something went wrong . 
For women in the developing world , by contrast , dying in childbirth is simply a fact of life . 
In some countries , one woman in eight will die giving birth . 
Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19 worldwide . 
In poor countries , pregnant women often must fend for themselves ; they have no healthcare and nowhere to turn . 
They may struggle to find proper nutrition and work long hours in factories and fields until the day they go into labor . 
They give birth at home , perhaps with the help of a midwife who most likely has no medical training . 
I myself was born at home , in a small village in the Korean countryside . 
One of my childhood memories is asking my mother about a curious custom . 
Women who were about to give birth would gaze at their simple rubber shoes , which were kept by the back door . 
My mother explained that they were wondering if they would ever step into those shoes again . 
Giving birth was so risky that they feared for their lives . 
In the United States , just 100 years ago , women were roughly 100 times more likely to die in childbirth than they are today . 
We know how to save mothers &quot; lives . 
Simple blood tests , a doctor &apos;s consultation , and someone qualified to help with the birth can make a huge difference . 
Add some basic antibiotics , blood transfusions , and a safe operating room , and the risk of death can almost be eliminated . 
Recent figures show that we are making progress in helping women throughout the world . 
Yet we still have very far to go . 
Every year , hundreds of thousands of women die in childbirth , 99 % of them in developing countries . 
That is why , as Secretary-General , I have spoken out for the needs of mothers and pregnant women at every opportunity . 
Last month , the UN launched a joint action plan with governments , businesses , foundations , and civil-society organizations to advance this vital cause . 
I am counting on people around the world to back us in ending this silent scandal . 
No woman should have to pay with her life for giving life . 
On Mothers &quot; Day , let us honor mothers around the world by pledging to do everything we can to make motherhood safer for all .
