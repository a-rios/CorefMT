Europe &apos;s Winners and Losers 
BERLIN - Rarely is a high-flying country brought back down to earth in a single night , but that is precisely what happened to Germany recently . 
In both football ( soccer ) and politics , the country had come to embody an unseemly mixture of arrogance and denial . 
It thought itself the measure of all things European , in terms of both the European championship and the European Union . 
In both cases , it was deceiving itself . 
The same night that Germany was thrashed by the Italians in the championship &apos;s semi-finals , German Chancellor Angela Merkel ran up against the limits of her own powers at the eurozone leaders &quot; summit in Brussels . 
Germany &apos;s political course since the beginning of the euro crisis two years ago had left it isolated , and she was no match for an alliance of Italy , Spain , and France . 
Indeed , she had no choice but to concede and agree to far-reaching changes to the EU &apos;s new fiscal compact that will ease refinancing of the crisis countries and their banks . 
The German dogma of &quot; no payments without counter-performance and control &quot; was thus off the table , and the bargain struck in the early hours of the morning was exactly the opposite of what she had wanted . 
The fiscal compact had been reduced to a shambles even before Germany &apos;s parliament , the Bundestag , approved it later that day . 
In terms of addressing the eurozone financial crisis , however , the agreement reached in Brussels was anything but a breakthrough , because it never transcended the logic of narrow crisis management . 
It offers no strategy for overcoming the crisis in the south of Europe , which means that the threat to the eurozone has not been removed . 
Politically , however , the agreement amounts to a small revolution , because it has shifted the balance of power within the eurozone : Germany is strong , but not strong enough to get away with isolating itself completely from Europe &apos;s other major players . 
Decisions that go against Germany are possible . 
The full extent of the political damage that Germany &apos;s bailout policy for the eurozone , with its austerity , mass unemployment , and economic depression , has caused in southern Europe remains to be seen . 
If Merkel had wanted the agreement reached in Brussels , the outcome would have marked the beginning of a fundamental revision of the eurozone &apos;s crisis policy - and thus an expression of successful statesmanship . 
Instead , it is a full-blown defeat for Germany , linked to its firm denial that German policy has sharply reduced the country &apos;s influence in the EU . 
Yet it clearly has : German influence within the European Central Bank has declined significantly ; the German finance minister will not become head of the Eurogroup ; and now we have the Brussels disaster ! 
But Germany &apos;s defeat , however widely celebrated , holds much cause for concern . 
First , not everything that Germany is arguing is wrong : the urgent need for medium-term fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to increase the crisis countries &quot; competitiveness will not go away . 
Equally important , however , is the reduction of economic imbalances and European policy coordination to enable growth . 
Second , political paranoia is rising on the German right : everybody supposedly just wants Germany &apos;s money ; our Anglo-Saxon partners &apos; real aim is to weaken us ; and the financial markets will not rest until Germany has invested all of its wealth and has thus endangered its economic success . 
Germany is being &quot; betrayed to foreigners &quot; by the opposition , and &quot; good &quot; productive capital is once again being opposed to &quot; bad &quot; speculative capital . 
In the opinion pages of some German newspapers , anti-capitalism is returning in a new form , which entails nothing less than a renunciation of Europe and even of the West . 
Of course , while the German right threatens to become more nationalistic , history will not repeat itself , because today &apos;s Germany has changed , and so has its political environment . 
Still , an increasingly Euro-skeptic Germany in the heart of the EU could , given its great economic clout , seriously endanger the European integration process . 
And , while that would jeopardize Germany &apos;s own interests , practical political action is not always rational , particularly in times of serious crisis . 
The same , incidentally , applies to France , except that the French , unlike the Germans , find it difficult to transfer political sovereignty , whereas for us Germans , it is all about the money . 
Both of these mental / political blocks are threatening the European project in equal measure . 
Indeed , if the result of the recent summit means that France and Germany will henceforth each forge alliances against the other , while hiding behind verbal expressions of solidarity , we might just as well forget about Europe . 
Both sides will have to decide whether or not they want Europe - that is , full economic and political integration . 
Economically , they must choose either joint liability and a transfer union or monetary re-nationalization . 
Politically , the choice is whether to empower a common government and parliament or return to full sovereignty . 
What we know for certain is that , just as one cannot be a little pregnant , the existing hybrid is not sustainable . 
Last November , Volker Kauder , the majority leader in the Bundestag , bragged that &quot; suddenly Europe is speaking German . &quot; 
He was wrong . 
Just as Spain ( not Germany ) remains the benchmark in European football , so Europe speaks broken English at best . 
From the standpoint of safeguarding the European project , that is all for the better .
