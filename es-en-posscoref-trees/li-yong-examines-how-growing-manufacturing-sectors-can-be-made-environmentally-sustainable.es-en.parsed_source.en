Greening the New Industrial Revolution 
VIENNA - Manufacturing industries present society with a dilemma . 
But , as factories try to meet ever-growing consumer demand , they deplete the world &apos;s natural resources and pollute the environment . 
For some , the world now faces a stark choice between rising prosperity and a cleaner , more sustainable environment . 
In fact , with new technology and fresh thinking , policymakers can strike a durable balance between these competing interests . 
In developed countries , consumers are increasingly recognizing that , while their material well-being may be higher than ever , their quality of life suffers if the environment is damaged . 
For poorer countries , such concerns are dismissed as a rich-world luxury . 
No government , rich or poor , can ignore the imperative to encourage economic growth . 
The manufacturing sector creates jobs , makes affordable products for cash-strapped consumers , produces vital tax revenue that can be used to support social goals , and brings in foreign currency in the form of export revenue . 
In short , a well-run manufacturing sector spreads wealth across society . 
However , trying to satisfy the seemingly endless material demands of consumers at all levels of the economic pyramid has placed an unmanageable burden on the natural world . 
Resources are being consumed more quickly than the planet can replace them . 
The manufacturing sector is particularly voracious , devouring over half of all raw materials , around 30 % of the world &apos;s energy , and 20 % of its water . 
In the process , it produces too much waste for our fragile ecosystems to absorb . 
Now , public opinion is starting to turn against what is increasingly perceived as plunder on a global scale . 
Policymakers may not be able to compel citizens to ration their consumption . 
Technological innovation and recyclable inputs can make a huge difference to the way the world produces and consumes . 
Like the dramatic changes once wrought by mass production , there is similar potential in the development and application of 3D printing , biotechnology , nanotechnology , and other resource-efficient technologies . 
And management thinkers from the late C. K. Prahalad to Jaideep Prabhu have shown how industry can be reconfigured to produce high-quality products cheaply and cleanly . 
Indeed , these technologies and management ideas amount to something of a new industrial revolution - though one that will be very different from the Industrial Revolution that made Great Britain the dominant world power in the nineteenth century and helped it build a global empire . 
The current transformation will be more democratic , spreading through global supply chains and modern communications to all countries that are integrated into the global economy . 
And it will be characterized by partnerships between government , the private sector , and civil society . 
Our challenge , and our historic opportunity , is to recognize this potential and find ways for diverse groups to collaborate and realize it . 
A Green Industry Conference held recently in Guangzhou , China - following similar events in Manila in 2009 and Tokyo in 2011 - provides a template for this kind of broad cooperation . 
Delegates shared best practices , discussed ways to accelerate change in a range of sectors , and sought innovative solutions to old management problems . 
No one need be left out of this revolution . 
Even countries with abundant natural resources do not have to fear the shift to a greener world . 
By adopting new economic models , their large but finite reserves will not be rendered useless ; they will simply last longer . 
At the same time , countries facing shortages will gain greatly from being able to reduce their own resource needs . 
Businesses , too , have been quick to adopt new practices . 
Many now routinely monitor and report on their environmental impact . 
Some are even starting to organize around new industrial concepts such as the &quot; circular economy , &quot; which focuses on reducing waste through multiple rounds of recycling . 
This revolution may have been borne out of necessity ; but , with ingenuity and cooperation , it will prove to be profitable , over the long run , for countries , manufacturers , and consumers worldwide .
