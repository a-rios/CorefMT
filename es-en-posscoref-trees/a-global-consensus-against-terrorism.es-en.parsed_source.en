A Global Consensus Against Terrorism 
Mention the United Nations and the first reaction is likely to be the ongoing oil-for-food scandal and what it will mean for Secretary-General Kofi Annan &apos;s ability to lead the organization for the remaining year and a half of his tenure . 
But there is much more going on at the UN than investigations . 
Reform is in the air - in part because of the scandal , but also because of the UN &apos;s inability to deal effectively with challenges ranging from Rwanda and Kosovo to Iraq and , most recently , Sudan . 
Even the UN &apos;s most ardent supporters now recognize that change is called for if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security . 
Some of the reform talk concerns the UN Security Council &apos;s composition . 
The Security Council represents what the World War II Allies believed the post-war world would look like and how it should be run . 
This helps to explain why a much-weakened France was made a permanent member of the Council - and why Germany and Japan ( and a not-yet independent India ) were not . 
Defending the Security Council &apos;s current make-up is impossible ; the need for change is beyond debate . 
But coming up with an approach that gains broad international support will prove extremely difficult . 
Great Britain and France will resist being replaced by a single EU seat , while making Germany a permanent member would only exacerbate the problem of Europe &apos;s relative over-representation . 
Pakistan would object to adding India to the Security Council ; 
Argentina , Chile , and Mexico to adding Brazil ; 
Nigeria to South Africa ( and vice-versa ) ; and several countries , including China , Indonesia , and South Korea , might resist creating a permanent seat for Japan . 
Clearly , fixing the Security Council will require considerable time and political effort . 
In the meantime , there is important work to be done . 
One productive avenue would be to follow up on one of the recommendations of the High Level Panel that was endorsed by Annan ; namely , that all UN members go on record declaring that terrorism has no place in today &apos;s world . 
This will prove more difficult than it first sounds . 
For too long , the international community has tolerated terrorism - the intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants by non-state actors for political purposes - on the grounds that , on occasion , &quot; one man &apos;s terrorist is another man &apos;s freedom fighter . &quot; 
Historians have the luxury of debating whether terrorism may have been justified in certain situations in the past . 
We do not . 
Modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated , much less supported . 
Weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons - are just that , and no cause can excuse their use . 
Moreover , as the terrorist attacks on America of 2001 showed , weapons as basic as box-cutters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulnerabilities of modern , global life . 
Terrorism is even less justified given that political avenues exist nowadays for pursuing political aims . 
Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and can count on American , Russian , European , and UN assistance . 
Iraqis have elected their own representatives and are poised to write their constitution . 
No one pursuing reasonable goals and who is prepared to compromise can argue that terrorism is his or his group &apos;s only option . 
The world has already taken some important steps against terrorism . 
A dozen international conventions and numerous UN resolutions commit governments to oppose hostage taking , the hijacking of civilian aircraft , and terrorism more broadly . 
Similarly , the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force , created in 1989 to curb money laundering , has grown and become focused mainly on curbing terrorist financing . 
UN Security Council Resolution 1373 , passed after the September 11 attacks , calls on states to deny safe haven to terrorists , bring to justice anyone associated with terrorism , suppress recruitment by terrorist groups , block terrorists &quot; efforts to acquire weapons , and cooperate with other governments and international organizations in tracking suspects and boosting security . 
What is missing is a new , 13th convention that closes the loophole that seems to permit governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not . 
Broad agreement is needed that any intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants is unacceptable , and that its perpetrators and supporters must be punished . 
Of course , such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism . 
Terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been . 
Doing so will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism ; it should also make it less difficult to garner support for international action against those who nevertheless carry it out . 
We are taught early on in our lives that the end cannot justify the means . 
It is time to put this principle into effect before many more innocent lives are lost .
