Spying on Eros 
A Sydney-based Muslim cleric , Sheik Hilaly , recently made headlines in Australia when he publicly reflected that immodest women invite rape because they are like &quot; uncovered meat . &quot; 
More unfortunate still was his implication that this was the cause of a series of gang rapes in Sydney in 2000 , in which the attackers &quot; legal defense was that they thought the women were sexually available because they wore Western clothes . 
Although local Muslim leaders have since criticized Hilaly &apos;s attitude , the incident again raises the question of attitudes regarding sex in &quot; orthodox &quot; communities , and how they can be reconciled with prevailing norms in the West . 
Meanwhile , in the United States , the controversy over government spying on its citizens seems to have died down , mostly because people are now convinced that their government will only look at the really bad guys . 
What do these two issues have in common ? 
Gathering sophisticated intelligence is largely a matter of understanding trends . 
It is less important , for instance , to steal a copy of North Korea &apos;s bomb designs than to know the morale and capability of its scientists . 
It is important to know how much deprivation in a country would swing public opinion . 
Like most social science , measurement of these dynamics is conducted indirectly . 
Intelligence analysts operate like scientists , in the sense that they develop theories , then measure and test them . 
Like scientists , they prefer to work with huge amounts of data , which is why the US government wants a record of every call and financial transaction made by every inhabitant of the country . 
Tracking the movement of individuals by the locator in their cell phones is possible , and it is surely under consideration . 
That is because intelligence agents look for indicators , correlations , and causes . 
Causes are the hardest to understand . 
For example , the civil services in Iraq have recently crossed a threshold beyond which they are now probably impossible to administer . 
A significant reason is believed to be the steady flight of intellectuals from Iraq , which seems obvious , but is difficult to measure . 
Indicators and correlations are easier to demonstrate . 
If a lot of people are leaving their seats during a sporting event , you might consider it an indication that the event is not exciting . 
During the Cold War , Western intelligence agencies developed an immense catalogue of indicators and correlations . 
If train traffic on certain routes increased , it suggested that army food supplies were being delivered , thus hinting at impending military action . 
Likewise , shipments of toilet paper are amazingly accurate indicators of military activity . 
Once the Soviets realized this , they began to send bogus shipments around the country on random schedules , creating shortages for the baffled civilian population . 
As it turns out , another extremely useful view into a society is the type of pornography it consumes , together with how that pornography is manufactured and delivered . 
Yes , it is true . 
Spies are interested in prurient behavior everywhere . 
One reason is that pornography in orthodox societies is illicit , so the distribution channels opened by sexual materials are usually used for other goods as well . 
In the Muslim world , there is a significant , important flow of pornography . 
According to one story , possibly apocryphal , in the 1970 &quot; s , the Islamic insurgency in Iran was initially planned using material delivered through porn-related channels because the mosques were so tightly controlled . 
But there are other trends indicated by pornographic content that are useful to spies . 
Movies produced for the sexual gratification of consumers reveal cultural norms of restriction , transgression , and otherness . 
In fact , porn is so specifically tuned to the tastes of consumers that shifts can indicate changes in a society almost immediately . 
Interestingly , many purveyors of pornography initially thought that better quality video would make their product more desirable . 
However , it seems that high production values were actually less popular . 
So a &quot; casual &quot; production style was adopted , similar to the design of worn and ripped jeans . 
Part of the raw appeal of pornography , it seems , is that the product itself be raw , and conspicuously illicit . 
But local tastes nonetheless vary widely . 
Japanese porn features schoolgirls , often bound . 
Egyptian porn before Nasser featured local beauties and voyeurism , but now focuses on fair-haired and pale-skinned women , sometimes with forced sex as a theme . 
Egyptian-born Sheik Hilaly , in Sydney , may have been verbalizing a latent sense of otherness and mistaking it for insight . 
This means that tinkering with the content of porn could be in the national interest , under certain circumstances . 
Anyone privy to details of such activities cannot comment on them , but one story circulating in the research community involved attempts to introduce condoms into African porn as part of an anti-AIDS effort . 
Then , of course , there is the biggest market of all : the US , where it is estimated that annual revenue for pornography in 2004 exceeded the combined revenue of the ABC , CBS , and NBC television networks by many billions of dollars . 
We should not be surprised if someone eventually tries to tweak the content of pornography to exploit Americans &quot; cultural proclivities on behalf of other products , causes , or even political candidates .
