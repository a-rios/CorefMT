Syria &apos;s No-Solution Solution 
BERLIN - The Russian-American plan to eliminate Syria &apos;s chemical weapons - now embodied in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 - may open a more constructive approach to ending the country &apos;s civil war , because the Security Council is also demanding that the long-planned Geneva II conference on Syria convene as soon as possible . 
Rightly so : elimination of Syria &apos;s chemical-weapons stockpiles and a political process to end the war must occur simultaneously . 
As a practical matter , efforts to verify , secure , and eventually destroy Syria &apos;s huge supply of chemical weapons cannot be implemented without at least a lasting ceasefire . 
But synchronizing the two processes is necessary for other reasons , too . 
Aside from the human suffering caused by Syria &apos;s ongoing war , we should be aware of the potentially dire regional consequences . 
Some people now warn of a &quot; Lebanonization &quot; of Syria - partition of the country into rival fiefdoms and quasi-independent regions . 
But Syria &apos;s fragmentation is not the only plausible scenario . 
Indeed , the Lebanon metaphor is too benign . 
Unlike Lebanon during its 15-year civil war , no regional power today would be able to contain Syria &apos;s war within its borders . 
As a result , it is much more likely that Syria &apos;s disintegration would call the entire post-World War I ( or post-Ottoman ) Middle Eastern state system - also called the &quot; Sykes-Picot &quot; system - into question . 
Such region-wide instability is not just a theoretical scenario ; it follows from developments on the ground . 
Lebanon &apos;s established political contours already are beginning to blur under the relentless pressure of the Syrian conflict . 
A zone of de facto control by Lebanon &apos;s Hezbollah and Syrian regime forces has emerged between Baalbek and Homs , straddling the Lebanese-Syrian border . 
Likewise , the fighting has created highly fluid conditions in the Kurdish-majority areas of Iraq and Syria . 
Since the fall of Saddam Hussein , the Kurdistan Regional Government ( KRG ) in northern Iraq has effectively established de facto autonomy vis-Ã -vis the central government in Baghdad . 
Regional and domestic developments could push the Kurdish authorities in Erbil , their capital , toward declaring formal independence . 
With its oil income and good neighborly relations with Turkey , such a state would be viable . 
Indeed , the KRG government has long made clear that it respects Turkish sovereignty and will not interfere with relations between Turkey &apos;s government and its own Kurdish population . 
And , if only for its own security , the KRG is attempting to extend its power , formally or informally , into northern Syria . 
Regional acceptance of a Kurdish state-building project that transcends today &apos;s KRG-controlled borders would depend , among other things , on the scale of the Kurds &quot; national ambitions . 
From Turkey &apos;s perspective , a confederation of Syria &apos;s northeastern region with the KRG might be favorable to continuing domestic Kurdish unrest , much less rule by the anti-Turkish Kurdish Workers Party ( PKK ) along its border with Syria . 
In contrast , any attempt by the KRG to establish a Kurdish corridor to the Mediterranean would certainly meet resistance , not only from Turkey , but also from other warring factions in Syria . 
What , however , would Kurdish independence mean for the rest of Iraq ? 
This is not only a question of territory , borders , and oil , but also one that concerns the domestic balance of power . 
With a Kurdish exit removing the third constituent element - besides Shia and Sunni Arabs - of Iraqi politics , the country &apos;s sectarian polarization would most likely deepen . 
Moreover , Kurdish independence could encourage demands for autonomy in the Sunni-majority provinces bordering Syria , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia - a third region where Syria &apos;s civil war is blurring international borders . 
Social , tribal , and economic ties between the provinces of Deir al-Zour in Syria and Anbar in Iraq are strong and have strengthened further as control by the Syrian and Iraqi governments has loosened . 
It is astonishing how many regional observers seem to expect , hope , or fear that such developments will somehow lead , almost automatically , to a &quot; new Sykes-Picot &quot; - that is , to the establishment of a new regional order in the Middle East created by today &apos;s great powers . 
( A Google search for &quot; new Sykes Picot &quot; in Arabic brings 52,600 hits . ) 
Such expectations are patently unrealistic . 
Europeans and Americans have learned - and China , Russia , and others have learned from Western experience - that external powers cannot successfully engineer political arrangements or regional order in the Middle East . 
Rather than pondering or devising new borders , regional and external powers need to focus their efforts on holding Syria together . 
The planned Geneva II conference is a necessary first step . 
To be sure , there are many reasons to be pessimistic about the willingness of Syria &apos;s warring parties to engage in serious negotiations . 
Indeed , no one - not Russia , the US , Iran , Saudi Arabia , or other external patrons of either the regime or the opposition - can guarantee that Geneva II will succeed . 
But all of them could improve conditions for negotiations by sending the same message to their respective Syrian clients , namely that they henceforth exclude a military victory by one side over the other . 
Thus , Russia and Iran will have to tell Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that they will not support his effort to seek a military victory . 
Saudi Arabia , the US , Turkey , and others will have to tell the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces that it will not win on the battlefield ; the Salafists must hear this message from Saudi Arabia , too . 
And Turkey and Qatar , for their part , will have to pass the same message to the Muslim Brotherhood . 
The message to all of these groups should be consistent : We will continue to support you politically , financially , and in negotiations with the Syrian regime , but we will no longer support a military solution . 
This would be a strong incentive to go to Geneva .
