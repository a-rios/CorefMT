Getting Serious About Global Poverty 
Institutions and governments , like people , make bold resolutions at the beginning of every year . 
But , for the millions who face the crushing burden of poverty , mere proclamations that help is on the way are not enough to create jobs or foster development . 
This year , the international community must move decisively from pledges to action in the effort to reduce poverty . 
What will this require ? 
In 2005 , the international community renewed its commitments to help the poorest countries meet the United Nations &quot; Millennium Development Goals ( MDG &apos;s ) , which aim to halve poverty by 2015 . 
These commitments include significant increases in debt relief and aid . 
While there has been progress on implementing debt-relief measures , the international community must follow through on the other part of its pledge , by delivering increased aid and promoting its better use . 
Multilateral lenders have long understood the importance of debt relief to poverty reduction . 
Indeed , the joint IMF-World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) Initiative was launched in 1996 to coordinate efforts by multilateral organizations and governments to reduce poor countries &quot; debt burdens to sustainable levels . 
So far , the results are encouraging . 
Before the HIPC Initiative , eligible countries spent , on average , slightly more on debt service than on health and education combined . 
Now , debt in the 28 countries for which relief has been approved has declined by an average of two-thirds , while their expenditures on health , education , and other social services have risen to almost four times the amount of debt-service payments . 
In 2005 , the international community went further , agreeing on the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative ( MDRI ) , which will write off 100 % of many poor countries &quot; debts to the IMF , the World Bank , and the African Development Bank . 
As a result , just this past December , the IMF approved immediate , full relief for 19 countries - including 13 in Africa , four in Latin America , and two in Asia - on all outstanding debt to the Fund disbursed before January 1 , 2005 . 
Other countries are eligible , and the IMF is helping these states make rapid progress to qualify , with total debt relief expected to be more than $ 5 billion . 
As with the HIPC Initiative of which it is a part , the MDRI will do more than reduce debt : it will free up resources that can be devoted to poverty reduction and economic development . 
In 2006 , for example , Zambia will see its debt fall by almost 10 % of GDP , leaving more resources available for development . 
Similarly , Guyana will have its debt reduced by more than 8 % of GDP . 
The level of debt relief will be even greater once the World Bank and the African Development Bank finalize their own programs in the months ahead . 
Nevertheless , the debt relief now being implemented will only provide a small part of the assistance , both financial and technical , that low-income countries need to meet the MDG &apos;s . 
If they are to be met , donors must also deliver on their commitments for significant increases in aid . 
The IMF has long called on donors to meet the internationally accepted target for overseas development assistance of 0.7 % of GDP . 
Some donors have now promised to do so , though only over time ; others are not ready to go that far , but have promised more aid than they currently give . 
The international community must show that it will follow through on these promises . 
Donors must provide the help that developing countries urgently need . 
At the same time , we must ensure that low-income countries use debt relief and aid efficiently . 
One priority is to ensure that large , new infusions of aid do not produce unintended economic outcomes , such as rapid currency appreciation or inflation , which would make recipient countries &quot; exports less competitive . 
Another priority is to ensure that low-income countries that are striving to meet the MDG &apos;s , and which have large financing requirements , avoid a new spiral of indebtedness . 
The gains from MDRI debt relief will amount to precious little if low-income countries emerge from their debt burdens only to start the cycle anew by amassing fresh debt . 
But recipient countries must complement donor efforts , and continue to do their part as well , by maintaining a track record of reform and sound macroeconomic policies , and by making the best possible use of the higher levels of assistance . 
Outside efforts can help reduce poverty , but it is , ultimately , the efforts of low-income countries themselves to sustain strong economic performance , improve governance , and develop stable and effective institutions that will have the most important impact on reducing poverty . 
Low-income countries can also improve their prospects by strengthening their fiscal management , fostering private-sector development , and liberalizing trade . 
If we keep our promises , 2006 can be a year of hope for those who have little else than the dream of a better life .
