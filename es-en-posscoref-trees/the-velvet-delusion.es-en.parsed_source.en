The Velvet Delusion 
COLLEGE STATION , TEXAS - With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the relatively non-violent overthrow of communism throughout Central and Eastern Europe , optimists predicted a new golden age of a world filled with peaceful democracies . 
History , for some , seemed to have come to an end . 
But the optimists have proved to be misguided , as the world &apos;s powers , great and small , drew their own , often conflicting , lessons from the past . 
For Americans , 1989 validated everything they already believed . 
They had won the Cold War , or so they perceived , through hard force and conviction . 
They saw demonstrators in East European capitals and Chinese crowds in Tiananmen Square chanting for freedom , and believed that those throngs wanted to be American . 
As George H.W. Bush declared , &quot; We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth : through free markets , free speech , free elections , and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state . &quot; 
Subsequent events seemed to validate this American recipe . 
The Gulf War confirmed American military might and the age-old perils of appeasement . 
The Clinton era gave us active democracy-promotion as the principle tool of American foreign policy , which George W. Bush &apos;s administration took to unprecedented extremes . 
Cold War victory provided the answer for each . &quot; America &apos;s resolve and American ideals so clearly articulated by Ronald Reagan , &quot; Clinton said , &quot; helped to bring the Wall down . &quot; 
The lesson was clear : &quot; we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom . &quot; 
Barack Obama &apos;s words echo those of Clinton . 
Despite his frequent avowals of change , his central articulation of American policy seems remarkably static . 
This is why Obama &apos;s America spends more on weaponry than the rest of the world combined , and why democracy-promotion remains the unquestioned foundation of American foreign policy , with debate possible only about its application . 
History offers a recipe for success , so long as Americans adhere to the lesson of 1989 . 
But the rest of the world learned different lessons . 
European strategists largely dismissed America &apos;s interpretation that force had won the Cold War , believing that cooperation had triumphed precisely because force was absent . 
They heard in pleas for freedom from behind the Iron Curtain not a desire to become American , but to join the remarkably successful European experiment in collective security and prosperity that emerged after World War II . 
For today &apos;s European leaders , the central lesson of 1989 is that force is counterproductive ; what matters is consensus . 
Russian leaders , not surprisingly , also drew their own conclusions . 
When Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of a &quot; Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals , &quot; his conception was not of a continent under Soviet domination , as Josef Stalin once threatened . 
Having demonstrated remarkable restraint in 1989 , Russian leaders expected to be embraced by the West . 
Instead , NATO expanded to Russia &apos;s doorstep , the European Union barred its doors , and membership in the World Trade Organization seemed out of reach . 
The post-Soviet economy crumbled , crime skyrocketed , and life expectancy declined . 
Russia &apos;s voice in global affairs lost authority . 
For Russian leaders , 1989 &quot; s lesson was clear : trusting the West was foolish at best , dangerous at worst . 
Gorbachev &apos;s vision of European inclusion neglected centuries of Russian history ; the West did not want Russian participation . 
Better that Russians rely on their own power , develop their own resources , and police their own borders . 
The Kremlin trusted the West in 1989 . Subsequent Russian leaders refuse to be duped again . 
Chinese leaders embraced 1989 &quot; s most puzzling legacy . 
They recoiled at the Soviet bloc &apos;s disintegration . 
China took from 1989 the lesson that state stability was paramount . 
Yet China &apos;s leaders also recognized that they ignored popular demands at great peril . 
The government thus made an implicit deal with its citizens : political dissent would not be tolerated , but , in exchange , the state would guarantee economic growth . 
No one could question the government &apos;s legitimacy so long as prosperity expanded . 
Chinese foreign policy also prioritized legitimacy after 1989 , with the regime hoping to reassert its authority globally by expanding China &apos;s participation in international organizations . 
Chinese leaders embraced the cooperative nature of the post-1945 European process , but simultaneously took the Russian lesson to heart : the West would not yield merely to good intentions . 
But , unlike Russia , China de-emphasized the relevance of traditional hard power to achieve its goals . 
In fact , Chinese leaders have spent remarkably little , relative to China &apos;s growing GDP , on the military . 
Chinese power today comes not from its ability to match America &apos;s blue-water navy , but from its holdings in US Treasury bonds . 
The legacy of 1989 echoes even in Iran , whose leaders seem clearly to have learned from Tiananmen Square and the collapse of the Iron Curtain that a committed government can , indeed , demobilize a public demanding reform . 
The world would not soon forget the horrors of Tiananmen , global protestors promised in 1989 . 
But it did - and with extraordinary speed . 
In looking back at 1989 , we are , in effect , looking forward from that year &apos;s momentous events at the very different legacies that they produced .
