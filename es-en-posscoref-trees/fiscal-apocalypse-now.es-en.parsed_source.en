Fiscal Apocalypse Now 
As support for President George W. Bush in the United States has crumbled over the past year , perhaps the most surprising element is the revolt of economists and observers of economic policy . 
Last week , Peggy Noonan , a speechwriter for both President Reagan and the first President Bush declared in the Wall Street Journal that had she known what George W. Bush &apos;s fiscal policy would be , she would have voted for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election . 
&quot; If I &apos;d thought &#91; that George W. Bush &#93; was a big-spending Rockefeller Republican .... 
Bush &quot; did present himself as a conservative ... &#91; and &#93; conservatism is hostile , for reasons ranging from the abstract and philosophical to the concrete and practical , to high spending and high taxing .... &quot; 
And then she falls into near-complete despair : &quot; Mr. Bush will never have to run again , and he is in a position to come forward and make the case , even if only rhetorically , to slow and cut spending . 
And there &apos;s no sign he will ... &quot; 
Noonan is not quite correct . 
George W. Bush presented himself not as a normal conservative , but as something he called a &quot; compassionate conservative , &quot; thus preserving a certain amount of ambiguity . 
Some focused on the &quot; conservative &quot; : they expected the Bush administration &apos;s fiscal policy to keep a tight rein on spending and to eliminate many programs in order to finance significant tax cuts . 
Others focused on the &quot; compassionate &quot; : they expected Bush &apos;s fiscal policy largely to eschew tax cuts and to adopt largely Democratic spending priorities , including expanded federal aid to education and a prescription drug benefit , thereby showing that Republicans could run a more cost-effective version of the social-welfare state . 
Still others interpreted &quot; compassionate conservatism , &quot; as the commentator Andrew Sullivan put it , as a &quot; smokescreen ... necessary for any vaguely successful retrenchment of government power in an insatiable entitlement state . &quot; 
They expected tax cuts to be followed by a fangs-bared attack on social-welfare spending once deficits reemerged . 
As a result , in 2000 and 2001 nobody was really sure of the Bush administration &apos;s policy direction . 
Was it traditional fiscal conservativism ? 
Was it to do what Democrats do , but do it better ? 
Was it to &quot; starve the beast &quot; by pumping up government debt to the point that social programs would have to be cut ? 
The first two priorities , if well designed and well implemented , are certainly honorable goals for a government to pursue . 
The third is less honorable , and likely to fail : it relies on the dangerously weak premise that the party in power &apos;s political adversaries will be more public-spirited and less ruthless when they return to government . 
Of course , conservatives and Republicans could hope that their own favorite policy priorities would emerge as the administration &apos;s preferred strategy . 
But then a strange thing happened : the Bush administration did not order any of the three options that were thought to be on the menu . 
It chose something different entirely : big tax cuts , yes , but tax cuts that were badly designed from a genuine supply-side perspective aimed at boosting growth , as well as Democratic domestic spending priorities , but very badly implemented . 
Moreover , the Bush administration combined its policies with an extraordinary reluctance to veto anything coming out of Congress , and , after the year or two that it took for this to become obvious , an inability to restrain Congress at all . 
What emerged was neither traditional fiscal conservatism nor Democratic policies without Democrats nor starve-the-beast populism , but something that has no name . 
An exchange between two characters in a scene from the movie &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; captures an anti-ethic that characterizes the Bush administration &apos;s policies as well : 
Willard : &quot; They told me that you had gone totally insane , and that your methods were unsound . &quot; 
Kurtz : &quot; Are my methods unsound ? &quot; 
Willard : &quot; I don &apos;t see any method at all , sir . &quot; 
It is not that Republicans and conservatives think that the Bush administration has adopted the wrong method , but that they don &apos;t see any method at all that has driven them into their ( late ) fiscal-policy revolt .
