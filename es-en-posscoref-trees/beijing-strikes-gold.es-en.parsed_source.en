Beijing Strikes Gold 
MADISON , WISCONSIN - On the eve of the Beijing Olympic Games , many human rights activists and observers continue to hope that the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s embrace of odious regimes such as Burma &apos;s and Sudan &apos;s , and its oppression of Tibetan Buddhists , Uighur Muslims , and Falun gong spiritualists , will lead democratic heads of state to boycott the Olympics , or athletes and spectators to demonstrate on behalf of the victims . 
I doubt it . 
The only demonstrations are likely to be those celebrating China &apos;s massive gold medal count . 
No one should underestimate China &apos;s will and capacities , especially when it sets its collective mind on a goal . 
China is a budding superpower that has amassed the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world . 
No major government will risk retaliation by insulting the Chinese regime with a boycott or public protest . 
Indeed , France has already dispatched representatives to Beijing to apologize for supporting the Dalai Lama , and for the protests that took place during the Olympic torch relay in Paris . 
From Seoul to Sydney to San Francisco , citizens in democracies were angered at how Chinese visitors bullied into silence powerless Tibetans demanding minimal rights on behalf of their brethren in authoritarian China . 
In the wake of the Sichuan earthquake , criticism of China will be even more muted . 
In 1997 , Denmark , a nation whose people are demonstrably committed to human rights , asked the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva to look into the CCP &apos;s long track record of abuse . 
China responded by canceling a Danish trade mission . 
France got the message , and the French soon stopped promoting human rights resolutions directed at China . 
The French were then rewarded with a string of lucrative contracts in China . 
The United States , however , persisted , and China prevailed upon its allies allies to vote the US off the UN Human Rights Commission . 
Although China is the world leader in capital punishment and imprisoned activists , its human rights record is no longer a matter for significant international scrutiny . 
Although China touts its aid and investment in Africa as being given without strings , governments that accept it repay China in natural resources and political capital . 
They eschew official relations with Taiwan . 
They vote to protect China from human rights investigations . 
They agree not to stand up for the Dalai Lama , Tibetan Buddhism , or Tibetan victims in China . 
Many African nations ship a large percentage of their GDP to China every year . 
Europeans see Chinese money in Africa as undermining international efforts to promote good governance , and they worry that Chinese funds are used to shore up corrupt authoritarian regimes . 
Certainly , China has plenty of cash , states its demands clearly , and asks few questions , and the combination of such policies and economic clout has won it followers . 
But a few bold voices have made themselves heard . 
South Africa &apos;s Nobel laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu has spoken out forthrightly on behalf of Tibetan rights , and South African 
South Korea &apos;s government expressed its distaste for how Chinese visitors assaulted peaceful human rights demonstrators as the Olympic torch passed through that country . 
Of course , in response to the global outcry , China has yielded a bit on Tibet , with Chinese officials meeting with representatives of the Dalai Lama . 
The government has reinforced its security system , and have put in place a ubiquitous system of surveillance cameras . 
Visas are being denied to anyone active on behalf of human rights , with the unintended side effect of hurting international business in China . 
But China &apos;s priority is not just to perpetuate economic growth . 
The regime is set on proving to the world that China , once again a world power , can stage a spectacular performance , and that its voice will be heeded . 
The message of the Beijing Olympics , then , is that China &apos;s political system not only manages international affairs adroitly , but that the &quot; Chinese way &quot; should be seen as superior even to democratic systems . 
The CCP &apos;s relentless efforts will no doubt lead to continued economic growth , ensure political stability , and generate significant worldwide support . 
But the regime has missed one key point in its relentless march to a &quot; successful &quot; Olympics . 
It is actually in China &apos;s interest to make a deal with the Dalai Lama and begin to heal the rift between Han Chinese and Tibetans . 
This would not only help defuse the disaffection in Tibet , but would lend real luster to China &apos;s world leadership , and indicate the kind of mature decision-making that marks a true &quot; great power . &quot;
