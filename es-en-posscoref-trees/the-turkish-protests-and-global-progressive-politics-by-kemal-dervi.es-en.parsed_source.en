Taksim and the Left 
ISTANBUL - The small park in Taksim Square in the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul is one of the few green spaces left in the city center . 
On May 28 , a handful of Turkish environmentalists started a peaceful protest against a redevelopment plan for the park that would replace the greenery with a replica of an Ottoman-era army barracks , a shopping mall , and apartments . 
The redevelopment plan for the park triggered a huge protest against what a large segment of the Turkish public , particularly young people , considers paternalistic and authoritarian political leadership . 
The movement &apos;s rapid growth was fueled by widespread opposition to what many regard as official efforts to regiment lifestyles , as well as by frustration over perceived economic inequities . 
Indeed , though environmentalists and secular youth spearheaded the protest movement , it became remarkably diverse and inclusive almost overnight . 
Pious Muslims - particularly those who believe that Turkey &apos;s urban development has created too much rent-seeking and too many easy fortunes - joined the demonstrations as well , as did some far-left groups . 
Some of the protests became violent . 
Overall , however , the movement has remained peaceful and even joyous . 
Moreover , important figures in or close to the ruling Justice and Development Party expressed their willingness to hold a dialogue with the protesters . 
President Abdullah Gül , in particular , played a calming , statesmanlike role . 
A striking feature of the protests has been the distance that the demonstrators have put between themselves and existing political parties , including the Republican People &apos;s Party ( CHP ) , the largest force in the center-left secular opposition . 
In this sense , the Taksim &quot; sit-in &quot; resembles protests elsewhere , particularly in the advanced democracies , from the &quot; Occupy Wall Street &quot; movement to the protests in Spain and Italy . 
To be sure , there are country-specific features to such protests - including , in Turkey &apos;s case , the reaction against lifestyle paternalism . 
Without such realism , the center left in Europe and the emerging world cannot regain political momentum . 
Modern production systems , in which information technology plays an increasingly crucial role , are totally different from the large factory floors that characterized the birth of trade unionism and social democracy . 
The way much of GDP is now produced has made it significantly harder for the left to organize in traditional ways . 
Yet information technology and global social media have empowered people to overcome social fragmentation along occupational , residential , and national lines . 
On some recent days , posts about Taksim Square have reportedly occupied a huge part of the entire world &apos;s &quot; Tweet space . &quot; 
In this corner of cyberspace , there is , of course , everything under the sun , including calls for the worst sort of sectarianism . 
Nonetheless , what dominates is a desire for individual freedom , an acceptance of diversity , great concern for the environment , and a refusal to be &quot; organized &quot; from above . 
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu , the CHP &apos;s reformist leader , quickly recognized these dynamics : &quot; The demonstrators don &apos;t want us on the front lines , &quot; he said , &quot; and we have much to learn from these events . &quot; 
And yet , while civil society can be a trigger , sooner or later democratic politics has to drive the process of change . 
Whether in New York , Paris , Madrid , Rome , Istanbul , or New Delhi , a feeling of unease and a desire for change has emerged in societies that are becoming increasingly unequal , and in which politics and business mix in non-transparent ways . 
Rising youth unemployment and cuts in pensions and social expenditures come at a time when many large multinational corporations legally avoid taxes by shifting their profits to favorable jurisdictions . 
In the eurozone , stock prices are soaring , while joblessness is at a record-high 12.2 % . 
The democratic opposition can address the flaws of the existing order only if it recognizes the need for very different forms of mobilization from those of the past . 
It must recognize a strong popular desire for individual autonomy , more leadership positions for women and the young , and greater support for individual enterprise ( along with reforms of social insurance that make it cost-effective and truly inclusive ) . 
Finally , the environment , climate change , and global solidarity will be defining themes of the twenty-first century . 
Acting on their own , nation-states can successfully address neither tax avoidance nor carbon emissions . 
The renewed patriotism seen in many places - a response to the unfairness and dislocation that globalization can generate - must be reconciled with human solidarity , respect for diversity , and the ability to work across national borders . 
The success of Germany &apos;s Green Party reflects the focus that it has placed on many of these issues . 
The events that started in Taksim Square are specific to Turkey , but they mirror aspirations that are universal . 
The same can be said for the challenge facing the democratic left .
