The Escalating Arab Wars 
BEIRUT - The violence unleashed in Arab countries in the last four years may turn out to be just a first taste of what is to come . 
Escalating brutality and the actions of governments have put Arab citizens under immense pressure . 
Without a change of course , the outcome could easily be further conflict and a new wave of uprisings - this time not peaceful . 
Not since the end of World War I have Arab countries undergone such a momentous upheaval . 
Conflict has broken out in no fewer than nine Arab countries , and the carnage has reached unimaginable levels of inhumanity . 
Tensions are mounting even in countries that are nominally at peace . 
Long-standing value systems are weakening , and once-solid societal foundations are crumbling . 
Fighting in Syria , Iraq , Sudan , Libya , and Yemen has torn apart entire communities . 
Ethnic cleansing perpetuated by the Islamic State has reversed centuries of religious , ethnic , and cultural intermingling , and pushed close to two million people from their homes . 
Indeed , although the Middle East and North Africa is home to just 5 % of the world &apos;s population , it has produced more than one-third of its refugees . 
In Syria alone , 11 million people have been forcibly displaced within and outside the country . 
These population movements are exacerbating preexisting social tensions across the Arab world . 
In Lebanon , for example , the arrival of more than one million Syrians has sparked worries that the country &apos;s sectarian balance could be altered , undermining its fragile political system . 
These huge demographic upheavals are irrevocably transforming the region &apos;s social and political identity . 
Indeed , throughout the region , warring parties are relying on sectarian identity politics to mobilize support , further polarizing populations along religious , ethnic , and ideological lines . 
Saudi Arabia and Iran are using Yemen &apos;s internal divisions over historic political and socioeconomic grievances in their proxy war there , presenting the conflict as a manifestation of the historic Sunni-Shia rift . 
Even in countries not at war , poisonous identity politics is becoming increasingly widespread and accepted . 
In Egypt , for example , the public has been broadly supportive of a brutal crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its Islamist supporters . 
These convulsions are further impoverishing Arab countries and limiting future opportunities for their citizens . 
Some 21 million Arab children are out of school , and more than 50 million Arabs are considered poor . 
In Syria , 80 % of the population is unable to meet its basic needs . 
In Yemen , more than one-third of the population - some 11.5 million people - suffered from food insecurity prior to the conflict . 
Another two million have since been added to the tally . 
This turmoil has created a fertile breeding ground for militarized and radicalized youth . 
Tunisia , the fÃªted success story of the Arab uprisings , has contributed the largest number of foreign fighters to the Islamic State - an estimated 3,000 ( mainly young ) people . 
Anecdotal evidence shows that many of the parties in the various conflicts are using children to fight their wars . 
In Yemen , around one-third of the fighters are children . 
The Islamic State boasts that it is training children for future battles . 
Rather than trying to ease dissatisfaction or attempt reconciliation , Arab governments are using brute force to shut down every possible space for dissent or debate . 
In the name of national security , citizens are stripped of their nationality , demonstrators are shot in the street , and thousands are held in arbitrary detention . 
In Egypt , danger lurks in the squares , universities , football stadiums , and even bathhouses , with the security services having detained anywhere from 22,000 to 41,000 citizens in the last year . 
Torture and forced disappearances are also widespread . 
In Syria , 85,000 individuals are said to have disappeared since the beginning of the conflict . 
Another 12,000 have been brutally tortured . 
Shutting out citizens from formal democratic processes is forcing political discontent further into the shadows , where it risks becoming militarized . 
In Egypt , there have been growing calls for more violent and radical responses to the government &apos;s clampdown . 
In Jordan and Morocco , the authorities are facing a rising challenge in containing militant tendencies . 
Indeed , as political leaders choose military repression over engagement , they will increasingly lose ground to groups like the Islamic State , the only entities in the region offering a clear - albeit brutal , and regressive - vision of the future . 
At this point , an end to current hostilities in Syria , Iraq , and Yemen requires national , regional , and international consensus . 
Obviously , that is a tall order . 
The scale of the challenges requires courageous thinking , bold initiatives , and ingenuity by national and regional political and development leaders . 
Otherwise , violence will engulf the region and far beyond .
