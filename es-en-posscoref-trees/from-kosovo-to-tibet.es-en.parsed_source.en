From Kosovo to Tibet 
LONDON  -  
What makes Tibet so important to the government in Beijing ? 
At the heart of the matter is the fact that nothing worries China &apos;s rulers more than when the country &apos;s unity is called into question . 
And nothing makes them more anxious than their fear that a regional dispute might , if not brought to an end quickly , steamroll into national disintegration . 
Kosovo &apos;s recent unilateral declaration of independence sharpened the Chinese government &apos;s anxieties over the protests in Tibet . 
Although supporters of Kosovo &apos;s independence argue that it sets no international precedent , China &apos;s rulers fear otherwise . 
Moreover , Taiwan &apos;s upcoming presidential election has further ratcheted up the tension for China &apos;s government . 
Opinion polls in Taiwan suggest that former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang ( KMT ) will defeat Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) . 
But some in China fear that the incumbent president , Chen Shui-bian of the DPP , is seeking a pretext to prevent a defeat for the pro-sovereignty camp . 
He is currently advocating a referendum on whether Taiwan should join the United Nations , which China views as provocative and a threat to China &apos;s unity . 
It may sound strange to the outside world that China , which has known nothing but economic success for three decades , should feel its unity to be so fragile . But China &apos;s history , both ancient and modern , suggests that there is nothing permanent or stable about the country &apos;s current unity . 
Indeed , today &apos;s unity was secured only with Mao &apos;s victory in 1949 . 
From the Warring States period ( 403-221 BC ) to the warlord period of the twentieth century ( 1916-28 ) - and many times in between - China &apos;s territory has splintered into separate , rival regions . 
So , while loudly proclaiming the unity of the Chinese state , China &apos;s leadership is obsessed with the country &apos;s fragility , and works constantly to reduce tensions between its provinces . 
The government &apos;s failure to eradicate chronic regional tension underscores the limits of central authority in China , which was partly intentional . 
An integral feature of the reforms that Deng Xiaoping launched 30 years ago was greater autonomy for local authorities - a move aimed at fostering accountability and creating incentives for growth . 
But some provinces have gone further . 
The central government &apos;s loss of authority is reflected in the number of its appeals - usually unsuccessful - that it makes to local government for compliance with limits on investment or controls on pollution . 
In any country as vast as China , far-flung regions are bound to have different interests and identities . 
Though few in China speculate aloud about it , there are some who believe that such differences may continue to tug the regions away from the center , and that some might one day break away . 
This is the fear gnawing at China &apos;s rulers as they confront the unrest in Tibet . 
Of course , to judge from official rhetoric , there is no threat to unity . 
All of China &apos;s peoples , including non-Chinese in annexed territories such as Tibet , Inner Mongolia , and Xinjiang , are firm and loyal supporters of the current system . 
But the government &apos;s frequent rotation of local officials tells a different story . 
Keen to prevent any coalescence of regional identity and local authority , senior officers in China &apos;s seven military districts also are rotated regularly . 
Another precaution taken by the central government is to shape the military districts so that they do not overlap with natural regional or economic divisions . 
But it also reflects the Chinese government &apos;s constant fear that regional tensions may lead to national fragmentation . 
Nevertheless , none of these precautions can assuage the anxiety of China &apos;s leaders about the struggle underway in Tibet , particularly in view of events in Kosovo and Taiwan . 
In principle , of course , conflict between Taiwan and the Mainland is not inevitable . 
With increasing change in China and growing economic and social contacts across the Strait , it should be possible to find a formula that allows the Taiwanese to maintain their market economy and democratic system without a placard at the UN . 
The West has historically stressed two bright lines with respect to Taiwan : no independence and no use of force by China . 
But , in view of Kosovo &apos;s independence against the will of Serbia and without UN sanction , these bright lines have become blurred in China &apos;s eyes . 
The world is risking much by injecting ambiguity into an issue that once seemed clear-cut . 
Thirty-five years ago , in a supreme act of modern statecraft , Zhou En-lai and Richard Nixon signed the Shanghai Communiqu√© , which set the following unambiguous standard : there is only one China , and Taiwan is part of it . 
An unequivocal reaffirmation of that understanding , particularly by the United States in the light of its role as primary backer of Kosovo &apos;s independence , is now needed if China is to be reassured that its unity will not be called into question . 
The West does not have an interest in helping either Tibet or Taiwan become sovereign countries , and efforts by some Tibetans and Taiwanese in this direction present the danger of a miscalculation that could create lasting enmity . 
Already , some Chinese suspect the US of seeking an independent Taiwan as an &quot; unsinkable aircraft carrier &quot; for use against a future Chinese enemy . 
Such suspicions can feed a climate of excessive nationalism in China . 
Both China and the West must now avoid letting exaggerated fears create self-inflicted prophecies . 
Events in Tibet can only be properly viewed with the shadows cast by Kosovo and Taiwan in mind .
