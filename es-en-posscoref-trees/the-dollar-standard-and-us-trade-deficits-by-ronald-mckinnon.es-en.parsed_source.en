The Unloved Dollar Standard 
PALO ALTO - Since World War II &apos;s end , the US dollar has been used to invoice most global trade , serving as the intermediary currency for clearing international payments among banks and dominating official foreign-exchange reserves . 
This arrangement has often been criticized , but is there any viable alternative ? 
The problem for post-WWII Europe , mired in depression and inflation , was that it lacked foreign reserves , which meant that trade carried a high opportunity cost . 
To facilitate trade without requiring payment after each transaction , the Organization for European Economic Cooperation created the European Payments Union in 1950 . 
Supported by a dollar-denominated line of credit , the EPU &apos;s 15 Western European member states established exact dollar exchange-rate parities as a prelude to anchoring their domestic price levels and removing all currency restrictions on intra-European trade . 
This formed the keystone of the hugely successful European Recovery Program ( the Marshall Plan ) , through which the US helped to rebuild Europe &apos;s economies . 
Today , most developing economies , with the exception of a few Eastern European countries , still choose to anchor their domestic macroeconomic arrangements by stabilizing their exchange rates against the dollar , at least intermittently . 
Meanwhile , to avoid exchange-rate conflict , the US Federal Reserve typically stays out of the currency markets . 
But the dollar &apos;s role as international anchor is beginning to falter , as emerging markets everywhere grow increasingly frustrated by the Fed &apos;s near-zero interest-rate policy , which has caused a flood of &quot; hot &quot; capital inflows from the US . 
That , in turn , has fueled sharp exchange-rate appreciation and a loss of international competitiveness - unless the affected central banks intervene to buy dollars . 
Indeed , since late 2003 , when the Fed first cut interest rates to 1 % , triggering the US housing bubble , dollar reserves in emerging markets have increased six-fold , reaching $ 7 trillion by 2011 . 
The resulting expansion in emerging markets &quot; monetary base has led to much higher inflation in these countries than in the US , and to global commodity-price bubbles , particularly for oil and staple foods . 
But the US is also unhappy with the way the dollar standard is functioning . 
Whereas other countries can choose to intervene in order to stabilize their exchange rates with the world &apos;s principal reserve currency , the US , in order to maintain consistency in rate setting , does not have the option to intervene , and lacks its own exchange-rate policy . 
Moreover , the US protests other countries &quot; exchange-rate policies . 
Two decades ago , the US pressed the Japanese to allow the yen to strengthen against the dollar , claiming that Japan &apos;s unfair exchange-rate policies were responsible for America &apos;s ballooning bilateral trade deficit . 
Likewise , today &apos;s &quot; China-bashing &quot; in the US - which has intensified as China &apos;s contribution to America &apos;s trade deficit has soared - is intended to force the Chinese authorities to allow faster renminbi appreciation . 
Herein lies the great paradox . 
Although no one likes the dollar standard , governments and private market participants still consider it the best option . 
In fact , US trade deficits are primarily the result of insufficient , mainly government , saving - not a misaligned exchange rate , as economists have led policymakers to believe . 
Large US budget deficits during Ronald Reagan &apos;s presidency generated the famous twin fiscal and trade deficits of the 1980 &quot; s . 
This , not an undervalued yen , caused the bilateral deficit with Japan to widen in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
The much larger US fiscal deficits of the new millennium , courtesy of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama , portend large - and indefinite - trade deficits . 
But American policymakers continue to blame China , claiming that the renminbi has been undervalued for the last decade . 
The claim that exchange-rate appreciation will reduce a country &apos;s trade surplus is false , because , in globally integrated economies , domestic investment falls when the exchange rate appreciates . 
So the ill will that China-bashing is generating is for nothing . 
Worse , it detracts political attention from America &apos;s huge fiscal deficit - $ 1.2 trillion ( 7.7 % of GDP ) in 2012 - and thus impedes any serious effort to rein in future spending for entitlements , such as health care and pensions . 
Some contend that large fiscal deficits do not matter if the US can exploit its central position under the dollar standard - that is , if it finances its deficits by selling Treasury bonds to foreign central banks at near-zero interest rates . 
But America &apos;s ongoing trade deficits with highly industrialized countries , particularly in Asia , are accelerating de-industrialization in the US , while providing fodder for American protectionists . 
Indeed , America &apos;s trade deficit in manufactures is roughly equal to its current-account deficit ( the amount by which domestic investment exceeds domestic saving ) . 
So those concerned with job losses in US manufacturing should join the chorus lobbying for a much smaller fiscal deficit . 
Can large US fiscal deficits and near-zero interest rates be justified because they help to revive domestic economic growth and job creation ? 
Five years after the credit crunch of 2007-2008 , it seems that they cannot . 
And , without even that justification , the latest wave of criticism of the US dollar standard appears set to rise further - and to stimulate the search for a &quot; new &quot; arrangement . 
But the best new arrangement - and possibly the only feasible one - would follow an old formula : as in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s , the US would set moderately positive and stable interest rates , with sufficient domestic saving to generate a ( small ) trade surplus . 
The cooperation of China , now the world &apos;s largest exporter and US creditor , is essential for easing and encouraging the transition to this nirvana . 
Apart from the ongoing euro crisis , a stable renminbi / dollar exchange rate is the key to renewed ( dollar ) exchange-rate stability throughout Asia and Latin America - as envisaged in the original 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement .
