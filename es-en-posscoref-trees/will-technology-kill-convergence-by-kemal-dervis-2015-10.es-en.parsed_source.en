Will Technology Kill Convergence ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - At last week &apos;s annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Lima , Peru , one topic that dominated discussions was the slowdown in emerging-economy growth . 
Hailed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as the new engines of the world economy , the emerging economies are now acting as a drag on global growth , and many argue that their era of rapid expansion - and their quest to achieve convergence with advanced-country income levels - is over . 
Are the doomsayers right ? 
There is certainly reason for concern - beginning in China . 
After decades of nearly double-digit growth , China appears to be experiencing a marked slowdown - one that some argue is actually worse than official statistics indicate . 
As China &apos;s growth slows , so does its demand for oil and commodities , with severe effects for other emerging economies that depend on commodity exports . 
Moreover , the benefits of lower commodity prices do not seem to have materialized among net importers , except perhaps India ; if they have , they have been far from adequate to offset other growth-damaging forces . 
Meanwhile , the advanced economies are tentatively recovering from the 2008 crisis . 
Indeed , after averaging three percentage points for two decades and rising to 4.8 percentage points in 2010 , the percentage-point differential fell to 2.5 last year and is expected to amount to just 1.5 this year . 
The question , then , is whether the growth differential will remain as low at it is today . 
Those who believe that it will , typically rely on three arguments , all of which require some qualification . 
First , they argue that much convergence has already taken place in manufacturing . 
This is true , but it neglects the increasing interconnectedness of manufacturing and services , and the changing nature of many services . 
An iPad , for example , must not just be built ; it also needs coding services . 
In a sense , it is actually more the product of the modern services sector than of manufacturing . 
And there are plenty of untapped opportunities for technological catch-up in , say , health , education , and financial services . 
Second , emerging-market bears point out that these economies have gained major productivity benefits from the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas , a surplus that will soon be exhausted . 
This , too , is true . 
But it ignores the fact that there still is a huge reservoir of urban labor in the informal sector that , upon shifting to the formal sector , would provide an additional boost to productivity . 
The pessimists &quot; third argument is that emerging economies are not implementing fast enough the structural reforms needed to support long-term growth . 
Again , there is some truth to this argument : structural reforms are needed everywhere . 
But there is no proven way to measure the pace of their implementation . 
But there may be a fourth mechanism at work , related to the changing - and seriously disruptive - nature of new technologies . 
A major driver of past catch-up , if only in terms of incremental growth , was the shift of many activities in both the services and manufacturing sectors from advanced economies to developing countries with lower wages . 
Now , however , a growing array of activities can be automated . 
And coding-supported products often have lower costs per unit of output than even very cheap labor can provide . 
So , whereas call centers , for example , used to be mostly staffed in low-wage countries , now the computer-robot that does most of the talking can be located in New York . 
That observation should not , however , overshadow fundamental economic insights - specifically , that trade and the location of production are determined by comparative , not absolute , advantage . 
A country will always have a comparative advantage in something ; but that something changes . 
Many advanced countries , for example , now have a comparative advantage in high-value-added activities . 
In other words , thanks to their highly skilled labor forces , they are better equipped than their developing-country counterparts for activities like the production of made-to-measure specialized goods or , indeed , anything that requires a highly trained team to work in close proximity . 
But the technology-induced shifts that are underway could portend big disruptions in global value chains - disruptions affecting both developed and developing countries . 
In fact , we may have entered a period of fundamental change that could weaken growth everywhere , as the &quot; old &quot; shrinks before the &quot; new &quot; can occupy sufficient space . 
To be sure , the creative destruction that is taking place seems to be affecting developing-economy growth proportionately more than advanced-economy growth , largely because the new technologies are being put to work where they were invented , and developing countries have not yet managed sufficient imitation . 
But I am not convinced that &quot; catch-up &quot; opportunities will remain diminished - not least because it will always be easier to imitate than to invent . 
In fact , it could be argued that new &quot; leap-frogging &quot; may become possible . 
As experience in the telecommunications sector shows , the ability to adopt new technologies without first having to dismantle old systems can enable rapid progress . 
The key to enabling continued convergence - even at a fairly rapid pace - is good political governance . 
Developing-country governments must implement policies aimed at managing the impending transformation , while maintaining social solidarity and cohesion . 
That is the challenge they must meet at this time of great disruption .
