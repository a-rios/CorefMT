The Return of the Renminbi Rant 
NEW HAVEN - China &apos;s currency , the renminbi , has been weakening in recent months , resurrecting familiar charges of manipulation , competitive devaluation , and beggar-thy-neighbor mercantilism . 
In mid-April , the US Treasury expressed &quot; particularly serious concerns &quot; over this development , underscoring what has long been one of the most contentious economic-policy issues between the United States and China . 
This is a timeworn debate - politically inspired and grounded in bad economics - that does a serious disservice to both sides by diverting attention from far more important issues affecting the US-China economic relationship . 
Taken to its extreme , America &apos;s accusations risk pushing the world &apos;s two largest economies down the slippery slope of trade frictions , protectionism , or something even worse . 
First , the facts : Since hitting its high watermark on January 14 , 2014 , the renminbi has depreciated by 3.4 % relative to the US dollar through April 25 . 
Relative to where it started nearly nine years ago , the renminbi is still up 32.5 % . 
Over the same period , there has been a dramatic adjustment of China &apos;s international balance-of-payments position . 
The current-account surplus - the most telling symptom of an undervalued currency - has narrowed from a record 10.1 % of GDP in 2007 to just 2.1 % in 2013 . 
The International Monetary Fund &apos;s latest forecast suggests that the surplus will hold at around 2 % of GDP in 2014 . 
Seen against this background , US officials &quot; handwringing over the recent modest reversal in the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate appears absurd . 
With China &apos;s external position much closer to balance , there is good reason to argue that the renminbi , having appreciated by nearly one-third since mid-2005 , is now within a reasonable proximity of &quot; fair value . &quot; 
The IMF conceded as much in its latest in-depth review of the Chinese economy , which calls the renminbi &quot; moderately undervalued &quot; by 5-10 % . 
This stands in contrast to its earlier assessments of &quot; substantial &quot; undervaluation . 
America &apos;s fixation on the renminbi is a classic case of political denial . 
With US workers remaining under intense pressure in terms of both job security and real wages , politicians have understandably been put on the spot . 
In response , they have fixated on the Chinese component of a long-gaping trade deficit , charging that currency manipulation is the culprit to the long festering woes of the American middle class . 
This argument is politically expedient - but wrong . 
The US trade deficit is a multilateral imbalance with many countries - 102 in all - not a bilateral problem with China . 
It arises not from the alleged manipulation of the renminbi , but from the simple fact that America does not save . 
Lacking in domestic savings and wanting to grow , the US must import surplus savings from abroad , and run massive current-account deficits to attract the foreign capital . 
Yes , trade with China is the largest component of this imbalance , but that largely reflects the complexity of multinational supply chains and the benefits of offshore efficiency solutions . 
That brings us to the uncomfortable truth about America &apos;s politically inspired China bashing : It will backfire . 
If America fails to solve its saving problem - a reasonable scenario in light of fiscal gridlock and persistently subpar personal saving - the current-account deficit will persist . 
That means that any reductions in China &apos;s share of America &apos;s external imbalance would simply be shifted to other foreign producers . 
Significantly , this alternative sourcing will most likely have a higher cost base than Chinese production , thereby imposing the functional equivalent of a tax hike on already-beleaguered middle-class Americans . 
As China rebalances toward a growth model that draws greater support from domestic demand , Washington should stop ranting about the renminbi and start focusing on the opportunities that this bonanza will create . 
Pushing for a bilateral investment treaty that relaxes caps on foreign ownership in both countries would be an important step in that direction . 
Similarly , the US needs to give China credit for having taken meaningful steps on the road to further currency reform . 
The mid-March widening of the daily renminbi-dollar trading bands to plus or minus 2 % ( from the earlier 1 % band ) is an important step in relaxing control over the so-called managed float . 
That , coupled with the 3 % depreciation in the past few months , should send a strong signal to speculators that one-way renminbi bets are hazardous - a signal that could help dampen inflows of hot money , which have complicated liquidity management and fueled asset-market volatility in China . 
There are two views of the future of the US-China economic relationship : one that sees only risk , and another that sees opportunity . 
Fixating on the renminbi falls into the former category : It misses the rebalancing and reforms already under way in China and deflects America &apos;s focus from addressing its most serious long-term macroeconomic problem - a lack of saving . 
By contrast , viewing China as an opportunity underscores the need for America to undertake its own rebalancing - rebuilding US competitiveness and pushing for a meaningful share of China &apos;s coming boom in domestic demand . 
Unfortunately , the revival in US saving that this will require is being drowned out by the renminbi rant .
