Celebrity Central Bankers 
CAMBRIDGE - Why do the comments of major economies &quot; central bankers command outsize attention nowadays ? 
It is not as if they change interest rates all of the time . 
Nor have they developed new , more robust models for analyzing the economy . 
On the contrary , major central banks &quot; growth and inflation forecasts in the years since the financial crisis have consistently overestimated both growth and inflation - and by wide margins . 
There are many good reasons for the attention lavished on monetary policymakers , including the rise of central-bank independence , public acceptance of the need to appoint highly competent technocrats to oversee the money supply , and the deepening of financial markets . 
And many central bankers have been rightly lauded for their role in preventing a global meltdown during the financial crisis . 
Even so , given the numerous uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic forecasts and the effects of policy instruments ( not least quantitative easing ) , many academics find it puzzling that central bankers &quot; speeches and statements generate so much fanfare . 
And for all of their heroics during the financial crisis , many central bankers have been far too inflexible in the aftermath , worrying too much about overshooting inflation targets , and too little about deflationary dynamics . 
Moreover , central bankers bear a share of the blame for the crisis in the first place , mainly owing to lax regulatory policy . 
Many central bankers portray former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ( who served from August 1987 until January 2006 ) as the culprit , saying that he projected an image of central-bank omnipotence that is not warranted in theory or practice . 
But this critique is overblown : Greenspan is long gone , but the focus on central-bank pronouncements is greater than ever . 
What , then , is going on ? 
I would argue that , in addition to all of the factors listed above , three further considerations should be noted . 
For starters , the public perception that central bankers are omniscient makes them an attractive whipping boy for politicians . 
Moreover , the digital revolution in media has elevated the role of business news , one of the few profit centers for print and broadcast journalism in many countries . 
Central bankers &quot; pronouncements are of interest to businesspeople - especially in the financial sector - and businesspeople are of interest to advertisers . 
Finally , and perhaps least appreciated , is the fact that central-bank policy pronouncements are almost unique in having clear and predictable effects on financial markets , at least in the very short run ( which can be a day or less ) . 
If Fed officials surprise markets by making more &quot; hawkish &quot; statements ( suggesting an upward bias to policy interest rates ) than investors were expecting , the dollar will usually appreciate ; long-term dollar interest rates will usually rise ; and the stock market typically will decline . 
True , these effects may be small and transitory . 
But , unlike most of the reams of macroeconomic information with which we are bombarded every day , central bankers &quot; speeches and opinions have relatively foreseeable effects , especially when the bank &apos;s chair , president , or governor speaks , or other officials speak in concert . 
And , with trillions of dollars swirling around global financial markets , this predictability creates a fat target , with investors willing to make massive bets when they are pretty sure they are right , even if the profit per dollar is small . 
If you think I am exaggerating , consider the coverage of other economic news , say , unemployment , GDP , or the trade balance . 
Virtually every story quickly shifts its focus to what the data mean for monetary policy . 
Some economic indicators , such as unemployment or inflation data , are indeed immediately important for central banks , because they may directly concern their mandates , and therefore have rather predictable effects . 
But much information is simply noise . 
This makes policy opinions that come straight from the horse &apos;s mouth almost uniquely valuable . 
In short , there are many good reasons why central bankers receive so much media focus , including their relative independence and generally solid performance . 
But there are also other reasons having to do with politicians &quot; need for scapegoats , the media &apos;s struggle to reinvent itself in the Internet age , and central-bank pronouncements &quot; predictable short-term effects on financial markets . 
These other factors have combined to create a bubble around central-bank pronouncements and decisions that grossly exaggerates their economic significance . 
Is this a bubble that central bankers should worry about ? 
The answer is clearly yes . 
The news bubble is of particular concern , because it reinforces the idea that central bankers somehow care disproportionately about financial markets , which is generally not the case . 
Most central bankers really are targeting growth , inflation , and financial stability , if not necessarily in that order . 
The political bubble is an inevitable product of central-bank independence , and preventing monetary policy from becoming a target for elected officials requires constant effort . 
The predictability bubble is perhaps the trickiest to navigate , though my instinct is that less would be more . 
Exaggerated importance is one kind of bubble that central bankers should always be eager to burst .
