China Stuck in the Net 
There is nothing &quot; virtual &quot; about the problems China &apos;s communist rulers confront with the internet . 
Although critical to China &apos;s goals of modernization and globalization , the internet threatens the political status quo . 
So no surprise at the government &apos;s often schizophrenic response to it : while broadly encouraging the internet &apos;s development , some party factions seek to suppress it by arresting IT entrepreneurs and web dissidents . 
Nonetheless , China &apos;s more than 35 million internet users - a number that doubles every nine months - have access to a wide variety of previously censored information , including sites that are officially banned . 
Staggering changes have already occurred . 
When , a little over a year ago , 42 elementary school children and teachers in impoverished Jiangxi ( south central China ) were killed in an explosion , China &apos;s domestic newspapers and internet sites reported the explosion as the result of an appalling child-labor scheme : nine-year-old children had been forced to install detonators in firecrackers so that teachers could sell fireworks to supplement their salaries . 
Two days later , Premier Zhu Rongji denied the reports . 
He claimed that the explosion was the result of a &quot; deranged man . &quot; 
Typical of China , state-owned media that carried the original story instantly retracted their reports to parrot the party line . 
Atypical of China , however , the true story refused to die . 
In internet forums and chat rooms , Chinese citizens continued to express their outrage about what they saw as a government cover up . 
Evidence that party leaders were lying , including interviews with witnesses , was posted on the net . 
Some websites deleted the information , others refused . 
Links to obscure websites with uncensored news about the catastrophe could even be found on the government newspaper &apos;s official website , People &apos;s Daily . 
A few days later , the breaking news from China was astonishing . 
&quot; Responding to reports on the internet and elsewhere , Premier Zhu Rongji apologized for an explosion that gutted an elementary school in rural China , &quot; read a report . 
Zhu said that the government bore &quot; unshirkable responsibility &quot; for the imbroglio and ordered an investigation . 
The turnaround was unprecedented . 
Premier Zhu apologized primarily in response to the public outcry on the internet . 
Though still in its infancy , the internet has shown that it has the power to shake China loose from its stagnant , isolated and repressive past . 
Historically , information in China was controlled by the Communist Party , making popular opinion irrelevant . 
Now the internet provides ordinary Chinese what they never had before : uncensored information . 
So the Communist Party is trapped in the internet , because the government cannot pull the plug on it without hamstringing the economy . 
Furthermore , China will probably need to ease up on the restrictions it has already imposed if it wants to gain all of the internet &apos;s benefits ; that is , unless the conservative factions who feel most threatened by the internet consolidate their power in the upcoming leadership succession . 
When I first visited China a few years ago , US President Clinton had just departed Beijing , where he charmed the Chinese people in an historic televised discussion with President Jiang Zemin . 
Since the April 2001 US-China spy-plane crisis , when China demanded an apology and US President Bush refused to give one , the Bush administration has been alienating the Chinese . 
The implications go beyond public relations . 
The Communist Party is preparing to change its old-guard leadership over the next two years . 
Hardliners who feel most threatened by the internet &apos;s free flow of information were the people emboldened by the nationalistic waves of anti-American sentiment that swept China . 
In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on America on September 11 , angry and vengeful messages appeared in some Chinese chat rooms . 
&quot; I &apos;m glad that the USA was attacked , &quot; read one . 
&quot; Airplanes ? 
Why not atomic bombs , &quot; read another . 
Were these the xenophobic rants of extremist rightists or did they reflect a majority sentiment of the Chinese ? 
In China , like the US , reactionary groups often congregate on line , but with one important difference . 
In China , only the educated and relatively privileged can take part in online discussion . 
Thus , they can &apos;t all be written off as a purely lunatic fringe . 
For the first time , as the explosion at Jaingxu school and the response to the attacks of September 11 th proved , China &apos;s public can use the internet to both gain information and express views that may influence the government . 
Now that popular opinion is emerging as a force in China , the Chinese people as well as its government will need to be wooed by those wishing to influence China . 
The internet has provided ordinary Chinese with access to the real story as well as to a public voice , which means that they can be a powerful ally in efforts to effect change in the most populace nation on earth .
