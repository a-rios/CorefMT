Decision Time for the Eurozone 
ATHENS - Germany &apos;s arguments against introducing Eurobonds , expanding the eurozone &apos;s bailout fund , and instituting a comprehensive system of economic governance are transparent and easy to understand . 
But are they right ? 
The Germans fear that such innovations would lead to a rise in domestic borrowing costs , and to direct and indirect fiscal transfers to poorer countries . 
Moreover , they warn of the moral hazard generated by relieving over-indebted countries from the pressure to put their public finances in order . 
Third , they cite treaty-related and constitutional difficulties in establishing rules and procedures that would simulate a &quot; fiscal union . &quot; 
Finally , the need to move ahead with European unification in order to legitimize the inevitable infringement of over-indebted countries &quot; sovereignty might eventually infringe upon German sovereignty as well . 
On the other hand , refusing to accept the growing consensus that fiscal union is the key to resolving the debt crisis exposes the eurozone , and Germany , to serious risks . 
Sticking to half-measures exacerbates markets &quot; impatience and provokes increasingly determined speculative attacks , not only on the weaker peripheral countries , but also on core AAA-rated countries - like France and , eventually , Germany itself - whose banking sectors hold large volumes of peripheral countries &quot; debt . 
Indeed , weakening banking conditions are emerging as a major threat to the eurozone &apos;s recovery and stability . 
In the event of sovereign defaults , moreover , the cost of bailing out the banks may far exceed the cost of issuing Eurobonds or instituting a reasonable transfer regime . 
Investors need to be reassured that debt-service costs are under control , and that debt volumes and deficit limits are firmly monitored in order to minimize default risks and strengthen banks &quot; ability to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth . 
In fact , the emerging systemic risk concerning the sustainability of the eurozone produces a vicious circle . 
Systemic risk raises doubts about the solvency of over-indebted countries , which means that these countries &quot; efforts to consolidate their fiscal position and promote reform do not lead to improvement in financial conditions , which is essential for overcoming the crisis and promoting recovery . 
As a result , fiscal consolidation becomes increasingly difficult to achieve , inviting renewed speculative attacks . 
Moreover , viewed from a wider perspective , economic and social turbulence on Europe &apos;s southern periphery will constitute a geopolitical risk . 
That risk would be exacerbated by the eruption of a major default-related crisis within the eurozone , which might not be contained and , through a Lehman-like domino sequence , could jeopardize the entire edifice . 
The eurozone &apos;s dilemmas , and the pros and cons of proposed solutions , can be debated endlessly . 
It could be argued , for example , that Eurobonds would allow eurozone members to pool their financial strength and , by enhancing the attractiveness of the euro as a reserve currency , hold down borrowing costs to such an extent that AAA-rated countries are not overburdened . 
Legal problems could also be overcome in the short term by designing Eurobonds to include credit guarantees , repayment priorities , and the use of specific tax streams as collateral . 
Proposals to limit moral hazard , meanwhile , would do so by limiting Eurobonds to 60 % of GDP - the eurozone &apos;s current ceiling for member states &quot; public debt . 
A more substantial constraint would be to establish a tougher disciplinary regime on fiscally profligate countries as part of a reinforced institutional framework . 
Political problems , however they are addressed , should be weighed against the vulnerability of European banks . 
Germany &apos;s banks today are the most highly leveraged of any of the major advanced economies , while at the start of the crisis they held close to one-third of all loans made to the public and private sectors of Greece , Portugal , Ireland , Spain , and Italy . 
So long as the eurozone &apos;s systemic risk is not addressed , sovereign defaults are not unlikely , leading to extended bank bailouts that could carry unacceptable costs . 
In that case , a full-blown banking crisis could bring about a depression in the eurozone and , perhaps , globally . 
Europe-wide bank recapitalization is essential in the short term to contain the cost arising from possible sovereign defaults . 
However , addressing the eurozone &apos;s deeper defects cannot be postponed endlessly . 
Of course , in the midst of so much uncertainty , it is remarkable that the over-indebted countries &quot; consolidation efforts remain broadly on track ; but the European Central Bank &apos;s continued bond-buying and liquidity support is only a temporary palliative . 
An impasse is inevitable , so playing for time is not a solution . 
By contrast , a combination of Eurobonds , a fully-fledged debt facility , enhanced powers for the ECB so that it can act as a lender of last resort , and solid economic governance would work . 
In the longer term , radical reforms in capital , product , and labor markets will also be needed , complemented by a stronger and more cohesive investment strategy at the European level , aimed at boosting competitiveness and restoring growth prospects . 
European competitiveness does not have only a global dimension . 
Large discrepancies exist within the eurozone , reflected in structural trade imbalances between the core and the periphery that lie at the heart of the debt crisis . 
The eurozone &apos;s cohesion and future growth depend critically on creating a framework - through grants and loans - for investment capital to flow to the poorer countries in order to close the competitiveness gap . 
To borrow a phrase from the financial world , the euro is too big to fail . 
Decisions should be taken sooner rather than later , so that the eurozone itself shapes events , rather than being commanded by them .
