The Lessons of Europe &apos;s Carbon Trade 
FLORENCE - As the Canc√∫n climate change summit approaches , discussions about the viability of carbon trading systems is intensifying . 
The world can look to Europe as a model that is not only up and running , but that works . 
In 2005 , the member states of the European Union became the first to create a cap-and-trade system covering roughly half their CO2 emissions . 
They remain the only countries that impose a price for carbon upon a significant part of their economies . 
With the EU &apos;s Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) half-a-decade old , three broad lessons can be drawn . 
First , the system works . 
The ETS has achieved its objective of reducing emissions by the required amount at least cost . 
Emissions have been reliably estimated to be 3-5 % lower in the ETS &apos;s first three years , owing to the carbon price . 
This is a modest amount , but the initial ambition was also modest . 
More importantly , the cap on emissions is being tightened over time - by 11 % for the second period , from 2008 through 2012 , and by 1.74 % annually from 2013 on - so that the required reductions will increase in the future . 
While it is impossible to prove that firms have reduced emissions at least cost , the necessary conditions for doing so exist . 
Firms can readily compare their cost of abating an extra ton of emissions with the cost of the allowance required if that ton is released into the atmosphere . 
A well-functioning allowance market - with broad participation and pricing that reflects underlying fundamentals - reveals this latter cost . 
The second lesson is that the side-effects of the ETS are few . 
The expectations of extremists among advocates and opponents of carbon pricing have been disappointed in equal measure . 
The former expected transformational technological and social change , while the latter darkly predicted weakened competitiveness and job losses , even recession . 
The readily observable fact - to the consternation of both sides - is that the carbon price has produced no far-reaching economic changes in Europe . 
Trends that existed before 2005 continued thereafter . 
Production and employment increased in the first years of the program , and there was no observable effect on imports and exports . 
The only trend that changed was carbon emissions , which fell . 
The financial crisis in late 2008 brought recession , but no one has blamed carbon pricing . 
The fact is that the European economy has been affected more by sub-prime mortgages in the United States than by a carbon price in Europe . 
The reason for the absence of noticeable side-effects is worth noting . 
Producers that are subject to the cap-and-trade scheme have many ways to adjust production , and , not surprisingly , they do so when faced with higher prices , including a new price on carbon . 
Some of these adjustments are little more than &quot; leak-plugging , &quot; or paying more attention to emissions . 
Others involve small changes in industrial processes , such as the use of inputs that emit less carbon in steel and cement production , as well as large ones , such as a changeover within Europe to lower-carbon manufacturing facilities . 
A typical example is the increase in electricity produced by gas-fired generating plants rather than coal-fired plants . 
In such instances , the output purchased by consumers is the same , and the additional cost is imperceptible . 
The explanation is one that applies to all of us . 
When faced with higher prices , we make small adjustments in our use of the affected items , but otherwise carry on as before . 
Producers find ways to continue making the goods that consumers want , but with fewer emissions . 
The third broad lesson from the ETS is that multinational emissions-trading regimes can be constructed . 
A little-noted feature of the ETS is that it is more akin to 27 linked national cap-and-trade systems than to one big centrally administered system . 
The EU , after all , is composed of sovereign states that jealously guard their prerogatives while occasionally yielding some aspect of sovereignty to central institutions for mutually agreed-upon purposes . 
Moreover , the differences among member states in economic circumstances , exposure to market institutions , and commitment to climate-change policy are significant . 
These differences may not be as great as they are on a global scale , but they are similar , and bridging them to accommodate individual EU member states required no small amount of negotiation and compromise . 
But it was done - a demonstration of the feasibility of multi-national carbon trading that has enormous implications for the construction of a global trading regime . 
While the ETS is often criticized and sometimes characterized as a failure , a sense of perspective is always required . 
As is true of all public policies , textbook perfection was not achieved . 
Mistakes were made but they have been or are being corrected . 
Many find the system lacking in ambition , but the important point is that a mechanism for achieving bolder reductions is in place . 
The real problem is one of political will , not of institutional mechanics . 
And , compared to the US Senate &apos;s failure to enact anything at all , Europe &apos;s achievement looks pretty good . 
It has demonstrated that a cap-and-trade system can reduce CO2 emissions at least cost , that the side-effects are not serious , and that multinational cap-and-trade systems can be constructed . 
Whatever the ETS &apos;s flaws , these three lessons are the important ones to keep in mind .
