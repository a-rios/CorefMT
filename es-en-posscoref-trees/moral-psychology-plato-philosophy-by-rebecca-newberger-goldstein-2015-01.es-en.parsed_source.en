What Drives Moral Progress ? 
DAVOS - What would happen if the ancient Greek philosopher Plato partook in contemporary dialogues about the types of questions that he first posed , and that continue to vex us ? 
In my view , he would have many new questions - including about our increasingly psychological approach to philosophical discussion . 
Plato would probably head to a leading global technology hub : Google &apos;s California headquarters . 
There , he might fall into a discussion with a software engineer about , say , whether ethical questions can be answered through crowdsourcing . 
He would probably love the idea of the information cloud - so abstract , so Platonic - and find Google to be the ideal tool to catch up on the vast scientific and technical advances of the last couple of millennia . 
But Plato would probably be most amazed by the world &apos;s moral progress . 
After all , he believed that being a &quot; philosopher &quot; meant assuming the responsibilities of moral reformer . 
Yet , though morality was always at the center of his thinking , many of the moral truths that we now take for granted never occurred to him . 
For example , though Plato opposed the enslavement of Greeks , he - like every other ancient Greek - condoned the enslavement of &quot; barbarians &quot; ( non-Greeks ) . 
Today , by contrast , even an emphatically non-philosophical person - say , Plato &apos;s &quot; media escort &quot; - could easily explain why slavery is wrong : &quot; A person is a person . 
Everybody &apos;s life is just as important as anybody else &apos;s . &quot; 
As obvious as this conclusion might seem , the world has taken millennia to reach it - and , in many ways , has yet to accept it fully . 
Nonetheless , we can now collectively look back at our slave-owning , wife-beating , child-brutalizing , heretic-burning , colonizing forebears and wonder how even the most profoundly moral among them failed to see that they should not behave that way . 
What drove this progress ? 
Plato held that moral progress is essentially an intellectual process , driven by reasoned arguments - a stance that many of the most influential moral philosophers , from Baruch Spinoza and Immanuel Kant to John Rawls and Peter Singer , have supported . 
Yet many other philosophers have rejected the autocracy of reason in humans &quot; moral lives , agreeing with David Hume &apos;s assertion that &quot; reason , in itself , is perfectly inert . &quot; 
They believe that no purely abstract argument can get us to do anything that we do not want to do . 
If a reasoned argument cannot move us , what can ? 
One simple answer stands out : emotions . 
Moral emotions , notably empathy , can accomplish what no bloodless ratiocination can : they make us feel - and thus want to account for - the experience of others . 
The more we feel , the more we care - and the more moral our motivations . 
In short , a stronger sense of empathy spurs moral progress . 
With this shift in focus from reason to emotion , moral philosophy is increasingly giving way to moral psychology , which , by incorporating ideas from evolutionary biology , has more and more to say about human nature and our moral lives . 
It all comes down to natural selection . 
Moral emotions like empathy are as much an outcome of the blind workings of adaptation as our upright stance and opposable thumbs - traits that are entrenched in a species through the proliferation of particular genes . 
We humans are most strongly empathetic toward those who share the greatest proportion of our genes : our children , our parents , our siblings , and , by lessening gradations , our extended family and tribe . 
Our empathy toward them might even drive us to make sacrifices that jeopardize our individual survival , but that makes perfect sense in terms of preserving our shared genes . 
Of course , empathy is not the only part of our inherited nature that shapes our behavior toward others . 
In fact , there is also a compelling evolutionary explanation for xenophobia . 
Humans evolved from primates who formed communities that worked together to survive . 
Given the obvious benefits of having access to more territory in which to gather and hunt , outsiders - particularly those who bear characteristics that mark them as genetically distant - were treated as foes . 
In this sense , the notion of &quot; us versus them &quot; has been fundamental to human evolution , and it continues to shape our interactions . 
Just as both empathy and xenophobia can be explained by natural selection , both can be modulated by cultural factors . 
Within the strict domain of moral psychology , they do . 
After all , a psychological telling of the story of our moral development provides no basis for encouraging us to dampen one natural inclination and nurture another . 
But moral psychology does not have to tell the whole story . 
There is no reason why we cannot have moral psychology and moral philosophy : moral psychology to explain why moral progress is both possible and painfully slow , and moral philosophy to clarify what constitutes moral progress and to push us in the appropriate direction . 
We are reasoning , deliberating human beings , and our genes are not the masters of our fate . 
We should not become so enthralled by the explanatory power of the behavioral sciences that we succumb to the belief that moral progress is predetermined . 
Psychology tells a diminished story that leaves out our past moral advances and the hard argumentative work required to expand those advances in the future . 
Plato would reject this view .
