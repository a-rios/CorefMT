The Visual Politics of Terror 
NEW YORK - The British artist Damien Hirst once referred to the 2001 attack on New York &apos;s World Trade Center as &quot; kind of an artwork in its own right . 
It was wicked , but it was devised in this way for this kind of impact . 
It was devised visually . &quot; 
Like Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda , the Islamic State appears to understand the impact that lurid images of violence can have on the public imagination . 
The irony , of course , is that the Islamic State &apos;s exploitation of images of &quot; pornographic &quot; violence is at odds with the Islamists &quot; own condemnations of visual stimulation in other areas of life . 
Indeed , their videos take sensory titillation to its limit . 
Like an algorithm designed to access an adversary &apos;s digital network , the Islamic State &apos;s carefully staged videos , featuring the beheadings of American and British journalists and aid workers , have penetrated the Western psyche . 
That psyche has long been primed to receive shocking imagery . 
Now , the electronic media &apos;s weakness for graphic violence has become the Islamic State &apos;s strength . 
The visual politics of terror may seem primitive , but its practice can be as sophisticated as its effects are profound . 
Like ancient conquerors , who erected new temples on the sites where the vanquished had their own , the destroyers of New York &apos;s Twin Towers used visual terror to strike at the heart of their enemy &apos;s value system . 
That is what terror aims to do : destabilize the foe &apos;s normative reality . 
Once the security of the familiar world is challenged , and its inner sanctums have been invaded and shaken , a space may be cleared for occupation . 
Consider , for example , how Indonesia &apos;s Suharto regime , from 1966 to 1998 , depicted alleged Communist insurgent savagery , and compelled citizens to watch it on television and in theaters . 
The horrifying images were intended to foment terror . 
In the face of a grotesquely violent enemy , an even more terrifying state apparatus of organized violence emerged . 
In effect , Suharto &apos;s visual politics of atrocity and terror created a new reality from the violence and terror associated with the demise of the old . 
The same perverse logic is at work in the Islamic State &apos;s viral spectacles . 
Though the need to confront evil remains as pressing as ever , Western societies &quot; motivation for doing so may lose clarity . 
After all , it is one thing to deliberate on the pros and cons of confronting external forces of irrational violence ; it is something else to lash out against the producers of brutal , politically charged , and upsetting imagery . 
We must therefore ask ourselves what exactly is driving our response to the threats that the Islamic State presents . 
Distinguishing between information about real national-security concerns and images strategically designed to shock and titillate us will not be easy . 
The visual politics of atrocity and terror is only as strong as we imagine it . 
That is why exorcising its demons will require more than military might . 
It also will require us to think deeply about the strategic use of violent images in the digital age .
