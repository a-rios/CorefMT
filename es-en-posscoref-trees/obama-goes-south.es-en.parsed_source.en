Obama Goes South 
MEXICO CITY - US President Barack Obama &apos;s current swing through Latin America will probably be short on substance , long on rhetorical flourishes and symbolism , and may include a few announcements affecting American business in the region . 
More importantly , he will see real success stories , and how Latin America as a whole has changed . 
The main change is that Latin America is splitting in two . 
Indeed , this might be the last trip that a US president ever makes to &quot; Latin America . &quot; 
Later visits will be either to South America , or to Mexico and the Caribbean Basin . 
Chile &apos;s success is old , if still inspiring , news . 
More than two decades of democratic rule and economic growth practically ensure that , simply by staying the course , the country will achieve lower-tier developed status by 2020 . 
And there is every reason to believe that it will stay the course , even if President Sebastián Piñera , who will preside over Chile &apos;s best economic performance in 15 years , is succeeded by former president and rival Michele Bachelet in 2014 . 
Even the country &apos;s proverbial inequality is beginning to shrink , albeit slowly , and lower-middle-class living standards are finally rising to where they should have been a decade ago . 
Brazil &apos;s success is also well known . 
Millions of families have been lifted out of poverty . 
Inequality has diminished , though from astronomically high levels . 
The economy is growing at a sustainable pace . 
As long as China and India maintain their insatiable appetite for commodities , Brazil &apos;s exports will finance today &apos;s consumer boom . 
In the international arena , the new president , Dilma Roussef , has pulled back from Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva &apos;s many excesses ( indifference to human rights abuses , support for Iran and its nuclear program , and rhetorical anti-Americanism ) during his last year in office , and may even have a present for Obama . 
Brazil has been mulling whom to pick to renew its Air Force &apos;s fighter fleet , and , whereas Lula favored France , Roussel canceled that option and may be leaning toward the US . 
El Salvador is Latin America &apos;s most interesting success story . 
It is far from a picture of health and stability , with high levels of violence and crime , mass emigration , a slow-growth economy , and perpetual tensions within its center-left coalition government . 
But next year the country will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Chapultepec Peace Accords , which ended its decade-long civil war . 
Ever since , a country that had never truly experienced democratic rule has enjoyed all the charms and vicissitudes of competitive elections , legislative battles , and rotation in power . 
After a succession of conservative governments , in 2009 Salvadorans elected a president running on the ticket of the FMLN , the old guerrilla group that fought the Salvadorean army and its US ally to a draw in the late 1980 &quot; s . 
The right accepted its defeat , and the left has governed reasonably ( maintaining the dollar as the national currency ) . 
The right has started to regroup , and Obama will surely point to this virtuous cycle as one in which the US has played a positive role , and can continue to do so . 
This would be even more true if the US were to move toward immigration reform . 
El Salvador , together with Ecuador , leads the world in terms of the proportion of its population living abroad . 
It also has an economy that is not growing sufficiently to stem the ongoing tide passing through Mexico to the US . 
Stagnant growth and emigration are two of the main factors causing division in the Americas . 
South America is booming , as India and China swallow up its exports of iron , copper , soybeans , coffee , coal , oil , wheat , poultry , beef , and sugar . 
Its foreign trade and investment patterns are diversified and dynamic . 
With a few minor exceptions , migration is internal to the region , and a modus vivendi has been reached with the drug trade , mainly coca leaf and cocaine in Bolivia , Peru , and Colombia . 
Moreover , relations with the US , while important , are no longer paramount . 
South American governments can afford to disagree with the US , and often do . 
They have just elected a new president of the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) , whose headquarters are being built in Quito , Equador . 
As its name suggests , Unasur &apos;s main raison d &quot; être is to exclude Canada , the US , and Mexico ( in contrast to the Organization of American States ) . 
None of this holds true for Mexico , Central America , and the Caribbean islands - mainly the Dominican Republic , but eventually Cuba , too , and , in its own way , Haiti . 
These are not mineral-rich or bountiful agricultural nations : some coffee and bananas here , a little sugar and beef there , but nothing with which to sustain a boom . 
While Mexico is America &apos;s second-largest supplier of oil , this represents only 9 % of its total exports . 
Instead , these countries export low-value-added manufactured goods ( Mexico does more , of course ) , and live off remittances , tourism , and drug-transhipment profits . 
All of this is overwhelmingly concentrated on the US : that is where the migrants are , where the towels and pajamas are shipped , where the tourists come from , and where the drugs are bought . 
For these countries , including Mexico , stable , close , and productive relations with America are essential . 
Obama will say all the right things during his visit , and will be cheered everywhere . 
But he should ponder the shifts taking place in the hemisphere . 
One area is freeing itself from US hegemony and is thriving , but may founder if Chinese and Indian growth slows . 
Another is increasingly integrated with the US and Canada . 
Despite its current travails , it will discover a path to prosperity when the US does . 
Latin America as a single entity is no more . 
Long live Latin America .
