Life without Doha 
BRASILIA - In a recent commentary , I drew on the Interim Report of the High-level Trade Experts Group , appointed by the governments of Britain , Germany , Indonesia , and Turkey , which I co-chair , to explain why concluding the World Trade Organization &apos;s ten-year-old Doha Round was important . 
The column was reprinted on a blog maintained by CUTS International ( Consumer Unity and Trust Society ) , the most important developing-country NGO today , leading to an outpouring of reactions from trade experts . 
The faucet is still open , but the debate has already raised critiques that must be answered . 
Some critics rushed in to declare that Doha was dead - indeed , that they , being smart , had already said so years ago . 
Presumably , our attempt at resurrecting it was pathetic and hopeless . 
But , if Doha was dead , one had to ask why the negotiators were still negotiating , and why nearly all G-20 leaders were still issuing endorsements of the talks each time they met . 
Others argued that Doha was dead as negotiated . 
Or , in the words of former United States Trade Representative Susan Schwab , writing in Foreign Affairs , the Doha talks were &quot; doomed &quot; and ready for burial . 
However , these critics thought that one could pick at the corpse and salvage &quot; Plan B , &quot; though what was proposed in its many variants - always some minor fraction of the negotiated package to date - should more accurately be called Plan Z. 
It sounded like a great idea : better something than nothing . 
But , in multi-faceted talks that straddle several different sectors ( for example , agriculture , manufactures , and services ) and diverse rules ( such as anti-dumping and subsidies ) , countries have negotiated concessions with one another in various areas . 
Whatever balance of concessions has been achieved would unravel if we were to try to keep one set and let go of another . 
Indeed , as Stuart Harbinson , a former special adviser to WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy , has pointed out , the haggling over what should go into Plan B would be as animated and difficult as the haggling over how to complete the entire Doha package . 
Some of the critics are factually ill-informed . 
The Bhagwati-Sutherland Report amply documents that much has already been agreed upon in all the major areas . 
As Lamy has put it , nearly 80 % of the curry is ready ; we need only additional spices from the major players - India , the European Union , the US , Brazil , and China . 
These can be provided in politically palatable ways , which also means that the conclusion of Doha is within our reach , not beyond our grasp . 
But why bother to continue trying ? 
If Doha fails , some say , life will go on . 
That is true , of course , but that doesn &apos;t make this view any less na√Øve . 
If the Doha Round fails , trade liberalization would shift from the WTO to preferential trade agreements ( PTAs ) , which are already spreading like an epidemic . 
But , if PTAs were the only game in town , the implicit constraint on trade barriers against third countries provided by the WTO &apos;s Article 24 , which is weak but real , would disappear altogether . 
The WTO stands on two legs : non-discriminatory trade liberalization and uniform rule-making and enforcement . 
With the former eliminated , the most important institution of global free trade would be crippled . 
This would also affect the leg that survived , because the PTAs would increasingly take over the functions of rule-making as well . 
This already can be seen in PTAs whose rules on conventional issues like anti-dumping are often discriminatory in favor of members . 
It is also reflected in the increasing number of non-trade-related provisions being inserted into the PTA treaties proposed by the US and EU , a result of self-serving lobbies that seek concessions by weaker trading partners , without which free trade supposedly would amount to &quot; unfair trade . &quot; 
These rules are then advertised as &quot; avant garde , &quot; implying that the PTAs are the &quot; vanguard &quot; of new rules . 
As a result , the willingness of WTO members to invoke the Dispute Settlement Mechanism , the pride of the WTO - and , indeed , of international governance - would also be sapped . 
Tribunals established within PTAs would take over the business , leading to the atrophy , and eventual irrelevance , of the DSM . 
We can live without the Doha Round , but for many people it would not be much of a life . 
Now is no time for cynical complacency .
