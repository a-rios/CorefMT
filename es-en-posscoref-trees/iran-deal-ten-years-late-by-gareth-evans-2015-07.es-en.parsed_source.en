An Iran Deal Ten Years Late 
ROME - The only thing to lament about the agreement reached by Iran and the P5 + 1 ( the UN Security Council &apos;s five permanent members - China , Britain , France , Russia , and the United States - plus Germany ) in Vienna this month is that it was not signed and sealed a decade ago . 
In the years that it has taken for diplomatic sanity to prevail , the Middle East has endured myriad avoidable tensions and lost opportunities for security cooperation . 
From 2003 to 2006 , Iran made clear to anyone willing to listen that it would agree to all the key elements of the recent deal , including measures to block uranium and plutonium pathways to a bomb and obtrusive monitoring mechanisms to ensure ample advance notice of a likely breakout . 
All it needed in return - beyond , of course , the lifting of sanctions as implementation proceeded - was formal recognition of its &quot; right to enrich &quot; uranium . 
In discussions with the European Union in 2003-2004 , Iran voluntarily froze its then-minimal enrichment program , pending negotiation of a full accord . 
Iran also declared its willingness to apply the &quot; additional protocol , &quot; allowing for much more far-reaching and stringent monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency than is called for under standard arrangements . 
Those commitments ended in 2005 , owing to the continued insistence by the EU , backed by the US , that Iran abandon uranium enrichment entirely . 
This stance disregarded the &quot; inalienable right , &quot; clearly acknowledged in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( as much as one might wish otherwise , in an ideal world ) , of NPT parties to engage in all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle as part of a peaceful nuclear energy program . 
If , at that time , the West had been prepared to settle for effectively containing Iran &apos;s nuclear program , rather than destroying every last sensitive component of it , a deal would have been possible . 
I am confident , on the basis of many hours of productive dialogue with senior Iranian officials in Tehran , New York , and elsewhere , that this proposal could have broken the deadlock . 
It had all the right elements of an effective compromise . 
The Iranians were never going to accept what they perceived as second-class status under the NPT . 
It was only when US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration acknowledged that , and commenced direct back-channel talks in 2011 , that progress became possible . 
The key was the recognition that Iran &apos;s sense of honor had to be accommodated . 
Critics of the Vienna deal in the US Congress , Israel , and the Arab world tend to assume that Iran has no honor . 
They believe that Iran has always been hell-bent on building nuclear weapons , and that its leaders signed the deal , which imposes limits on the country &apos;s nuclear program for 15 years , only to relieve the enormous sanctions pressure now crushing its economy . 
Iran is biding its time , the critics charge , and will inevitably attempt to break out again . 
While no one should be under any illusion that Iran has been a model international citizen , or is likely to become one any time soon , this perception of the country &apos;s nuclear ambitions involves a fundamental misreading of the dynamics in play . 
My judgment , based on more dialogue with senior Iranian officials than most of the critics have conducted , is that Iran - whatever engineering research it may have carried out in the past , and whatever fuel-making and missile-delivery capabilities it may have developed more recently - has never been close to deciding actually to build nuclear weapons . 
Iran has always been keenly aware of the multiple risks involved in crossing that red line . 
It knows that it would face attack by a much more heavily armed Israel , whether supported by the US or not ; that Sunni powers in the region could move quickly to counter a &quot; Shia bomb &quot; with their own nuclear weapons ; and that additional crushing international sanctions could be imposed . 
And there is another factor that should not be instantly dismissed , as it usually is by cynical critics : Iranian leaders &quot; repeated strong rejection of weapons of mass destruction on religious grounds . 
The question , then , is why has Iran walked the precipice for so long by building a visible breakout capability bound to spook the West , Israel , and its Arab neighbors ? 
The answer , I believe , is overwhelmingly national pride - its peoples &quot; desire to demonstrate that Iran is a power to be reckoned with , a country that has impressive technical prowess , and that there are limits to its willingness to suffer international humiliation . 
Iranians vividly remember the overthrow , orchestrated by the CIA and British intelligence , of the elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953 . 
They remember the West &apos;s prolonged support for the hated Shah , and for Iraq in its brutal war with Iran in the 1980s , even after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein employed chemical weapons . 
It is understandable that many will not readily be persuaded of Iranian sincerity , not least because the national negotiating style - among moderates and hardliners alike - tends to be anything but frank and direct , with private reason often accompanied by public thunder that makes it hard to assess real intent . 
In fact , there is every reason to believe that the agreement captures and reflects the real interests not just of Iran , but also of the international community . 
It keeps intact a global non-proliferation regime that has been showing signs of falling apart , and gives new hope for wider regional security cooperation . 
Intelligent diplomacy beats brute force every time .
