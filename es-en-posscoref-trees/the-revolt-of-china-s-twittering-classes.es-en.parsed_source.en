The Revolt of China &apos;s Twittering Classes 
BEIJING - Last week , Liu Xiaobo was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China . 
That award comes at a crucial moment in Chinese politics , as it may well become a stepping stone on China &apos;s long march toward greater freedom . 
Yet few voices in mainland Chinese media are discussing Liu &apos;s Nobel Prize . 
The government &apos;s propaganda department has ordered major media to keep the news from spreading to the general public by imposing strict censorship . 
In fact , on CCTV &apos;s widely viewed 7 p.m. national newscast , not a word on Liu was mentioned on the day he received the prize . 
Despite this news blackout , China &apos;s blogosphere and microblogs exploded after Liu was announced as the winner . 
For example , on Sina &apos;s microblog site , bloggers used pictures , euphemisms , and English or traditional Chinese characters to avoid censorship . 
Twitter-style microblogging is extremely popular in China . 
Twitter.com was officially blocked last year , following the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown and the riots in Xinjiang that summer . 
Soon afterwards , its most famous Chinese clone , Fanfou.com , also was closed down , leaving one million registered users homeless . 
Nevertheless , although Twitter can be accessed in China only via proxy servers , it still plays a vital role in Chinese Internet life because of its ability to connect different news sources and social activists . 
Indeed , Twitter is the only place where people can talk freely about Liu &apos;s Nobel prize . 
A search of the hash tag &quot; # Liuxiaobo &quot; shows that relevant messages pop up hundreds of times per minute . 
More generally , Twitter has become a powerful tool for Chinese citizens as they increasingly play a role in reporting local news in their communities . 
But the social revolution brought by microblogging might be even more important than the communication revolution . 
Ever since Iranians used Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests against the stolen presidential election of June 2009 , there has been much discussion about the role of digital activism in authoritarian countries like China . 
Does Web 2.0 technology imply an analogous role for &quot; Twivolution &quot; in a Chinese democratic transition one day ? 
Twitter political activism in China challenges the simplistic yet widespread assumption that social media in the hands of activists can lead swiftly to mass mobilization and social change . 
Instead , these information-sharing tools and channels promote more subtle social progress . 
That subtlety reflects the distinction between macro-politics and micro-politics . 
Macro-politics is structural , whereas micro-politics is daily . 
Changes in the micro-political system do not necessarily lead to an adjustment in the macro structure , particularly in hyper-controlled political systems like China &apos;s . 
&quot; Micro-information &quot; and &quot; micro-exchange &quot; can push forward real change . 
Why is micro-power so important ? 
In the past , only a few highly motivated people engaged in political activism ; the masses took almost no initiative . 
Passionate people did not understand why the public seemed unconcerned about their efforts . 
Today , highly motivated people can lower the threshold for action so that people with less passion join their efforts . 
Currently , the Chinese Twittersphere has three prominent features : First , as China &apos;s rulers strengthen their censorship efforts , Twitter has become highly politicized . 
Moreover , Twitters brings opinion leaders together around one virtual table , attracting a lot of &quot; new public intellectuals &quot; and &quot; rights advocates , &quot; as well as veterans of civil rights movements and exiled dissidents . 
Its influence on Chinese cyberspace and traditional media is the result of this grouping . 
Finally , Twitter can be used as a mobilizing tool in China . 
Recent years have seen an explosion of activities indicating that Twitter has become the coordinating platform for many campaigns asserting citizens &quot; rights . 
With the proliferation of Twitter clones in China ( all the major portals now offer microblog services ) , social movements in China are getting a long-term boost . 
So Twitter has become a major tool to promote contentious politics in China . 
It can effectively link discourse and action , generate widespread campaigns , and forge common ground among rights activists , public intellectuals , and all kinds of Twitter users . 
In fact , a series of protests and events held since the second half of 2009 suggests a close relationship between Twitter and contentious real-life politics , and thus invites new possibilities for reshaping China &apos;s authoritarian regime .
