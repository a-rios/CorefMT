The Great Organ Bazaar 
LUND , SWEDEN - The Web site 88DB.com Philippines is an active online portal that allows service providers and consumers to find and interact with each other . 
Naoval , an Indonesian man with &quot; AB blood type , no drugs and no alcohol , &quot; wants to sell his kidney . 
Another man says , &quot; I am a Filipino . 
I am willing to sell my kidney for my wife . 
She has breast cancer and I can &apos;t afford her medications . &quot; 
Then there is Enrique , who is &quot; willing to donate my kidney for an exchange . 
21 years old and healthy . &quot; 
Other offers of this type could , just a few years ago , be found at www.liver4you.org , which promised kidneys for $ 80,000- $ 110,000 . 
The costs of the operation , including the fees of the surgeons - licensed in the United States , Great Britain , or the Philippines - would be included in the price . 
All of this Internet activity is but the tip of the iceberg of a new and growing global human-tissue economy . 
Indeed , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has estimated that about 10 % of organ transplants around the world stem from purely commercial transactions . 
Trade in organs follows a clear , geographically linked pattern : people from rich countries buy the organs , and people in poor countries sell them . 
In my research on organ trafficking , I have entered some of these shadow markets , where body parts from the poor , war victims , and prisoners are commodities , bought or stolen for transplant into affluent ill people . 
One woman , originally from Lebanon , told me that a wealthy businessman from Spain paid a huge sum for her kidney . 
In the end , however , she received no monetary payment . 
Today , her life is much worse than before , because medical complications following the operation make it difficult for her to work . 
Similar stories are told by organ vendors I have met from the former Soviet states , the Middle East , and Asia . 
Organ trafficking depends on several factors . 
One is people in distress . 
They are economically or socially disadvantaged , or live in war-torn societies with prevalent crime and a thriving black market . 
On the demand side are people who are in danger of dying unless they receive an organ transplant . 
Additionally , there are organ brokers who arrange the deals between sellers and buyers . 
It is also necessary to have access to well-equipped clinics and medical staff . 
Such clinics can be found in many countries , including Iran , Pakistan , Ukraine , South Africa , and the Philippines . 
Indeed , the Philippines is well known as a center of the illegal organ trade and a &quot; hot spot &quot; for transplant tourism . 
From the 1990 &quot; s until 2008 ( when a new policy was adopted ) , the number of transplantations involving organ sales by Filipinos to foreign recipients increased steadily . 
Many organ sellers from Israel , for example , were , together with their buyers , brought to Manila for the transplants . 
Hector is one of the several hundred cases of kidney vendors documented by social workers in three impoverished towns in the Philippines &quot; Quezon province . 
His brother was trapped in Malaysia with high debts to criminal gangs , so Hector sold his kidney in order to buy his freedom . 
Another vendor , Michel , became a broker himself ; after selling one of his kidneys to pay for his father &apos;s medicines , the surgeon forced him to deliver more organs . 
The vendors &quot; organs were transplanted to recipients mainly from the Philippines , Israel , Japan , South Korea , and Saudi Arabia . 
Trade in humans and their bodies is not a new phenomenon , but today &apos;s businesses are historically unique , because they require advanced biomedicine , as well as ideas and values that enhance the trade in organs . 
Western medicine starts from the view that human illness and death are failures to be combated . 
It is within this conceptual climate - the dream of the regenerative body - that transplantation technology develops and demand for biological replacement parts grows . 
One of the more obvious manifes Â­ tations of treating the human body as a resource to be mined is the hospital waiting list , used in many countries . 
A man I interviewed recently for a study of Swedes who had been on the waiting list , but who decided to purchase kidneys abroad , described to me his trip to Pakistan for the transplant : &quot; I &apos;m not the kind of man who uses other people , but I had to . 
I had to choose between dying and getting back my life ! &quot; 
In an era of transplants on demand , there is no way around this dilemma . 
The biological imperatives that guide the priority system of transplant waiting lists are easily transformed into economic values . 
As always where demand exceeds supply , people may not accept waiting their turn - and other countries and other peoples &quot; bodies give them the alternative they seek .
