Philosophy on Top 
MELBOURNE - Last year , a report from Harvard University set off alarm bells , because it showed that the proportion of students in the United States completing bachelor &apos;s degrees in the humanities fell from 14 % to 7 % . 
Even elite universities like Harvard itself have experienced a similar decrease . 
Moreover , the decline seems to have become steeper in recent years . 
There is talk of a crisis in the humanities . 
I don &apos;t know enough about the humanities as a whole to comment on what is causing enrollments to fall . 
Perhaps many humanities disciplines are not seen as likely to lead to fulfilling careers , or to any careers at all . 
Maybe that is because some disciplines are failing to communicate to outsiders what they do and why it matters . 
Or , difficult as it may be to accept , maybe it is not just a matter of communication : Perhaps some humanities disciplines really have become less relevant to the exciting and fast-changing world in which we live . 
I state these possibilities without reaching a judgment about any of them . 
What I do know something about , however , is my own discipline , philosophy , which , through its practical side , ethics , makes a vital contribution to the most urgent debates that we can have . 
I am a philosopher , so you would be justified in suspecting bias in my view . 
Fortunately , I can draw on an independent report by the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute ( GDI ) , a Swiss think tank , to support my claim . 
GDI recently released a ranked list of the top 100 Global Thought Leaders for 2013 . 
The ranking includes economists , psychologists , authors , political scientists , physicists , anthropologists , information scientists , biologists , entrepreneurs , theologians , physicians , and people from several other disciplines . 
Yet three of the top five global thinkers are philosophers : Slavoj Žižek , Daniel Dennett , and me . 
GDI classifies a fourth , Jürgen Habermas , as a sociologist , but the report acknowledges that he , too , is arguably a philosopher . 
The only Global Thought Leader in the top five not involved in philosophy is Al Gore . 
There are more economists in the top 100 than thinkers from any other single discipline , but the top-ranking economist , Nicholas Stern , ranks tenth overall . 
Can it really be true that four of the world &apos;s five most influential thinkers come from the humanities , and 3-4 from philosophy ? 
To answer that question , we have to ask what GDI measures when it compiles its ranking of Global Thought Leaders . 
GDI aims to identify &quot; the thinkers and ideas that resonate with the global infosphere as a whole . &quot; 
The infosphere from which the data are drawn may be global , but it is also English-language only , which may explain why no Chinese thinker is represented in the top 100 . 
There are three eligibility requirements : one has to be working primarily as a thinker ; one must be known beyond one &apos;s own discipline ; and one must be influential . 
The ranking is an amalgam of many different measurements , including how widely the thinkers are watched and followed on YouTube and Twitter , and how prominently they feature in blogs and in the wikisphere . 
The outcome indicates each thinker &apos;s relevance across countries and subject areas , and the ranking selects those thinkers who are most talked about and who are triggering wider debate . 
The rankings will no doubt vary from year to year . 
But we have to conclude that in 2013 a handful of philosophers were particularly influential in the world of ideas . 
That would not have been news to the Athenian leaders who considered what Socrates was doing to be sufficiently disturbing to put him to death for &quot; corrupting the youth . &quot; 
Nor will it be news to anyone familiar with the many successful efforts to bring philosophy to a broader market . 
There is , for example , the magazine Philosophy Now , and equivalents in other languages . 
There are the Philosophy Bites podcasts , many blogs , and free online courses , which are attracting tens of thousands of students . 
Perhaps the growing interest in reflecting on the universe and our lives is the result of the fact that , for at least a billion people on our planet , the problems of food , shelter , and personal security have largely been solved . 
That leads us to ask what else we want , or should want , from life , and that is a starting point for many lines of philosophical inquiry . 
Doing philosophy - thinking and arguing about it , not just passively reading it - develops our critical reasoning abilities , and so equips us for many of the challenges of a rapidly changing world . 
Perhaps that is why many employers are now keen to hire graduates who have done well in philosophy courses . 
More surprising , and more significant still , is the way in which taking a philosophy class can change a person &apos;s life . 
I know from my own experience that taking a course in philosophy can lead students to turn vegan , pursue careers that enable them to give half their income to effective charities , and even donate a kidney to a stranger . 
How many other disciplines can say that ?
