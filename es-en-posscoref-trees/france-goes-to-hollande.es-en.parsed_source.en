France Goes to Hollande 
PARIS - France has now conducted its ninth presidential election under direct universal suffrage . 
And , for the first time in 17 years , after three consecutive defeats , the left - embodied in the Socialist candidate , François Hollande - will return to Élysée Palace . 
Indeed , the first implication of this unquestionably significant election is that it confirms a return to stability . 
France is the largest country in Europe to have so much trouble finding its balance . 
Its revolution in 1789 initiated a long period of profound instability , featuring two empires , three monarchies , and five republics . 
The French have gone through 13 constitutions in less than 200 years . 
At 54 years old , the current Fifth Republic is the second longest-lasting regime since the revolution . 
At times , there has been talk of a Sixth Republic , which would address limited but real concerns and difficulties . 
But voter turnout in the latest presidential election ( 80 % in the first round , and 81 % in the second round ) leaves no doubt : our current system is strong , and we French are attached to it . 
But the primary importance of the election result is the left &apos;s return to power for only the second time in 31 years . 
In fact , when François Mitterand was elected in 1981 , the left had been out of power since 1957 . 
Back then , the Communist Party was still powerful , and maintained close ties with the Soviet Union . 
The prospect that the Party could come to power in an electoral alliance with the Socialists struck fear in opponents . 
The Socialists , for their part , had not yet shed their intellectual skin . 
Mitterand &apos;s political program was a hymn to economic planning , and the free market was still , for him , synonymous with oppression . 
Today , there is no longer international communism , or , for that matter , French communism . 
We remember having seen the left govern without drama . 
Its two passages to power - ten years under Mitterand and five years with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin - forced the left to reconcile with reality . 
France &apos;s international reputation was not damaged , and , at home , the left &apos;s performance , especially concerning unemployment , compared well with that of other governments . 
So , there will be no panic this time . 
On the contrary , the left &apos;s return to power appears to be an entirely normal , almost trivial , example of alternation in government . 
In fact , Hollande &apos;s victory was underpinned not by a leftward shift among the electorate , but by voters &quot; rejection of Nicolas Sarkozy . 
Indeed , the result represents a stunning and historic defeat : during the Fifth Republic , three sitting presidents - Charles de Gaulle , Mitterrand , and Jacques Chirac - have been reelected after their first term in office . 
Only Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , weakened by the long decline of Gaullism , was not . 
The rejection of Sarkozy is very different ; above all , it is a matter of style . 
There remains a type of royalism among the French , and our constitution has many features of an elective monarchy . 
With his over-familiarity , simplicity , and occasional vulgarity , Sarkozy undermined the dignity of his sacred function . 
Moreover , in substantive terms , Sarkozy &apos;s tax policies , in particular , favored the upper classes and the wealthy . 
So a powerful combination of social and economic anger emerged , particularly given the perception that the excessive greed of financiers and bankers was the primary cause of the crisis that erupted in 2008 , and that still menaces us today . 
A social and political correction was necessary , and it has occurred with a vengeance unique to France . 
But the state &apos;s coffers are dangerously depleted , and France now finds itself among the many countries whose debt burden compromises the eurozone &apos;s existence . 
Thus , it is now subject to the discourse of economic orthodoxy , which , in insisting that all debts be paid to the penny , ignores that public spending is also an engine of growth . 
Just how much will actually have to be repaid ? 
With Germany as the primary exponent of orthodoxy , the debate has raged on . 
But now we see that austerity has plunged Greece , Portugal , and especially Spain and Italy deeply into recession . 
The president of the European Central Bank , as well as the International Monetary Fund , acknowledge the gravity of the problem . 
But what happens if we refuse to accept Germany &apos;s position ? 
The victory of Hollande , who has said that he wants to &quot; renegotiate &quot; the European Union &apos;s new , German-backed &quot; fiscal compact , &quot; will weigh heavily in this debate . 
Furthermore , the Socialists now control not only the presidency and the government , but also a majority in the Senate , all of the regional presidencies , 55 % of the country &apos;s departments , and most major cities &quot; town halls . 
In less than two months , they may control a majority of the National Assembly as well , implying a concentration of power that has never before been seen in modern France . 
The Socialists can govern without limits , so it is up to them to govern well . 
It is this uncertainty that hovers over the future of France , if not that of Europe .
