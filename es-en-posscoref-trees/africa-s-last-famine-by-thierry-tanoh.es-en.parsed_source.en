Africa &apos;s Last Famine 
WASHINGTON , DC - Last year , the international community recognized one of the worst humanitarian tragedies of recent times unfolding in the Horn of Africa , and moved in to ameliorate the widespread famine there . 
Now , poor rains , crop shortages , and continuing conflict could cause millions to be plunged back into life-threatening levels of hunger and malnutrition . 
Emergency assistance is crucial in this fragile time ; but it is not enough . 
Only if the agricultural sector &apos;s fundamental inadequacies are addressed can the region truly escape famine &apos;s blight . 
Africa is endowed with 60 % of the world &apos;s unused arable land and millions of dedicated farmers . 
They simply need the tools , infrastructure , and competence to unlock the continent &apos;s tremendous agricultural potential . 
There is no reason - and no excuse - to leave the survival of millions to unpredictable weather conditions . 
Rather , countries must take control by drastically improving efficiency and productivity . 
To be sure , progress has been made . 
Some African governments have reduced regulatory barriers to private-sector investment in agriculture . 
And some are implementing risk-management and hedging tools to shield farmers from drought and flood , and poor consumers from the food-price volatility that such disasters cause . 
For example , the Global Index Insurance Facility insures Kenyan farmers against drought or excessive rainfall . 
Such initiatives foster the flow of resources into agriculture - both for the agribusinesses needed to feed Africa &apos;s growing cities , and for smallholders who need better seeds , fertilizer , and market roads . 
Although more developed regions have been taking such measures , they are not yet standard practice in Africa . 
The continent &apos;s agricultural sector is further hindered by low skills , a dearth of innovation , weak infrastructure , little funding , and lack of access to land , land titles , and lender security . 
But , given the right tools , all of these problems are solvable . 
For example , in order to finance reform , local banks need incentives to expand credit . 
That could mean access to specialized credit bureaus and rating agencies , risk-sharing facilities targeting smallholders , and advisory services to provide capacity-building and education . 
These banks also need direct support . 
For example , the International Finance Corporation is investing $ 25 million in Zambia National Commercial Bank to increase access to finance for small-scale entrepreneurs and rural agribusiness companies , which account for a significant share of Zambia &apos;s economic output . 
Moreover , innovative financing techniques - such as structured trade finance , warehouse receipt finance , and supplier finance - are already in place or being developed . 
Under the Global Warehouse Receipt Program , for example , farmers may use produce stored in depositories as collateral for loans . 
Smallholder farm-mechanization models are also needed to improve efficiency and increase yields . 
Farmers could be grouped together to pool their production and negotiate a favorable offtake agreement to monetize future sales , then use the receipts to lease equipment , such as tractors . 
Water is another major constraint on food production in some regions . 
Most affected countries are working to increase supply by developing new sources of ground and surface water , using wastewater from nearby urban areas , harvesting rainwater , or reusing agricultural drainage . 
Meanwhile , some countries are focusing on reducing demand , through improved management and innovative agricultural techniques , such as precision and drip irrigation . 
Africa also needs better infrastructure in order to boost food output . 
Limited access to electricity means that cold storage is lacking ; poorly maintained roads slow down old vehicles ; and inefficient ports often leave food to rot on the docks . 
Production is meaningless if fresh products do not make it to market in good condition and at a reasonable cost . 
Finally , Africa &apos;s transformation into an agricultural powerhouse must be based on inclusiveness and environmental sustainability . 
Investments should ensure an equitable division of benefits between producers and consumers , and include smallholder participation and linkages to markets for inputs and outputs . 
And investors must account for the interests of host countries , local communities , and the environment - an approach that is both good and good business . 
Long-term food security in Africa is possible . 
In fact , it is only the first step on the road to a booming agricultural export sector for Africa . 
By acting now , African and international leaders can ensure not only the continent &apos;s food security , but also a prosperous , inclusive economy .
