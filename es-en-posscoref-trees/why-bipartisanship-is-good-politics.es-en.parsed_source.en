Why Bipartisanship is Good Politics 
LONDON - Bipartisanship seems to have taken a drubbing in Washington since President Barack Obama got to the White House . 
Like most recent American presidents , Obama campaigned on a promise to work with his political opponents for the greater good of the country . 
Bill Clinton said much the same thing before he was elected , and then spent his first term in a knockdown fight with Newt Gingrich &apos;s Republican majority in Congress , and his second term fighting off impeachment . 
George W. Bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him . 
Obama already appears to have gone further in the pursuit of bipartisanship than his predecessors . 
His selection of Republicans for key posts - including retaining Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense - has raised a few eyebrows among his supporters . 
But , above all , he has tried hard to secure Republican support for his efforts to prevent the economy from disappearing into a deep recessionary hole . 
Only three maverick Republican Senators went along with Obama &apos;s proposals to get the plan accepted . 
And in the House of Representatives , the Republicans unanimously rejected every amendment , every compromise , and every courtesy that he offered . 
Some commentators suggest that Obama made a bad mistake . 
First , he promised bipartisanship , but got heavily rebuffed . 
Second , he and his administration were so busy trying to build consensus that they watered down some of the vital ingredients of the stimulus package , and failed to defend it robustly from Republican attack . 
There may sometimes be a downside in trying to woo your opponents . 
When they are plainly wrong , why let them off the hook ? 
Here we have had Republicans criticizing an increase in America &apos;s budget deficit after doubling America &apos;s national debt in the Bush presidency &apos;s eight years . 
Moreover , Republicans &quot; belief that only tax cuts , not public spending , will delivery recovery is a sad example of blinkered ideology . 
But there are more positive reasons for Obama effort at bipartisanship . 
In any democratic system of checks and balances , leaders usually require coalitions in order to get what they want done . 
Moreover , a consensual style is good politics . 
Most voters - certainly swing voters , who usually decide elections - do not like partisan battles as much as some politicians and their supporters do . 
After all , the wise , the moderate , and the floating voter do not switch on the radio to listen to archconservatives like the American broadcaster Rush Limbaugh . 
When things get tough in politics , as will happen in most of the world as we struggle with the impact of the global recession , every sensible government will try to hang on to the benefit of doubt . 
Citizens know that running a country , especially in a time like this , is tough . 
They are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism , if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone . 
They bridle at a government that must do unpopular things and that also looks narrow and mean-spirited . 
There is also a lot to be said for making political argument more civil . 
But he did so without ever seeming to despise his opponents or disparage their intentions . 
Obama &apos;s aides have confessed that he modeled his own election program on the sunny and optimistic decency of the Republican actor . 
Civility in politics is not simply political confectionery . 
A leader who respects his or her opponents is more likely to earn respect himself than one who doubts their patriotism and resents their criticism . 
One reason for the widespread respect felt for Nelson Mandela is that years of imprisonment did not embitter him . 
Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech , take seriously the views of his critics , and defend their right to disagree with him . 
His role in establishing enduring democracy in India , despite the tensions of caste , ethnicity , religion , and regional loyalties , made him one of the towering figures of the twentieth century . 
So my own hope is that Obama will not be dissuaded from trying to work with his opponents , to build consensus , and to deal courteously even with those whose views he may thoroughly dislike . 
Personally , I do not think that those whose philosophy deplores the whole idea of government , except when it is required to bail out businesses or banks , and who purport to offer a better future by stitching together the shreds and tatters of policies that helped produce today &apos;s economic disaster , will have much respect or support from voters . 
Even in Washington , there is not much to be said for being partisan , unpopular , and wrong .
