China Should Import Deflation 
BEIJING - With China &apos;s inflation - and inflation expectations - rising , how can price stability be maintained without threatening the country &apos;s booming growth ? 
Reconciling growth and fighting inflation is not impossible , but it does require that the government overcome its deep-seated suspicion of opening China &apos;s markets to imports . 
The World Bank predicts 3.5 % growth for the world economy this year , and most analysts predict that the United States will grow at a similar pace . 
As a result , external demand for China &apos;s exports will be strong , while the interest-rate differential between China and the world &apos;s advanced economies is resulting in massive capital inflows . 
Thus , China will continue to accumulate large foreign-exchange reserves this year . 
As a result , the Chinese authorities are now deploying a combination of tools to stabilize domestic prices . 
With the reserve ratio of banks already at 19.5 % and unlikely to be raised by a large margin , interest rates will most likely continue to be raised . 
Indeed , the benchmark interest rate reached 7.47 % in August 2008 , after a five-year climb . 
Given today &apos;s current lending rate of 5.56 % , the authorities have a great deal of upside room . 
But raising interest rates has its downside : higher capital inflows , which will offset the disinflationary effect of higher borrowing costs . 
As a result , it is reasonable to expect that Chinese authorities will soon tighten controls on capital flows . 
Foreign governments and international markets would like to see China fight inflation by letting the renminbi appreciate in value . 
To the extent that the renminbi becomes more expensive , appreciation would discourage the influx of foreign capital . 
Appreciation will help China &apos;s fight against inflation only if it brings down China &apos;s trade surplus . 
That is why some economists believe that China should take much bolder steps toward allowing the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate to strengthen . 
For Chinese officials , however , this is out of the question , because it would almost certainly cause large-scale unemployment and thus threaten social stability , which is closely tied to the government &apos;s legitimacy . 
Because the main inflation-fighting tools are double-edged swords , the Chinese authorities are likely to turn to other measures . 
For one , they will likely introduce quantity controls on bank lending , though the effects of such regulations are diminishing because banks and other financial institutions have developed a range of ways to circumvent them . 
A more effective measure is to expand the central bank &apos;s sterilization operations . 
In theory , the People &apos;s Bank of China can sterilize any amount of money supply caused by foreign-capital inflows simply by issuing the requisite amount of bonds . 
In practice , the PBOC faces two kinds of costs . 
The first cost is a direct accounting loss : the interest rate will inevitably increase when more bonds are issued . 
At the same time , the interest rate paid on the central bank &apos;s foreign reserves , mostly in dollar-denominated US Treasuries , is low . 
The second cost is implicit , but potentially far more substantial : because sterilization bonds are forced savings ( and deflationary by definition ) , they absorb the potential investment and consumption implied by today &apos;s trade surplus . 
For example , banks would curtail mortgage lending in response to higher rates paid on sterilization bonds , forcing consumers to save more in order to buy houses . 
So more bonds today would deter domestic investment and consumption tomorrow . 
Thus , the PBOC &apos;s sterilization operations are likely to be self-defeating in the long run . 
The Bank sterilizes the money supply caused by today &apos;s trade surplus , but in the meantime causes further current-account surpluses in the future . 
So China &apos;s authorities must find new ways to address its external-imbalance problem . 
One way might be to increase consumer imports . 
Right now , consumer goods account for only 2.3 % of China &apos;s imports , as they are subject to relatively high tariffs and value-added or sales taxes at customs , where procedures are complicated and slow . 
Lowering the tariffs on consumer goods and simplifying customs procedures would improve consumer welfare while causing no significant harm to domestic industry . 
To see why , consider potential imports from the US , most of which are likely to be brand-name products , furniture , high-end cars , and land-intensive agricultural products ( such as beef ) . 
China has a comparative advantage in none of these areas . 
Unlike exports , higher imports of consumer goods would thus help China combat inflation . 
Moreover , increased imports would reduce China &apos;s trade surplus and help balance China &apos;s external position , which would be much welcomed by the international community . 
In short , a policy aimed at increasing imports would serve several important goals - and poses little or no risk to economic growth . 
There is no good reason why the Chinese authorities should reject such an effort .
