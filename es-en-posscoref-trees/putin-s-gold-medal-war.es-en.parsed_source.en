Putin \ u0027s Gold-Medal War 
LONDON - What does the &quot; Olympics War , &quot; otherwise known as Russia &apos;s invasion of Georgia , really mean ? 
The war itself was , of course , predicable and predicted . 
Its results are equally clear . 
First , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin remains in unambiguous charge in Moscow . 
He may play a &quot; good cop-bad cop &quot; routine with President Dmitri Medvedev . 
But the bad cop , Putin , is the real boss . 
Second , Putin cannot stand Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , who admittedly is not an easy man to like . 
The Russian thought the Georgian had become too big for his boots . 
He waited for Saakashvili to go a step too far , and then came down on him and his poor country like a ton of bricks . 
Third , Russia has been stirring up trouble in South Ossetia and Abkhazia for years . 
Moscow wants to keep Georgia weak . 
It plays the same game in Transdniestria to undermine Moldova . 
If an outsider had tried similar tactics in Chechnya , the Russians would rightly have howled with rage . 
Fourth , today &apos;s Russian leaders , like nineteenth-century Czars , want a sphere of influence around their borders . 
So far as they are concerned , the countries that were once part of the Russian empire in the Soviet Union should enjoy only limited sovereignty . 
The message being transmitted from Georgia to Ukraine and the Central Asian Republics is heard very loudly . 
Russia has in particular opposed its neighbors joining NATO . 
What is NATO against , the Russians ask ? 
Where is NATO &apos;s front line ? 
Are we Russians really the enemy ? 
If so how should we react ? 
Russia &apos;s actions have had the reverse effect to what was presumably intended ; the invasion of Georgia has made a powerful case for further NATO enlargement . 
Fifth , Georgia itself provides an important link to Caspian energy for all those Europeans who do not want to be totally dependent on pipelines controlled by Russia . 
Indeed , Georgia is Russia &apos;s choke point in its policy of using oil and gas as strategic foreign policy weapons , which it has done repeatedly . 
The Swedish Defense Research Agency has reported that out of 55 deliberate gas supply interruptions , explicit threats , or coercive price actions by Russia since 1991 , only 11 had nothing to do with politics . 
America has reacted strongly - at least verbally - to Russia &apos;s attack on its neighbor , in which the Russian army moved in first and made things safe for the Russian-backed unofficial South Ossetian militias to burn and pillage Georgian property . 
But America is not in a strong position to go any further . 
Its moral authority has been compromised in the Bush years , it cannot put more troops on the ground to defend Georgian sovereignty , and , even if it could , doing so would escalate the crisis . 
America &apos;s position is further weakened in the absence of a strong and united European response . 
But you can forget about seeing that . 
Russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy , Europe is all mouth . 
Russia has pushed Europe around for years on energy issues , cutting bilateral deals with the bigger countries and opposing efforts to create a common European energy policy . 
Europe certainly needs Russian gas . 
But Russia needs European consumers , and sooner rather than later it will seek more European investment in energy exploration and extraction . 
No sensible person in Europe wants to revive the Cold War . 
But it is not the European Union that is being provocative . 
It is not Germany , France , and Italy that are invading their neighbors . 
We Europeans seem to have forgotten our history . 
There were other times when we have stood by while a militaristic European power insisted that it had the right to intervene wherever it wanted to advance the interests of those who claimed shared ethnicity from the Baltics to the Caucasus . 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy claims to have brought peace to Georgia . 
Yet it looks suspiciously as though the deal that ended the fighting will leave Russian troops in that truncated country for years . 
So what , exactly , will Europe do ? 
Perhaps initially Europeans should be cautious . 
But I doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiqu√©s will ever be employed . 
Will we stop talking about our allegedly shared values with Russia ? 
Will we press the pause button on further discussion of how to integrate Russia fully into the international community ? 
Will we cut off some of our contacts with Russia , reconsider its membership of the G8 , or delay its entry to the WTO and OECD ? 
Will we put to the side for the time being negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Russia ? 
I suspect that the answer to each of these questions is a resounding &quot; no . &quot; 
It will be business pretty much as usual as Europeans prepare cheerfully in the years ahead for the Winter Olympics in Sochi , just up the road from the Russian missiles and tanks on Georgian soil . 
Meanwhile , Europeans will continue to talk about their crucial role in world affairs . 
It is enough to make even the cynical shake their heads in disbelief . 
You could not make it up . Europe &apos;s approach is weak and will cause bigger problems in the future . 
So Putin wins the gold medal in his favorite event - bullying his smaller neighbors .
