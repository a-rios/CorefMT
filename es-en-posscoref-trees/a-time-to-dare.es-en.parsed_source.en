A Time to Dare 
NEW YORK - The upcoming G-20 meeting is a make-or-break event . 
Unless it introduces practical measures to support the countries at the periphery of the global financial system , global markets will suffer another round of decline , just as they did after United States Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner &apos;s failure in February to produce practical measures to recapitalize America &apos;s banking system . 
The current financial crisis is different from all the others we have experienced since World War II . 
On previous occasions , whenever the financial system came to the brink of a breakdown , the authorities got their act together and pulled it back from the brink . 
This time the system actually broke down in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers &quot; collapse last September , and it had to be put on artificial life support . 
Among other measures , both Europe and the US have effectively guaranteed that no other important financial institution will be allowed to fail . 
This step was necessary , but it produced unintended adverse consequences : many other countries , from Eastern Europe to Latin America , Africa , and Southeast Asia , could not offer similarly convincing guarantees . 
Abetted by the determination of national financial authorities at the center of the world economy to protect their own institutions , capital fled from the periphery . 
Currencies fell , interest rates rose , and credit default swaps soared . 
When the history of this crisis is written , it will be recorded that - in contrast to the Great Depression - protectionism first prevailed in finance rather than trade . 
The International Financial Institutions ( IFIs ) are now faced with a novel task : to protect the periphery countries from a storm that emanated from the center . 
They are used to dealing with governments ; now they must learn to deal with the collapse of the private sector . 
If they fail to do so , the periphery economies will suffer even more than those at the center . 
Countries on the periphery tend to be poorer and more dependent on commodities than the more developed world , and they must repay more than $ 1.4 trillion in bank loans in 2009 alone . These loans cannot be rolled over without international assistance . 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown recognized the problem and placed it on the G-20 &quot; s agenda . 
But , in the course of preparations , profound attitudinal differences have surfaced , particularly between the US and Germany . 
The US has recognized that only using the credit of the state to the fullest extent possible can reverse the collapse of credit in the private sector . 
Germany , traumatized by the memory of hyperinflation in the 1920 &quot; s and the consequent rise of Hitler in the 1930 &quot; s , is reluctant to sow the seeds of future inflation by incurring too much debt . 
Both positions are firmly held and can be buttressed by arguments that are valid from the point of view of the country concerned . 
But the controversy threatens to disrupt the April 2 meeting . 
It should be possible for each side to respect the other &apos;s position without abandoning its own 
As things stand now , the G-20 meeting will produce some concrete results : the resources of the International Monetary Fund are likely to be effectively doubled , mainly by using the mechanism of the New Arrangement to Borrow ( NAB ) , which can be activated without resolving the vexing question of reapportioning voting rights in the IFIs . 
This will be sufficient to enable the IMF to come to the aid of specific countries in trouble , but it will not provide a systemic solution without conditionality . 
Such a solution is readily available in the form of Special Drawing Rights ( SDR ) . 
The mechanism exists and has already been used on a small scale . 
SDRs are highly complicated and difficult to grasp , but they boil down to the international creation of money . 
Countries that are in a position to create their own money do not need them , but the periphery countries do . 
Rich countries should therefore lend their allocations to the countries in need . 
This would not create a budget deficit for rich countries . 
Recipient countries would have to pay the IMF a very low interest rate : the composite average treasury bill rate of all convertible currencies . 
They would have free use of their own allocations , but the IFIs would supervise how the borrowed allocations are used to ensure that the borrowed funds are well spent . 
It is difficult to think of a scheme where the cost / benefit ratio is so favorable . 
In addition to the one-time increase in the IMF &apos;s resources , there ought to be substantial annual SDR issues , say , $ 250 billion , as long as the global recession lasts . 
To make the scheme counter-cyclical , the SDR issues could be callable in tranches when the global economy overheats . 
It is too late to agree on issuing SDRs at the upcoming G-20 meeting , but if it were proposed by President Barack Obama and endorsed in principle by the majority of participants , it would be sufficient to give heart to the markets and make the meeting a resounding success .
