Why Greece is Different 
BRUSSELS - The seemingly interminable negotiations between the new Greek government and its international creditors - the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission - on a new loan deal have entered a dangerous phase . 
At this point , a mistake on either side threatens to trigger the kind of accident that could precipitate a new crisis in Europe . 
The IMF seems ready to throw in the towel - not least because of the recent revelation that Greece could post a small primary budget deficit ( which excludes interest payments ) this year , rather than the planned sizeable surplus . 
But , with Greece &apos;s economy tanking again , its government is convinced that the current repayment program is not working - and that , in the absence of significant adjustments , it never will . 
Fundamental to Greece &apos;s case for new bailout terms is the narrative - reinforced by its current economic travails - that it has been a victim of excessive austerity . 
But this neglects a crucial fact : austerity worked in Europe &apos;s other crisis-hit countries . 
Indeed , Portugal , Ireland , Spain , and even Cyprus are showing clear signs of recovery , with unemployment finally falling ( albeit slowly and from high levels ) and access to capital markets restored . 
Why is Greece different ? 
The short answer is exports . 
In all of the other crisis-hit countries ( and , indeed , in most of the dozens of countries that have received IMF loans in recent decades ) , rising exports offset , at least partly , the hit that demand took when their governments slashed spending and raised taxes to balance their books . 
Of course , in a large economy where external financing is not a problem , as in the United States or the eurozone , attempting to reduce a budget deficit could conceivably lead to such a large decline in demand ( and thus tax revenues ) that austerity becomes self-defeating . 
But this argument does not apply to Greece . 
In fact , Greece was running very large current-account deficits - exceeding 10 % of GDP - when external financing dried up suddenly in 2008-2009 , forcing an adjustment in domestic spending . 
If the Greek government had not made such an adjustment , domestic demand and employment would certainly have remained higher - but so would imports and large external deficits . 
So , while austerity did cause a deep recession , it enabled Greece to avoid large external deficits , thereby reducing the size of the bailout the country needed . 
Export performance is thus the key to escaping the austerity trap . 
The problem for Greece is that what little export growth it has experienced lately is largely illusory , as it has come mostly from petroleum products . 
Since Greece does not produce oil , this can mean only that Greek refiners , which now have considerable excess capacity , are simply exporting imported crude oil in a slightly different form . 
With refinery margins typically less than 5 % , the economy is gaining little added value from these exports . 
Other exports that have increased , such as metals , raise a similar problem . 
Moreover , Greece &apos;s largest services export , maritime shipping , has few real links with the rest of the economy , given that companies in the sector pay no taxes and employ few Greeks ( the crews hail from low-wage countries ) . 
Undermining the sector &apos;s economic contribution further is the fact that global commodity prices , on which shipping rates depend , have lately been declining . 
Meanwhile , manufactured goods , which do add domestic value and employment , form only a small share of Greece &apos;s overall exports . 
In fact , Greece &apos;s total foreign trade , if properly measured , amounts to only 12 % of its GDP , much less than what one would expect from such a small economy . 
More jarring is the fact that Greece &apos;s total trade deficit ( including both goods and services ) , was even higher in 2008 , amounting to 13 % of GDP , implying that , in order to avoid a subsequent decline in imports and thus in domestic demand , exports would have had to more than double . 
In Portugal , by contrast , the trade deficit amounted to only about one-third of exports in 2008 , meaning that exports had to increase by one-third to close the external deficit , without reducing imports . 
Since then , Portugal has increased exports cumulatively by more than one-quarter , so that , despite a slight increase in imports since 2007 , it runs a trade surplus . 
To be sure , Greece &apos;s trade deficit has declined , but only because imports collapsed . 
Meanwhile , exports stagnated , even as wages declined by more than 20 % . 
That , not austerity , is Greece &apos;s real problem . 
If Greece had experienced the same growth in exports as Portugal ( a country of similar size and per capita income ) , it would not have experienced such a deep recession , and tax revenues would have been higher , making it much easier for the government to achieve a primary budget surplus . 
This suggests that a combination of fiscal consolidation , lower wages , and export-oriented reforms could have enabled Greece to move toward a sustainable recovery . 
This approach has been tried before , and it has failed only once , when Argentina had to default on its foreign debt in 2002 and break a decade-long 1 : 1 peg to the US dollar . 
Unfortunately , Greece resembles Argentina in two key respects . 
Both countries have only a small export sector , which makes external adjustment much more difficult ; and both have an export structure that is skewed toward commodities , the supply of which is unlikely to change much , even as structural reforms are pursued or wages decline . 
Of course , this does not mean that Greece is doomed to follow in Argentina &apos;s footsteps toward default . 
But it does highlight the challenge that the country faces today - namely , to rebuild its export sector from the ground up . 
It is time for Greece &apos;s government to recognize this imperative and expand the scope of negotiations with its creditors to include not just the budget , but also strategies for stimulating exports . 
But , first , Greece must finally recognize that austerity is not the enemy .
