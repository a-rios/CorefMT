Felipe Calderón &apos;s Two Faces 
MEXICO CITY - Mexican President Felipe Calderón has finally gotten what he wanted : the resignation of United States Ambassador Carlos Pascual . 
Calderón shot the messenger for delivering bad news through confidential cables released by WikiLeaks . 
Pascual &apos;s harsh assessments of the &quot; war on drugs &quot; that Calderón unleashed four years ago infuriated the president . 
The revelations also annoyed the Mexican army , for they pointed out that the military frequently doesn &apos;t act on intelligence provided by the US , and displays a strong aversion to risk . 
Moreover , Pascual &apos;s candid assessments described a dysfunctional situation in which Mexican security agencies fight each other more than they fight organized crime . 
Essentially , Pascual was forced to leave for describing a reality that Calderón does not want to face , and that his government would prefer to ignore . 
In other words , he lost his job for doing it properly . 
But the stubborn truth revealed by the US diplomat emerges every day , despite the impact of drug kingpins who are arrested , the number of weapons discovered , or the amount of cocaine seized . 
Mexico is not winning the &quot; war &quot; against drug trafficking and organized crime : Pascual &apos;s forced resignation cannot hide the 34,000 dead , the growing number of Mexicans addicted to drugs , the surge in kidnappings and executions , and widespread impunity . 
The official narrative is that violence is an inevitable consequence of taking on the drug cartels . 
But other countries have managed to prevent drug gangs from unleashing their fury on innocent civilians . 
And , while Mexicans are told that the violence is only between rival gangs , executions transcend the realm of drug trafficking . 
Citizens are exhorted by their government to denounce criminals , though 98.5 % of criminal investigations are never solved . 
A recent poll showed that 59 % of Mexicans believe that the government is losing the war that it declared , while only 23 % support the government &apos;s current course . 
As Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War , all wars entail deception . 
Mexico has become its latest victim . 
The Mexican government has not been sufficiently honest about the scale of the challenges that it faces , the measures that it has taken , and the level of US support , involvement , and collaboration that it has sought . 
Therein lie the contradictions , evasiveness , and lack of transparency regarding the terms on which Calderón &apos;s war is being conducted . 
Everyone on his team demands that the US devote more attention and resources to Calderón &apos;s effort , but publicly denies doing so when evidence of heightened US presence in Mexico becomes public . 
In recent weeks , the Calderón administration has twisted itself into knots trying to explain how and why it authorized US drone planes to fly over Mexican territory for intelligence-gathering purposes . 
And yet , while Calderón insists that the US assume its bilateral responsibilities , he also demands the US Ambassador &apos;s head for revealing his own tactical and strategic mistakes in the war he insists on prosecuting . 
Calderón &apos;s contradictory stance is rooted in the reflexive habits of a Mexican political class trained to gain points by kicking the US . 
Calderón , too , has sought refuge behind the folds of the Mexican flag and in diatribes about sovereignty under siege . 
In other words , Calderón accuses the US of intervention , even as he assiduously seeks it . 
He criticizes the US for meddling , after his government promoted that meddling . 
Pascual is accused of behaving like a &quot; Proconsul , &quot; after Mexican authorities - due to incompetence or irresponsibility - assigned him that role . 
In a recent interview , Calderón lambasted Pascual for his &quot; ignorance , &quot; after the ambassador sent incontrovertible cables describing the real situation on the ground . 
They &apos;re painful to read , but difficult to refute . 
Rather than shooting the messenger , Calderón should reflect on the message itself , and rethink not only the war but the terms on which he has decided to wage it . 
The cables should lead Calderón to rectify a strategy that so far has increased the level of violence without decreasing drug trafficking . 
The &quot; success &quot; of the war needs to be measured by the reduction in its toll of violence . 
Moreover , Pascual &apos;s conclusions should force Calderón to redefine Mexico &apos;s relationship with the US in a more honest fashion . 
Because if all of this does not happen , Calderón &apos;s ability to force out the US ambassador , and any short-term political gain he obtained in doing so , will be irrelevant . 
Indeed , after the &quot; ugly American &quot; has packed his bags , Ciudad Juárez will still be the most dangerous city in the world . 
The homicide rate in the country will continue to soar , and public security agencies will remain incapable of preventing , detecting , or punishing the vast majority of violent events that have placed the country on edge . 
The Mexican government will continue to request US aid in a surreptitious fashion , and deny doing so when it becomes public . 
The message is clear . 
One does not have to read Carlos Pascual &apos;s leaked cables to understand that .
