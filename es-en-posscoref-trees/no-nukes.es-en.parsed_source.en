No Nukes ? 
NEW YORK - When parts of Japan were devastated recently by an earthquake and subsequent tsunami , news of the human toll was quickly overshadowed by global fears of radioactive fallout from the Fukushima Daichi nuclear power plant . 
The concern was understandable : radiation is very frightening . 
I grew up in Denmark at a time when fear of nuclear power was pervasive . 
But our latest nuclear fears have broader implications , especially for energy supply and our desire to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels . 
It is difficult to step back at the time of a natural disaster to gain a broader perspective ; even attempting to do so can feel crass . 
But there are some facts that we should not overlook . 
During the round-the-clock coverage of the nuclear drama , the specter of Chernobyl has been raised repeatedly . 
It is worth noting that the worst nuclear disaster in history directly caused only 31 fatalities . 
The World Health Organization estimates that 4,000 deaths could be linked to the disaster over 70 years , whereas the OECD projects a range of 9,000-33,000 deaths during this period . 
That is substantial . 
But consider that , according to the OECD , every year nearly one million people die from fine-particle outdoor air pollution . 
Yet this massive death toll provokes no discernible fear in the developed world , and receives virtually no news coverage . 
Of course , every country with nuclear power facilities should revise its safety measures in light of the Japanese disaster , which raised obvious questions about the sites chosen for such facilities . 
Clearly , plants located near tsunami-prone areas need to be reconsidered , and some countries have power plants in disturbingly close proximity to seismic faults - and to large cities . 
But while America &apos;s commitment to nuclear power was quickly reaffirmed by President Barack Obama , some European governments took the knee-jerk decision to freeze all new nuclear-energy projects immediately , and , in the case of Germany , not to extend the life of existing reactors . 
For Germany , this will leave a gap that it cannot fill with alternative energy sources , leaving it little choice but to rely more heavily on coal power . 
We see coal as a polluting but reasonably &quot; safe &quot; energy source compared to nuclear energy . 
Yet , in China alone , coal-mining accidents kill more than 2,000 people each year - and coal is a leading cause of smog , acid rain , global warming , and air toxicity . 
As a result of Germany &apos;s decision , its annual carbon emissions are now expected to rise by as much as 10 % - at a time when European Union emissions are rising as the continent shakes off the effects of the financial crisis . 
Germany doesn &apos;t have a low-carbon alternative if it shutters its nuclear plants , and the same is true of most other countries . 
Alternative energy sources are too expensive and nowhere near reliable enough to replace fossil fuels . 
Although safety concerns are paramount right now , the construction of new nuclear plants faces another hurdle : they are very expensive . 
New nuclear power plants have high up-front costs ( which can be politically challenging ) , including a very complicated , slow , and fraught planning process . 
When completed , the total cost of nuclear power is significantly higher than the cheapest fossil-fuel source . 
And society must bear significant additional costs in terms of the risks of spent-fuel storage and large-scale accidents . 
Moreover , in most parts of the world where energy consumption is expanding , nuclear proliferation is an issue . 
Then there is the question of maintaining existing plants . 
Decommissioning nuclear reactors may make us feel safer , but we should acknowledge that this will often mean compensating for the lost output with more reliance on coal , meaning more emissions that contribute to global warming , and more deaths , both from coal extraction and air pollution . 
Moreover , given that the plants are already paid for , waste facilities are already in place , and the high decommissioning cost will have to be paid regardless of timing , the actual operating costs are very low - half or lower per kilowatt-hour than the cost of the cheapest fossil fuels . 
The long-term answer is more research and development - not only into next-generation , safer nuclear energy , but also into energy sources like solar and wind , which currently provide well below 1 % of the planet &apos;s energy . 
Alarmingly , this research has decreased over the last three decades . 
At protests calling on politicians to respond to climate change , a cry has rung out : &quot; No coal , no gas , no nukes , no kidding ! &quot; 
The harsh reality - thrown into stark relief by the Japanese disaster - is that we do not yet have the luxury of dumping coal , gas , and nuclear power . 
Until we can find a feasible alternative , reducing reliance on one of them means that another must take its place .
