Putin of all the Russias 
VIENNA  -  
His actions this week show that he is Russia &apos;s new autocrat . 
He is a Czar pure and simple . 
The seven years since Putin assumed power in the Kremlin have been a time of conflicting signals . 
On one hand , he appears to be an educated and dynamic leader committed to modernizing Russia . 
On the other hand , with the help of the military-industrial KGB complex - the &quot; siloviki &quot; - he has systematically weakened or destroyed every check on his personal power , while strengthening the state &apos;s ability to violate citizens &quot; constitutional rights . 
This week , Putin told the United Russia party that he will place his name at the top of its ballot for the parliamentary election scheduled for December 2 , which could enable him to become Russia &apos;s new prime minister after the presidential election due in March 2008 . 
Of course , as he put it , Russia will have to elect as president a &quot; decent , competent , effective , modern person with whom it would be possible to work in tandem . &quot; 
If this scenario comes true , it will be a sad day for Russia , but not because Putin will be retaining power - something everyone in Russia knew that he would . 
True , Putin has concentrated in his own hands more decision-making authority than at any time in Russia &apos;s post-Soviet history . 
Poll after poll puts his approval ratings at more than 70 % . 
Putin , quite genuinely , holds contradictory views . 
He simultaneously advocates multiparty democracy and centralized power . 
He favors a free economy , but wants the state to control how wealth is allocated and who benefits from it . 
Like their president , most Russians see no contradiction between improving their personal lives and the country &apos;s international status since the 1990 &quot; s and the erosion of democratic institutions . 
Of course , Russia &apos;s formal institutions of democracy remain in place ; but , in the absence of a free press , an independent judiciary and free elections in the regions - where Kremlin cronies , like Ramzan Kadyrov in Chechnya , now hold sway - they have been hollowed out . 
Russians would rather have a &quot; father of the nation , &quot; no matter the title - czar , general secretary , president , or prime minister - than follow laws and rules . 
Putin &apos;s political genius is to have recognized this . 
Even if Putin has found a way to retain power without amending the constitution - a possibility that was endlessly speculated about by Russia &apos;s dwindling band of democrats - the undemocratic nature of his strategy is glaringly obvious . 
Moving from one high office in the Kremlin to another in the White House ( the seat of the Russian Parliament ) is merely a technicality . 
Putin will be czar no matter what office is formally his own . 
What will make this work is that , like any good KGB man , Putin is a master of facades . 
It has been said that presidential democracy only strengthens Russian political culture &apos;s tendency to favor rulers with a &quot; strong hand , &quot; whereas a parliamentary system would allow for a more &quot; horizontal &quot; distribution of power . 
So any future Prime Minister Putin will be able to say - hey , I rule under the ultra-democratic Italian parliamentary model . 
What could be more democratic ? 
But if Putin , who has spent seven years &quot; verticalizing &quot; power in order to restore the stability and pride lost during Yeltsin &apos;s &quot; democratization &quot; of Russia , really wanted to secure the good of his country , he would follow in Yeltsin &apos;s footsteps and exit the scene . 
Only democratic systems and free markets provide the essential signals that a government needs in order to act efficiently . 
After all , the good of democratic structures is their predictability . 
Only the Russians , with their devotion to the rule of a strongman , still insist on the importance of the role of personality in history . 
By contrast , successful democracies believe that nobody is irreplaceable . 
After September 11 , 2001 , many New Yorkers wanted the city &apos;s then Mayor Rudy Giuliani to remain in office . 
So , if Putin is concerned about Russia , he should abandon his czarist notions of power and leave high office , if not politics altogether . 
Like other democratic leaders , he might consider working in the private-sector , like Gerhard Schr√∂der , or , better yet , write books and help Tsunami victims , like Bill Clinton or become an environmentalist , like Mikhail Gorbachev . 
But this seems to be too much to ask of ex-KGB man Putin , for whom there can be no distinction between losing power and leaving it gracefully .
