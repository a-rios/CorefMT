Holocaust Denial , Nuclear Denial 
What connects Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions and Holocaust denial ? 
With equal fervor , Iran &apos;s president , Mahmoud Ahmedinejad , defends his country &apos;s right to develop its nuclear capacity ( though denying that his country seeks nuclear weapons ) and challenges decades of Holocaust research . 
How should Ahmedinejad &apos;s denial that Iran intends to pursue nuclear arms be judged in light of his Holocaust denial ? 
Journalists ask , but Ahmedinejad won &apos;t answer . 
His argument is that Iran does not want nuclear weapons , and would not use them to duplicate a crime that did not happen . 
Some westerners , while lamenting Ahmedinejad &apos;s insensitivity , have struggled to minimize the significance of his Holocaust denial as the fulminations of a misguided fanatic ( as if misguided fanaticism were an incidental quality in a nation &apos;s president ) . 
This misses the point . 
Holocaust denial is not an argument about the past . 
The point of Holocaust denial is to remove the taboo now associated with the original crime . 
For deniers , the problem is not that the Holocaust occurred , but that most people still consider it to be a bad thing . 
Thus , Auschwitz is dismissed as a &quot; detail of history , &quot; in the telling phrase of the French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen . 
What Holocaust deniers seek most is to undo the idea that Nazi crimes should have any impact on current international relations or on global notions of morality . 
Ahmedinejad made this point repeatedly in interviews with western media and in long letters to US President George W. Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 
He has even done the math : sixty years have indeed passed since the Holocaust ended , five times the actual period of Nazi rule in Germany . 
So , it is time , he wrote Merkel , to &quot; make the shadow of World War II disappear . &quot; 
Unsurprisingly , he has Israel in mind . 
But Ahmedinejad &apos;s obsession with Israel blinds him to any understanding of what actually happened across Europe during WWII - and to the fact that present-day Europe was constructed over the six decades since then as a response to this historical disaster . 
In writing to Merkel , he is addressing the leader of a country decimated by Nazi rule - millions dead , an entire society and economy reduced to rubble . 
Had she been politically active during the Nazi times , Merkel would have landed in a concentration camp . 
Yet Ahmedinejad , referring to Europe &apos;s response to the Holocaust , asks her to imagine &quot; what standing some European countries could have had and what global role they could have played , if it had not been for this 60-year-old imposition . &quot; 
Germany does not seem to have done too badly in these 60 years , but consider the core of this &quot; imposition &quot; : the effort to give enduring political expression to the moral concepts of good and evil that the Nazis tried to invert . 
As a policy , the Holocaust was premised on denial - the physical denial of any legitimate religious , racial , or political difference within Nazi Germany . 
The means of this denial were the annihilation of offending populations - the Jews foremost among them - in a merciless attempt at social purification . 
The intent of the crime was so ambitious , and its scope so great , that a new word - genocide - was coined to describe it . 
Modern media played a role , too , broadcasting images of the death camps that immediately came to symbolize the depth of Nazi depravity . 
The enduring impact of the Holocaust , explored in hundreds of books and films , was to portray Nazism as the ultimate expression of evil . 
In this context , to deny the Holocaust is to reject its modern association with evil , and implies that what happened during the Holocaust could be accommodated under a different moral order . 
Ahmedinejad argues that outside pressure , not the actual historical experience of total war , keeps the memory of the Holocaust alive in Europe . 
What he doesn &apos;t understand is that the memory of Auschwitz is also the memory of the Battle of Britain , the bombing of Dresden , the occupation of Paris , and the Warsaw uprising . 
Auschwitz did not occur in a vacuum . 
It was the furthest extreme of a disaster that incorporated all these other events . 
If the Holocaust did not happen , or if it has no meaning , then how is the rest of modern European history to be understood ? 
If there were no crimes , then the Nazis were not criminals . 
Ahmedinejad feels the power that comes with re-writing history . 
He enjoys taunting the West with the past that he denies . 
He understands the temptation of evil , the lure of forgetfulness . 
Above all , he is a practical man . 
It does Ahmedinejad no good for Europe to maintain a sense of history that must put it at cross purposes with Iran . 
Ahmedinejad &apos;s purpose is simple : find the weak spots in the chain that links Europe to its past and , through this past , to Israel and the US . 
Europe &apos;s choice is equally clear : to accept absolution for this past from the president of Iran , or to determine whether the standard of truth that he applies to history is the same as he applies to nuclear weapons .
