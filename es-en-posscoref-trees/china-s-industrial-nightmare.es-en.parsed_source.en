China &apos;s Industrial Nightmare 
The Western media have a habit of going on feeding frenzies . 
Ironically , when it comes to China , the latest frenzy concerns food itself . 
The execution this week of the former head of China &apos;s State Food and Drug Administration ( SFDA ) , Zhen Xiaoyu , who accepted almost $ 1 million in bribes , shows that the frenzy has now seeped into China as well . 
First came a spate of stories about pet food laced with melamine ( a coal derivative ) , cough medicine and toothpaste adulterated with diethylene glycol ( a sweet-tasting industrial chemical used in anti-freeze and brake fluid ) , toy trains decorated with lead-based paints , bacteria-infected antibiotics , exploding cell phone batteries , and defective car tires . 
Now , attention has now turned to food . 
The world press is filled with stories about honey laced with industrial sweeteners , canned goods contaminated by bacteria and excessive amounts of additives , rice wine braced with industrial alcohol , and farm-raised fish , eel , and shrimp fed large doses of antibiotics and then washed down with formaldehyde to lower bacterial counts . 
In response , China &apos;s government acted almost instantly . 
The General Administration of Quality and Supervision , Inspection , and Quarantine conducted a survey and reported that nearly one-fifth of all products made in China for domestic use did not measure up to safety and quality standards . 
At the same time , regulators increased inspections , closed down some 180 food manufacturers and now post the names of violators on their Web site . 
Moreover , not only was Zhen Xiaouyu executed , but Cao Wenzhuang , who was in charge of drug registration at the SFDA , was sentenced to death for accepting roughly $ 300,000 in bribes from drug manufacturers . 
Both verdicts were doubtless calculated , as a famous Chinese proverb puts it , to &quot; kill some chickens in order to scare the monkeys . &quot; 
But why does this surprise us ? 
After all , &quot; capitalism with Chinese characteristics &quot; has been a chaotic free-for-all for some time . 
Roughly 75 % of China &apos;s food is now produced by small , private , and un-licensed operations that are difficult to regulate . 
With little knowledge of China &apos;s tectonic changes , foreigners have been investing , buying , trading , and extravagantly praising its amazing , but hell-bent , &quot; economic boom . &quot; 
Fear of &quot; China bashing &quot; has made it difficult for so-called &quot; friends of China &quot; to discuss its darker side openly . 
The Chinese people themselves , however , have been far from unaware that the purity of their food , medicine , water , and air is in doubt . 
The xiadao xiaoxi ( back alley news ) has long been replete with rumors of things going awry . 
One small-time operation ground up sheet-rock and put it in gel-caps to sell as medicine . 
A peasant village raided a hospital dumpster to reclaim discarded surgical equipment , wash it in a nearby canal , re-package it in sealed plastic saying &quot; sterilized , &quot; and sell it back to the hospital at cut-rate prices . 
It has not helped , of course , that the Communist Party loathes a free press and a robust civil society , both of which are essential information feedback loops in ensuring any country &apos;s well-being . 
Nor has it helped that China &apos;s regulatory agencies lag far behind the growth of its economy . 
For example , the Beijing office of China &apos;s State Environmental Protection Administration has less than 300 employees , whereas the United States Environmental Protection Administration has over 17,000 . 
China &apos;s mad rush toward fuqiang ( wealth and power ) has given it little chance to develop all the compensatory institutions that any truly developed , not to say enlightened , society needs to achieve equilibrium and social health . 
But in today &apos;s globalized world , where national boundaries have morphed into synapses for myriad kinds of uncontrollable interactions , each country &apos;s problems have become everyone &apos;s problem . 
So , before we in the West becomes too censorious of China &apos;s quality control problems , we should remember our complicity in making China the world &apos;s industrial park and global dumping ground for many toxic industries . 
While we may lament the loss of manufacturing jobs through &quot; outsourcing , &quot; we certainly do not lament exporting massive amounts of pollution to China . 
China may come to rue the wanton eagerness with which it has embraced industrialization . 
Already , the Chinese are beginning to awaken from the infatuation with development that besieged them as they began to emerge from the commodity-starved Cultural Revolution . 
In a world of scarcity , more always seemed better . 
But now , just as the West began to understand decades ago that the natural environment has limits , China is showing the first signs of entering a post-industrial phase . 
So , rather than simply shutting our doors to Chinese products , we might contemplate helping China by opening the doors of our regulatory agencies to Chinese regulators . 
To do so would actually help ourselves .
