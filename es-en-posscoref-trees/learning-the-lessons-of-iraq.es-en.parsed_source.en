Learning the Lessons of Iraq 
NEW YORK - The Iraq war has been replaced by the declining economy as the most important issue in America &apos;s presidential election campaign , in part because Americans have come to believe that the tide has turned in Iraq : the troop &quot; surge &quot; has supposedly cowed the insurgents , bringing a decline in violence . 
The implications are clear : a show of power wins the day . 
It is precisely this kind of macho reasoning that led America to war in Iraq in the first place . 
The war was meant to demonstrate the strategic power of military might . 
Instead , the war showed its limitations . 
Moreover , the war undermined America &apos;s real source of power - its moral authority . 
Recent events have reinforced the risks in the Bush administration &apos;s approach . 
It was always clear that the timing of America &apos;s departure from Iraq might not be its choice - unless it wanted to violate international law once again . 
Now , Iraq is demanding that American combat troops leave within twelve months , with all troops out in 2011 . 
To be sure , the reduction in violence is welcome , and the surge in troops may have played some role . 
Yet the level of violence , were it taking place anywhere else in the world , would make headlines ; only in Iraq have we become so inured to violence that it is a good day if only 25 civilians get killed . 
And the role of the troop surge in reducing violence in Iraq is not clear . 
Other factors were probably far more important , including buying off Sunni insurgents so that they fight with the United States against Al Qaeda . 
But that remains a dangerous strategy . 
The US should be working to create a strong , unified government , rather than strengthening sectarian militias . 
Now the Iraqi government has awakened to the dangers , and has begun arresting some of the leaders whom the American government has been supporting . 
The prospects of a stable future look increasingly dim . 
That is the key point : the surge was supposed to provide space for a political settlement , which would provide the foundations of long-term stability . 
That political settlement has not occurred . 
So , as with the arguments used to justify the war , and the measures of its success , the rationale behind surge , too , keeps shifting . 
Meanwhile , the military and economic opportunity costs of this misadventure become increasingly clear . 
Even if the US had achieved stability in Iraq , this would not have assured victory in the &quot; war on terrorism , &quot; let alone success in achieving broader strategic objectives . 
Things have not been going well in Afghanistan , to say the least , and Pakistan looks ever more unstable . 
Moreover , most analysts agree that at least part of the rationale behind Russia &apos;s invasion of Georgia , reigniting fears of a new Cold War , was its confidence that , with America &apos;s armed forces pre-occupied with two failing wars ( and badly depleted because of a policy of not replacing military resources as fast as they are used up ) , there was little America could do in response . 
Russia &apos;s calculations proved correct . 
Even the largest and richest country in the world has limited resources . 
The Iraq war has been financed entirely on credit ; and partly because of that , the US national debt has increased by two-thirds in just eight years . 
But things keep getting worse : the deficit for 2009 alone is expected to be more than a half-trillion dollars , excluding the costs of financial bail-outs and the second stimulus package that almost all economists now say is urgently needed . 
The war , and the way it has been conducted , has reduced America &apos;s room for maneuver , and will almost surely deepen and prolong the economic downturn . 
The belief that the surge was successful is especially dangerous because the Afghanistan war is going so poorly . 
America &apos;s European allies are tiring of the endless battles and mounting casualties . 
Most European leaders are not as practiced in the art of deception as the Bush administration ; they have greater difficulty hiding the numbers from their citizens . 
The British , for example , are well aware of the problems that they repeatedly encountered in their imperial era in Afghanistan . 
America will , of course , continue to put pressure on its allies , but democracy has a way of limiting the effectiveness of such pressure . 
Popular opposition to the Iraq war made it impossible for Mexico and Chile to give into American pressure at the United Nations to endorse the invasion ; the citizens of these countries were proven right . 
But back in America , the belief that the surge &quot; worked &quot; is now leading many to argue that more troops are needed in Afghanistan . 
True , the war in Iraq distracted America &apos;s attention from Afghanistan . 
But the failures in Iraq are a matter of strategy , not troop strength . 
It is time for America , and Europe , to learn the lessons of Iraq - or , rather , relearn the lessons of virtually every country that tries to occupy another and determine its future .
