Let the Negotiations Begin 
Having successfully integrated ten new members in May - including eight former communist countries with significantly lower levels of economic development - some argue that the EU should stop there . 
But drawing a line under the enlargement process would be both a missed opportunity for the EU and a cruel blow to those countries in the Balkans and elsewhere for whom the prospect of membership is an important incentive for reform and renewal . 
Greece knows this very well . 
It was our belief in Europe as a catalyst for peace and prosperity that led us to support Turkey &apos;s EU aspirations . 
When the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( PASOK ) government launched its policy of Greek-Turkish rapprochement during my tenure as foreign minister , many people were suspicious of mending ties with an old enemy . 
Changing entrenched attitudes could not happen overnight : it required a step-by-step process of confidence-building measures , from the grassroots level to the heights of political power . 
Five years later , the results speak for themselves . 
Greece and Turkey have signed eighteen mutually beneficial agreements in areas ranging from trade and energy , to environmental protection and the fight against organized crime . 
There is no denying that strong bilateral ties are good for Greece &apos;s economy and security . 
But our proactive policy of rapprochement was not designed merely to serve national interests . 
It was part of a regional vision to promote stability from the Balkans to the Middle East . 
As a result , Greece and Turkey cooperated in humanitarian efforts in Kosovo and undertook a joint peace mission to Israel and Palestine . 
Greece and Turkey also worked together to prevent the war in Iraq from spilling over into neighboring countries . 
Greek-Turkish rapprochement has created the framework for closer relations between Turkey and the EU . 
As a progressive party , PASOK has every interest in Turkey &apos;s progress on democratic reforms . 
That is why we have always supported a real rather than &quot; virtual &quot; European candidacy for Turkey - with full rights , but also with full responsibilities for completing the domestic reforms that have so far been implemented as a result of Turkey &apos;s enhanced &quot; Accession Partnership &quot; with the EU . 
Turkey &apos;s governing Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) was elected on a pro-European platform , reflecting the public &apos;s demand for modernization and democratization . 
The biggest obstacles to membership are Turkey &apos;s record on human and minority rights and the inordinate power of the military . 
Clear EU benchmarks and targets for reform will help , but it is now up to the AKP government to show the necessary political will to fulfill its membership obligations . 
However , Turks are all too aware of the passions that their country &apos;s EU candidacy stokes in Europe . 
Several EU leaders have claimed that Turkish membership would spark a wave of migration and strain the European economy . 
Others see no place for a Muslim country in Europe . 
None of these objections is persuasive . 
If properly managed , migration can enhance Europe &apos;s cultural wealth and meet its labor-market needs , as fertility rates in the EU fall and its population ages . 
Immigrants come to Europe in large measure because Europe needs them . 
At the same time , to deny Turkey a European future on religious grounds is to deny our Union &apos;s diversity . 
Democracy is a universal value , not the property of specific religions . 
Moreover , welcoming a country like Turkey will send a positive signal to the Muslim world . 
It will allay the growing tensions between Christianity and Islam fueled by international terrorism and knee-jerk nationalism . 
Unlike the &quot; war on terrorism , &quot; European integration can serve as a model for resolving the underlying crises of the Middle East and addressing the roots of violence in the wider region . 
In particular , the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul could be a great example of peaceful coexistence among Christians and Muslims . 
For Orthodoxy , the Ecumenical Patriarchate is in many ways the equivalent of Mecca . 
Allowing the Patriarchate to flourish , and reopening the Theological School on the island of Halki , would underscore Turkey &apos;s progress on human and minority rights . 
Turkey should view the Patriarchate not as a threat , but as an important asset Â­ - a bridge to Europe . 
Similarly , Cyprus &apos;s entry into the EU , coupled with Turkey &apos;s EU aspirations , has created a unique catalyst for tearing down the &quot; Berlin Wall &quot; that runs through the capital , Nicosia , separating the island &apos;s Christian and Muslim communities . 
If Turkey is serious about joining the European family , it must recognize the Republic of Cyprus - like any other member state . 
A road map must be drawn up for the withdrawal of Turkish troops from Cyprus and a settlement of the political division of the island . 
At Helsinki in December 1999 , the EU agreed that Turkey must resolve its differences with its neighbors peacefully by the end of 2004 , within the framework of EU and international law ; otherwise , any outstanding dispute would be settled at the International Court of Justice . 
The time has now come for the EU to assess Turkey &apos;s progress on these issues and for Turkey to fulfill its obligations . 
As negotiations proceed in the years ahead , it is in the international community &apos;s interest to support Turkey &apos;s European future , while making a constructive contribution to end the division of Cyprus , so that the progress we have achieved is not lost . 
From religious and ethnic conflict , Europe can once again forge a model of peaceful cooperation - this time by creating an integrated zone of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean .
