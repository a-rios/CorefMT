The Scientific Road to Copenhagen 
BERLIN - On June 10 , 1859 , six months before Charles Darwin published his Origin of Species , the physicist John Tyndall demonstrated a remarkable series of experiments at the Royal Institution in London . 
The meeting was chaired by Prince Albert . 
But neither he , nor Tyndall , nor anyone in their distinguished audience could possibly have anticipated the extent to which the experiments &quot; results would preoccupy the world 150 years later . 
This month , thousands of people from all over the world , including many heads of state , will gather in Copenhagen to try to forge an agreement to drastically cut atmospheric emissions of an invisible , odorless gas : carbon dioxide . Despite efforts by some leading countries to lower expectations ahead of the conference about what can and will be achieved , the meeting is still being called the most important conference since World War II . And at the conference &apos;s heart are the results of Tyndall &apos;s experiments . 
But the story starts even before Tyndall , with the French genius Joseph Fourier . 
An orphan who was educated by monks , Fourier was a professor at the age of 18 , and became Napoleon &apos;s governor in Egypt before returning to a career in science . 
In 1824 , Fourier discovered why our planet &apos;s climate is so warm - tens of degrees warmer than a simple calculation of its energy balance would suggest . 
The sun brings heat , and earth radiates heat back into space - but the numbers did not balance . 
Fourier realized that gases in our atmosphere trap heat . 
He called his discovery l &apos;effet de serre - the greenhouse effect . 
It was Tyndall who then put Fourier &apos;s ideas to the test in his laboratory . 
He proved that some gases absorb radiant heat ( today we would say long-wave radiation ) . 
One of these gases was CO2 . 
In 1859 , Tyndall described the greenhouse effect in beautifully concise words : &quot; The atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat , but checks its exit ; and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet . &quot; 
Then , in 1897 , Svante Arrhenius , who earned a Nobel Prize for chemistry six years later , calculated how much global warming a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere would cause . 
His answer was 4-6 degrees Celsius ( a little more than the 2-4 degrees that modern studies consistently find ) . 
Arrhenius was not in the least troubled by the prospect of global warming . 
Perhaps because he was Swedish , he proposed setting coal mines on fire to speed it up , since he thought a warmer climate was an excellent idea . 
But it was all just theory in Arrhenius &apos;s time , since nobody had measurements to prove that CO2 levels in the atmosphere were in fact increasing . 
That changed only in the late 1950 &quot; s , when Charles Keeling started to measure CO2 with unprecedented accuracy in Antarctica and on Mauna Loa in Hawaii , far away from any sources . 
By 1960 , he was able to prove that CO2 was indeed on the rise . 
It then took only a few years until , in 1965 , an expert report - the first of many - to US President Lyndon B. Johnson warned of global warming : &quot; By the year 2000 , the increase in carbon dioxide will be close to 25 % . 
This may be sufficient to produce measurable and perhaps marked changes in climate . &quot; 
In 1972 , a more specific prediction was made in the leading science journal Nature , namely that temperatures would warm by half a degree Celsius by 2000 . 
And , in 1979 , the US National Academy of Sciences issued a stark warning of impending global warming . 
We did not have to wait until 2000 to find these predictions were correct : by the 1980 &quot; s , global warming became apparent in temperature measurements from weather stations around the world . 
In 1988 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) was founded to analyze the issue in more detail , and in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro world leaders signed a historic treaty : the Framework Convention on Climate Change . 
Its goal : &quot; stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . &quot; 
Unfortunately , little has been achieved in the 17 years since then . 
In fact , CO2 emissions from fossil fuels were almost 40 % higher in 2008 relative to 1990 . 
And even the rate at which emissions are increasing is now three times higher than in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Global temperatures had already risen by 0.5 ºC above preindustrial levels by the early 1990 &quot; s , and another 0.3ºC have been added to that since the Rio Earth Summit . 
And they keep rising . 
Most countries now agree that global warming should be stopped at a maximum of two degrees centigrade . 
But this has become an extremely tough challenge , as growth in greenhouse-gas emissions and atmospheric stocks accelerated in the years since Rio . 
That is why Copenhagen is so important : it may well be our last to address climate change before it addresses us . 
Tyndall &apos;s measurements 150 years ago showed that carbon dioxide traps heat and causes warming . 
And , 50 years ago , Keeling &apos;s measurements showed that CO2 levels are increasing . 
In the meantime , earth &apos;s climate has been heating up , as predicted . How much more proof do we need before we act ?
