Ten Reasons for Europe 
PARIS - The euro , many now believe , will not survive a failed political class in Greece or escalating levels of unemployment in Spain : just wait another few months , they say , the European Union &apos;s irresistible collapse has started . 
Dark prophecies are often wrong , but they may also become self-fulfilling . 
Let &apos;s be honest : playing Cassandra nowadays is not only tempting in a media world where &quot; good news is no news &quot; ; it actually seems more justified than ever . 
For the EU , the situation has never appeared more serious . 
It is precisely at this critical moment that it is essential to re-inject hope and , above all , common sense into the equation . 
So here are ten good reasons to believe in Europe - ten rational arguments to convince pessimistic analysts , and worried investors alike , that it is highly premature to bury the euro and the EU altogether . 
The first reason for hope is that statesmanship is returning to Europe , even if in homeopathic doses . 
It is too early to predict the impact of François Hollande &apos;s election as President of France . 
But , in Italy , one man , Mario Monti , is already making a difference . 
Of course , no one elected Monti , and his position is fragile and already contested , but there is a positive near-consensus that has allowed him to launch long-overdue structural reforms . 
It is too early to say how long this consensus will last , and what changes it will bring . 
But Italy , a country that under Silvio &apos;s Berlusconi &apos;s cavalier rule was a source of despair , has turned into a source of real , if fragile , optimism . 
A second reason to believe in Europe is that with statesmanship comes progress in governance . 
Monti and Hollande have both appointed women to key ministerial positions . 
Marginalized for so long , women bring an appetite for success that will benefit Europe . 
Third , European public opinion has , at last , fully comprehended the gravity of the crisis . 
Nothing could be further from the truth than the claim that Europe and Europeans , with the possible exception of the Greeks , are in denial . 
Without lucidity born of despair , Monti would never have come to power in Italy . 
In France , too , citizens have no illusions . 
Their vote for Hollande was a vote against Sarkozy , not against austerity . 
They are convinced , according to recently published public-opinion polls , that their new president will not keep some of his &quot; untenable promises , &quot; and they seem to accept this as inevitable . 
The fourth reason for hope is linked to Europe &apos;s creativity . 
Europe is not condemned to be a museum of its own past . 
Tourism is important , of course , and from that standpoint Europe &apos;s diversity is a unique source of attractiveness . 
But this diversity is also a source of inventiveness . 
From German cars to French luxury goods , European industrial competitiveness should not be underestimated . 
The moment when Europe truly believes in itself , the way Germany does , and combines strategic long-term planning with well allocated R D investments , will make all the difference . 
Indeed , in certain key fields , Europe possesses a globally recognized tradition of excellence linked to a very deep culture of quality . 
The fifth source of optimism is slightly paradoxical . 
Nationalist excesses have tended to lead Europe to catastrophic wars . 
But the return of nationalist sentiment within Europe today creates a sense of emulation and competition , which proved instrumental in the rise of Asia yesterday . 
Koreans , Chinese , and Taiwanese wanted to do as well as Japan . 
In the same way , the moment will soon come when the French want to do as well as Germany . 
The sixth reason is linked to the very nature of Europe &apos;s political system . 
Churchill &apos;s famous adage that democracy is the worst political system , with the exception of all the others , has been borne out across the continent . 
More than 80 % of French citizens voted in the presidential election . 
Watching on their televisions the solemn , dignified , peaceful , and transparent transfer of power from the president they had defeated to the president they had elected , French citizens could only feel good about themselves and privileged to live in a democratic state . 
Europeans may be confused , inefficient , and slow to take decisions , but democracy still constitutes a wall of stability against economic and other uncertainties . 
The seventh reason to believe in Europe is linked to the universalism of its message and languages . 
Few people dream of becoming Chinese , or of learning its various languages other than Mandarin . 
By contrast , English , Spanish , French , and , increasingly , German transcend national boundaries . 
Beyond universalism comes the eighth factor supporting the EU &apos;s survival : multiculturalism . 
It is a disputed model , but multiculturalism is more a source of strength than of weakness . 
The continent &apos;s fusion of culture makes its people richer rather than poorer . 
The ninth reason for hope stems from the EU &apos;s new and upcoming members . 
Poland , a country that belongs to &quot; New Europe , &quot; is repaying the EU with a legitimacy that it had gained from Europe during its post-communist transition . 
And the entrance of Croatia , followed by Montenegro and a few other Balkan countries , could compensate for the departure of Greece ( should it come to that for the Greeks ) . 
Finally , and most important , Europe and the world have no better alternative . 
The Greek crisis may be forcing Europe to move towards greater integration , with or without Greece . 
The German philosopher Jürgen Habermas speaks of a &quot; transformational reality &quot; - a complex word for a simple reality : divided we fall , whereas united , in our own complex manner , we may strive for &quot; greatness &quot; in the best sense . 
Investors , of course , are hedging their bets . 
Having ventured successfully into emerging non-democratic countries whose frailty they are starting to fear , some , out of prudence , are starting to rediscover Europe . 
They may well be the wise ones .
