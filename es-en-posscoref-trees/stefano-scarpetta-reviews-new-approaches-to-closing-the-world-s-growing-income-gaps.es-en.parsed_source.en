Innovation and Inequality 
PARIS - When the benefits of economic growth are distributed very unequally , social bonds fray . 
Those losing ground , especially the young , may well grow disaffected , then resentful . 
This was a key factor behind the Arab Spring revolts ; and , as protests in Chile , Brazil , Israel , Turkey , and India have shown , social tensions stemming from inequality are mounting around the globe . 
To be sure , income inequality has been increasing worldwide for decades . 
Even while many developing and emerging economies lifted millions of people out of extreme poverty , the perception that growth meant greater inequality was always bubbling below the surface . 
But now increasingly persistent unemployment and under-employment are giving new impetus to the rise in inequality , as the OECD reported to the G-20 in July . 
Indeed , in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , youth unemployment now averages 16 % in advanced countries , and exceeds 40 % in some European countries . 
As a result , the challenge of inclusive growth has moved to the top of the global economic-policy agenda . 
Indeed , according to the World Economic Forum &apos;s Global Agenda Outlook , widening income disparities will be the second most important world trend in 2014 , behind only Middle East tensions . 
Income gaps are growing for many reasons , ranging from &quot; skill-biased &quot; technological progress to corruption . 
But , whatever its causes , putting people back to work at productive , rewarding jobs can help a great deal , and this demands the best efforts of governments , employers , and civil-society groups on many fronts . 
For starters , it means providing populations with access to quality schooling and health care : a healthy , educated person is an employable person . 
In many countries , this remains a major challenge . 
But the large strides already made in some low-income countries reveal great potential . 
Consider Brazil , which enjoyed a long boom in the 2000 &quot; s , during which income inequality actually declined . 
One contributing factor was the bolsa familia ( family grant ) , now a decade old . 
This monthly cash payment goes directly to mothers , provided that they keep their children in school and send them for regular medical checkups . 
This innovative program is not only a human-capital investment in millions of children ; it also allows mothers to work . 
Such well-designed subsidies for socially useful behavior can lift millions out of poverty . 
But education and health are just the first step . 
For practical and political reasons , redistributive programs , while essential , are not enough to ensure inclusive growth by themselves . 
It is often said , for good reason , that the widening income gap largely reflects technological change , which has drained many economies of blue- and even white-collar jobs , while channeling the fruits of improved productivity to high-skilled elites . 
But the digital revolution can also enable inclusive growth . 
Internet applications and other communications advances are spreading knowledge and information to millions of poor people . 
Consider Babajob.com , started by a Microsoft researcher in India to bring better job opportunities to the country &apos;s informal sector by connecting employers and job seekers via the Web , mobile apps , SMS , and voice services . 
Likewise , in Kenya , as cellphones became widespread , network operators introduced M-pesa , by which anyone with a mobile phone can transfer money quickly and cheaply - a boon for the smallest enterprises in particular . 
Both of these examples - and there are many others - originated not from government but from the private sector . 
And that points to another piece of the solution : improved labor-market efficiency . 
In many countries with high jobless rates , employers cannot find people with the right qualifications . 
The solution is twofold : better market information and better connections between the world of education and the world of work . 
Specialized online job-search sites are facilitating employment . 
But a successful school-to-work transition should start when tomorrow &apos;s workers are young . 
Early childhood education is critical but must lead to high-quality schools that provide ample career-related guidance and counseling . 
The evidence is clear ; countries that invest in these areas have better results than countries that move more slowly . 
While most countries aspire to move toward a &quot; knowledge society , &quot; this should not mean downplaying technical and vocational education . 
On the contrary , advanced economies need many skills , and high-quality technical education , especially if followed by effective apprenticeship programs , can create smooth transitions from school to work . 
Germany , Austria , Switzerland , and other developed countries are rightly praised for this . 
Germany &apos;s youth unemployment rate is under 8 % , and a steady supply of skilled labor helps to sustain the country &apos;s success as an exporter . 
To be sure , this model cannot be adopted in every country - for one thing , it requires a high degree of trust between labor and management . 
But some practices can be modified for use elsewhere . 
The G-20 countries have recently adopted comprehensive guidelines for quality apprenticeships ; each member country should adopt the most appropriate strategy within this broad framework . 
Virtual training programs , for example , allow students to practice using expensive machinery without interfering with actual production - and with no risk of damaging the equipment . 
Similarly , massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) , which are another fast-growing approach to training , enable delivery of top-notch teaching to a broad public at a low unit cost . 
There are many innovative approaches to sharing growth more equally , and more are emerging all the time . 
But they all point to a fundamental truth : If young people and the disadvantaged are to find satisfying and rewarding jobs , governments , employers , educational institutions , and civil-society groups all have an important role to play . 
Our economies &quot; long â€‘ term sustainability depends on it .
