The Drone in the Desert 
TEL AVIV - A drone recently penetrated Israel &apos;s airspace from the Mediterranean . 
It was allowed to fly for about half an hour over southern Israel before being shot down by the Israeli air force over a sparsely populated area . 
It is still not known who dispatched the drone and from where , but it is now assumed that it was launched from Lebanon , either by Hezbollah , acting in Iran &apos;s service , or by forces of the Iranian regime itself . 
If that is indeed the case , the episode should not be regarded as yet another incident in a region fraught by conflict and violence . 
On the contrary , it is a significant window into the arena in which the conflict over the future of Iran &apos;s nuclear program is being waged . 
Several developments and forces are now shaping this arena . 
One is Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s decision , announced in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month , to suspend his threat to launch unilateral military action against Iran &apos;s nuclear installations . 
He has said that Israel will give the US and the rest of the international community an opportunity to stop Iran &apos;s progress through other means by the spring or early summer of 2013 . 
Another development is the US presidential election . 
Republican challenger Mitt Romney &apos;s success in the first debate improves his chances and the prospect of a new administration settling in before any major decisions are made on the Iranian nuclear issue . 
In Iran , the regime pushes ahead , but is clearly being hurt by an economic crisis ( largely a consequence of international sanctions ) , popular protest , and internal bickering - and has turned bellicose as a result . 
After several months of listening to Israeli ( and , to some extent , US ) war rhetoric , the regime began issuing its own menacing bombast , as a matter of substance and to defend the pride of a regime that views itself as the heir to the glorious imperial tradition of Persia . 
Various Iranian spokesmen have begun threatening Israel not only with a massive response to any potential attack , but also with a preemptive strike . 
Israel would not merely be punished for any attack , they say ; it would be annihilated . 
This position was accompanied by Iran &apos;s harder line on military involvement in the Syrian civil war , echoed by its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah . 
For some time , under the impact of the Syrian civil war - and still smarting from the 2006 war with Israel - Hassan Nasrallah , the Hezbollah leader , had lowered his profile and moderated his rhetoric . 
No longer . 
At the same time , the Iranian regime is sending a variety of signals that it wants to renew the nuclear negotiations . 
One example was the announcement that some of its enriched uranium is being diverted to medical research ; in other words , uranium enrichment , according to this message , can be slowed down . 
At this point , however , there are no indications that Iran is interested in more than reducing external pressure and the impact of the sanctions . 
The drone , shot down not far from Israel &apos;s nuclear facility in Dimona , fits with these two efforts . 
Iran &apos;s war rhetoric and threat to inflict a deadly blow on Israel is served by dispatching a drone in the general direction of Dimona . 
And , if the idea is to negotiate , the drone &apos;s flight was an excellent prelude to a demand that Iran &apos;s nuclear effort be dealt with as part of a larger effort to ban nuclear weapons throughout the Middle East . 
There are two other disturbing aspects to the drone affair . 
First , it is a clear indication that Hezbollah is , indeed , the long arm of the Iranian regime - its base on the Mediterranean and on Israel &apos;s border . 
The occasional argument that it is a genuine Lebanese political movement , tied to Iran but ultimately Lebanese , is simply wrong . 
Second , the drone &apos;s arrival from the Mediterranean underscored the danger that terrorist organizations , supplied with deadly modern equipment , can inflict damage &quot; without a return address . &quot; 
Just a few weeks ago , it was feared that Syria &apos;s crumbling regime might transfer part of its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to Hezbollah , or that some of that arsenal might fall into jihadis &quot; hands . 
And one of the arguments against Iran &apos;s nuclear program has been that the regime might transfer fissile material to Hezbollah and its ilk to be used in a radioactive &quot; dirty bomb . &quot; 
There are four components to an effective strategy for dealing with Iran &apos;s nuclear program : real negotiations , rather than a leisurely meeting once every few weeks ; stiff sanctions on Iran , but without today &apos;s gaping loopholes ; a credible threat of military action ; and a face-saving exit for the Iranian leadership . 
This is a viable strategy , but it is now clear that only the US can implement it . 
Let us hope that the Americans act in time .
