America &apos;s Global Election 
NEW YORK - Most people around the world will not be able to vote in the United States &apos;s upcoming presidential election , even though they have a great deal at stake in the result . 
Overwhelmingly , non-US citizens favor Barack Obama &apos;s re-election over a victory for his challenger , Mitt Romney . 
There are good reasons for this . 
In terms of the economy , the effects of Romney &apos;s policies in creating a more unequal and divided society would not be directly felt abroad . 
But , in the past , for better and for worse , others have often followed America &apos;s example . 
Many governments quickly subscribed to Ronald Reagan &apos;s mantra of deregulated markets - policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 1930 &quot; s . 
Other countries that followed America &apos;s lead have experienced growing inequality - more money at the top , more poverty at the bottom , and a weaker middle class . 
Romney &apos;s proposed contractionary policies - the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely , while the US economy is still frail - will almost surely weaken America &apos;s already anemic growth , and , if the euro crisis worsens , it could bring on another recession . 
At that point , with US demand shrinking , the rest of the world would indeed feel the economic effects of a Romney presidency quite directly . 
That raises the question of globalization , which entails concerted action on many fronts by the international community . 
But what is required with regard to trade , finance , climate change , and a host other areas is not being done . 
Many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of American leadership . 
But , while Romney may summon bravado and strong rhetoric , other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him , owing to the belief ( correct in my judgment ) that he would take the US - and them - in the wrong direction . 
American &quot; exceptionalism &quot; may sell well at home , but it does poorly abroad . 
President George W. Bush &apos;s Iraq war - arguably a violation of international law - showed that though America spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined , it could not pacify a country with less than 10 % of its population and less than 1 % of its GDP . 
Moreover , it turned out that US-style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable . 
With most Americans &quot; incomes stagnating for a decade and a half , it was clear that the US economic model was not delivering for most citizens , whatever official GDP data said . 
Indeed , the model blew up even before Bush left office . 
Together with the abuses of human rights under his administration , the Great Recession - the predictable ( and predicted ) consequence of his economic policies - did as much to weaken America &apos;s soft power as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did to weaken the credibility of its military power . 
In terms of values - namely , the values of Romney and his running mate , Paul Ryan - things are not much better . 
For example , every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care , and Obama &apos;s Affordable Care Act represents a significant step toward that goal . 
But Romney has criticized this effort , and has offered nothing in its place . 
America now has the distinction of being among the advanced countries that afford the least equality of opportunity to their citizens . 
And Romney &apos;s drastic budget cutbacks , targeted at the poor and middle class , would further impede social mobility . 
At the same time , he would expand the military , spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist , enriching defense contractors like Halliburton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education . 
While Bush is not on the ballot , Romney has not really distanced himself from the Bush administration &apos;s policies . 
On the contrary , his campaign has featured the same advisers , the same devotion to higher military spending , the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem , and the same fuzzy budget math . 
Consider , for example , the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier : climate change , financial regulation , and trade . 
Romney has been silent on the first , and many in his party are &quot; climate deniers . &quot; 
The world cannot expect genuine leadership from Romney there . 
As for financial regulation , while the recent crisis has highlighted the need for stricter rules , agreement on many issues has proven to be elusive , partly because the Obama administration is too close to the financial sector . 
With Romney , though , there would be no distance at all : metaphorically speaking , he is the financial sector . 
One financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank havens , which exist mainly for purposes of tax evasion and avoidance , money laundering , and corruption . 
Money does not go to the Cayman Islands because sunshine makes it grow faster ; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine . 
But , with Romney unapologetic about his own use of Cayman banks , we are unlikely to see progress even in this area . 
On trade , Romney promises to launch a trade war with China , and to declare it a currency manipulator on Day One - a promise that gives him little wiggle room . 
He refuses to note the renminbi &apos;s large real appreciation in recent years , or to acknowledge that , while changes in China &apos;s exchange rate may affect the bilateral trade deficit , what matters is America &apos;s multilateral trade deficit . 
A stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the US from China to lower-cost producers of textiles , apparel , and other goods . 
The irony - again lost on Romney - is that other countries are accusing the US of currency manipulation . 
After all , one of the main benefits of the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; - perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy - derives from the depreciation of the US dollar . 
The world has a lot riding on America &apos;s election . 
Unfortunately , most people who will be affected by it - almost the entire world - will have no influence on the outcome .
