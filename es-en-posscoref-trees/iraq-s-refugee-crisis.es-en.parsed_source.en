Iraq &apos;s Refugee Crisis 
Among the many humanitarian disasters produced by the civil war now raging in Iraq is one that is almost invisible . 
Only rarely do scenes of massive displacement of the civilian population make it onto our television screens , because , unlike bombs and suicide attacks , displacement does not generate the blood , fire , or screams that constitutes compelling footage . 
Yet the numbers are staggering : each month , some 40,000 Iraqis flee their homes because of the war . 
Half of them go to other parts of Iraq ; the rest go abroad . 
Iraq &apos;s population , frankly , is bleeding away . 
This devastation is even more dramatic because , since the invasion four years ago , only 3,183 Iraqis have been resettled in third countries . 
According to the UN High Commission for Refugees , all countries combined have offered a chance to start a new life to approximately the same number of Iraqi refugees as flee the country in just five days . 
This exodus is not new , but since the increased violence that followed the bombing of the Shiite Golden mosque in Samarra in February 2006 , the pace of the displacement has accelerated . 
Indeed , this is the largest population displacement in the Middle East since 1948 . 
Two million Iraqi refugees are scattered around the region , the great majority of them in Jordan and Syria , with smaller numbers in Turkey , Lebanon , and Egypt . 
Because they are urban refugees - not housed in tents , but rather blending in with the local population in the host countries - they are easily ignored . 
For Iraq , this is a brain drain that will be hard to repair . 
The country had a total population of 26.8 million , and now nearly 13 % of them are displaced ; many may never return . 
But what happens to them ? 
Last month , I traveled to four countries in the Middle East to meet refugees and learn about their stories and options . 
In Amman , Damascus , Istanbul , and Beirut I met dozens of people who have a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country . 
I spoke to a hairdresser who was raped because she is Christian . 
I heard the story of a liquor store owner whose one-year old son was kidnapped and beheaded . 
I met with a Shiite taxi driver whose father was killed in Najaf just a few days before . 
I listened to a Sunni engineer whose association with an American construction company makes him a target for extremists , and to a translator of the Christian Mandaean minority who narrowly escaped death when the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad was bombed in August 2003 . 
Most of those to whom I spoke were poor and without hope for the future . 
None wanted me to use their names . 
Refugees who are in the country of first asylum usually face three possible choices : return to their homeland , try to integrate in the host country , or be resettled to a third country . 
But do the Iraqis really have these three choices ? 
Can anyone watching reports of the daily carnage in Iraq envision Iraqis going back ? 
The answer is no . 
If the Parliament in Baghdad , one of the best protected buildings in the country , can be attacked from within , then no Zone in Iraq is Green ; they are all Red . 
Repatriation of Iraqis is unrealistic and definitely out of question for any foreseeable future . 
Most Iraqis cannot opt for local integration , either . 
True , Jordan and Syria let most Iraqis in , but they do not offer a possibility of durable local absorption . 
Iraqis cannot become permanent residents , and they do not have work permits or access to public health services . 
In Jordan , Iraqi children cannot go to public schools . 
It is not a matter of ill will on the part of these countries ; they simply cannot afford to extend these services . 
Helping them to cope with the influx of refugees is necessary , but it is not a durable solution . 
This leaves the third possibility - that of resettlement . 
But for this to happen , countries with traditionally generous refugee programs should come forward and offer more places to receive Iraqis . 
The United States is a bad example : only 692 refugees have been accepted since the invasion - roughly the number of Iraqis who are killed every week . 
In February , the Bush administration announced that it will offer resettlement this year to 7,000 Iraqi refugees . 
If America makes good on this promise , it would be a big step forward , but the US , which led the intervention in Iraq , should now lead in attending to the victims . 
Should the US not take the lead , the only hope is that other countries will be more generous . 
The Iraqi refugees are a crisis that cannot be ignored : the international community must alleviate the burden on the countries in the region , while offering resettlement opportunities to many more of the most vulnerable Iraqis .
