The Climate Change Revolution 
The world is in the midst of a great political transformation , in which climate change has moved to the center of national and global politics . 
For politicians in persistent denial about the need act , including US President George W. Bush , Australian Prime Minister John Howard , and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , there is no longer any place to hide . 
The science is clear , manmade changes in climate are being felt , and the electorate &apos;s demand for action is growing . 
Though unlikely just a few months ago , a strong global agreement by 2010 , one that will set a path for action for decades to come , now stands a good chance of being implemented . 
Political leaders in countries that produce coal , oil , and gas - like the US , Australia , and Canada - have pretended that climate change is a mere hypothesis . 
For several years , the Bush administration tried to hide the facts from the public , deleting references to manmade climate from government documents and even trying to suppress statements by leading government scientists . 
Until recently , Exxon Mobil and other companies paid lobbyists to try to distort the public debate . 
Yet truth has triumphed over political maneuvers . 
The climate itself is sending a powerful and often devastating message . 
Hurricane Katrina made the US public aware that global warming would likely raise the intensity of destructive storms . 
Australia &apos;s great drought this past year has similarly made a mockery of Howard &apos;s dismissive attitude toward climate change . 
Scientists themselves have operated with great seriousness of purpose in educating the public . 
We can thank the United Nations for that . 
The UN sponsors the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , a worldwide body of hundreds of climate scientists who report every few years to the public on the science of climate change . 
This year , the IPCC is releasing its fourth round of reports , starting with the one issued early in February . 
That report was unequivocal : there is a powerful scientific consensus that human activity , mainly the burning of fossil fuels ( coal , oil , gas ) , as well as deforestation and other land uses ( such as growing paddy rice ) , leads to massive emissions of carbon dioxide into the air . 
This is causing climate change , which is accelerating and poses serious risks to the planet . 
The single biggest threat comes from the production and consumption of energy for electricity , transport , and heating and cooling buildings . 
But the world &apos;s scientists and engineers , as well as global technology leaders such as General Electric , are also sending a clear message : we can solve the problem at modest cost if we put our best thinking and action into real solutions . 
By shifting to alternative energy sources , economizing on energy use , and capturing and safely storing the carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels , global society can limit its emissions of carbon dioxide to prudent levels at an estimated cost of under 1 % of global income . 
The changeover to a sustainable energy system will not come quickly , and will require new kinds of electrical power plants , new kinds of automobiles , and &quot; green buildings , &quot; which economize on energy use . 
The process will take decades , but we must start now and act on a global basis , using carbon taxes and emission permits to create market-based incentives for companies and individuals to make the necessary changes . 
Those incentives will come at modest cost and huge benefit , and they can be designed to protect the poor and shift the climate-change burden to those who can afford it . 
A reasonable timetable is possible . 
By the end of 2007 , all of the world &apos;s governments should begin negotiations on a climate-change system for the years after 2012 , when the current Kyoto Protocol expires . 
Basic principles should be established during 2008 , and by 2009 , the world community , including the two largest emitters of carbon dioxide , the US and China , should be ready to make a serious deal , which should be concluded by 2010 and ratified in time to replace the Kyoto Protocol . 
The Kyoto Protocol was the first attempt at such a system , but it applied only to rich countries and set only modest objectives . 
The richest country and biggest contributor to global climate change , the US , didn &apos;t even sign . 
Neither did Australia . 
Canada signed but has failed to act . 
Nor did huge energy users like China and India , which must be part of any meaningful solution , face serious responsibilities under the Kyoto agreement . 
All of that will have to change . 
All countries will have to shoulder their responsibilities to the rest of the world and to future generations . 
There is now a way for individuals and companies to make their own voices heard . 
The Earth Institute at Columbia University , which I direct , hosted a Global Roundtable of leading businesses , environmental groups , and other international organizations to reach a consensus to help inform the upcoming negotiations . 
The Roundtable produced an important Statement of Principles and a longer overall statement that has been signed by many of the world &apos;s largest businesses , including those based in the US , Europe , Canada , China , and India . 
Many of the world &apos;s leading scientists signed , too . 
Global climate change requires global decisions , and initiatives like the Roundtable Statement show that we can find areas of agreement for powerful action . 
It &apos;s time for the world &apos;s political holdouts to join that effort .
