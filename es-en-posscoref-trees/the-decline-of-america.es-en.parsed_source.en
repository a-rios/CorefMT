The Decline of America 
The first anniversary of the war in Iraq has arrived , and America &apos;s reputation continues to sink . 
One year ago , the US tried to bully the world into supporting an unprovoked war , claiming that anybody who didn &apos;t believe in Iraq &apos;s weapons of mass destruction was either a fool or an accomplice of terrorists . 
Now we know that the US government and its few allies were themselves either fools or liars . 
The US could be a great force for good . 
Studies like one by the World Health Organization &apos;s Commission on Macroeconomics and Health show that with an $ 11 trillion dollar annual national income , America could finance the control of AIDS , malaria , tuberculosis , and many other killer diseases for a small fraction of the money it wastes in Iraq . 
Instead , US financial assistance to the world &apos;s poor countries as a share of national income is the lowest of any donor country . 
The US can also be a force for great ill . 
America &apos;s military budget is currently about $ 450 billion , roughly equal to the rest of the world &apos;s combined military spending . 
The Bush Administration believes that US military power buys security , even though terrorism has increased since the Iraq War . 
But despite its wealth and military might , America &apos;s ability to project political power - for good or ill - will decline in future years , for at least five reasons : America &apos;s budget is in crisis . 
Thanks to Bush &apos;s tax cuts and military spending , which have contributed to budget deficits of $ 500 billion per year , the US will have to raise taxes and limit budget spending , whether or not Bush is re-elected . 
The annual military budget , which has increased by $ 150 billion since Bush took office , will need to be cut in coming years to get the budget under control ; 
The US is borrowing massively from abroad . 
Asia &apos;s central banks have bought hundreds of billions of dollars of US securities . 
Japan alone has foreign exchange reserves of around $ 750 billion , much of that in US treasury bills . 
China , Hong Kong , India , Korea , Singapore , and Taiwan together have another $ 1.1 trillion or so in reported foreign exchange reserves . 
In short , the US is in deep and growing debt to Asia . 
Only massive buying of treasury bills by Asian central banks has prevented the dollar from falling even more precipitously than it has ; 
The rest of the world is catching up . 
America &apos;s big technological lead will narrow relative to Brazil , China , India , and other major economic regions of the developing world . 
China will have an economy larger than the US economy within 25 years - potentially 50 % larger by 2050 . 
India , considerably poorer on average than China , will also close the wealth gap . 
By 2050 , India will conceivably have an economy the size of America &apos;s , with four times the population and roughly one-fourth of the average income level per person ; 
A narrower economic gap will reduce America &apos;s relative geopolitical power . 
China and India , which together account for about 40 % of the world &apos;s population , will begin to play much larger roles on the world scene . 
The current xenophobic reactions to &quot; outsourcing &quot; of jobs to India &apos;s software engineers Â­ - a hot political issue in the US - reflects the underlying anxiety of a US population that wants to stay in the economic lead . 
With or without American protectionism , Asia &apos;s technological capacities and incomes will grow . 
This will be good for the world because prosperity will be more widely spread , even if America &apos;s ego gets hurt in the process . 
Demographics will weaken America &apos;s militaristic approach to the world . 
Much of Bush &apos;s support comes from white fundamentalist Christian men . 
This , in my opinion , is a social group that is fighting a rearguard battle against the growing social power of women , immigrants , and other religions . 
It is also fighting against secularism , such as the teaching of modern biology and evolutionary theory . 
The religious right &apos;s backward-looking agenda - and the Manichaean worldview that underlies it - is doomed . 
The US Census Bureau recently found that by 2050 , the non-Hispanic white population of the US is likely to be only half of the total US population , down from 69 % currently . 
By 2050 , 24 % of the population will be Hispanic , 14 % will be African-American , and 8 % Asian . 
The US will look more like the world , especially Latin America . 
In the face of these five factors , the dream of global empire held by many US right-wingers will most likely fade . 
This may happen sooner rather than later if Bush loses this November in an election that is certain to be very close .
