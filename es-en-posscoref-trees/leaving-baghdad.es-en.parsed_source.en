Leaving Baghdad 
The poison of terrorism has now ripped into the humanitarian work of the UN , with the tragic bombing of its Iraq mission &apos;s headquarters . 
Dozens of innocent people were killed , including one of the world &apos;s most accomplished peacemakers , Sergio Vieira de Mello . 
Predictably , President Bush re-stated his determination to wage war on terrorism . 
Other leaders declared that the UN should not abandon its mission . 
Yet the bombing raises political questions that demand answers . 
Rather than bolstering its military occupation , the US should leave Iraq , allowing the UN to continue its mission . 
In the early 20 th century , empires could suppress restive populations . 
No longer . 
Nationalist and anti-colonialist ideologies , supported by growing literacy and political mobilization , have long since made imperial rule virtually impossible . 
This is especially true in the Middle East , where anti-colonialism mixes with religious fundamentalism . 
It was foolhardy for the US to think it could put troops on the ground in Iraq without an extended period of violence and bloodshed . 
America &apos;s leaders believed that the US would be welcomed as liberators . 
The US government and many observers believe that if the US can just get basic services established in Baghdad , and perhaps catch Saddam Hussein , then the situation will quiet down . 
The goal seems to be to install a regime led by friends of the Pentagon , such as Ahmed Chalabi . 
That regime , in turn , is supposed to invite a longer stay by US troops , and to grant concessions to the US oil industry . 
But such a regime will never have legitimacy , and will be subject to assassinations , political upheaval , and terrorist attacks . 
In the end , it will squander human lives - such as the brave and dedicated workers of the UN - not to mention hundreds of billions of dollars . 
Shockingly , the US is now spending around $ 4 billion per month to station its troops in Iraq , while at the same time President Bush fights like crazy to keep America &apos;s contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB , and Malaria to no more than $ 200 million for an entire year . 
Many American voices are already saying that , whether or not the war in Iraq was a good idea , the US ( and the UN ) must now stay , to preserve national honor and to show that the US will not be scared away by terrorism . 
These responses to terrorist attacks resonate well with US public opinion . 
Nobody likes to be bullied , and no American wants the US to be frightened or coerced by the brutal and thuggish actions of car bombers . 
Yet the emotional response of digging in deeper simply compounds the political errors of the war itself . 
The US is not in a position to pacify Baghdad or to protect the UN or others that work alongside an occupying army , even those working in humanitarian activities . 
Terrorism in this case is not just a cowardly act ; it is also a reflection of the poisoned politics of US military occupation . 
A political response is therefore needed . 
Malaysia , a successful and stable moderate Muslim country , has put the issue just right . 
Rather than defending the truly heroic work of the UN , Malaysia &apos;s Government correctly called on the US to leave Iraq . 
Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar wisely noted that &quot; &#91; t &#93; he security threat in Iraq will remain as long as the deep-rooted resentment of the people against the occupation is not dealt with in a fair and just manner . 
The UN should not be seen as part and parcel of the occupation . &quot; 
Even at this late date , with American soldiers being killed on a regular basis , and with the massive deaths resulting from the car bombing of the UN headquarters , the US resists greater UN authority , much less replacing US troops with UN-led forces . 
The Bush administration is sticking to its game plan . 
It is probably calculating that a few dozen casualties , or even a few hundred , will still be worth the greater prize - a US military presence in Iraq that looks over the disposition of more than 100 billion barrels of oil while breathing down the neck of Iraq &apos;s next door neighbor , Saudi Arabia . 
In the end , it will prove to be a false and misguided calculation . 
As long as US occupying forces remain , Iraq &apos;s politics are likely to remain unstable . 
Cooperation with the US will , by itself , increasingly become a disqualification for Iraqi political leaders seeking real support within their own communities . 
In the early 21 st century , merely providing electricity and running water will not prove enough to win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people , even if the US figures out how to get these public services working . 
Iraqis will demand the dignity of government by Iraqis , while criminals and terrorists will prey on such sentiments by whatever means necessary . 
The US invasion was a grave mistake . 
Committing more soldiers will only compound the error . 
What is needed now is the quick withdrawal of US forces , and their temporary replacement by UN-led troops , which will hand power back to the Iraqi people .
