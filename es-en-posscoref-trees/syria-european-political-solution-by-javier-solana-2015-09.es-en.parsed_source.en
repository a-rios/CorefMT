No Time to Lose in Syria 
MADRID - The arrival of hundreds of thousands of men , women , and children seeking refuge from conflict has confronted the European Union with two stark realities . 
First , its member states are not all meeting their obligations , both to one another and according to international law . 
Second , its position regarding Syria &apos;s civil war is unsustainable . 
To be clear : failing to work towards peace in Syria is just as grave an error as turning away those fleeing from persecution . 
The defects in Europe &apos;s asylum legislation and the difference among its member states &quot; practices have been evident for some time . 
But the 350,000 refugees who crossed European borders , and the more than 2,600 who drowned trying to reach them , in the first eight months of this year have opened our eyes . 
Now , on top of the so-called &quot; north-south &quot; split that emerged from the economic crisis , the United Kingdom &apos;s potential exit from the EU , and the critical situation in Greece , a new breach , between east and west , has appeared in Europe . 
The EU cannot afford any more cracks . 
Therefore , it must use all possible means to compel its members to abide by their international and European legal obligations . 
That same urgency must be applied to peacemaking in Syria ; after all , the refugees are a product of the country &apos;s long , brutal , multi-sided civil war . 
The seriousness of the situation in Syria cannot be overstated . 
Since the conflict began in 2011 , it has produced more than four million refugees , and approximately eight million internally displaced people . 
More than 200,000 people have died . 
To put that in perspective : more than half of the 22 million people living in Syria in 2011 are either dead or displaced . 
Control of Syria &apos;s territory is now divided between President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , various armed opposition groups , the Kurds , and the Islamic State . 
The civil war has enabled the extremist Islamic State to build up its capacity to the point that , if the Syrian regime were to collapse entirely , the group would likely be able to take advantage of the power vacuum to seize control of the entire country . 
Nonetheless , Russia &apos;s claim that Syria faces a choice between Assad or the Islamic State is false . 
Suspicions about Russia &apos;s intentions have lately ballooned , as the country allegedly steps up its aid to the Assad regime , a longtime ally , and calls increasingly loudly for cooperation with the regime to combat the Islamic State . 
While Russia &apos;s emphasis on keeping Assad in power is likely driven by its own interests in retaining influence in the Middle East , it is right about one thing : the Islamic State must be stopped . 
And it is a grave mistake to think that this can be achieved without a political solution to the conflict in Syria - the conflict that enabled the organization &apos;s explosive growth . 
Only if external powers think beyond military operations and devise a political solution to the crisis can the fight against the Islamic State succeed . 
Such a political solution must , first and foremost , reflect an understanding of past errors and a commitment not to repeat them . 
Recall that in Iraq , the attempt to rebuild the state began with the complete dismantling of Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime and all existing governance structures . 
The power vacuum that this approach produced was filled by Sunni militias and , ultimately , the Islamic State . 
For Syria , this means that part of the existing state , including Assad &apos;s Alawite sect , should be included in a broad coalition , along with the opposition and the Kurds . 
Without such broad representation , no Syrian government can hope to defeat terrorist forces and lead the country toward a more stable future . 
Of course , implementing such a solution will not be easy - not least because of sharp divisions among relevant external powers . 
Like Russia , Iran - which will be crucial to the success of any solution - backs the regime . 
Meanwhile , Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Qatar are unwilling to support any solution that includes Assad . 
And , fortunately , it doesn &apos;t have to . 
All crises end in the same way : with all parties sitting at the negotiating table . 
That must be the goal in Syria now . 
This is where EU leadership can prove vital . 
Exercising it will require EU member states to maintain a common position , supporting the efforts of the United Nations special envoy for Syria , Staffan de Mistura , to work with all relevant players - including the EU , the United States , Russia , Iran , and Saudi Arabia - to achieve peace in Syria . 
A good place to start would be by urging the so-called E3 / EU + 3 group - that is , the five permanent members of the UN Security Council ( China , France , Russia , the US , and the UK ) , Germany , and the EU - to convene . 
Given that these countries recently managed to overcome their strong differences to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran , this might be the right forum to begin building consensus on a political solution in Syria . 
Negotiations could subsequently progress to include other major actors , especially Saudi Arabia , Iran , and Turkey . 
Syria is out of time . 
Its people have been besieged by brutality and mayhem for far too long ; they can find respite in far too few countries ; and they are being forced to undertake journeys that are far too dangerous . 
The UN General Assembly cannot end its 70th session without taking decisive steps toward effective negotiations - and an effective solution . 
The world , urged by the EU , must work to bring peace to Syria now , and to establish a strong state capable of guaranteeing peace in the future .
