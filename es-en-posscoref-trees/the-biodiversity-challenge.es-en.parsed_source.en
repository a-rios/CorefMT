The Biodiversity Challenge 
LONDON - In this , the United Nations &quot; International Year of Biological Diversity , and with the Convention on Biological Diversity meeting in Japan , it is clear that the environmental challenges we face are severe and increasing , and that the need for action has never been more urgent . 
Our lives , and those of all other creatures on this planet , are both part of and dependent on biodiversity . 
Simply put , biodiversity is the web of life , including all organisms found in every habitat , from the fish of the deep oceans to the birds of the tropical rainforests and everything in between . 
Plant and fungal diversity lies at the very foundation of biodiversity , and on them all other life depends . 
Plants absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen , thereby providing the air we breathe and helping to regulate the climate . 
They provide food , medicine , fuel , shelter , clean water , and fertile soils . 
Plant diversity sustains us now , and in the future it will enable us to adapt , innovate , and ultimately survive . 
And yet , despite our dependence on this incredible natural heritage for our very lives and wellbeing - and those of future generations - we are squandering it at an unprecedented rate.amp # 160 ; 
Our generation faces biodiversity loss on a massive scale . 
Species extinctions are occurring at a rate far greater than the natural cycle , owing largely to habitat destruction caused by human activities such as deforestation and land clearance . 
Evidence suggests that climate change will accelerate this loss . 
But there is hope amid the gloom . 
In fact , there is no technical reason why a species should go extinct , and great achievements in protecting biodiversity are being made . 
For example , scientists and conservationists around the world are collaborating on projects such as the Millennium Seed Bank partnership , founded and coordinated by the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew . 
This partnership of more than 100 institutions in over 50 countries has already conserved 10 % of the world &apos;s wild plant species , and is working towards conserving 25 % , focusing on those that are rare , endangered , and useful . 
What is needed now is the political will and financial resources to underpin these efforts . 
The major meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity taking place in Nagoya , Japan , from October 18-29 , is an opportunity in this regard , and we at Kew are hopeful for positive outcomes in terms of international agreements in the key areas of biodiversity conservation , sustainable use and access , and benefit-sharing . 
Meanwhile , at the national level , it is essential that biodiversity conservation is &quot; mainstreamed , &quot; becoming an integral part of government policy and sustainable management practices worldwide . 
Poverty alleviation , central to the UN Millennium Development Goals , is largely measured in GDP growth , but must include sustainable management of the natural capital on which economic health depends . 
Indeed , we should not forget the infinite spiritual and recreational benefits that the natural world provides to people and cultures everywhere . 
This is a component of human well-being that cannot be measured in GDP alone . 
It has been argued that much biodiversity has been lost as a result of a lack of understanding of its true value . 
Two major initiatives are helping to highlight the value of our natural capital : the UN-backed study , &quot; The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity &quot; ( TEEB ) , and the UN Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Nations ( REDD + ) . 
Once the true value of our natural resources is understood , rather than taken for granted as if there were an infinitely available supply , the vital importance of conserving biodiversity should be better recognized . 
Effective conservation programs are based on sound scientific knowledge . 
Kew &apos;s leading work in understanding and conserving plants around the world is hence a key pillar in the fight against biodiversity loss . 
Its collections contain some of the largest and most comprehensive records of plant diversity in the world , and are a global point of reference for research . 
A deep understanding of plant science is essential in planning and executing conservation projects . 
Kew &apos;s recent work with the International Union for Conservation of Nature , London &apos;s Natural History Museum , and the Zoological Society of London to create the Sample Red List Index ( SRLI ) for plants has revealed for the first time that one in five of the world &apos;s plant species is threatened with extinction . 
As a result , we now have a baseline from which to measure progress in plant conservation around the world . 
We have the knowledge , expertise , and partnerships to make a very real positive difference to biodiversity conservation worldwide , and we welcome support from all parts of society to help us deliver this .
