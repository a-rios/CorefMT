Ghettoizing Identity 
PARIS - Once , as I picked up the Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen at his hotel , the receptionist asked me if I was his driver . 
After hesitating , I nodded yes . 
Among my various identities that day , that of driver was the most obvious to her . 
This sense of multiple identities is something that Sen himself highlighted mischievously in his book Identity and Violence : &quot; The same person can be , for example , a British citizen , of Malaysian origin , with Chinese racial characteristics , a stockbroker , a non-vegetarian , an asthmatic , a linguist , a bodybuilder , a poet , an opponent of abortion , a bird-watcher , an astrologer , and one who believes that God invented Darwin to test the gullible . &quot; 
Only a minimum of introspection shows that our difficulty in answering the question , Who am I ? , arises from the complexity we face in distinguishing between our many identities and understanding their architecture . 
Who am I , indeed , and why should I accept people reducing me and the richness of my identity to only one of its dimensions ? 
Yet such reductionism lies behind one of today &apos;s dominant concepts , multiculturalism , according to which one of our identities must prevail above all others , serving as the sole criterion for organizing society into distinct groups . 
Nowadays , we are often told that there are only two ways for people to integrate into a society : the &quot; British &quot; model of cultural pluralism , and the &quot; French &quot; model , based on acceptance of Republican values and , above all , the concept of equality . 
According to the conventional wisdom , Britain &apos;s social model is based on coexistence between different communities , with each continuing to observe its conventions and customs while respecting the country &apos;s laws - an informal federation of communities . 
But that common wisdom is grossly mistaken , because British law grants immigrants from all the Commonwealth countries something extraordinary : the right to vote in British elections , even national ones . 
Citizens know by experience that democracy does not consist in universal suffrage alone , but also requires a public sphere that is equally open to all . 
In the United Kingdom , a large group of immigrants thus share with native Britons the right to participate in public debates on all matters of general interest , whether local or national . 
Because fundamental equality is granted in this way , the British system manages to cope better than others do with a greater expression of distinctive identities . 
Nowadays , however , Britain &apos;s government itself seems to be forgetting the bedrock conditions of this British model by trying to satisfy the desire of particular communities &quot; for public recognition by officially promoting things like state-subsidized denominational schools . 
According to Sen , this is regrettable because it leads to people giving one of their identities - religious , say , or cultural - priority over all others at a time when it is essential that children broaden their intellectual horizons . 
By embracing the kind of separatism that such schools represent , the British are now saying , &quot; This is your identity and you can have nothing else . &quot; 
That approach amounts to communitarianism , not multiculturalism . 
In the last few years , the &quot; French model &quot; has also been subjected to misinterpretation , due to confusion about its basis - genuine inclusion in the life of society , which means genuine equality in terms of access to public services , the social welfare system , schools and universities , employment , and so on . 
Republicanism grants each individual , regardless of his or her other identities equal rights in order to achieve universal equality . 
It does not deny distinctive identities and gives each the right to express itself within the private sphere . The temptation of communitarianism , which the French have debated for at least a decade , comes from the wish to turn the failure of genuine equality into something positive . 
It offers integration by default within the differentiated space of various communities - a sort of imprisonment by civilization , Sen would say . 
But you cannot dress up failure in the clothes of success . 
As long as urban areas are socially and economically deprived , communitarianism will only serve to mask the violation of the principle of equality . 
Social groups are then measured in terms of their &quot; ethnic &quot; or &quot; racial &quot; differences . 
Because the social conditions of the &quot; French model &quot; have been so neglected , the model is now a living contradiction of its core principle : equality . 
To reverse the trend , French republicanism must , like English multiculturalism , contradict itself in order to fulfil itself . 
The French must recognize that equality before the law is a core principle , but a weak one ; it needs to be complemented by a stricter vision of how to achieve equality . 
This vision should make republican efforts proportional to the importance of people &apos;s handicap in order to free them from the burden of their initial conditions . 
Genuine equality in the public sphere - which differs according to the values and history of each country - implies a minimal level of acceptance of a country &apos;s history and values . 
Sen says that what is being accepted here should be thought of as national identity . 
But this identity must be open . 
It is an identity we share by living together and by what we have in common , whatever the differences between our multiples identities . 
The great British novelist Joseph Conrad , born JÃ³zef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski to Polish parents in Russian-ruled Ukraine , said that words are the biggest enemy of reality . 
The appeal of &quot; national identity &quot; must not be turned into a collective smokescreen behind which inclusion becomes a disembodied dream coexisting with the communitarianism that is now emerging from its failure .
