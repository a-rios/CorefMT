The Culture of Entrepreneurship 
Governments around the world want to promote entrepreneurship . 
Though most business start-ups will never amount to much , each little company is an experiment , and a great deal of experimentation is necessary to produce the occasional firm that can transform a nation &apos;s economy - or even rise to international significance . 
In short , entrepreneurship is an incubator , and one that is essential to long-term economic success . 
In explaining the variation in levels of entrepreneurship across countries , much attention is devoted nowadays to differences in national attitudes and policies . 
But there are also significant differences in levels of entrepreneurship within individual countries . 
People from Shanghai are said to be more entrepreneurial than people in Beijing . 
People in the Ukrainian town of Kherson are more entrepreneurial than people from Kiev . 
In a recent study , Mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov of the Stockholm School of Economics show the magnitude of differences in levels of entrepreneurship across Swedish municipalities . 
They define entrepreneurs as people who report income from a company that they control and work in at least part-time , and find that the proportion of entrepreneurs in the population differs substantially across the 289 municipalities that they studied , ranging from 1.5 % to 18.5 % . 
What can these differences tell us about the real causes of entrepreneurship ? 
Policy changes at the national level cannot account for the variation Gianetti and Simonov found . 
In the 1980 &quot; s and early 1990 &quot; s , centralized wage-setting agreements were dissolved and the Swedish government cut personal and corporate tax rates . 
The level of entrepreneurial activity in the country as a whole doubled as a result , but the response was very different from one municipality to another . 
Why ? 
Cultural variables seem to explain a lot : religion and politics accounted for about half of the variation across municipalities . 
Municipalities tended to have more entrepreneurs if they had a high proportion of pensioners who were members of the Church of Sweden ( the official state church until 2000 ) and a high proportion of right-wing voters . 
Beyond that , a feedback mechanism appears to be in place : cities with more entrepreneurs tend to beget still more entrepreneurs . 
Once an entrepreneurial culture takes root , it typically spreads locally , as people learn about business and begin to feel attracted by it - even if it doesn &apos;t yield an immediate or certain payoff . 
Indeed , Giannetti and Simonov discovered that the average income of entrepreneurs was lower in high-entrepreneurship municipalities than in the low-entrepreneurship ones . 
Similarly , studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often have lower initial earnings and earnings growth than they would have as employees . 
What these studies suggest is that differences in the degree of entrepreneurship may be due less to better economic opportunities ( the &quot; supply &quot; side of the entrepreneurship equation ) than to cultural differences that make entrepreneurship personally more rewarding ( the &quot; demand &quot; side ) . 
This hypothesis is supported by Giannetti and Simonov , who argue that differences in the prestige of entrepreneurs across municipalities may account for differences in levels of entrepreneurship . 
In some municipalities , entrepreneurs enjoy high social status , regardless of whether they are already successful ; elsewhere they are looked down upon and other occupations are more admired . 
The idea that prestige is important is not new . 
In her book Money , Morals &amp; Manners , the sociologist Mich√®le Lamont compared definitions of success in France and the United States . 
She interviewed people in both countries and asked them what it meant to be a &quot; worthy person . &quot; 
In essence , she was asking people about their sense of what is important in life and about their own personal sense of identity . 
Lamont &apos;s study confirmed the conventional wisdom that Americans value business success , while the French place greater value on culture and quality of life . 
Likewise , open contempt of &quot; money-hungry &quot; businesspeople and competition is expressed more often in France than in America . 
But , while Lamont focused on differences between the French and the Americans , her study &apos;s most interesting finding was that of significant differences between regions within France . 
She compared Clermont-Ferrand , the capital of Auvergne , in the center of France , with Paris . 
Auvergne &apos;s inhabitants have a reputation for being parsimonious and stern , and , despite substantial recent progress , for a relative dearth of high culture . 
Lamont found that people in both Paris and Clermont-Ferrand tended to express contempt for &quot; money-grubbing . &quot; 
But the Clermontois valued &quot; simplicity , pragmatism , hard work , and resolve , &quot; while the Parisians put more stress on &quot; pizzazz and brilliance . &quot; 
She concluded that , &quot; In many respects the Clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers ( as the residents of the US mid-Western state of Indiana are called ) than to the Parisians . &quot; 
Her evidence suggests that in Clermont-Ferrand , as compared to Paris , there is a higher intrinsic demand for starting small businesses . 
Virtually every country is a pastiche of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their personal identity . 
Differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a worthy person , and how worthiness is signaled , probably explain much of the variation in levels of entrepreneurship . 
Economists and others often tend to look at countries as a whole and emphasize national attitudes and national policies as the main factors in encouraging or discouraging entrepreneurship . 
But , in fact , the national success in entrepreneurship depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies . 
Entrepreneurship can take root in culturally congenial regions of any country after economic barriers against it are lifted , and then feed on itself to grow to national significance .
