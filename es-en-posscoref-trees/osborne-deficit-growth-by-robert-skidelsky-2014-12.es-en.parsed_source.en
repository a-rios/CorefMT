Britain &apos;s Closet Keynesian 
LONDON - There is a growing apprehension among Britain &apos;s financial pundits that Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is not nearly as determined to cut public spending as he pretends to be . 
He sets himself deadlines to balance the books , but when the date arrives , with the books still unbalanced , he simply sets another . 
Consider some fiscal arithmetic . 
When Osborne became Chancellor in 2010 , the budget deficit - spending minus revenue - was £ 153 billion ( $ 239 billion ) , or 10.2 % of GDP . 
He promised that by 2015 the deficit would stand at only £ 37 billion , or 2.1 % of GDP - equivalent to balancing current spending and revenue . 
Instead , the deficit for 2014-2015 is expected to be £ 97 billion . 
The conclusion of Osborne &apos;s balancing act has been postponed until the 2019-2020 budget . 
Osborne talks about the need to cut spending , but his actions say otherwise . 
Though he vowed to reduce spending by more than £ 100 billion by now , he has cut less than half of that , simply extending his five-year rolling program of cuts for another few years . 
As a result , Osborne , the poster child for British austerity , is starting to look like a closet Keynesian . 
There is a school of thought that holds that commitment , not achievement , gives a policy credibility . 
For example , the Bank of England is committed to achieve 2 % inflation &quot; in the medium term . &quot; 
Annual inflation has not been 2 % at any time in the last six years , but it is possible that the BoE &apos;s commitment has had some effect in lowering interest rates . 
Osborne &apos;s defenders might make the same argument for his fiscal policy . 
A credible policy of fiscal consolidation , they might say , will have the same exhilarating effect on confidence as fiscal consolidation itself . 
Economists call this the &quot; signaling effect . &quot; 
If you announce that you intend to balance the books over five years and pencil in a lot of spending cuts , consumers , relieved of their fears of future tax increases , will start spending more freely . 
This will cause national income to rise , and , with luck , the budget deficit will start shrinking , more or less according to plan , without requiring any , or much , retrenchment . 
In its emphasis on the importance of the signal , economics enters postmodernist territory . 
The signal - in this case the promise to balance the books - creates the reality . 
People start behaving as though the books were balanced , ignoring the fact that they are not . 
When one believes the narrative , one acts in ways that make it come true . 
In fact , I do not believe that Osborne himself ever attached importance to the signaling effects of his pronouncements . 
He really did want to balance the budget by making the spending cuts that he promised . 
If he turned out to be more Keynesian than he intended to be , it was for pragmatic reasons . 
What free-market ideologues often fail to grasp is that politics eventually makes all policymakers Keynesian to some degree . 
No matter how much a politician advocates short-term pain for long-term benefits , voters will stomach only a certain amount of suffering . 
So sensible politicians slow down the cuts that markets demand , and take loans that they know they will be unable to pay , in order to keep public services going . 
To be sure , Osborne must not be given too much credit for his closet Keynesianism . 
A true Keynesian would have said that what was needed in 2010 was fiscal expansion , not consolidation . 
Osborne believed , or appeared to believe , that austerity would speed up economic recovery , by restoring confidence in government finance . 
But there is a strong case to be made that the cuts that Osborne did make impeded recovery , by removing spending power from an economy already suffering from a deficiency of aggregate demand . 
The result was economic stagnation from 2010 to 2013 , undermining Osborne &apos;s ability to meet his deficit-reduction targets . 
Now that Osborne has once again promised new cuts and a new five-year timetable for balancing the books , the question is whether he will keep his word this time . 
Yes , the British economy has finally started to grow ; and , yes , growth is expected to continue . 
But is there any reason to believe that the recovery will not be undermined by another five years of austerity , leading Osborne ( or his successor ) to postpone the deadline once again ? 
We can all agree that what happens to the budget affects the economy . 
But I would argue , as Keynes did , that &quot; the boom , not the slump , is the time for austerity at the Treasury . &quot; 
To try to cut spending in a slump , as Osborne is doing , is to prolong the slump . 
And , as he is learning , to his displeasure , that means postponing the day when the books will be balanced .
