Learning from America 
As the United States prepares to celebrate the inauguration of its first African-American president , it showcases again one of the best aspects of its national identity . 
Though it took more than 200 years to reach this point , foreign observers , especially in Europe , marvel at Barack Obama &apos;s ascendancy . 
They recognize from their own relative marginalization of people of color or of immigrants that no French , German , Italian , or British Obama is on the horizon , and they wonder : how does America do it ? 
America certainly has its flaws and its struggles over race and national identity , but it also has much to be proud of in terms of how it assimilates those with foreign or minority backgrounds . 
Obama &apos;s example - and that of his newly formed cabinet , which includes many accomplished leaders from ethnic or racial &quot; out-groups &quot; - holds useful lessons for other nations , particularly in Western Europe . 
So what is it that America is doing right ? 
First , America &apos;s national story is different in essence from those of Western European nations . 
The French story is that of French-ness , the British story one of British-ness ; by definition , newcomers are &quot; less than &quot; or &quot; outside of &quot; this narrative . 
But the American national drama is the drama of immigration : everyone , except Native Americans , came from somewhere else . 
All who are now part of the national elite have ancestors who came , often bedraggled and harassed , from somewhere else . 
Indeed , in America the qualities that lead people to become immigrants - initiative , ambition , risk-taking - are lionized . 
Immigrants are seen as arriving on a journey of continual reinvention , driven to exceed their opportunities in their countries of origin . 
By contrast , immigrants in Western Europe were invited to fill low-status jobs , creating a built-in incentive for natives to see them and their children as a servant class , incapable of entering , let alone leading , the larger society . 
Moreover , unlike America , Western Europe must live with the uneasy conscience stirred by immigrants whose very presence serves as a reminder of a history of colonialism . 
In this sense , the relationship between native-born and new Americans starts out &quot; cleaner . &quot; 
Second , Americans don &apos;t demand that immigrants regard their cultural or ethnic background as being in contrast to or in opposition to their American-ness . 
Everyone gets to be hyphenated . 
By contrast , when identity is presented as being a stark choice , people often do not choose the identity of the host country that is being so inflexible . 
As a result , Britain , France , and The Netherlands contain deeply entrenched subcultures of alienated , radicalized Muslim youth . 
But , while they and other radical Muslims around the world may hate Americans , it is hard to imagine a more Americanized , suburbanized immigrant subculture than Muslim immigrants in the US . 
Rather then listening to radical clerics , they are busy assimilating , sending their kids to law and medical school , barbequing on weekends , and going to ( American ) football games - all while still maintaining devout ties to their religion and community . 
That has not changed since the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , despite rising hostility toward US Muslims among native-born Americans , based the assumption that they could not assimilate ( a charge often directed in the past at Jews in various countries ) . 
More generally , Americans view immigrants as being welcome to combine their culture of origin with their new American-ness , while immigrants see no conflict between their ethnicity and religion and their embrace of America . 
And , most significantly when it comes to assessing the ease of integration over time , they fully expect their kids to be completely , unhesitantly &quot; American &quot; - a promise that , by and large , is readily fulfilled . 
How different it is in Western Europe . 
Three generations after West Indians began immigrating en masse to the United Kingdom , Caribbean-descended Britons still doubt that their children or grandchildren will ever be seen as fully British . 
Turkish Gastarbeiter are still , two generations later , not seen as fully German . 
And the unrest of the children and grandchildren of Algerian , West African , and Moroccan immigrants in the French banlieues attest to France &apos;s failure to assimilate its immigrant population , despite the Republic &apos;s official egalitarian rhetoric . 
Third , and perhaps most importantly , Americans separate Church and State . 
As long as there is a Church of England , if you are Jewish or Muslim or Sikh , there is a subtle level at which you will simply not feel fully English . 
But because the US Founders - many of them descended from people fleeing official religious persecution - guaranteed that there would never be a state-sanctioned religion , no religious group in America , no matter how small , is made to feel marginalized . 
It is for this reason that Americans are not alarmed by visible symbols of different religions in public settings . 
It is assumed that since religion is a private matter for everyone , personal religious symbols are just that - personal . 
A Muslim girl who wears a headscarf in a public school is simply wearing a headscarf , not provocatively challenging a hegemonic social order . 
Fourth , America is defined in terms of a set of values that everyone can share , not as a lineage , a specific history , and a geographical area . 
Immigrant kids who go to US schools learn that America - ideally - is about freedom , aspiration , and tolerance . 
The history that they learn about their new home illustrates how the US fulfills ( or falls short of ) those ideals , whereas an immigrant schoolchild in Europe learns less about ideals and more about a monarchical lineage , a set of historical events , and a roster of &quot; great men . &quot; 
If Western Europe took a leaf from the US , it would be more peaceful within its own borders and better able to use the talents and leadership of its Turkish , Algerian , Caribbean , and other immigrants . 
Only then would we see a British , French , Dutch , or German Obama .
