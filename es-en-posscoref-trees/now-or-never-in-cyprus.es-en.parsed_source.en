Now or Never in Cyprus 
ANKARA - Cyprus is back on the international agenda , with leaders of the island &apos;s rival Greek and Turkish communities engaged in intense negotiations to resolve the divided country &apos;s status . 
But , although new talks are underway , the international community is , not surprisingly , tired of dealing with the issue . 
After all , the Cyprus conflict has dragged on since 1974 , wearing out United Nations Secretary-Generals and special representatives of all sorts , as well as bringing down governments in both Greece and Cyprus . 
In 2004 , the European Union , the United States , and a good part of the international community invested considerable energy in trying to resolve the conflict once and for all . 
Then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his team drafted a plan , which Turkey &apos;s government took very significant political risks in supporting . 
The government convinced the Turkish Cypriots to make a leap of faith and vote in favor of the Annan plan in order to reunite the island . 
Regrettably , the Greek Cypriot leadership at that time actively campaigned against the UN plan . 
Consequently , whereas 65 % of Turkish Cypriots voted in favor of the plan when it was put to a vote on the island , 76 % of Greek Cypriots rejected it . 
Worse yet , Greek Cyprus joined the EU literally days after it spurned the will of the international community , while the EU reneged on its promises to end the Turkish community &apos;s isolation if it supported Annan &apos;s plan . 
Today , many people might think that all of this is water under the bridge . 
But the fate of the Annan plan remains very much a part of Turkish thinking on the Cyprus issue . 
In 2008 , the UN started a new negotiation process for Cyprus . 
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has given his full blessing to a negotiated settlement , and , similar to 2004 , Turkey supports the Turkish Cypriots &quot; willingness to find a viable solution to the division of Cyprus under the UN umbrella . 
But it should be clear that the current talks are the last chance for a negotiated settlement on the island . 
So it is imperative that the transatlantic community recognize that the current talks constitute a historic opportunity . 
No one - not the US , the EU , Turkey , Greece , or the two Cypriot communities - can afford to waste it . 
Either the island will reunite under a UN plan accepted by both sides or the status quo will need to change by some other means . 
The isolation of the Turkish Cypriots , who opted in favor of an internationally acceptable solution , cannot be sustained any longer . 
The talks between Turkish Cypriot President Mehmet Ali Talat and Greek Cypriot President Dimitris Christofias are now entering a critical phase . 
Both leaders need the full support of the transatlantic community . 
The US is particularly well situated to contribute to the process in a positive manner , and its engagement at the appropriate level will be needed in the coming months . 
The US-Turkish partnership , badly strained by the war in Iraq , was reinvigorated by President Barack Obama &apos;s visit to Turkey in June . 
American participation in resolving the Cyprus conflict would ensure that the relationship remains on a sound footing . 
Contrary to many previous rounds of Cyprus negotiations , the issue this time is not confined to the island alone but embraces the wider region . 
The outcome of the ongoing talks , for example , will have a big impact on how Turkey assesses its relations with the EU . 
Should the talks fail , the side that behaves in an uncompromising manner will bear full responsibility for dividing the island forever . 
Moreover , failure to resolve the Cyprus issue would deadlock already strained security cooperation between NATO and the EU . 
The recent visit to Ankara by the new NATO Secretary-General , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , only highlighted again how urgent a Cyprus settlement really is . 
Failure might also have security implications in the Balkans , the Black Sea , and the Eastern Mediterranean - all areas where the US and the EU have vital interests . 
It is for these reasons that the transatlantic community should invest its time and energy in the ongoing UN-sponsored talks . 
Neither the US nor the EU can afford another failure in Cyprus . 
There is simply too much at stake .
