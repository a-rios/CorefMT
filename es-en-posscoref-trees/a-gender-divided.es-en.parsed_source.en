A Gender Divided 
OXFORD - The top and the bottom of the list of countries in Newsweek &apos;s recent cover story , &quot; The 2011 Global Women &apos;s Progress Report , &quot; evoke images of two different worlds . 
At the top of the list - the &quot; Best Places to be a Woman &quot; - we see the usual suspects : Iceland and the Scandinavian countries , the Netherlands , Switzerland , and Canada . 
On that planet , we see rankings in the upper 90 &quot; s for the survey &apos;s five categories : justice , health , education , economics , and politics . 
Women are out-earning men in college degrees ( United States ) , domestic abusers are being banned from their homes and tracked with electronic monitors ( Turkey ) , and female prime ministers are being elected ( Denmark and Australia ) . 
Now look at the other planet , &quot; The Worst Places in the World to be a Woman . &quot; 
In Chad , the worst of the worst , woman have &quot; almost no legal rights , &quot; and girls as young as ten are legally married off , which is also true in Niger , the seventh worst place for a woman . 
Most women in Mali - the fifth worst - have been traumatized by female genital mutilation . 
In Democratic Republic of Congo , 1,100 women are raped every day . 
In Yemen , you are free to beat your wife whenever you like . 
Though it is stunning to see these two worlds in such stark and detailed relief , their existence is not news : development specialists and human rights groups have been calling attention to these inequities for years . 
Some development researchers have started to make a compelling case , too , that oppression of women impedes countries &quot; efforts to escape poverty . 
But the data in the Newsweek list show that we need to frame this issue in stronger , more sweeping terms : When poor countries choose to oppress their own women , they are to some extent choosing their own continued poverty . 
Female oppression is a moral issue ; but it also must be seen as a choice that countries make for short-term &quot; cultural &quot; comfort , at the expense of long-term economic and social progress . 
It is not politically correct to attribute any share of very poor countries &quot; suffering to their own decisions . 
Obviously , the legacy of colonialism - widespread hunger , illiteracy , lack of property or legal recourse , and vulnerability to state violence - is a major factor in their current poverty . 
When the poorest countries - most of them in Africa or with Muslim majorities - choose to sustain and even devise new policies that oppress women , we have to be willing to say that , in some measure , they are choosing the economic misfortune that follows . 
The developed world &apos;s silence suggests that it takes the mistreatment of black and brown women by black and brown men for granted , rather than holding all people to one standard of justice . 
The &quot; surprises &quot; on the Newsweek list confirm that educating women boosts economic prosperity . 
Many countries with histories of colonialism and other forms of tyranny , as well as countries without abundant natural resources , have chosen to educate women and grant them legal rights . 
Some continue to struggle economically , but none is abjectly poor - and some are booming . 
Think of China , India , Malaysia , Indonesia , Brazil , South Korea , and Turkey . 
The low status of women on Planet Worst cannot be blamed on cultural stasis : many of the &quot; surprise &quot; countries - Romania , Portugal , the Philippines , and India - treated women far more unequally a mere 50-100 years ago . 
In Pakistan , marital rape is not illegal today , and there are 800 honor killings a year . 
What kind of economic boom might stagnating Pakistan enjoy if patriarchy relaxed its grip ? 
If you are not innumerate , you can start a business . 
If you are not living in mortal fear of rape and beatings at home , you can organize your community to dig a new well . 
If you are not subjecting your daughter to traumatic genital injury at three and marrying her off at ten , she can go to school . 
Educated , pushy mothers make all the difference . 
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in the Newsweek issue , &quot; The world needs to think more strategically and creatively about tapping into women &apos;s potential for growth . 
Studies show that helping women access trade and grow businesses helps create jobs and boost incomes . &quot; 
But on Planet Worst , forcing terrified , uneducated women to remain at home is more socially acceptable than facing the fact that this means choosing to drag down incomes for everyone . 
It is time to stop tiptoeing around the poorest countries &quot; responsibility to do something essential about their own plight : emancipate their women .
