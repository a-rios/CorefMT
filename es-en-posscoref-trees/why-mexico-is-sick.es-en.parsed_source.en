Why Mexico is Sick 
Mexico City - As I reflect on my troubled country , the lyrics of a Bruce Springsteen song come to mind : &quot; We are far , far away from home . 
Our home is far , far away from us . &quot; 
That &apos;s how it feels to live in Mexico nowadays : far from democratic normalcy ; far from a health system that inspires confidence ; far from a government that builds trust ; far from home and close to everything that imperils it . 
My homeland has become a place where too many people are victims , succumbing to a virus , or gunned down by a drug-trafficker ; assaulted by a robber , shot by an ill-trained policeman , or kidnapped by a member of a criminal gang . 
The flu epidemic , which probably began in the southern state of Veracruz , is yet another sign that all is not well in Mexico . 
The country seems to be caught in a permanent , uneasy tug-of-war between the past and the future , between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path . 
For example , when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases , it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities , because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations . 
Mexico faces mid-term elections for Congress in the fall , and President Felipe Calder√≥n &apos;s National Action Party is trailing slightly in the polls over its main rivals , who would like nothing better than to see a health emergency translate into a political defeat . 
In the face of a public health system that seemed incapable of diagnosing and treating the outbreak quickly , the government felt it had little choice but to shut down Mexico City , dealing a severe blow to an already crippled economy . 
In contrast with Mexico &apos;s authoritarian past , when an &quot; imperial presidency &quot; constituted a major obstacle to modernization , power has been dispersed . 
What the executive branch has relinquished , or been forced to give up , vested interests have seized . 
The problem is no longer too much power in the president &apos;s hands , but too much power in the hands of &quot; veto centers &quot; - including public-sector unions - that are blocking much-needed reforms , including in the health system . 
In all likelihood , the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union recalcitrance . 
The flu also revealed some of Mexico &apos;s other fundamental flaws . 
The political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian remnants and newly established mechanisms for transparency . 
The electoral process has been unable to guarantee decent democratic governance , rein in predatory practices among the political class , or make public officials follow established rules , keep them responsive to citizen preferences , and deter them from channeling public funds into private hands . 
Lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished . 
Impunity , in turn , erodes the credibility of the country &apos;s institutions , including public hospitals and clinics . 
Today , conspiracy theories abound in Mexico about the origins of the virus , because government officials are viewed with such ingrained suspicion . 
Throughout the epidemic , citizens have largely obeyed government guidelines and followed public health prescriptions . 
But that doesn &apos;t mean they trust the government . 
Public-opinion polls reveal that more than 50 % of the population believe that political parties are &quot; not necessary &quot; for the good of the country . 
Disapproval of Congress is growing , and people &apos;s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased . 
In the midst of the epidemic , 66 % of Mexicans believe that the country is regressing . 
Seventy-five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities , and 98 % of crimes are never resolved or punished . 
Public opinion seems disenchanted with a democracy incapable of offering tangible solutions to problems , the flu crisis being the most recent example . 
Saddled by a viral infection , drug-related insecurity , and rising crime , Mexico feels like a besieged place . 
The noted columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa wrote last week : &quot; All that &apos;s missing is for Mexico to get peed on by a dog . &quot; 
Mexico &apos;s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu . 
Over the past ten years , political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform , condemning Mexico to move sideways , even as other emerging markets surge ahead . 
Lately , political battles among key actors have not been about how to build a more effective of representative political system or a more equitable , dynamic economy , but about how to maintain control of accumulated power or distribute it among their allies . 
Political parties appear far removed from citizen demands , beset by internal divisions , incapable of addressing deep-rooted inequality and lawlessness , and prone to populist or authoritarian leadership that promises quick fixes to entrenched problems . 
Mexico &apos;s current quandary is the flu , but it faces more important challenges than a mutating microbe . 
With more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in drug-related violence last year , Mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light : a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently insensitive to their plight . 
In this national crisis , Mexico &apos;s people have closed ranks , collaborated , and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest . 
But their political and economic elites frequently seem incapable of doing so . 
That is why home seems far , far away for so many Mexicans .
