Microbiology \ u0027s World Wide Web 
All the fashionable talk nowadays about computer &quot; viruses &quot; explains what these culprits do by forging an analogy to their biological namesakes . 
But it is equally enlightening to portray the biosphere of real , living microbes as a world wide web of informational exchange . 
Indeed , microbes exchange information with each other and their environment , with DNA serving as the packets of data going every which way . 
Microbes differ from computer viruses because they not only spread but evolve , and do so at a faster pace than their hosts . 
Microbes are in fact well designed to exploit this difference to their advantage in the war that occasionally erupts between them and other species - a war we see as disease and death . 
It is the microbe &apos;s capacity to transfer information to other organisms that makes the analogy with the World Wide Web plausible . 
Like computer viruses , many living viruses can integrate ( download ) their own DNA into their host &apos;s genetic material ( the genome ) , and this can be copied and passed on . 
Indeed , even our own , human , evolution is partly explained by these encounters with microbes . 
Many segments of human DNA originated from historical encounters with a particular type of viruses , known as retroviruses , which &quot; downloaded &quot; their information into human cells and integrated it into human DNA . 
The field of molecular genetics , which began in 1944 , when DNA was proven to be the mechanism by which inherited characteristics are passed on , brought microbes to the center of many biological investigations . 
Systems composed of microbes are often the most convenient models to study evolution in a laboratory . 
What makes the evolution of microbes so intriguing - and worrisome - is their combination of vast populations and intense fluctuations within those populations . 
Some microbes possess a gene that enhances their variability , and this allows them to mutate at different rates in response to factors in the environment - something larger organisms rarely do . 
Also , while more advanced life forms , like humans , cannot mate with members of other species , microbial evolution is less constrained by this &quot; species barrier . &quot; 
Indeed , through a processes known as Aplasmid transfer , &quot; microbes can exchange biological innovations among themselves , including - most importantly and dangerously - resistance to antibiotics , which one species of microbes can pass on to another . 
The sheer number of microbes and their ability to exchange information is a formula for high-speed evolution . 
Populations of microbes fluctuate by many billions on a daily basis as they move between their host organisms and encounter antibiotics , antibodies , drought , or other natural hazards to which their genetic evolution may respond . 
A simple comparison of the pace of the evolution of microbes and their multicellular hosts suggests a millionfold or billionfold advantage to the microbe . 
One year in the life of a microbe , indeed , easily surpasses the ages it took for all mammals to evolve ! 
By that measure , mankind is playing out of its evolutionary league . 
Indeed , many complex species lost the war with microbes to become extinct . 
Human history , too , has been marked by catastrophic microbe-caused plagues . 
While humanity has survived all these microbe-inspired disasters so far , maintaining our survival in a world in which germs / viruses and their hosts continuously interact in new ways will require us to think in innovative ways as well , and to bring ever more sophisticated technical wit and social intelligence to the contest . 
In my recent work , I explore the implications of this gross imbalance in the evolutionary pace of humans as compared to microbes and viruses . 
Had the entire evolutionary drive of microbes been directed at optimizing their virulence and lethality , larger species would not have survived such murderous competition . 
But , of course , neither would many microbes have survived , because they depend on other species for their habitat . 
Despite the fact that microbes do not ordinarily seek to maximize their virulence , most research on infectious disease focuses on the mechanisms by which the harmful effects of microbes are felt , as well as on the ways in which host organisms adapt ( mainly through the immune system ) to fight that virulence . 
Very little attention has been given to the microbes &quot; internal mechanisms for sustaining themselves as inhabitants within their hosts , which includes the interest the microbe shares with its host in controlling and limiting the damage it does . 
After all , microbes reside in their hosts in order to gain from the exchange . 
Startling examples show that a microbe &apos;s goal is , indeed , joint survival with its host . 
In some cases , the host &apos;s immune system is even manipulated by one parasite in order to enhance the host &apos;s resistance to super-infection by rival , invading parasites . 
We may thus have to learn how to exploit these synergies and use the weapons that microbes provide us , rather than look at them only as mortal enemies marked for peremptory extermination . 
Just as scientists study entire ecological systems to see how the various parts interact , we must regard the human body as an extended genome . 
Its parts consist of the nuclear DNA genome ( karyome ) , a chondriome ( mitochondria ) , and what I call the microbiome : the menagerie of the body &apos;s attendant microbes . 
We must study the microbes that we carry within us and on our surfaces as part of a shared embodiment . 
If you can &apos;t beat them , join them ! the old saying goes , and for better and worse our fates are joined with the microbes that share our bodies . 
We can and will benefit from a deeper understanding of just how they work within and with us .
