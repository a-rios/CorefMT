America &apos;s Self-Defeating Hegemony 
When I wrote about the &quot; end of history &quot; almost twenty years ago , one thing that I did not anticipate was the degree to which American behavior and misjudgments would make anti-Americanism one of the chief fault-lines of global politics . 
And yet , particularly since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , that is precisely what has happened , owing to four key mistakes made by the Bush administration . 
First , the doctrine of &quot; preemption , &quot; which was devised in response to the 2001 attacks , was inappropriately broadened to include Iraq and other so-called &quot; rogue states &quot; that threatened to develop weapons of mass destruction . 
To be sure , preemption is fully justified vis-Ã -vis stateless terrorists wielding such weapons . 
But it cannot be the core of a general non-proliferation policy , whereby the United States intervenes militarily everywhere to prevent the development of nuclear weapons . 
The cost of executing such a policy simply would be too high ( several hundred billion dollars and tens of thousands of casualties in Iraq and still counting ) . 
This is why the Bush administration has shied away from military confrontations with North Korea and Iran , despite its veneration of Israel &apos;s air strike on Iraq &apos;s Osirak reactor in 1981 , which set back Saddam Hussein &apos;s nuclear program by several years . 
After all , the very success of that attack meant that such limited intervention could never be repeated , because would-be proliferators learned to bury , hide , or duplicate their nascent weapons programs . 
The second important miscalculation concerned the likely global reaction to America &apos;s exercise of its hegemonic power . 
Many people within the Bush administration believed that even without approval by the UN Security Council or NATO , American power would be legitimized by its successful use . 
This had been the pattern for many US initiatives during the Cold War , and in the Balkans during the 1990 &quot; s ; back then , it was known as &quot; leadership &quot; rather than &quot; unilateralism . &quot; 
But , by the time of the Iraq war , conditions had changed : the US had grown so powerful relative to the rest of the world that the lack of reciprocity became an intense source of irritation even to America &apos;s closest allies . 
The structural anti-Americanism arising from the global distribution of power was evident well before the Iraq war , in the opposition to American-led globalization during the Clinton years . 
But it was exacerbated by the Bush administration &apos;s &quot; in-your-face &quot; disregard for a variety of international institutions as soon it came into office - a pattern that continued through the onset of the Iraq war . 
America &apos;s third mistake was to overestimate how effective conventional military power would be in dealing with the weak states and networked transnational organizations that characterize international politics , at least in the broader Middle East . 
It is worth pondering why a country with more military power than any other in human history , and that spends as much on its military as virtually the rest of the world combined , cannot bring security to a small country of 24 million people after more than three years of occupation . 
At least part of the problem is that it is dealing with complex social forces that are not organized into centralized hierarchies that can enforce rules , and thus be deterred , coerced , or otherwise manipulated through conventional power . 
Israel made a similar mistake in thinking that it could use its enormous margin of conventional military power to destroy Hezbollah in last summer &apos;s Lebanon War . 
Both Israel and the US are nostalgic for a twentieth-century world of nation-states , which is understandable , since that is the world to which the kind of conventional power they possess is best suited . 
But nostalgia has led both states to misinterpret the challenges they now face , whether by linking al-Qaeda to Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq , or Hezbollah to Iran and Syria . 
This linkage does exist in the case of Hezbollah , but the networked actors have their own social roots and are not simply pawns used by regional powers . 
This is why the exercise of conventional power has become frustrating . 
Finally , the Bush administration &apos;s use of power has lacked not only a compelling strategy or doctrine , but also simple competence . 
In Iraq alone , the administration misestimated the threat of WMD , failed to plan adequately for the occupation , and then proved unable to adjust quickly when things went wrong . 
To this day , it has dropped the ball on very straightforward operational issues in Iraq , such as funding democracy promotion efforts . 
Incompetence in implementation has strategic consequences . 
Many of the voices that called for , and then bungled , military intervention in Iraq are now calling for war with Iran . 
Why should the rest of the world think that conflict with a larger and more resolute enemy would be handled any more capably ? 
But the fundamental problem remains the lopsided distribution of power in the international system . 
Any country in the same position as the US , even a democracy , would be tempted to exercise its hegemonic power with less and less restraint . 
America &apos;s founding fathers were motivated by a similar belief that unchecked power , even when democratically legitimated , could be dangerous , which is why they created a constitutional system of internally separated powers to limit the executive . 
Such a system does not exist on a global scale today , which may explain how America got into such trouble . 
A smoother international distribution of power , even in a global system that is less than fully democratic , would pose fewer temptations to abandon the prudent exercise of power .
