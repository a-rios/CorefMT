Thick as BRICS 
MEXICO CITY - When the United Nations voted for what was known as partition and created the State of Israel 64 years ago , subsequently granting it full membership , several Latin American countries - Brazil , El Salvador , Argentina , Colombia , Chile , Honduras - abstained , or , in the case of Cuba , voted against the relevant resolutions . 
Mexico abstained on partition , though it voted in favor of admitting Israel to the UN a few months later , and subsequently recognized the Jewish state , acknowledging that its national interest was best served by not taking sides in the Middle East imbroglio . 
In the coming weeks , most Latin American countries will vote in favor of some form of UN membership or recognition of statehood that the Palestinian Authority is seeking . 
But some will not . 
The issue is not a simple one for the Security Council &apos;s two Latin American non-permanent members , Brazil and Colombia , or for Cuba , Nicaragua , Venezuela , Costa Rica , Argentina , Bolivia , Chile , Ecuador , Peru , Uruguay , and Honduras , which have already recognized Palestine , but have not yet voted to grant it &quot; observer &quot; status at the UN . 
To become a full-fledged UN member , the Security Council must recommend the move to the General Assembly ; but upgrading the Palestinian Authority &apos;s status to that of the Vatican - which in theory would allow it to participate in many UN agencies , including the International Criminal Court - requires only a two-thirds vote in the General Assembly . 
In any case , the political consequences overshadow legal or bureaucratic issues . 
Forcing the US to use its veto in the Security Council , or obtaining the support of more than 150 of the UN &apos;s 193 member states in the General Assembly , would be a huge defeat for Israel and the US , which is why the Latin American votes are important . 
Brazil has stated that it intends to vote in the Security Council in favor of recommending Palestine &apos;s admission to the General Assembly ; 
Colombia has said that it plans to abstain . 
Most other Latin American countries would probably vote in favor of some sort of enhanced status for the Palestinian Authority . 
The Jewish community in the United States , and to a lesser extent President Barack Obama &apos;s administration , has attempted to convince Chile and Mexico , which have not yet made their stances explicit , that nothing would be gained by isolating Israel ( or the US , for that matter ) on this issue . 
Indeed , little would change on the ground even with full Palestinian statehood if Israel and the US do not accept it - and Mexico and Chile could lose much in distancing themselves from an ally on a question of great importance to it . 
In short , as was the case more than a half-century ago , the region has not spoken with a single voice on these crucial issues . 
Now , as then , most Latin American countries have not taken a principled stand - either for or against Israel , or for or against the Palestinians . 
Instead , they have followed the path of expedience , their positions depending on the relative clout and stridency of their societies &quot; Jewish or Arab communities , and on urging from Washington or from the so-called ALBA bloc of Cuba , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , and Paraguay . 
Latin Americans &quot; lack of conviction on such grave matters - with the exception of the ALBA countries , which have the wrong convictions , but nonetheless believe in them almost religiously - has marginalized the region on other important international issues , such as the recent crisis in Libya , and the ongoing one in Syria . 
On the UN resolution establishing a no-fly zone and civilian protection in Libya , Brazil , along with three of the other &quot; BRICS &quot; ( and world power wannabes ) - Russia , India , and China - abstained . 
The fourth , South Africa , went along only grudgingly . 
And now , on the European and American attempt to impose UN-mandated sanctions on Syria &apos;s President Bashar al-Assad , the BRICS have gone from bad to worse . 
First , they dispatched a three-country mission ( Brazil , India , and South Africa ) to Damascus to &quot; persuade &quot; Assad not to murder his people . 
Needless to say , he did not respond that , yes , he had killed a few thousand here and there , but that now that they brought it up , he would try to be more careful . 
Then they made statement after statement claiming that Syria was not Libya , and they would not allow another Western intervention to achieve regime change in another Arab country just because its people seemed upset with the local dictator . 
In the words of a senior NGO human rights leader : &quot; They &apos;re punishing the Syrian people because they were unhappy that NATO took the mandate of protecting civilians in Libya and transformed it into a mandate for regime change . &quot; 
Given their growing role in the global economy , it is understandable that larger Latin American countries , along with the other BRICS , are seeking a more influential world role . 
This is not the way to achieve it .
