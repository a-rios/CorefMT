Charlie and the Anti-Muslim Media Factory 
PARIS - It is facile to frame the deadly attack on Charlie Hebdo as an attack on freedom of expression . 
Are we supposed to be surprised that a global terror organization known for its brutal disregard for human rights and humane values would attack a media outlet that has specialized in provoking it ? 
Just as much of the social media in the Arab / Muslim world has made anti-Semitic rants routine , there is a global industry of outlets dedicated to all things anti-Muslim . 
In any given week , French , European , ( and increasingly Indian ) journalists , bloggers , tweeters , and others regularly express all sorts of things that are offensive or provocative to Muslims - or at least the most devout and fanatical among them . 
There are literally hundreds of websites , radio programs , and TV networks that specialize in anti-Muslim and anti-Islam propaganda . 
The Twitter hashtag # killallMoslems has been around since 2011 . 
While this abundance of offensiveness may comfort those concerned about freedom of expression , it does not give me any comfort as a European Muslim . 
Europe &apos;s suspicion of Islam is not new , of course , and one could say that the feeling is mutual . 
But the level of anti-Muslim provocation has become unprecedented recently . 
In Germany , the so-called Pegida movement now holds weekly anti-Muslim marches in several cities ( though , in fairness , even bigger rallies , and almost all of Germany &apos;s political elite , have opposed the Pegida marchers ) . 
Last year , the mayor of Sargé-lès-le Mans , a French town of 3,500 people with 180 Muslim students , sought to impose pork meat on all schools . 
A couple of years earlier , then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy joined in a campaign to ban halal meat branding , which became an election issue . 
The Swiss , meanwhile , have banned minarets . 
The list goes on . 
Minorities are easy targets everywhere ( certainly , Christians and Jews do not have an easy time nowadays in Muslim-majority countries ) . 
And , given the fear campaign propagated by Al Qaeda and its affiliates , on the one hand , and right-wing racists , on the other , many people are unaware that Muslims are actually a very small minority in all European ( and Western ) countries . 
That is why Charlie Hebdo &apos;s mockery of the sacred beliefs of minorities ( Jews , Muslims , and gays alike ) is not an act of bravery . 
Most people abstain from such provocations not because they are cowards , but because they believe , quite reasonably , that such behavior serves no good or useful purpose . 
European Muslims are no less peaceful than their non-Muslim neighbors . 
Almost all terrorist acts carried out by Muslims in Europe and other countries have been the work of affiliates of one umbrella organization - Al Qaeda . 
Though this organization &apos;s far-reaching influence is worrisome , it is also comforting to know how limited violent ideology is among Muslims , particularly in the West . 
Indeed , there are no real homegrown Islamist terrorist organizations of any significance in Europe . 
Radicalized European Muslims must look elsewhere . 
To be sure , Muslim-majority countries are not known for their affection for free speech . 
But , in the wake of the attack on Charlie Hebdo , it is worth noting that , apart from war-torn Iraq and Syria , more journalists are killed each year in the largely Catholic Philippines than in any Muslim-majority country . 
Unfortunately , as the horrific murder of 77 people by Anders Breivik in my adopted country of Norway has shown us , it only takes one organization or one individual to commit an atrocity , whatever a society &apos;s level of education and living standards . 
Yet , while lone wolves like Breivik are hard to detect , active members of terror organizations are much easier to detect and monitor . 
This is where the attacks in Paris become more troublesome . 
Here was a case of a catastrophic intelligence and security failure that allowed a group of four who were known to the police to be members of a globally active terrorist organization to operate with relative ease in the French capital . 
Why were they on the loose ? 
Why were they not monitored and stopped earlier ? 
How many more such people , known to the police , are out there ? 
This is the discussion that is needed . 
Focusing the debate solely on Islam and Muslims and the prospect of religious reform , integration , and co-existence is a way to camouflage failure . 
Muslims are already very much part of every sphere of European life , including the security apparatus and the army . 
European Muslims are integrated in their societies as professionals , athletes , academics , and civic leaders . 
If we European Muslims are expected to identify with our citizenships and other secular identities , then our fellow Europeans should not categorize us by our religious identity . 
No one should presume that European Muslims must apologize or explain the actions of a terrorist organization with a cult-like religious ideology , just as no one expected Norwegians to apologize for Breivik . 
Al Qaeda and its affiliates have been known to attract disenchanted individuals from among Muslim and non-Muslim Europeans alike . 
If we close our eyes , we can think that the Paris attacks exposed a contradiction between Islam and freedom of expression - and between Muslims and Europeans . 
If we open them and start looking at cause and effect , we can avoid the abyss to which such willful blindness beckons us . 
The Paris attacks targeted innocent people everywhere , and the public deserves answers from those whose job it is to prevent such incidents from happening .
