Five Steps Forward in 2011 
MILAN - The worst of the financial / economic crisis seems to be over . 
Asset markets performed reasonably well in 2010 . 
Growth in the United States and parts of Europe returned . 
Private-sector deleveraging continued , but was counter-balanced by rising public-sector deficits and debt . 
And emerging-market growth returned to pre-crisis levels and appears to be sustainable , helped by unorthodox policies designed to &quot; sterilize &quot; massive capital inflows . 
But continued high growth in emerging markets depends on avoiding a second major downturn in the advanced economies , which continue to absorb a large ( though declining ) share of their exports . 
Slow growth is manageable . 
Thus , for the emerging economies , advanced countries downside risks and the spillover effects of their recovery policies are the key areas of concern . 
In several advanced countries , including the US , growth and employment prospects are starting to diverge widely , endangering social cohesion and economic openness . 
This situation is largely the result of predictable post-crisis economic dynamics , as firms and households in advanced countries repair their balance sheets . 
But it also reflects non-cooperative policy choices . 
Indeed , attempts to coordinate economic policy across the G-20 , which accounts for 85 % of global GDP , fell short of what was hoped for in 2010 . 
So what would a coordinated set of global economic policies look like ? 
First , it would include credible plans in Europe and the US to restore fiscal balance . 
In Europe , that means agreeing on burden-sharing for re-capitalizing countries where deficits and debt have cut off market access or led to prohibitively high borrowing costs . 
Restructuring damages the euro , and fiscal consolidation in the distressed countries , while necessary , is probably not sufficient . 
That leaves Europe &apos;s stronger countries , particularly Germany , with the residual liability . 
Greater fiscal centralization and political unification seem inevitable , but it may take time to muddle through to that outcome . 
In the US , the main challenge is to restore fiscal balance without damaging the recovery and future growth . 
Getting the balance correct is complicated by the fact that the right fears the left will use fiscal stimulus as a path to permanently larger government , a path that the right ( and apparently the general public ) is unwilling to follow . 
The second item on the agenda is a pull-back from quantitative easing in the US , which is subjecting the emerging economies to a flood of capital , rising commodity prices , inflation , and asset bubbles . 
Intervention may be needed in fragile sectors of the US economy , like housing , where faltering performance could produce another downturn . 
But such intervention can and must be far more precisely targeted than QE2 . 
America &apos;s reluctance to target areas of weakness or fragility leaves the impression externally that QE2 &quot; s real goal is to weaken the dollar . 
Beyond that , it is unclear whether or how QE2 will produce much growth . 
Its proponents argue that it is the main policy instrument left , and that it will work by increasing credit or lowering the discount rate , which will raise asset prices and hence consumption via balance-sheet effects . 
But do we really want to see the US leveraged up to its ears again ? 
Probably not . 
On the balance-sheet side , even if a temporary decline in long-term interest rates pushes up asset values , debt-burdened households with uncertain employment prospects are unlikely to rush to consume . 
After all , the wealth effect works only when people believe that the wealth is permanent . 
Third , advanced and emerging economies that are running chronic surpluses must get rid of them . 
The policies needed to do so vary by country and involve structural shifts . 
In the case of China , a key part of its 12th five-year plan is to shift income to the household sector , where the savings rate is high but still lower than the corporate rate . 
The economy can then use household savings ( with appropriate financial intermediation ) to finance corporate and government investment , rather than the US government . 
That structural shift , in combination with the renminbi &apos;s strengthening effective real exchange rate relative to the dollar , owing to inflation and rapidly rising wages in export sectors , offers hope that China &apos;s surplus will fall . 
The fourth item concerns the fact that the global economy will be out of balance so long as the US runs large current-account deficits . 
With the post-crisis resetting of domestic consumption and savings , US aggregate demand will remain depressed . 
In the longer run , that gap needs to be filled by higher foreign demand and increased export potential . 
The US tradable sector is growing . 
Its major sub-sectors - increasingly , high value-added ( per person employed ) services - are highly competitive and growing . 
But they are not big enough to fill the gap . 
Imports could fall , as they did during the crisis , but that was due to declining demand , not to a shift in demand in favor of domestic producers . 
The tradable sector accounts for just 30 % of the US economy ( by value added ) , and employment growth in the tradable sector is negligible . 
If employment growth in the non-tradable sector - dominated by government and health care - falters , the tradable sector will have to take up the slack . 
The problem is that it can &apos;t , even with a depreciating currency . 
If exports are to grow substantially , the scope of the tradable sector must expand . 
Fifth , and finally , major holders of reserves must agree to deploy them in a way aimed at maintaining global financial stability and preventing excessively volatile exchange-rate and capital movements . 
With periodic bouts of contagion in the eurozone and residual uncertainty about America &apos;s commitment to a strong dollar and fiscal discipline , major reserve holders in Asia and the Gulf need to become a stabilizing counterweight . 
None of these steps are easy . 
They will take time . 
But , taken together , they would help reduce uncertainty and restore a pattern of stability and inclusive growth to the global economy , thereby bolstering its continued openness . 
In avoiding second- or third-best outcomes and policy accidents , international economic policy coordination , though difficult , has a vital role to play .
