Argentina &apos;s Bumpy Ride 
SANTIAGO - &quot; Fasten your seat belts , because it should be a bumpy ride , &quot; the captain warned from the cockpit . 
We were about to enter Argentine airspace . 
Investors looking to do business in Argentina have long been issued similar warnings . 
This is the country that scholars study when they want to understand financial crises . 
The country &apos;s largest such crisis , in 2001 , brought down the local banking system and caused the Argentine government to default on its debts . 
The economy contracted by a whopping 18 % , and the unemployment rate peaked above 22 % . 
After a period of calm that has now lasted a decade , dire economic warnings are back . Forecasts for the world economy are turning pessimistic , and economists in export-dependent Argentina are finding much to worry about . 
Itau , Latin America &apos;s largest bank , is predicting GDP growth in Argentina of only 3.2 % next year , down sharply from 6 % in 2011 . 
Inflation is another concern . 
With official figures widely discredited , private analysts estimate that consumer prices are rising at an annual rate of 25 % or more . 
Those are careful estimates by serious economists . 
But , then again , one should take all economic forecasts about Argentina with a grain of salt . 
In the decade since the last crisis , Argentine policymakers have broken almost every rule in the economic-policy playbook . 
Again and again , local and international economists have issued dire warnings about what would happen if it persisted in its heterodoxy . 
And yet Argentina has managed to grow fast , doubling per capita income since 2002 . 
Energy policy is a perfect example of a wrongheaded strategy . 
The Argentine government fixed gas prices , despite ongoing inflation . 
Gas became artificially cheap , consumers seldom bothered to turn the thermostat down , and producers stopped investing . 
As a result Argentina , once a thriving gas exporter , had to seek imports to overcome domestic shortages . 
What saved Argentina over the last decade were highly favorable external conditions : sky-high global commodity prices and technological innovations that greatly increased farm yields . 
Neighboring Brazil helped by undergoing a boom of its own , which pumped up demand for a wide range of Argentine products . 
With rising tax revenues and the burden of debt gone after the default a decade ago , the government went on a spending spree : real public expenditure grew at double-digit rates most years since 2002 . 
At the same time , the central bank kept interest rates low , so that the inflation-adjusted cost of loans is zero or negative . 
In this environment , Argentine consumers naturally also went on a spending spree , and corporate profits rose accordingly . 
Not long ago , I met with a group of foreign investors in Argentina . 
They owned everything from paper mills to department stores and supermarket chains . 
After they finished trading stories of endless red tape and arbitrary government decisions , I asked why they kept investing in Argentina . 
&quot; Because we make a lot of money , &quot; was the unanimous answer . 
The question making the rounds in Argentina nowadays is whether this period of plenty is coming to an end . 
You would not feel any such anxiety in Buenos Aires shopping malls , which are as crowded as ever . 
Nor could you infer it from the behavior of voters , who seem poised to re-elect President Cristina Kirchner in October . 
But the signs of economic deterioration are surely there . 
With imports still growing strongly and commodity prices beginning to fall as a result of the world slowdown , Argentina &apos;s large trade surplus is disappearing quickly . 
Fearing a weaker peso , spooked investors demand dollars . 
Capital is flowing out of the country , and official reserves are slowly being depleted . 
To stem the outflow of dollars , the central bank may well be forced to raise interest rates . 
That , plus the gloomy international outlook and a fiscal policy that will have to become less expansionary after the election , will slow the economy down . 
A bumpy ride is acceptable as long as the landing is smooth . 
Ensuring that outcome will be the number one job for a newly re-elected President Cristina Kirchner . 
It will prove a difficult period at the controls .
