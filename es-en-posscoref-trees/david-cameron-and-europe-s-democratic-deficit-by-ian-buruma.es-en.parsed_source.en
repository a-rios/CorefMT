Does Europe Need Britain ? 
NEW YORK - Many people in the United Kingdom believe that their country can do perfectly well outside the European Union . 
They dream of Britain as a kind of Singapore of the West , a commercial powerhouse ruled from the City of London . 
That is why Prime Minister David Cameron felt obliged to offer the British people a referendum on a simple question : in or out . 
Cameron does not personally want Britain to leave the EU , but he knows that some form of democratic consent is needed for future British governments to settle the matter . 
The year of the promised referendum , 2017 , is comfortably far away . 
Many things may change in the meantime . 
If the eurozone forges ahead , what countries outside the zone do may not matter much anymore . 
Moreover , other Europeans may end up agreeing with Cameron that ever closer political union in Europe is undesirable - if they have a choice , that is , which is by no means certain . 
In the meantime , there is another question to be considered : how many Europeans want Britain to stay in the EU ? 
The answer depends partly on nationality . 
The smaller northern countries , such as the Netherlands , have traditionally wanted Britain to be in . 
And yet , as memories of World War II fade , more and more people in the Netherlands and Scandinavia feel content to be under Germany &apos;s powerful wings . 
But Germany itself would probably prefer to keep its British partner , rather than face the Mediterranean countries alone . 
Culture still matters . 
France is a different matter . 
According to a recent poll , 54 % of the French would prefer Britain to leave the EU . 
Britain never was very popular in France . 
President Charles de Gaulle blocked British entry into the European Economic Community twice . 
France , in his grandiose view , was the natural guardian of European values , which , according to him , were coextensive with French values . 
In 1930 , Winston Churchill said of his country : &quot; We are with Europe , but not of it . &quot; 
It is a sentiment still shared by many in Britain . 
As he once put it , somewhat ironically , Britain would lose its identity as a member of a European union , and this would be a great pity . 
But culture and nationality , or even Gaullist chauvinism , cannot explain everything . 
There is an important political dimension to the pro- or anti-British sentiments in Europe . 
The French who said they wanted Britain to leave the EU were largely on the left , while many who held the opposite view were further to the right . 
It is not entirely clear why , though it is probably because the right includes neo-liberals , who share the British attitude to business and free trade . 
Like leftists everywhere , the French left favors a large degree of state control of the economy , together with technocratic rather than liberal solutions to social and economic problems . 
This type of thinking has played a vital role in the development of European institutions . 
Jean Monnet , one of the godfathers of European unification , embodied this tendency - a born bureaucrat who distrusted politicians . 
Democratic politics is messy and divisive , and riddled with compromises . 
Monnet hated all that . 
He was obsessed by the ideal of unity . 
Monnet and other European technocrats were not exactly opposed to democracy , but in their zeal to unify Europe &apos;s diverse nation-states , they often appeared to ignore it . 
The Eurocrats knew what was best for Europe &apos;s citizens , and they knew what needed to be done . 
Too much public debate , or interference from citizens and their political representatives , would only slow things down . 
Hence the typical EU language about &quot; unstoppable trains &quot; and &quot; irreversible decisions &quot; : citizens are not supposed to question the wisdom of great planners . 
This emphasis on planning was one reason why the &quot; European project &quot; always appealed to the left - and not only in France . 
The technocratic belief in ideal models is inherently utopian . 
Those on the left also shared a deep aversion to nationalism , born of two disastrous European wars . 
The British , whose Churchillian nationalism helped them to prevail against Hitler &apos;s attacks , never shared this aversion . 
And their deep pride in Britain &apos;s liberal-democratic tradition made them suspicious of meddling Brussels bureaucrats . 
Some of this is doubtless the result of chauvinism , even xenophobia . 
But it would be wrong simply to dismiss British doubts about the European drive toward greater unity . 
It is not just a nationalist reaction . 
British resistance to grand European plans is the democratic grit in an enterprise that could become authoritarian , despite having the best intentions , and should serve as a necessary corrective to the utopianism of the technocrats . 
Those who favor European unification should take criticisms of its political flaws very seriously . 
Doing so is the only chance to ensure that a united Europe , whatever form it takes , will be democratic , as well as economically beneficial . 
That is why Europe needs Britain : not as an offshore center of banking and commerce , but as a difficult , questioning , stubbornly democratic partner .
