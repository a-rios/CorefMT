Is Ignorance Bliss ? 
The age of the Renaissance man is long gone . 
No one thinks it is possible anymore for an individual to grasp , fully , all areas of science and technology . 
Popular software contains millions of lines of code . 
Mechanisms of the immune response for just one kind of lymphocyte take up thousands of pages of scholarly journals . 
An iPod &apos;s elegantly simple appearance masks underlying technology that is understood by only a tiny percentage of its users . 
But , despite the vast incompleteness of our knowledge , recent research suggests that most people think that they know far more than they actually do . 
We freely admit to not knowing everything about how a helicopter flies or a printing press prints , but we are not nearly modest enough about our ignorance . 
The easiest way to show this is to have people to rate the completeness of their knowledge on a seven-point scale . 
For any question , a &quot; 7 &quot; denotes the equivalent of a perfectly detailed mental blueprint , and a &quot; 1 &quot; implies almost no sense of a particular mechanism at all , just a vague image . 
People happily , and reliably , assign numbers to their understandings of everything from complex machines to biological systems to natural phenomena such as the tides ; but these ratings are usually far higher than their actual knowledge . 
We can measure the discrepancy between what we think we know and what we actually know by simply asking people , after they have given their initial ratings , to tell us how some things work in as much detail as they can and then to rate their knowledge again in light of their attempt to explain . 
Similarly , we can ask them to answer critical diagnostic questions ( for example , &quot; How does a helicopter go from hovering in place to flying forward ? &quot; ) 
In all of these cases , people somewhat sheepishly confess that their level of understanding was far worse than they originally thought . 
People are often surprised and dismayed at their ignorance , but we are not generally bad at estimating how much we know . 
Instead , we have a special deficit with regard to our explanatory understandings . 
We are good at estimating how well we know simple facts ( such as the capitals of countries ) , procedures ( such as how to make an international phone call ) , and narratives ( such as the plots of well-known movies ) . 
We can be appropriately modest about our knowledge of other things , but not so about our ability to explain the workings of the world . 
Several factors converge to create this illusion of knowledge . 
When Leon Rozenblit and I uncovered the illusion and its specificity , we ran an extensive series of studies exploring why explanatory understanding is so vulnerable to a false sense of knowing . 
All of the factors that we identified are less influential for facts , procedures , and narratives . 
One important factor underlying the illusion of explanatory depth arises from the richly hierarchical nature of most complex systems , which means that they can be understood at several levels of analysis . 
One can understand how a computer &quot; works &quot; in terms of the high-level functions of the mouse , the hard drive , and the display while not having any understanding of the mechanisms that enable a cursor to move when a mouse is moved , or allow information to be stored and erased , or control pixels on a screen . 
This hierarchical structure of complex causal systems seduces us into a sense of understanding at a high level , which is then mistaken for having an understanding at a lower level . 
A second factor is the false comfort we derive from seeing the parts of a system . 
The more parts you can see , the more you think you know how those parts actually work . 
Thus , the illusion is stronger for objects with easy-to-inspect parts than it is for objects with more invisible , inaccessible , or microscopic parts . 
For example , we may think that we understand the mind much better than we do when we see images of glowing brain regions . 
Finally , we often figure out things on the fly when they are in front of us , but then falsely assume that we came to the object with a full understanding in our heads rather than using and manipulating the object to decipher its mechanism . 
There may be a silver lining to our inflated sense of understanding . 
The world is , of course , far too complex for any lone person to fully grasp . 
If a gnawing sense of ignorance kept us diving deeper in our quest to understand everything we encountered , we might suffocate in the details in one area and miss other areas completely . 
The illusion of explanatory depth may stop us at just about the right level of understanding , one that enables us to know how to get more information from others when we really need it without being overwhelmed . 
It would perhaps be better if we recognized the limits our own explanatory ability , but there may be some adaptive value of those limits as well .
