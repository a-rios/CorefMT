The Eurozone &apos;s Minsky Conundrum 
BRUSSELS - Stubbornly low inflation has the European Central Bank worried . 
As it stands , the headline consumer price index in the eurozone hovers around zero , and even core inflation remains below 1 % - too far for comfort from the ECB &apos;s target of around 2 % . 
While a new round of weakness in global commodity prices earlier this year contributed to these figures , it does not explain the weakness in longer-term inflation expectations , which have improved little since March , when the ECB started its massive â‚¬ 60 billion ( $ 66.3 billion ) per month bond-buying program . 
But instead of rethinking its strategy , the ECB is considering doubling down : buying even more bonds and lowering its benchmark interest rate even further into negative territory . 
This would be a serious mistake . 
Easier credit conditions and lower interest rates are supposed to boost growth by stimulating investment and consumption demand . 
But in the core of the eurozone - countries like Germany and the Netherlands - credit has been plentiful , and interest rates have been close to zero for some time , so there was never much chance that bond purchases would have a significant impact there . 
And , indeed , the European Commission &apos;s most recent economic forecast shows that spending in the core countries has not increased as a result of the ECB &apos;s policies ; 
Of course , in the highly indebted peripheral countries , there was room for interest rates to fall and for credit supply to grow - and they have , leading governments and households to increase their spending . 
While the asymmetrical impact of the ECB &apos;s policy is appropriate in principle ( because unemployment is much higher in the periphery ) , the reality is that a recovery supported by the least solvent economies is not sustainable . 
Back in 1986 , Hyman Minsky warned about the longer-term dangers to financial stability if &quot; Ponzi &quot; borrowers - those who can service their debt only with new debt - become the main pillar of the economy . 
A zero-interest-rate environment is of course ideal for such borrowers , because there is nothing to provide an indication of solvency ; borrowers can just roll over their debt . 
But it is bad for those with a strong asset position ; by reducing their spending power , it spurs them to save even more . 
The standard response to Minsky &apos;s concern - that the spenders can &apos;t afford it and the savers aren &apos;t spending - is that monetary policy should focus on ensuring price stability , while macroprudential policy aims to safeguard financial stability by limiting borrowing by highly indebted agents . 
But this approach does not work . 
If macroprudential policy limited additional credit to marginal borrowers effectively , monetary policy would have no impact on demand ( as long as the most solvent agents refuse to spend more ) . 
This problem arose in the United States after the 2001 recession . 
Although the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low for a protracted period , the corporate sector did not increase its investment . 
The recovery was ultimately fueled by so-called &quot; subprime &quot; mortgages : home-purchase loans extended to borrowers with lower credit ratings . 
The result , as we know , was a mega-bubble that triggered the 2008 financial crisis . 
In the eurozone &apos;s case , the risk is compounded by the ineffectiveness of its key macroprudential instrument , the Stability and Growth Pact , in limiting countries &quot; spending , as lower interest rates give debtor countries leeway to spend more . 
Public debt as a share of GDP is on the rise in Italy and Spain , even though both countries , with their eurozone partners , have committed to reducing the debt ratio . 
In fact , even without lower interest rates , the deficit limits that the Pact imposes have proved to be non-binding , exemplified by France &apos;s flouting of them since 2009 . 
In short , monetary policy is perpetuating the disequilibrium between creditor and debtor economies in the eurozone , and macroprudential policy is doing nothing to stop it . 
When interest rates normalize , this could generate serious financial instability . 
But - and this is the conundrum - the ECB has few options for stimulating demand among the eurozone &apos;s more solvent agents , and thus supporting a sustainable recovery . 
In deciding its next move - whether to initiate more bond purchases , lower interest rates even further , or do both - the ECB must recognize that any positive impact on demand probably will be limited to the eurozone &apos;s weaker economies - that is , the economies that can least afford it . 
This is a high-risk move , one that is probably not justified by the effort to bring price increases a few dozen basis points closer to the ECB &apos;s target . 
A recovery has already begun in the eurozone . 
An even more expansionary monetary-policy stance might strengthen the recovery marginally , but at the cost of increasing the eurozone &apos;s already-dangerous imbalances .
