Is Iraq the Next Afghanistan ? 
At the onset of the US-led war in Iraq , two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome . 
The first contended that overthrowing Saddam Hussein amp ; amp ; apos ; s regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally . 
Derided by detractors as a new amp ; amp ; quot ; domino theory , amp ; amp ; quot ; this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to America amp ; amp ; apos ; s role in post-WWII Japan . 
Against the optimism of that amp ; amp ; quot ; Japan scenario , amp ; amp ; quot ; pessimists argued that a amp ; amp ; quot ; Somalia scenario amp ; amp ; quot ; was more likely . 
They staked their claim on the tribal , sectarian , and multiethnic nature of Iraq , which , in the absence of dictatorship , would supposedly incite Iraq amp ; amp ; apos ; s collapse into a amp ; amp ; quot ; failed state , amp ; amp ; quot ; with rampant warlordism , ethnic and religious feuds , and harboring of terrorist organizations . 
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios , increasingly resembling Afghanistan . 
This amp ; amp ; quot ; Afghan scenario amp ; amp ; quot ; implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government . 
Bad as it sounds , this prospect appears to be a amp ; amp ; quot ; realistic amp ; amp ; quot ; compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing , unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state . 
Many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , as well as higher-level Bush administration decisions , seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy were misplaced . 
Indeed , such hopes were misplaced . 
Iraq amp ; amp ; apos ; s political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy : notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking , the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted , and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community . 
On the other hand , much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the amp ; amp ; quot ; traditional amp ; amp ; quot ; nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy . 
In Iraq , as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds , a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms : grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding ( nationalism , socialism , Islamism ) , versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience . 
The frontlines of this war are notions of the individual , cultural identity , civil society , and the nation-state . 
The religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated . 
But it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it . 
Nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system , but they are not its sole components . 
Indeed , the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of amp ; amp ; quot ; democracy amp ; amp ; quot ; and amp ; amp ; quot ; human rights amp ; amp ; quot ; as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle . 
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene . 
There are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context . 
Advocates of the notion of amp ; amp ; quot ; Arab exceptionalism , amp ; amp ; quot ; which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with amp ; amp ; quot ; grand narrative amp ; amp ; quot ; ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world amp ; amp ; apos ; s patronage-based political order . 
The models used in the West , both in political circles and in academia , for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient . 
In particular , many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model , reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented amp ; amp ; quot ; reality amp ; amp ; quot ; of separate communities . 
Some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its amp ; amp ; quot ; genuine amp ; amp ; quot ; original components : Sunni , Shi amp ; apos ; i , and Kurd . 
In fact , Iraqi society is more complex than this . 
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging , but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical , cultural , religious , and political identities of Iraqi individuals . 
Given the right circumstances , it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its state-to-be . 
The fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances . 
Indeed , the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddam amp ; amp ; apos ; s dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society . 
Upon Saddam amp ; amp ; apos ; s fall , a large amp ; amp ; quot ; middle ground amp ; amp ; quot ; existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice . 
Policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground , opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neo-Ba amp ; apos ; athism . 
The key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground . 
As a result , the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded . 
But to treat this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
Iraqi democrats must re-assess and develop a clear public strategy . 
The CPA , and the world community , must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society . 
Even if such efforts succeed , the road to a full-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive . 
But instead of succumbing to a amp ; amp ; quot ; Somalia scenario , amp ; amp ; quot ; dreaming of a amp ; amp ; quot ; Japan scenario , amp ; amp ; quot ; or settling for an amp ; amp ; quot ; Afghanistan scenario , amp ; amp ; quot ; Iraq may yet become a amp ; amp ; quot ; scenario amp ; amp ; quot ; for successful intervention in the 21 st century .
