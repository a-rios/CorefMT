The Secret of Harvard &apos;s Success 
AHMEDABAD , INDIA - No country dominates any industry as much as the United States dominates higher education . 
According to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University &apos;s Academic Ranking of World Universities , for example , 17 of the world &apos;s 20 best universities are American , with Harvard topping the list by a substantial margin . 
The traditional explanation for this phenomenon - America &apos;s wealth , large population , generous research funding , widespread private philanthropy , and ability to attract scholars from around the world - is incomplete . 
Although the US boasts the world &apos;s largest economy , it comprises only one-quarter of global GDP , and possesses roughly one-twentieth of the world &apos;s population . 
And its support for research is not unique . 
Moreover , according to the accepted explanation , large countries such as France , Germany , Japan , and even China and India should also be represented at the top of global university rankings . 
But they appear only sparsely anywhere in such rankings , if even at all . 
In fact , these countries lack a crucial piece of the puzzle : America &apos;s innovative governance model for higher education . 
Harvard was established as a public institution in 1636 by the authorities of the Massachusetts Bay Colony . 
Its value to Massachusetts is exemplified in the Commonwealth &apos;s post-independence state constitution , ratified in 1780 , which includes a section about the university &apos;s function and boundaries . 
When Harvard alumni dominated the Massachusetts legislature , the university was given support and consideration . 
But , in the 1840 &quot; s , mass immigration , fueled by the Irish potato famine , altered the state &apos;s demographic balance , enabling populists to gain control of the legislature . 
Almost immediately , Harvard came under attack for being too elitist , too exclusive , and too expensive . 
Even its curriculum was challenged . 
Over the next two decades , the state increasingly impeded Harvard &apos;s functioning by , for example , refusing to release funds and obstructing the appointment of professors . 
This behavior culminated in 1862 , when the legislature blocked a university president &apos;s appointment . 
In response , Harvard requested that it be placed &quot; out of the reach of ordinary political strife and change &quot; and into the &quot; hands of alumni who have the interests of education most at heart . &quot; 
On April 29 , 1865 , this radical proposal scraped through the Massachusetts General Court ( the state &apos;s bi-cameral legislature ) , owing to intense lobbying and the goodwill generated by Harvard alumni &apos;s distinguished service for the Union during the Civil War . 
Since then , Harvard &apos;s Board of Overseers , has been controlled exclusively by alumni . 
Inspired by Harvard &apos;s success , other universities - starting with Yale University and the College of William and Mary - took similar action . 
This &quot; genuine American method , &quot; as Charles William Eliot , Harvard &apos;s longest-serving president , called it , became the norm not only for private universities , but also for public institutions , such as the University of Michigan and Purdue University , and even religious institutions like the University of Notre Dame and Duke University . 
Today , 19 of the top 20 American universities in US News and World Report &apos;s much-watched rankings are controlled by alumni ( defined as 50 % or more representation on the Board of Trustees ) . 
The only exception , the California Institute of Technology , has a board with 40 % alumni representation . 
Of the top five , three ( Harvard , Yale , and Columbia ) are managed entirely by alumni , and two ( Princeton and Stanford ) are under 90 % alumni control . 
Alumni run the show even at public institutions such as Purdue ( 90 % ) and Michigan ( 63 % ) . 
On average , alumni make up 63 % of the boards of the top 100 US universities , both public and private . 
In general , a higher percentage of alumni on the board is associated with a higher ranking , increased selectivity , and a larger endowment . 
After all , no group cares more about a university &apos;s prestige than its alumni , who gain or lose esteem as their alma mater &apos;s ranking rises or falls . 
Indeed , alumni have the most incentive to donate generously , and to manage the university effectively . 
Given their intimate knowledge of the university , alumni are also the most effective leaders . 
Through alumni networks , board members can acquire information quickly and act upon it without delay . 
All great universities are nonprofit organizations , created to administer higher education , which benefits society as a whole . 
But US universities found a way to integrate competition &apos;s benefits into the European concept of nonprofit , or so-called eleemosynary , corporations . 
The lack of profit does not diminish an alumni-dominated board &apos;s incentive to compete for prestige by , for example , hiring distinguished faculty , accepting meritorious students , and striving for athletic or artistic achievement . 
Using alumni to infuse the benefits of competition into nonprofit institutions exemplifies the genius of American adaptation . 
Countries that aspire to compete with US universities should take note .
