Free Trade and Costly Love 
LONDON - The World Trade Organization &apos;s ministerial conference in Bali in December produced a modest package of encouragements to global trade . 
But the main question - whether globalization is a good thing , and for whom - remains unanswered . 
The essence of globalization - free trade - rests on the theory of comparative advantage , which views international trade as profitable even for a country that can produce every commodity more cheaply ( in terms of labor or all resources ) than any other country . 
The textbook example given by the Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson is that of a town &apos;s best lawyer who is also its best typist . 
Provided that he is better at law than at typing , he should specialize in law and leave his secretary to do the typing . 
That way , both of their earnings will be higher . 
Each country should specialize in producing those things that it produces most efficiently , rather than producing a bit of everything , because that way its income will be higher . 
Economists regard understanding the theory of comparative advantage as a test of professional competence . 
But are the incompetents - say , the average person who believes that buying cheap imports from China destroys Western jobs - always wrong ? 
Samuelson , who called the theory of comparative advantage the most beautiful thing in economics , changed his tune a bit at the end of his life . 
But if countries like China can combine Western technology with low wages , then trade with China will lower Western wages . 
True , the West will be able to get its goods more cheaply ; but , as Samuelson put it , &quot; being able to purchase groceries 20 % cheaper at Wal-Mart does not necessarily make up for the wage losses . &quot; 
Nor , he might have added , would being able to buy goods more cheaply compensate for many other good things in life that are sacrificed to efficiency . 
The argument for free trade is an argument for welfare , but welfare defined exclusively in terms of money . 
Time is money : the more money you can squeeze out of an hour &apos;s work , the better off you are . 
But what about all of the things that you enjoy doing , or that you think of as valuable , that do not maximize your earnings ? 
The economist responds that the more efficient you are at your work , the more time you will have for those other things . 
The trouble is that the more you start to think of your welfare in terms of money , the more likely you are to regard spending time with your friends or making love as an &quot; opportunity cost &quot; - the loss of money you would have made by working instead - rather than a benefit . 
The goal of squeezing as much money as possible out of time makes a great deal of sense in poor countries , where inefficient use of time can lead to starvation . 
The whole point of economic development is , surely , to reduce the cost of inefficiency . 
Yet economists , not noticing that their logic is less applicable to rich countries , continue trying to extend it to more and more areas of life . 
A newly luxuriant research area is &quot; life outsourcing . &quot; 
Even as penniless graduate students , the economists Jon Steinsson and Emi Nakamura borrowed money to pay people to do their household chores , calculating that &quot; spending an extra hour working on a paper was better for their lifetime expected earnings than spending that same hour vacuuming . &quot; 
Likewise , the economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers , pioneers of &quot; lovenomics , &quot; cite the tax code as a reason for not marrying . 
They also conducted a cost / benefit analysis before having a child . 
As Wolfers explains , 
&quot; The principle of comparative advantage tells us that gains from trade are largest when your trading partner has skills and endowments that are quite different from yours . 
I &apos;m an impractical bookish Harvard-trained empirical labor economist , while Betsey is an impractical and bookish Harvard-trained empirical labor economist . 
When your skills are so similar , the gains from trade aren &apos;t so large . 
Except when it comes to bringing up our baby . 
There , Betsey has a pair of , um , endowments that mean that she &apos;s better at inputs . 
And that means that I &apos;m left to deal with outputs . &quot; 
As Stevenson helpfully clarifies , &quot; it turns out that fathers can be pretty good at dealing with diapers . &quot; 
At this point , those untutored in economics are likely to start gnashing their teeth . 
&quot; I enjoy doing lots of things that do not maximize my earning power , &quot; they might protest . 
But as soon as we accept the premise that to be rational is to seek to maximize one &apos;s utility - defined in terms of consumption , with money the way to maximize it - the economist &apos;s logic wins . 
At that point , we must admit that it is irrational to spend time on long conversations with friends if it is time stolen from inventing , say , new software ( unless the conversation helps the invention ) . 
For Wolfers , it is a coincidence that what earns him the most money , economics , is also what he most enjoys doing . 
Such reasoning crystallizes opposing views of the world , one in which time is a cost , and the other in which it is a benefit . 
The first sees time spent on enjoyment as a missed opportunity ; the second as part of the good life . 
We should be clear about what is at stake in the choice between the two .
