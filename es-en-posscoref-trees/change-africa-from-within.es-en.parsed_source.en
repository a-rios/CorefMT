Change Africa from Within 
ROME - A severe food crisis currently threatens southern Sudan . 
In East Africa , where millions of people already are dependent on food aid , a sharp rise in the cost of staple crops looms . 
These are just the latest sources of concern in a turbulent period that began two years ago when food shortages hit many countries in Africa and Asia due to a worldwide spike in prices . 
On its heels came the global financial crisis , which also hit the poorest the hardest . 
Agriculture is the main employer , job creator , and export in most developing countries . 
Historically , agriculture has driven economic performance in many countries , generating growth that has been shown to be at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth in other sectors . 
Investment in agricultural and rural development is therefore vital to food security and sustainable economic development . 
Indeed , the vast majority of today &apos;s developed countries grew from strong agricultural foundations , where surplus production generated wealth and prosperity . 
This is what is happening today in Vietnam , and it is the path that China and India took on their way to becoming engines of economic growth . 
Poverty is predominantly rural . 
Globally , three-quarters of people living in extreme poverty are in rural areas and depend on agriculture and related activities for their livelihoods . 
About 380 million women , children , and men in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $ 1.25 a day . 
Many are malnourished or hungry . 
But , with some 80 million small farms in sub-Saharan Africa producing 80 % of agricultural goods , smallholder farmers have a key role to play in resolving the financial and food crises and unleashing Africa &apos;s potential to feed itself . 
In order to lift people out of poverty and ensure food security , a sustained effort is needed to develop Africa &apos;s agriculture and the associated infrastructure - notably roads , telecommunication , and energy - needed to unleash agricultural potential . 
Strengthening agriculture is one of the best investments any African country can make . 
Members of the African Union recognized this in 2003 in Maputo , Mozambique , pledging to increase spending on agriculture to at least 10 % of national budgets . 
Although eight countries have met or surpassed that target , the continent as a whole has not . 
But reaching this target is not enough . 
Governments must create the right policy environment to allow for appropriate investments in research and development to enhance productivity and increase production . 
Investment in agriculture in Africa must focus on creating a dynamic smallholder sector . 
A vibrant rural sector generates local demand for locally produced goods and services . 
In turn , this can spur sustainable non-farm employment growth in services , agro-processing , and small-scale manufacturing . 
This is crucial for rural employment , without which poor rural young people will be driven away from their communities in search of work in the cities . 
Agriculture , predominantly on a small scale , accounts for about 30 % of sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s GDP and at least 40 % of export value . 
In a number of small countries in Africa , agriculture plays an even greater role , representing 80 % or more of export earnings . 
The potential in these numbers will remain untapped unless African countries put the right policies in place to help agriculture to develop and flourish . 
But transformation of African agriculture will not happen until the private sector is fully engaged in agricultural production , processing , and marketing . 
Governments must become more investor-friendly to attract greater private-sector interest . 
More broadly , African countries need to put their political and economic houses in order . 
It is also crucial that they continue to improve their systems to create an enabling environment for dynamic rural growth to transform subsistence farmers into entrepreneurs . 
Given their central role not only as mothers and caregivers , but also as farmers , rural women hold the key to food security . 
That is why any nation that does not provide opportunities for women will not reach its full potential . 
Significant progress must be made in Africa to advance both women &apos;s empowerment and their status in society - particularly with regard to land and credit . 
Finally , although investment in development assistance is key to supporting Africa &apos;s advancement , nations will ultimately have to take responsibility for their own development . 
No nation , no people , ever experienced growth that sprang solely from external support . 
So Africa &apos;s development must be made in Africa , by Africans , for Africans . 
Every tree , every plant , must be fully rooted in its own soil to flourish . 
Change cannot be imposed from outside , it must be cultivated from within .
