Islam and / in the West 
JEDDAH - The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt provide examples of largely peaceful transitions of power after decades of unflinching authoritarian rule . 
Yet change in these and other Arab countries caught the world by surprise . 
Talk of an &quot; Arab Spring &quot; has dominated Western media and political debate for months now . 
Many Muslims living in the West are also watching events in the region closely , hoping that their co-religionists will soon enjoy greater rights , freedoms , and protections under the rule of law , much as they have done for many decades . 
But there is no guarantee that such transitions will have peaceful outcomes . 
Indeed , the current situation in Libya , Bahrain , and Yemen is extremely worrying , and finding workable political solutions in these countries will challenge not only the Muslim world , but also the West and the entire international community . 
It would also be wrong , however , to define the relationship between the Islamic world and the West solely in light of today &apos;s Arab mass movements . 
There is another aspect to the relationship : Islam in the West - that is , issues concerning Muslims living within Western societies , particularly Europe . 
A report published in May 2010 by the Council of Europe , entitled Islam , Islamism , and Islamophobia in Europe , recognized that Europe has been home to Muslims for many centuries , and acknowledged the contribution of Islamic civilization to European culture . 
Yet , as the report also noted , Muslims in Europe today feel socially excluded , stigmatized , and discriminated against . 
Indeed , they have become victims of stereotypes because of their religious and cultural traditions . 
A rising tide of Islamophobic rhetoric can be seen in Europe &apos;s mainstream media and among its political parties - for example , the Danish People &apos;s Party , the Dutch Freedom Party , the French National Front , the Swiss Peoples &quot; Party , the English Defense League , the Italian Northern League , and the Austrian Freedom Party . 
Similar parties exist or are emerging elsewhere in Europe . 
This situation only serves to remind us of the inadequate knowledge among many Europeans of the common roots and historical connections linking the Islamic world and the West . 
It is also indicative of the need for new relationships based on understanding , tolerance , and respect for cultural diversity . 
According to the Pew Foundation Forum &apos;s September 2010 report on Religion in Public Life , Western Europe &apos;s Muslim population totals more than 17 million . 
In countries like Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , the Netherlands , Sweden , and Switzerland , Muslims comprise 5 % or more of the population . 
They must be supported and encouraged to play their full role in both community and public life . 
As the world &apos;s second largest intergovernmental organization , the Organization of the Islamic Conference is committed to cooperating with the international community to promote and consolidate global peace , stability , harmony , security , and development . 
As I have stressed on many occasions , the OIC is guided by the principles of moderation and modernization . 
The OIC &apos;s basic documents , such as its Ten Year Program of Action and its new Charter , provide a visionary road map to meet the challenges facing Islam in the twenty-first century . 
Diverse cultures should complement and enhance one another . 
Tolerance , stability , and prosperity are nurtured only when communities and cultures communicate and respect one another . 
To speak out against Islamophobia is not to negate the existence of hatred against other religions , and we Muslims must extend our hand in cooperation to counter anti-Semitism , Christianophobia , and misperceptions about Western culture . 
We must not be hostages to our extremists . 
As the entire international community is fighting radicalization and terrorism , we firmly believe that this effort must be part of an overall endeavor aimed at building a better world , based on cultural diversity , in which human dignity , human rights , and fundamental freedom are properly respected . 
When Barack Obama became President of the United States , he promised a new chapter in relations between the Islamic world and the West . 
In his first overseas visit as President , speaking in the Turkish Parliament , he said : 
&quot; The United States is not , and will never be , at war with Islam .... America &apos;s relationship with 
the Muslim community , the Muslim world , cannot , and will not , just be based upon opposition to terrorism . 
We seek broader engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect . 
We will listen carefully , we will bridge misunderstandings , and we will seek common ground . 
We will be respectful , even when we do not agree . 
We will convey our deep appreciation for the Islamic faith , which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world - including in my own country . &quot; 
Although there have been many obstacles on the road to good relations , this year could provide a unique opportunity to forge a new discourse of tolerance and understanding between the peoples of the Islamic world and the West . 
We may have to look to the Muslim communities within Western societies to provide leadership and direction for the future . 
More opportunities for broad and deep encounters between Muslims and non-Muslims must be developed and sustained , at both the individual and institutional levels . 
In light of the potential for a new climate of political openness in Muslim-majority countries , these encounters may be more possible than ever before . 
Most importantly , committed organizations and individuals must unite and mobilize to isolate the extremists - and remain united in working to develop the culture of tolerance and respect needed to ensure the full enjoyment of our rights . 
That is the only way forward for the Islamic world and the West - and for Islam in the West .
