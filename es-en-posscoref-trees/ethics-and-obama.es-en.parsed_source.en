Ethics and Obama 
TUBINGEN - Many say that the world financial crisis could not have been foreseen . 
Perhaps not by financiers and economists , but others who were watching how markets were developing - often with dismay - were more than worried . 
As early as 1997 , I warned about a repeat of the collapsed economic order of 1929-1933 in my book A Global Ethic for Global Politics and Global Economics : &quot; The slightest remark , for example by the President of the American Federal Bank , Alan Greenspan , at the beginning of December 1996 , that an &quot; irrational exuberance &quot; had led to an overvaluation of the financial markets was enough to drive the nervous investors on the high-flying stock markets of Asia , Europe and America into a spin , and panic selling . 
This also shows that crises in globalization do not a priori balance out , but perhaps get progressively worse . &quot; 
Back then , I was already venturing what is , for economists , a heretical presumption : that chaos theory should be applied to the economy ; that devastating effects can follow from the smallest causes . 
One could by no means rule out &quot; a return of the world economic crisis and the collapse of the world economic order of 1929-1933 . &quot; 
So I was not at all surprised by the speed and dimension of events in recent months . Indeed , only a few economists - such as the 2001 Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz and the 2008 laureate Paul Krugman - warned against fatal developments that were mounting in the now globalized economy . 
Contrary to many predictions by economic experts , the crisis has not been limited to the financial sector . Instead , it is generating a massive impact on the real economy - hitting the automobile and chemical industries especially hard . 
In contrast to 1929 , credits are not now being throttled ; on the contrary , public money is being pumped into banks and the economy . 
But these measures will be successful only if they are not taken in an isolated and populist way . 
Instead , they need to be part of a convincing overall plan that combines responsible state intervention with relief of the financial burdens of individual citizens , as well as savings in public budgets . 
Unforeseeable state debt - at the cost of coming generations - is neither a viable nor an ethical solution . 
Fortunately , there are signs that the general state of mind that helped spawn the crisis is changing . 
In the rich industrialized countries , after an era of cynical and short-sighted profit-maximizing behavior , we may be at the dawn of a new age of modesty and sustainability . Companies are facing growing pressure to behave ethically , and unethical business behavior is at last being punished . 
On a lecture tour in the United States in November 2008 , I could see that many people are now complaining about the overwhelming desire for profit in business and megalomania in politics . 
As markets failed , calls for ethical regulation of the quest for profit has become justified not only in principle , but also in fact . 
But ethics is not the icing on the cake ; it is not merely an incidental addition to the global market economy . 
Rather , the new financial architecture that many are calling for , and which is urgently needed , must be supported by an ethical framework . 
The fatal human instincts of greed and hubris can be tamed only with some elementary ethical norms . 
So what should this ethical framework entail ? A paragraph of the Declaration toward a Global Ethic of the Parliament of the World &apos;s Religions in Chicago in 1993 reads as follows : 
&quot; In the great ancient religious and ethical traditions of humankind we find the directive : You shall not steal ! 
Or in positive terms : Deal honestly and fairly ! 
Let us reflect anew on the consequences of this ancient directive : No one has the right to rob or dispossess in any way whatsoever any other person or the commonweal . 
Further , no one has the right to use her or his possessions without concern for the needs of society and Earth . 
To be authentically human in the spirit of our great religious and ethical traditions means the following : 
• We must utilize economic and political power for service to humanity instead of misusing it in ruthless battles for domination . 
We must develop a spirit of compassion with those who suffer , with special care for the children , the aged , the poor , the disabled , the refugees , and the lonely ; 
• We must cultivate mutual respect and consideration , so as to reach a reasonable balance of interests , instead of thinking only of unlimited power and unavoidable competitive struggles ; 
• We must value a sense of moderation and modesty instead of an unquenchable greed for money , prestige , and consumption . 
In greed humans lose their &quot; souls , &quot; their freedom , their composure , their inner peace , and thus that which makes them human . &quot; 
Many hopes throughout the world are now directed toward President Barack Obama , who enters his presidency with a moral claim that is extraordinarily high for a politician . 
Of course , Obama is not the Messiah ; he cannot work miracles . 
But he is in a position to define an ethical framework for the rebuilding global economy . 
In view of the oppressive - and unprecedented - abundance of problems with which Obama is confronted at home and abroad , he will certainly not be able to fulfill all expectations . 
I shall not pass judgment on his plans for the world economy as reported so far . 
The suffering that so many people are enduring leads to pressure for reform , and Obama has shrewdly transformed these pressures into a political force . 
All this shows that reflection on common ethical values , a global ethic , is needed more urgently now than ever before .
