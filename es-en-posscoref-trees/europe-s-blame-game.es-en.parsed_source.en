Europe &apos;s Blame Game 
The European Union &apos;s leaders have just met to draw the lessons from the failed referenda on the Constitutional Treaty . 
But they need not search too far for culprits ; indeed , they need only look in the mirror and confront the consequences of the dishonest game that the leaders of EU member states have played for too long . 
Over the years , those leaders hoped to reap the benefits of reform while avoiding the blame , so they routinely let EU officials based in Brussels take the political heat for unpopular but necessary measures . 
They then bitterly complained to their people about &quot; Brussels bureaucrats &quot; and their undemocratic ways . 
But these leaders forgot that their people might actually believe them . 
So , when the leaders of France and the Netherlands - pro-constitution to a fault - asked their people what they thought about the Union , they received a clear echo of their own message : the people did not like the reforms , and they did not like the &quot; Brussels bureaucrats , &quot; constitution or no constitution . 
Nowhere has this game of passing the blame been more visible than in the way EU governments have handled the deregulation of the product market . 
The rewards to be gained by deregulating product markets are very large . 
Breaking up monopolies often yields dramatically lower prices and thus higher living standards for consumers , because the same wage buys a lot more . 
Consider deregulation of telecommunications and airlines , which has ushered in competition from low-cost carriers of data and people . 
Deregulation also leads to economies of scale , lowering prices even further , as we all know when shopping at the hypermarket rather than the corner grocery store . 
But deregulation inevitably brings disruptions . 
Consumers gain , but some workers lose . 
Existing firms often have a hard time adapting . 
New , leaner firms take over . 
In the process , old firms go bankrupt , workers are laid off . 
Rents disappear , and think of the effects of airline deregulation on pilots &quot; salaries . 
Even if as many or more jobs are created as are destroyed , this does not eliminate the pain of those who find themselves unemployed . 
By any estimate , with a decent safety net for workers who lose their jobs , the benefits of deregulation far exceed the costs and the pain they cause . 
But this does not make governments &quot; political task much easier , because the benefits are diffuse : consumers paying less for airline tickets may not attribute it to deregulation . 
By contrast , the costs are localized : airline workers who risk losing their jobs are intensely aware of the connection between deregulation and layoffs . 
Of course , governments could try to explain why they pursue deregulation . 
Or could it really be true that &quot; Brussels &quot; has overstepped its powers , forcing more deregulation than national governments wanted ? 
This exonerating hypothesis does not hold water . 
The case of airline deregulation is again revealing . 
Twice in the last ten years , national governments have explicitly given the EU the authority to tighten constraints on their subsidies to failing airline companies . 
But they did , and this did not prevent them for blaming &quot; Brussels &quot; strongly and loudly for these very constraints when their own national airlines got in trouble . 
Having triggered and then witnessed the &quot; anti-Brussels &quot; vote , what should European governments do ? 
One piece of good news is that deregulation of product markets has been largely achieved , so there is less need to play the Brussels blame game . 
The main item on the agenda now is to design better social insurance , in order to minimize the pain from reallocation , be it from deregulation , technological progress , or globalization . 
Of course , some product-market deregulation remains necessary , especially in the service sector . 
The Bolkestein directive on services played badly , but there is no question that European consumers pay too much for many services . 
To take just one example , eliminating the monopoly that notaries public hold in countries like France and Italy would substantially decrease the costs of buying and selling homes , decrease the cost of housing , and make it less costly for workers to move to where the jobs are . 
European governments face three choices . 
They can try to stop product market reforms altogether and , by the same token , try to stop trade liberalization and globalization . 
So far , no government appears to have fallen to that temptation . 
They also can continue to play the blame game , letting the Union pursue reforms , while complaining about Brussels bureaucrats . 
But the anxiety now being felt across the EU shows the dangers of that strategy . 
Moreover , labor-market policies do not fall under the EU mandate , so national governments will be on their own , without the Brussels bureaucrats to blame . 
Finally , they can help &quot; Brussels &quot; define and design product-market reforms , and then sell those reforms , and the EU &apos;s role in enacting them , to their voters . 
If Europe &apos;s leaders are wise enough to choose this course , the fiasco of the French and Dutch referendums will prove to have been useful after all .
