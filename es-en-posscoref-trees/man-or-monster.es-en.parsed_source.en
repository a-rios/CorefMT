Man or Monster ? 
PHNOM PENH  -  
Kaing Guek Eav , commonly known as &quot; Duch , &quot; presided over the deaths of more than 14,000 people at S-21 , a former Phnom Penh high school turned into a torture center . 
He is one of five former senior Khmer Rouge leaders who will be made to answer for their roles during Pol Pot &apos;s genocide , in which an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians perished . 
Until recently , Duch was the only one imprisoned , after being exposed in 1999 . 
The court - with its improbable blend of Cambodian and foreign judges and attorneys as well as laws - is meant to be a model for judicial reform and independent justice in a country where impunity has long been the rule . 
The five red-robed judges who preside over the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia ( the tribunal &apos;s official name ) are the final arbiters of Duch &apos;s detention , but the question they are now considering belongs as much to the people of Cambodia as it does to the court . 
Should mass murderers be afforded the same rights as everyone else ? 
One of my aunts has a strong opinion on the matter . 
Khmer Rouge soldiers beat her father to death , and she remembers being shot at for sport by communist cadres as she and dozens of other peasants scuttled up a mountainside . 
She now lives one block from S-21 . 
&quot; Human rights are for humans , &quot; she said emphatically when I asked her about Duch &apos;s case . 
&quot; He is a monster . &quot; 
I once believed that , too . 
When I first visited Duch &apos;s house of horrors in 1990 , I was 15 and full of wonder about the country where I was born but had never lived . 
My family escaped the Khmer Rouge on April 17 , 1975 , the day they claimed victory . 
When my mother and I journeyed home to reunite with relatives who had survived the genocide , S-21 ( also known as Tuol Sleng ) was among our first stops . 
By then , the torture facility had been turned into a museum . 
I remember feeling claustrophobic as I walked down its narrow halls and into classrooms turned into crude cellblocks . 
The air was stale but heavy with the stench of death in interrogation chambers , barren save for a single bed frame , shackles , and a chair . 
Flecks of dried blood peeled up from the floor . 
This was a place where fingernails of countless victims were ripped out , where others were strung upside down and dunked in barrels of water , where many were brutalized with metal prongs and batons . 
This was a place of utter brokenness . 
This was Duch &apos;s place . 
Mostly , I remember the hundreds of black and white mug shots of prisoners and victims that covered every inch of the walls - a ghastly montage of human suffering that haunts me to this day . 
I couldn &apos;t help but think : this was somebody &apos;s daughter , somebody &apos;s son . 
This was somebody &apos;s mother or sister or brother . 
Back then , I thought : What monster could do such things ? 
Now , that monster was sitting in a courtroom , looking scared and meek as prosecutors catalogued his alleged war crimes . 
Sitting in the packed auditorium where snatches of Duch &apos;s face flash by on a movie screen , I &apos;m struck by what I see : a face that belongs to someone . 
This alleged perpetrator of unspeakable misdeeds is , like his victims , someone &apos;s son , someone &apos;s brother , someone &apos;s father . 
This might have been only a fleeting thought had I not seen Duch &apos;s family members , who attended the hearings . 
Hang Seav Heang , 28 , described the defendant as a gentle man , a good father . 
One of his sisters said he was a caring , protective brother , and that she would always love him . 
Outside the courtroom and in the community , most of the Khmers I talked to were , like my aunt , quick to categorize Duch as something other than human . 
Duch must have thought much the same thing about his victims when he ordered them to their deaths . 
When we start to see each other as less than human , we respond with inhuman acts . 
It is this narrow , black-and-white view of humanity that has perpetuated a cycle of violence in Cambodia , where raging mobs beat to death robbery suspects and young mistresses suffer acid attacks by jealous wives . 
To say that Duch is a monster who does not deserve rights ignores the gray area between good and evil , between man and monster , where anything is possible . 
This trial is about that gray area , about that place in us all where morality decays and evil takes root and grows , the way mold prevails given the right conditions . 
Each of us carries this potential for rot . 
There is no dispute that Duch violated the rights of thousands of Khmers . 
But if the basic premise of these trials is to uphold human rights , then we are obliged to extend that same principle to Duch . 
What does it say to the country and the world if a court convened to mete out justice flouts the law ? 
Isn &apos;t lawlessness the plague we are finally trying to eradicate in Cambodia ? 
The judges have offered no indication when they will make a decision . 
And no one would blame them for taking their time to consider their options . 
This is , after all , the court &apos;s first test of fairness before the trials of Duch and four of Pol Pot &apos;s other henchmen begin next year . 
We all want justice , but that justice should not come at the cost of our humanity .
