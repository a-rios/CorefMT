Facing Up to Chronic Disease 
MONTREAL - Many of us are terrified by the prospect of having a debilitating stroke or a fatal heart attack . 
Few of us , however , respond as emotionally to the threat of chronic disease , a vague and elastic term that is mainly useful for organizing health services . 
And yet chronic disease has become a major social problem that requires a collective response . 
Historically , chronic disease referred to conditions lasting over a long period . 
But , with the increasing organization of medicine around specific diseases , the term has come to refer to an open-ended set of conditions including cardiovascular disease , cancer , and diabetes , but not infectious diseases , such as tuberculosis and malaria , or mental illness . 
In the nineteenth century , chronic disease was considered problematic in part because sufferers took up scarce beds in hospitals that were increasingly focused on treating acute , curable diseases . 
But chronic disease soon became a wider public-health issue as the death toll from cancer , cardiovascular disease , and diabetes seemed to rise . 
In fact , the initial increase in the number of reported deaths from these diseases most likely reflected better identification and diagnosis . 
Filling in death certificates is not an exact science , and doctors focus on causes with which they are familiar . 
Over time , though , the incidence of chronic disease almost certainly did rise in developed countries . 
As infectious diseases have been brought increasingly under control , more people live into old age , when they become susceptible to long-term illnesses . 
As a result , chronic diseases now comprise a large proportion of health-care systems &apos; total caseloads . 
Our collective interest in addressing the problem of chronic diseases does not rest only on epidemiological statistics . 
It also reflects deep , long-standing concerns about the effects of civilization : urban overcrowding , sedentary lifestyles , unhealthy habits like tobacco and alcohol consumption , overeating , and stress . 
Moreover , we have come to believe that most diseases , including previously hopeless conditions , can be prevented , cured , ameliorated , or controlled by scientific medicine , and that even those patients unlikely to benefit have a right to medical care . 
As chronic disease has become an increasingly prevalent social problem , it has been dealt with in two ways . 
The most common response is disease-specific . 
The American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association , as well as the disease-based research institutes of the National Institutes of Health , are notable examples . 
An alternative approach is to treat these illnesses as a single , comprehensive problem . 
The earliest example occurred in the United States , where a focus on welfare measures and health insurance for vulnerable populations - the elderly , the disabled , and the very poor - led to a strong push to confront the chronic diseases widespread among them . 
European countries , preoccupied with national health-care systems that addressed the needs of the entire population , took longer to move toward comprehensive strategies . 
Both approaches have given rise to new forms of epidemiological surveillance . 
Since the 1950s , for example , the field has been extended to risk factors , a concept that grew out of debates about the health effects of tobacco and studies of cardiovascular diseases with multiple potential causes . 
Some risk factors - moderate hypertension and high cholesterol , for example - have themselves become chronic diseases , requiring medical ( and sometimes surgical ) treatment and further contributing to the rise in illness rates . 
A new vision of health care , which has grown out of the US managed-care movement , has recently heightened the relevance of embracing a comprehensive approach to treating these conditions . 
Originally intended to cut costs , the goal now is to provide more appropriate care for a new era , the premise being that long-term care for many diseases requires forms of medical organization that are different from those geared toward acute care . 
Acute episodes and expensive hospitalization can be avoided by providing expert team support for patient self-care . 
The most successful and radical of these initiatives is the Chronic Care Model developed by Edward Wagner , an American doctor . 
Less sweeping is the Medical Home Model , also developed in the US , which seeks to create teams of caregivers to provide better access and continuity of care to patients suffering from multiple diseases . 
Massive health-care systems cannot shift course easily or quickly . 
But efforts like these , by focusing on the need to provide appropriate and less expensive care for chronic diseases , constitute a small step in the right direction .
