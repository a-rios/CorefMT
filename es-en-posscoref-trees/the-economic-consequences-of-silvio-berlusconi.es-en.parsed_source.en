The Economic Consequences of Silvio Berlusconi 
MILAN - Silvio Berlusconi has survived a confidence vote , but his government is virtually dead . 
One cannot rule a country with so scant a majority . 
The one important decision that this , Berlusconi &apos;s fourth government , ever bothered to take was a decision not to decide . 
Two years ago , when financial crisis shook the world , Berlusconi &apos;s choice was to avoid any policy intervention to counteract the Great Recession . 
Within the G-20 , only Japan did worse . 
Remarkably , Italy had twice the fall in output seen in France , another large OECD country that , like Italy , had avoided the root causes of the crisis : a housing boom-bust sequence and a serious bank crisis . 
The paradox is that the Berlusconi government &apos;s inaction did prevent a major deterioration in the public deficit . 
In light of the current debt crisis roiling the eurozone , the advantages of a policy of inertia are easy to appreciate . 
Italy &apos;s position today could have been much worse than it is . 
The Italian economy &apos;s problems , and the major issues concerning the sustainability of the country &apos;s huge public debt , are rooted in low growth of potential output . 
As is also revealed by the term structure of credit-default swaps for Italian debt , investors are not worried about , say , the 2011 budget law . 
Instead , they are worried about Italy &apos;s economic conditions in 5-10 years . 
It is these medium-run problems that Berlusconi &apos;s government has overlooked . 
None of the structural reforms essential to improving Italy &apos;s growth potential - for example , labor-market and unemployment benefit reforms , product market liberalizations , improvements of the education system , reforms of the public administration in the South - has been carried out , even though Berlusconi could count on solid majorities in both chambers of Parliament . 
Why did Berlusconi &apos;s government choose such a passive economic policy ? 
One reason is that the level of Italian debt did not leave much room for countercyclical fiscal policy . 
For instance , it would have been possible to provide income support to job losers - which would have been useful after the crisis as well - by reforming the system of unemployment benefits . 
A possible explanation for the government &apos;s inaction over the past two and half years is that the measures agreed upon within the coalition that won the 2008 elections were not tailored to a country entering a major recession . 
There was no leadership over economic policy defining new priorities and measures to meet the changed macroeconomic conditions . 
In its first month after coming to power , the government did actually try to do something for the economy . 
It took three decisions , all of which were soon revealed to be utterly wrong . 
The first decision was to reduce taxes on overtime work , a measure clearly aimed at increasing the number of hours worked . 
Needless to say , as unemployment rose and many other countries decreased hours worked in order to contain job losses , tax reductions on overtime were phased out and the scope of short-time work was enhanced . 
A similar fate occurred to a Robin Hood tax , which , according to Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti , should have forced banks and oil producers to provide resources for the poor . 
The tax on banks had to be transformed into a commitment to provide fresh money to troubled financial institutions via the so-called &quot; Tremonti Bonds . &quot; 
The last measure taken was the dismantling of the real-estate tax , a major source of revenue for local governments . 
This tax has not yet been restored , but the government is planning to introduce a number of new levies on housing , which would ultimately restore the lost revenues . 
In this way , Italy lost 30 months without enacting the structural reforms that it so badly needs to restore the country &apos;s growth potential . 
True , such reforms are particularly difficult during bad times , but a large number of them have been carried in the European Union precisely during recessions . 
The fact of the matter is that downturns are times of &quot; extraordinary politics , &quot; in which it is possible to create larger coalitions for far-ranging economic-policy changes . 
A government pursuing a reform agenda should , under these circumstances , make the public aware of the emergency conditions and appeal to the responsibility of the opposition . 
They constantly underplayed the extent of the crisis , and tried to sell the idea that Italy had largely been insulated from the global recession . 
This strategy may have prevented the dramatic fall in popularity experienced by other governments in the middle of the Great Recession , but sooner or later will backfire . 
The disappointment of the majority of Italians with Berlusconi &apos;s rule will be even larger when they realize that this government never presented the facts as they are .
