Putin &apos;s History Lessons 
CAMBRIDGE - Soviet ideology was always about the future . 
By contrast , today &apos;s official Russian ideology seems to be focused squarely on the past . 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin &apos;s recent article for the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza - written to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland - expresses his determination to make twentieth-century European history a major part of the Russian government &apos;s business . 
That article reflects the deep , unresolved problems of Putin &apos;s era : the inability to distinguish between the Soviet past and the Russian present ; an unscrupulous mix of political conservatism and historical revisionism ; and indifference , bordering on incomprehension , with regard to the key values of democracy . 
In his article , Putin did not mourn the collapse of the USSR , though he previously called it &quot; the greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century . &quot; 
Indeed , he even praised the democratic movements that buried the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence , and he expressed no sympathy for the twentieth century &apos;s revolutions , which he called &quot; deep wounds &quot; that humanity inflicted on itself . 
What really worries Putin and his historical advisers is the memory of World War II . 
They regard the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany as the highest achievement of the state and nation that they inherited from the USSR . 
They also see this victory as the main counter-weight to the memory of the USSR as a reign of brutal , unjustified violence . 
Not that Putin &apos;s version of history denies this memory altogether . 
This summer , he publicly instructed his education minister to include passages from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn &apos;s The Gulag Archipelago in the high school curriculum . 
Rather , what concerns Putin is the balancing of WWII and Stalinism in Soviet history . 
Calling for a &quot; contextual &quot; and &quot; causal &quot; view of history , he acknowledges the Stalinist terror but interprets it as a response to the extraordinary need to defeat Nazism . 
Putin summarizes his understanding of the scale of the war by recalling the loss of &quot; 27 million lives of my compatriots . &quot; 
That number has grown over the years , as Soviet officials broadened the definition of wartime deaths to mean total &quot; population loss , &quot; rather than direct military casualties . 
Official estimates of Soviet deaths in WWII thus rose from seven million ( the figure put forth under Stalin ) to 20 million ( Khrushchev ) to 26.6 million ( Gorbachev ) , with civilian deaths accounting for at least two-thirds of Putin &apos;s estimate . 
Unfortunately , Putin does not explain whom he counts as his compatriots . 
If he meant those who lived within Russia &apos;s contemporary borders , the number would have been much lower . 
Instead , he includes all citizens of the USSR who died during the war , including millions of Ukrainians , Belarusians , and others . 
Moreover , because Putin &apos;s &quot; contextual &quot; history subordinates Soviet-era suffering to the purpose of fighting the Great Patriotic War , his number mixes those who died in battle fighting for the USSR with those whom the Soviets killed through mass murder , deportation , and forced labor . 
By this logic , one could also reclassify the victims of the terror , collectivization , and famine of the 1930 &quot; s in order to boost the number of Hitler &apos;s casualties in the USSR . 
Putin connects two events that triggered WWII , the Munich Agreement of 1938 and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 , in one causal construction . 
Both acts of collusion with Nazi Germany were immoral mistakes , writes Putin , but the latter was merely a response to the former . 
To be sure , Britain &apos;s Neville Chamberlain and France &apos;s Edouard Daladier signed a shameful treaty with Hitler and Mussolini in Munich . 
The dictators remained , however , Molotov and Stalin among them . 
Moreover , while the Munich Agreement cynically blessed Hitler &apos;s dismemberment of Czechoslovakia , it was a public document that meant what it said . 
Molotov , who remained in power throughout the war and until 1956 , denied the existence of the Secret Protocols until his death 30 years later . 
Democracies make shameful mistakes , but they eventually correct them , or at least apologize for them . 
It is wrong , and even immoral , to equate democratic and dictatorial practices .
