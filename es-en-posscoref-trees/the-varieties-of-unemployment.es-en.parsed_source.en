The Varieties of Unemployment 
BERKELEY - We hear from surprisingly many quarters these days that governments in Europe and North America , and their central banks , should give up on the expansionary policies they have pursued to try to create jobs . 
The high unemployment currently afflicting the North Atlantic , critics of government stimulus maintain , is not cyclical but &quot; structural , &quot; and thus cannot be alleviated by policies that boost aggregate demand . 
Let me be the first to say that structural unemployment is a true and severe danger . 
When people who in other circumstances could be happy , healthy , and productive members of the workforce lack the skills , confidence , social networks , and experience needed to find work worth paying for , we obviously have a problem . 
And if unemployment in Europe and North America stays elevated for two or three more years , it is highly likely that we will have to face it . 
For nothing converts cyclical unemployment into structural unemployment more certainly than prolonged unemployment . 
But is that true today ? 
Does it look right now as if the biggest problem facing the economies of Europe and North America is structural unemployment ? 
It does not . 
Let us remember what structural unemployment looks like . 
The economy is depressed and unemployment is high not because of slack aggregate demand generated by a collapse in spending , but instead because &quot; structural &quot; factors have produced a mismatch between the skills of the labor force and the distribution of demand . 
The structure of demand by consumers is different from the jobs that workers are capable of filling . 
For example , suppose that you have many workers qualified and skilled to work in construction , but households have decided that their houses are more than large enough , and wish to fill them with manufactured goods . 
This would produce structural unemployment to the extent that the ex-construction workers could not do things in manufacturing that would make it worthwhile for manufacturing firms to hire them . 
In that case , we would expect to see construction depressed : firms closed , capital goods idle , and workers unemployed . 
But we would also expect to see manufacturing plants running at double shifts - the money not spent on construction has to go somewhere , and , remember , the problem is not a lack of aggregate demand . 
We would expect to see manufacturers holding job fairs , and when not enough workers showed up , we would expect to see manufacturers offering higher wages to attract workers into their plants , and then raising prices to cover their higher costs . 
The size and duration of the excess unemployment of ex-construction workers might be substantial and long lasting . 
It might require significant time to retrain construction workers and plug them into social networks in which they become good manufacturing workers . 
We might see prolonged and high unemployment in the construction sector , and in regions that had seen the biggest previous construction booms . 
But depression in the construction sector and unemployment among its ex-workers would be balanced by exuberance in the manufacturing sector , rising prices for manufactured goods , and long hours and high wages for manufacturing workers 
That is what &quot; mismatch &quot; structural unemployment looks like - and it is not what we have today , at least not in Europe and North America . 
In the past three years , employment in construction has shrunk , but so has employment in manufacturing , wholesale trade , retail trade , transportation and warehousing , information distribution and communications , professional and business services , educational services , leisure and hospitality , and in the public sector . 
Employment is up in health care , Internet-related businesses , and perhaps in logging and mining . 
In the United States , the past three years have seen employment fall from 137.8 million people in July 2007 to slightly less than 130 million in July 2010 - a decline of 7.9 million during a period in which the adult population grew by six million . 
What we have witnessed is not a shift in demand into sectors lacking an adequate number of qualified and productive workers , but rather a collapse in the level of aggregate demand . 
This may well look like structural unemployment in three years . 
In three years , we may well see labor shortages , rising wages , and increasing prices in expanding sectors , accompanied by high unemployment elsewhere in the economy . 
But that is not our problem now . 
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
