Romney versus Obama 
CAMBRIDGE - While the presidential primary elections in the United States are not over , Mitt Romney is now almost certain to be the party &apos;s nominee to face Democratic President Barack Obama in November . 
As Governor of Massachusetts , Romney built a record as a competent and moderate conservative , a political profile that suited him to the state &apos;s electorate . 
Now , as the party &apos;s presumptive nominee , he must move back toward the political center , where the majority of voters are to be found . 
So which is the real Mitt Romney ? 
And how can voters judge the two candidates ? 
Obama has a proven track record , albeit one that has disappointed many who voted for him in 2008 . 
Of course , his supporters argue that he had to adapt to two ongoing wars and the worst recession since the 1930 &quot; s . 
Moreover , after the 2010 mid-term elections , a hostile Republican-controlled House of Representatives blocked his initiatives . 
Romney , for his part , will hold up Obama &apos;s early , still-unmet promises , while Obama will call Romney a &quot; flip-flopper &quot; who changes his positions to suit the moment ( and the audience ) . 
In fact , the difficulty of predicting the eventual winner &apos;s performance in office is not new . 
In his 2000 presidential bid , George W. Bush famously promised &quot; compassionate conservatism &quot; and a humble foreign policy , but governed very differently , as when he decided to invade Iraq . 
Likewise , Woodrow Wilson and Lyndon Johnson campaigned on promises of peace , but each took America to war shortly after being elected . 
Do such post-election changes in direction make a mockery of democracy ? 
How can voters make intelligent judgments when campaigns are so carefully scripted and slickly promoted ? 
Leadership theorists suggest that we should pay less attention to leaders &quot; policy promises than to their emotional intelligence - their self-mastery and ability to reach out to others . 
Contrary to the view that emotions interfere with clear thinking , the ability to understand and regulate emotions can result in more effective thinking . 
As Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes reputedly quipped after meeting Franklin D. Roosevelt : &quot; Second-class intellect , but first-class temperament . &quot; 
Most historians would agree that Roosevelt &apos;s success as a leader rested more on his good nature than on his analytical skills . 
The energy and optimism that he unleashed in his administration &apos;s first hundred days did not reflect concrete policy proposals in his campaign . 
Psychologists have wrestled with the concept of intelligence , and how to assess it , for more than a century . 
General IQ tests measure dimensions of intelligence such as verbal and spatial dexterity , but IQ scores generally predict only about 10-20 % of success in life . 
And , while experts disagree about how much of the other 80 % is attributable to emotional intelligence , they generally agree that it is an important and learnable skill that increases with age and experience , and that individuals possess it to varying degrees . 
Leaders work hard to manage their public images , which requires some of the same emotional discipline and skill that successful actors possess . 
Ronald Reagan &apos;s experience in Hollywood served him well in this regard , and Roosevelt was a master at image management . 
Despite his pain and difficulty in moving on legs crippled by polio , he maintained a cheery exterior and avoided being photographed in a wheelchair . 
Whether they realize it or not , leaders always convey signals . 
Emotional intelligence involves the awareness and control of such signals , and the self-discipline that prevents personal psychological needs from distorting policy . 
If emotional intelligence is inauthentic , others will likely find out in the long run . 
Richard Nixon , for example , was strong on cognitive skills , but weak on emotional intelligence . 
He was able to strategize effectively on foreign policy , but was less able to control the personal insecurities that eventually led to his downfall - a shortcoming that emerged only over time . 
Indeed , it was not until well into his presidency that the public learned of his infamous &quot; enemies list . &quot; 
Bush showed emotional intelligence in midlife by mastering his problems with alcohol , and in displaying the courage to persevere with unpopular policies . 
Like Wilson , Bush had an obstinate commitment to his vision that inhibited learning and adjustment . 
Perhaps the flexibility that Obama and Romney have shown is not such a bad quality for a president after all . 
The rigors of the prolonged campaign provide voters with some clues about stamina and self-discipline . 
Each of the Republican candidates took a turn as front-runner in this race , and the rigors of the primary season exposed the flaws in some , like Texas Governor Rick Perry , who were initially attractive . 
Now , in the general election , how Romney , in particular , relates to his party &apos;s platform will tell us something about the strength of his independence and future cabinet appointments . 
But the most important variable for voters to examine is the candidate &apos;s biography . 
I do not mean the slick books and television advertisements that are produced for their campaigns . 
While image consultants and acting ability can mask a candidate &apos;s character , an integrated life over time is the best basis to judge the authenticity of the next president &apos;s temperament and how he will govern . 
Above all , sophisticated voters will themselves be emotionally intelligent enough to be prepared for surprises . 
When their candidate disappoints them - as he inevitably will , regardless of the election &apos;s outcome - they will bear in mind that democracy is the worst system , except for all of the others .
