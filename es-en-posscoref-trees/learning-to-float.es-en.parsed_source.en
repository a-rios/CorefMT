Learning to Float 
BEIJING - Despite shaky economic fundamentals , US government securities are usually regarded as a safe haven . 
Whenever a crisis erupts , the value of US Treasury bonds gets a boost . 
Indeed , US Treasuries were among the few assets that did not decline during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 . 
But the safe-haven status of US government securities is an illusion . 
They are safe only in the sense that no one can stop the Federal Reserve from operating its printing presses at full speed . 
The market value of Treasuries depends on a wide range of factors . 
Now it is essentially sustained by a Ponzi scheme , with the Fed &apos;s policy of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; keeping the price of Treasuries artificially high . 
But , at end of the day , no currency can defy the laws of economic gravity . 
The market price of Treasuries eventually will fall to levels dictated by US economic fundamentals . 
For decades , China has been investing its vast savings abroad , waiting for greater efficiency in domestic investment allocation before starting to dissave . 
China usually holds US Treasuries to maturity and re-invests the principal and proceeds . 
What matters is not variations in the book value of these reserves , but rather their real value in terms of purchasing power when China decides to cash in . 
We do not know what the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC , the central bank ) is doing at the moment in the bond market . 
What we do know is that China should have begun exiting gradually from US government securities long ago . 
But , according to US Treasury data , China &apos;s holdings of US government securities totaled $ 1.16 trillion at the end of 2010 , accounting for roughly 60 % of the overall increase in foreign official holdings of US government debt . 
China &apos;s holdings of US Treasuries increased by $ 351 billion between June 2009 and June 2010 alone , the largest jump on record . 
But they seem to show that , despite sharper rhetoric in Sino-US relations , China has continued lending to the US in order to keep its export machine going and avoid booking large foreign-exchange losses . 
It may be too late to do anything about China &apos;s existing stock of US treasuries without causing a serious political and financial backlash . 
But China should at least stop increasing its holdings . 
Since 2009 , China &apos;s trade surplus has dropped significantly , which many in China hail as progress in rebalancing . 
Yet China &apos;s 2010 trade surplus was still $ 183 billion ; its current-account surplus soared 25 % from 2009 , to $ 306.2 billion ; and its balance-of-payments surplus last year totaled more than $ 470 billion - the bulk of which must have been invested in new holdings of foreign-exchange reserves . 
Needless to say , these surpluses reflect a gross misallocation of resources . 
Above a certain limit , China &apos;s stockpiles of US treasury bonds imply welfare losses , not to mention the capital losses that the country almost certainly will suffer . 
Is China destined to see the value of its savings evaporate ? 
Given the trade and current-account surpluses , the PBOC must intervene in currency markets , buying the dollar and selling renminbi , to prevent - or moderate - the appreciation of the renminbi exchange rate . 
But such interventions inevitably translate into more holdings of US government securities . 
To stop this accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves , and thus minimize China &apos;s welfare and capital losses , the simplest solution would be for the PBOC to call a halt to intervention . 
But this implies that China must allow the renminbi to float freely , and thus to appreciate . 
China &apos;s official position is that the renminbi is not seriously undervalued . 
In that case , the government should not fear the end of intervention . 
Indeed , some Chinese authorities also maintain that renminbi appreciation would have no significant impact on China &apos;s trade balance because they believe that China &apos;s trade surplus is a reflection of excess saving and hence has nothing to do with the exchange rate . 
If so , there would be no need for China to worry about even a large jump in the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate . 
The true risk lies in the possibility that the renminbi is significantly undervalued and that appreciation would have a major impact on China &apos;s trade balance . 
In that case , China would have to accept an export slowdown and an increase in unemployment in order to avoid huge capital losses on its dollar reserves . 
Currently , the government is trying to slow the GDP growth rate , and job shortages are emerging in coastal areas . 
With the fiscal position still strong , the government should be able to help enterprises and workers that suffer undue pain from the renminbi &apos;s appreciation . 
Moreover , while exchange-rate policy is not an instrument for dealing with China &apos;s domestic inflation , renminbi appreciation would certainly help the government meet its goal of keeping the annual rate below 4 % in 2011 . 
Indeed , the increase in foreign-exchange reserves has been the single most important monetary source of inflation , as the PBOC has run into trouble sterilizing the inflows . 
The end of intervention in currency markets would allow the PBOC to shrug off the burden of sterilization and concentrate on fighting inflation . 
Ending central-bank intervention in currency markets is a complex issue . 
The devil is in the details . 
But , under any circumstances , the economic and welfare costs of China &apos;s slow pace in adjusting the renminbi &apos;s exchange-rate are too high and will increase by the day . 
It is time for China to seriously consider allowing the renminbi to float freely , while reserving the right to intervene when it must , and tighten the management of cross-border capital flows ( permissible under last November &apos;s G-20 agreements ) .
