Five Years of Financial Non-Reform 
STANFORD - Five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the largest global financial crisis since the Great Depression , outsize banking sectors have left economies shattered in Ireland , Iceland , and Cyprus . 
Banks in Italy , Spain , and elsewhere are not lending enough . 
China &apos;s credit binge is turning into a bust . 
In short , the world &apos;s financial system remains dangerous and dysfunctional . 
Worse , despite years of debate , no consensus about the nature of the financial system &apos;s problems - much less how to fix them - has emerged . 
And that appears to reflect the banks &quot; political power . 
For example , Vince Cable , the United Kingdom &apos;s business secretary , recently accused Bank of England regulators - whom he called &quot; capital Taliban &quot; - of holding back the country &apos;s economic recovery by imposing excessive burdens on banks . 
Cable appears to believe the banks &quot; lobbyists when they claim that lending and growth would suffer if banks were forced to &quot; hold more capital . &quot; 
Such claims by senior policymakers are hardly unique to the UK ; but they are false and misleading . 
Bank capital is not cash reserves that must be &quot; set aside &quot; ; it is unborrowed money that can be used to make loans . 
Simply put , lending and economic growth have suffered since 2007 because highly indebted financial institutions could not absorb their losses , not because of regulations that sought to reduce their indebtedness . 
The regulations in place when the crisis erupted were both inadequate and inadequately enforced , and the reforms proposed since then do little better . 
The proposed Basel III reforms , for example , would allow banks to fund up to 97 % of their assets with borrowed money ; some investments could be made entirely by borrowed funds . 
The perils of this approach should be obvious by now . 
When homeowners cannot pay their mortgages , they may lose their house , blighting the entire neighborhood . 
The same is true of financial institutions , as the Lehman bankruptcy showed . 
Moreover , the effects of heavy borrowing are felt before borrowers default . 
Distressed or &quot; underwater &quot; homeowners do not invest much in maintenance or improvements . 
Similarly , weak banks with overhanging debts that prevent them from funding worthy investments are a drag on the economy . 
Flawed regulations further distort weak banks &quot; behavior - for example , by biasing them in favor of making loans to governments or investing in marketable securities over lending to businesses . 
Regulators too often tolerate , and sometimes support , weak banks , denying the reality of their dire condition . 
This is counterproductive . 
Instead , regulators must take forceful steps to unwind zombie banks and compel viable banks to rely more on equity markets , where risk is traded and priced , to become stronger . 
Banning payouts to shareholders and requiring banks to raise funds by selling new shares would bolster them without restricting their ability to lend . 
Banks that cannot sell their shares at any price may be too weak to survive without subsidies . 
Such banks are dysfunctional and must be unwound . 
If we want safer and healthier banks , there can be no substitute for requiring banks to reduce their reliance on borrowing . 
As lenders , banks lose when borrowers default . 
Banks themselves , however , are the heaviest borrowers , routinely funding more than 90 % - and sometimes more than 95 % - of their investments by taking on debt . 
( By contrast , non-financial corporations rarely borrow more than 70 % of their assets , and often much less , despite the absence of any regulation of their leverage ratios . ) 
Cyprus illustrates the problem . 
Beginning in 2010 , Cypriot banks invested some of their deposits in Greek government bonds , which promised interest rates of more than 10 % - sometimes even 15 % or 20 % . 
As long as Greece paid these high rates , Cypriot banks could pay their depositors attractive rates , such as 4.5 % , and thrive . 
Cypriot banks passed stress tests in July 2011 . 
Yet , in early 2012 , their Greek bonds lost 75 % of their value . 
Because the banks made their investments with too little unborrowed money , they became insolvent . 
After being kept afloat for a year with help from the European Central Bank , the Cypriot banks were forced to face their losses . 
One was shut . 
Deposits over € 100,000 ( $ 133,000 ) incurred losses . 
Eurozone taxpayers provided € 10 billion in bailout funds . 
Remarkably , regulators had allowed Cypriot banks to engage in the practices that led to their troubles . 
Although investing in Greek bonds was risky - reflected in the high rates the bonds promised - the regulations ignored the possibility of a loss . 
While the upside of the risks played out , the banks &quot; profits benefited their shareholders and managers , politicians were happy , and the banks grew enormously relative to the economy . 
The proposed Basel III regulations set wholly insufficient minimum capital requirements and maintain a failed approach to adjusting the requirements to risk . 
Within the eurozone , for example , banks can extend loans to any government using exclusively borrowed money . 
The French-Belgian bank Dexia , like Cypriot banks and many others since 2008 , failed or were bailed out from losses on risky investments that regulators had considered safe . 
Regulations everywhere appear to be based on the false notion that banks should have &quot; just enough &quot; equity . 
Equity is not scarce for viable banks , and the &quot; science &quot; of complex risk weights and stress tests is a harmful illusion . 
Instead , regulation should seek to force banks &quot; investors to bear much more of their own risk , and thus to care much more about managing it , in order to limit the collateral damage of their excessive borrowing . 
Some say that banks are inherently special , because they allocate society &apos;s savings and create liquidity . 
In fact , banks have become special mainly in their ability to get away with so much gambling at others &quot; expense . 
Nothing about financial intermediation justifies allowing banks to distort the economy and endanger the public as much as they do . 
Unfortunately , despite the enormous harm from the financial crisis , little has changed in the politics of banking . 
Too many politicians and regulators put their own interests and those of &quot; their &quot; banks ahead of their duty to protect taxpayers and citizens . 
We must demand better .
