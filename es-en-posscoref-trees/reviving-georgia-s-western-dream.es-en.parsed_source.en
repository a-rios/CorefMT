Reviving Georgia &apos;s Western Dream 
Georgia &apos;s recent instability has dealt a blow to its international reputation as a new democracy , and poses a challenge to the European Union as well . 
Faced with street protests in November , President Mikheil Saakashvili claimed that Russian-Georgian tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili was conspiring to bring down the government . 
Ever since Saakashvili &apos;s inauguration in January 2004 , following the 2003 &quot; Rose Revolution , &quot; Georgia &apos;s government has displayed EU flags on official occasions . 
Georgians share that enthusiasm . 
A poll conducted by the International Republican Institute in September 2007 indicated that 81 % of Georgians support joining the EU . 
But , regardless of the election &apos;s outcome , the recent crisis exposes a lack of commitment by the EU to security and democracy in Georgia . 
Despite Georgia &apos;s strategic location on the Black Sea , bordering Russia , Azerbaijan , and Turkey - and on a key trade route linking the EU , Iran , Russia , and Central Asia - Europe has dragged its feet on the country &apos;s most enduring political problems . 
On the Georgian side , It is well understood - at least by the political elite - that EU membership is a distant prospect at best . 
An EU-Georgia ENP Action Plan was signed in November 2006 , but it is unlikely to meet expectations . 
Indeed , the ENP comes second to co-operation with NATO as a priority for Georgia , in part because Georgians , feeling threatened by Russia , crave security above all . 
Moreover , while the recent state of emergency was a serious setback , NATO membership , unlike EU accession , is still within reach . 
This makes all the difference . 
The security interests of Georgia and the EU coincide least when it comes to the so-called &quot; frozen conflicts &quot; in the Kremlin-backed breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia - it is no accident that &quot; Promoting Peaceful Resolution of Internal Conflicts &quot; ranks only sixth among the ENP Action Plan &apos;s priorities . 
Georgia wants a reluctant EU to be more engaged , but each side understands engagement differently . 
The EU supports politically uncontroversial confidence-building measures that can reap results only in the long term , if ever . 
The Georgian government views the Abkhazian and Ossetian conflicts as the country &apos;s principal security threat and impediment to development . 
It expects bolder moves from the EU , such as explicit endorsement of the Georgian-Ossetian working group , which includes the alternative , pro-autonomy South Ossetian government of Dmitri Sanakoyev , but is boycotted by the pro-Russian separatist government in Tskhinvali . 
The EU has avoided any such gesture , seeking to avoid further tension with Russia . 
On the other hand , there are better prospects for strengthening the EU &apos;s role in democracy development . 
&quot; Strengthening the Rule of Law , Building State Institutions , Protecting Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms &quot; occupies first place in the ENP Action Plan . 
Though judicial independence and protection of human rights remain conspicuously weak , Saakashvili &apos;s government has increased the civil service &apos;s efficiency , improved public infrastructure , fought corruption , reduced crime , and created an attractive investment environment . 
However , the opposition &apos;s shortcomings pose a further obstacle to democratic development . 
The government &apos;s opponents can mobilize public protests , as they did in November , but they are much less capable of formulating alternative policy agendas and attracting support for them . 
With no internal system of checks and balances in Georgia - the only way to sustain democratic institutions - the international community becomes a compensating actor , with the EU well placed to take the lead . 
In fact , while the Saakashvili government &apos;s clampdown showed the structural weaknesses of Georgia &apos;s democracy , the aftermath has also shown that Georgia &apos;s Western ambition remains intact , because the government understands that it cannot afford any long-term deviation from democratic norms . 
The EU &apos;s special representative in the South Caucasus , Swedish diplomat Peter Semneby , played a crucial role in bringing back Imedi TV in time to restore media balance ahead of the presidential election - possibly the first time that the EU took a leading role in seminal political events in Georgia . 
This was not part of any prefigured Action Plan , but it shows that , given the political will , the EU can play an active role in promoting democracy and stability .
