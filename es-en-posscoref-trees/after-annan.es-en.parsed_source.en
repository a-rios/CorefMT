After Annan 
Who will succeed Kofi Annan as UN Secretary General is a hot question among diplomats . 
Shashi Tharoor , UN Under Secretary General , explores what the job involves . 
&quot; The most impossible job on earth &quot; was how the first United Nations Secretary General , Trygve Lie , described the post to his successor , Dag Hammarskjold , in 1953 . 
Time has not made the job any easier.The framers of the UN Charter gave the Secretary General two distinct functions : &quot; chief administrative officer of the Organization &quot; and also an independent official whom the General Assembly and Security Council can entrust with certain unspecified ( but implicitly political ) tasks . 
Each holder of the office must demonstrate whether he is more Secretary than General.Paradoxes abound . 
The Secretary General is expected to enjoy the backing of governments , especially the five permanent members of the Security Council , but be above partiality to any of them . 
He establishes his credentials by bureaucratic or diplomatic service , but , once elected , must transcend his past and serve as a voice of the world , even a &quot; secular Pope . &quot; 
The Secretary General is entrusted with assisting member states to make sound and well-informed decisions , which he is then obliged to execute , but he is also authorized to influence their work and even to propose actions that they should undertake . 
He administers a complex organization and serves as head of the UN agencies , but must exercise this role within budgetary and regulatory constraints imposed by the member governments . 
True , the Secretary General has an unparalleled agenda-shaping authority . 
But he does not have the power to execute all his ideas , and he articulates a vision that only governments can fulfill . 
He moves the world , but he cannot direct it . 
It was Hammarskjold who , at the height of the Cold War , first argued that an impartial civil servant could be &quot; politically celibate &quot; without being &quot; politically virgin . &quot; 
The Secretary General could play a political role without losing his impartiality , provided he hewed faithfully to the Charter and to international law . 
With the Cold War &apos;s end , Kofi Annan has gone further than his predecessors in using the &quot; bully pulpit &quot; of his office . 
He boldly raised the question of the morality of intervention and the duty of the individual to follow his conscience , and he challenged member states to resolve the tensions between state sovereignty and their responsibility to protect ordinary people . 
Often , a Secretary General can raise an awkward question but not dictate the appropriate answer ; 
The UN is often seen embodying international legitimacy , yet the Secretary General &apos;s pronouncements often have less impact on the conduct of member states than the Pope &apos;s strictures on birth control.The Secretary General knows that he can accomplish little without the support of members whose inaction on one issue or another he might otherwise want to denounce . 
He cannot afford to allow frustration on any one issue to affect his ability to elicit cooperation from governments on a range of others . 
Annan once made the point by citing an old Ghanaian proverb : &quot; Never hit a man on the head when you have your fingers between his teeth . &quot; Today &apos;s single-superpower world also means that the Secretary General must manage a relationship that is vital to the UN &apos;s survival without mortgaging his own integrity and independence . 
The insistent demands of some in the US that the UN prove its utility to America - demands that could not have been made in the same terms during the Cold War - oblige a Secretary General to walk a tightrope between heeding US priorities and the preferences of the membership as a whole . 
Paradoxically , he can be most useful to the US when he demonstrates his independence from it . 
Member states &quot; increasing micro-management of budgets has also weakened the Secretary General &apos;s authority . 
Both Annan and his predecessor , Boutros Boutros-Ghali , embarked on ambitious administrative reforms , but were unable to address the far greater levels of procedural and regulatory inertia in areas under the authority of the member states . 
No Secretary General has enjoyed real independence from governments : the UN operates without embassies or intelligence services , and member states resist any attempt to acquire such capabilities . 
A Secretary General &apos;s reach thus cannot exceed his grasp , and his grasp cannot extend across the member states &quot; frontiers - or their pocketbooks . 
Indeed , today the Secretary General commands great diplomatic legitimacy , and even greater media visibility , but less political power than the language of the UN Charter suggests . 
To be effective , he must be skilled at managing staff and budgets , gifted at public diplomacy ( and its behind-the-scenes variant ) , and able to engage the loyalties of a wide array of external actors , including non-governmental organizations , business groups , and journalists . 
He also must convince the nations of the poor and conflict-ridden South that their interests are uppermost in his mind while ensuring that he can work effectively with the wealthy and powerful North . 
He must recognize the power and the prerogatives of the Security Council , especially its five permanent members , while staying attentive to the priorities and passions of the General Assembly . 
And he must present member states with politically achievable proposals and implement his mandates within the means they provide him . 
Above all , the Secretary General needs a vision of the higher purpose of his office and an awareness of its potential and limitations . 
In other words , to be successful , he must conceive and project a vision of the UN as it should be , while administering and defending the organization as it is . 
Truly an impossible job .
