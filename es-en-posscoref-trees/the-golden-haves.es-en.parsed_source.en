The Golden Haves 
CAMBRIDGE  -  
Microsoft founder Bill Gates first penetrated Gabriel &apos;s consciousness a couple of years ago , when his father served as a warm-up act to Gates at a large conference sponsored by the Danish government . 
Ever since , Gabriel has been fascinated by the seemingly infinite possibilities of having $ 60 billion . 
For example , whenever I tell Gabriel that something is unbelievably valuable ( even , say , a great painting in a museum ) , he invariably says , &quot; But Bill Gates could buy it , right ? &quot; 
Yes , Gates could buy the whole museum . 
But then he would just turn around and give it back so everyone else can see it , so there is no point . 
Gabriel is not entirely convinced . 
Gabriel has decided that if he can &apos;t become a professional basketball player when he grows up , then he &apos;d like to buy a team . 
As an economics professor , I cannot help but ask him if he knows that it costs $ 300-500 million to buy a National Basketball Association team . 
&quot; But Bill Gates could do it . 
He could buy all the teams in the league , right ? &quot; 
Yes , I say . 
But if Bill Gates were to own the entire NBA , how would he decide which team to root for ? 
Gabriel concedes the point , but I can tell that again he is not convinced . 
Gates is not the only one who can easily buy teams and paintings . 
The latest Forbes list of America &apos;s wealthiest individuals showed that last year &apos;s highest nine earners , whose ranks include New York City &apos;s mayor , Michael Bloomberg , managed to increase their wealth by $ 5-9 billion last year . 
Yes , that is just the annual increase in their wealth . 
Collectively , their $ 55 billion in earnings outstripped the entire national income of more than 100 countries . 
To put these astronomical numbers in perspective , I had Gabriel try to confirm that to be among the top nine earners in the United States , you had to pull in at least $ 150 per second , including time spent eating and sleeping . 
That is $ 9,000 per minute , or $ 540,000 per hour . 
How much do America &apos;s highest income earners make compared to the world &apos;s billion poorest individuals ? 
Well , if the top nine donated their earnings , it would be the equivalent of about three months income for the bottom billion . 
( Gabriel knows , of course , that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have donated tens of billions already . ) 
As for the other nine months , given that the US accounts for only 25 % of world income , it is a fair guess that there are some very wealthy individuals elsewhere who might be able to kick in . 
( Mexican telephone magnate Carlos Slim , for example , is a close competitor to Gates for the title of the world &apos;s richest man . ) 
Mind you , the idea that the ultra-rich could easily solve poverty is stupefyingly na√Øve . 
Most serious academic research strongly supports the view that rich countries can best help poor regions like Africa by opening their markets , and by providing assistance in building physical and institutional infrastructure . 
The greatest successes in fighting global poverty have come from China and India , two countries that have largely pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps . 
But this seems too complicated to explain to Gabriel just yet . 
So I retreat to the simplistic rock star / United Nations view of how great it would be if we could give more money . 
Are massive income and wealth differences an inevitable outcome of fast growth ? 
By and large , the answer from history is &quot; yes . &quot; 
China , whose growth performance since 1970 has now broken every record , is well on its way to having the world &apos;s most unequal income distribution . 
Indeed , China has passed the US and is nearing Latin American levels of inequality . 
Policy solutions are not easy . 
Many super-earners are also super-creative and bring enormous value . 
Places like the United Kingdom actively court wealthy foreign nationals through extraordinary preferential treatment of their investment income . 
The ultra-rich are an ultra-mobile group , too . 
If you are earning $ 540,000 an hour , it does not take too long to save up to buy an apartment , even in London . 
Anyway , there are limits to how much tax pressure the political system can apply to the ultra-rich . 
Consider that any of the top nine American earners make more in two days than leading US Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton raises for her campaign in a good quarter of the year . 
Rather than punitively taxing wealth , globalization strengthens the case for shifting to a flat tax on income ( or better yet consumption ) with a moderately high exemption . 
Aside from the usual efficiency arguments , it is just going to become increasingly difficult and costly to maintain complex and idiosyncratic national tax arrangements . 
Unfortunately , movements towards fundamental tax reform are on the back burner in most countries . 
One can only hope that our children &apos;s generation will grow up to live in a world that does a better job of balancing efficiency and equity than we do . 
Gabriel says he is going to think about it .
