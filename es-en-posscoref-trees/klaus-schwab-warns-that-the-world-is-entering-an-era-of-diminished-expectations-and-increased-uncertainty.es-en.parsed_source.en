The Global Economy in 2014 
GENEVA - At the dawn of a new year , the world is in the midst of several epic transitions . 
Economic growth patterns , the geopolitical landscape , the social contract that binds people together , and our planet &apos;s ecosystem are all undergoing radical , simultaneous transformations , generating anxiety and , in many places , turmoil . 
From an economic standpoint , we are entering an era of diminished expectations and increased uncertainty . 
In terms of growth , the world will have to live with less . 
To understand the implications of this , consider the following : If the global economy grew at its pre-crisis pace ( more than 5 % per year ) for the foreseeable future , its size would double in less than 15 years ; at 3 % , doubling world GDP would take about 25 years . 
This makes a significant difference to the speed at which wealth creation occurs , with profound effects on expectations . 
We ignore the power of compound growth to our detriment . 
As for uncertainty , the world &apos;s four largest economies are currently undergoing major transitions . 
The US is striving to boost growth in a fractured political environment . 
China is moving from a growth model based on investment and exports to one led by internal demand . 
Europe is struggling to preserve the integrity of its common currency while resolving a multitude of complex institutional issues . 
And Japan is trying to combat two decades of deflation with aggressive and unconventional monetary policies . 
For each , the formulation and outcome of complex and sensitive policy decisions implies many &quot; unknowns , &quot; with global interdependence heightening the risk of large unintended consequences . 
For example , the US Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of quantitative easing ( QE ) has had a major effect on other countries &quot; currencies , and on capital flows to and from emerging markets . 
When QE was launched , it was the least flawed of the available policies , and it averted a catastrophic global depression . 
The Fed &apos;s QE policy , and variants of it elsewhere , have caused the major central banks &quot; balance sheets to expand dramatically ( from $ 5-6 trillion prior to the crisis to almost $ 20 trillion now ) , causing financial markets to become addicted to easy money . 
As a result , the longer QE lasts , the greater the collateral damage to the real economy . 
The concern now is that when the Fed begins to taper QE and dollar liquidity drains from global markets , structural problems and imbalances will resurface . 
After all , competitiveness-enhancing reforms in many advanced economies remain far from complete , while the ratio of these countries &quot; total public and private debt to GDP is now 30 % higher than before the crisis . 
This source of uncertainty coincides with weakening performance in many emerging countries . 
Back in 2007 , emerging-market growth was expected to outpace that of advanced economies by a wide margin , before converging . 
Today , the advanced economies contribute more to global GDP growth than emerging countries , where growth is forecast to average 4 % in the coming years . 
Economic conditions are slowly improving in high-income countries , but a range of downward pressures may persist for years . 
The US economy , for example , remains stuck in a subpar recovery : inflation is too low and unemployment is too high . 
Official data have often been better than expected , reflecting how resilient , adaptive , and innovative the US economy is , but pre-crisis consumer-spending and growth patterns are unlikely to recur . 
Improvements in the eurozone are real but tenuous . 
The good news is that the disaster predicted by many pundits has been avoided , and the recession is coming to an end . 
But improvement does not mean resurgence : achieving the robust growth needed to reduce high unemployment , lower the debt / GDP ratio , and improve the fiscal outlook remains elusive . 
The greatest risk for the eurozone in the foreseeable future is not a disorderly exit by some countries , but rather a prolonged period of stagnant growth and high unemployment . 
Meanwhile , the emerging-market slowdown may well persist , particularly in the largest economies . 
Over the past 15 years , the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) have achieved remarkable progress , but their reforms - including new banking regulations and currency regimes - have been among the least difficult to implement . 
So-called second-generation reforms , which are more structural in nature , are vital to long-term growth but much more difficult to realize . 
Elimination of subsidies , labor market and judicial reforms , and effective anti-corruption measures are politically charged and often are blocked by powerful vested interests . 
The global growth slowdown is taking place against a backdrop of rising economic inequality , owing to labor &apos;s declining share of national income - a worldwide phenomenon , resulting from globalization and technological progress , that poses a serious challenge to policymakers . 
Systems that propagate inequality , or that seem unable to stem its rise , contain the seeds of their own destruction . 
Even in stronger-performing countries , such as the US or the United Kingdom , faster GDP growth has yet to boost real incomes . 
In the US , for example , median household income has fallen by more than 5 % since the recovery began . 
More generally , lower growth is fueling popular protest and social unrest , particularly in countries that were growing rapidly ( for example , Brazil , Turkey , and South Africa ) , owing to the impact of rising living standards on expectations . 
In such a charged social and political context , reviving high-quality economic growth is crucial . 
Technological progress is a distinct , but highly uncertain , possibility . 
Many disruptive technologies ( for example , advanced robotics , next-generation genomics , energy storage , renewable energy , and 3D printing ) could drive future growth , but their full potential can be realized only in the distant future . 
With most governments facing fiscal constraints , officials are reluctant to consider projects that might increase public debt . 
A focus on four areas , in particular - infrastructure , education , green energy , and sustainable agriculture - could yield high economic and social returns . 
Ultimately , however , the path to sustained growth requires not just new policies , but also a new mindset . 
Our societies must become more entrepreneurial , more focused on establishing gender parity , and more rooted in social inclusion . 
There simply is no other way to return the global economy to a path of strong and sustained growth .
