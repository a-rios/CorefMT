A Tale of Two Terminals 
BEIJING - Ever since it opened recently , Terminal 5 of London &apos;s Heathrow Airport has been plagued with failures . 
On the other side of the globe , Terminal 3 in Beijing , which opened for full operations just one day before Terminal 5 , has been operating almost without a glitch . 
The media , unsurprisingly , have feasted upon the failures of T5 in London , while neglecting the successes of T3 in Beijing . 
By all measures , Beijing &apos;s T3 surpasses London &apos;s T5 . 
Whereas T5 can handle only 12,000 bags an hour ( when it handles them at all ) and 30 million passengers per year , T3 can handle 20,000 bags an hour and 50 million passengers . 
While T5 will mostly service British Airways , T3 will service Air China and two dozen other airlines . 
At one million square meters , T3 in Beijing is the largest terminal in the world , but was much less costly to build than T5 in London . 
Using the most recent exchange rates , T3 cost only $ 3.86 billion compared with $ 8.6 billion for London &apos;s T5 . 
Furthermore , T3 took less than four years to complete , whereas T5 took almost 20 years . 
But to call T3 a success for socialism and T5 a failure of capitalism would be to miss a fundamental point . 
After all , if China &apos;s political system can still be called socialism , it is at best &quot; socialism with Chinese characteristics , &quot; which embodies an increasing amount of market-oriented economic activity and greater economic openness and transparency . 
It would be similarly misleading to attribute T3 &quot; s success to China alone . 
After all , T3 was designed by a Briton , and has incorporated the most recent architectural and operational trends , styles , and standards in the world . 
T3 in Beijing is just one of many projects China has recently built to improve its transportation infrastructure . 
In addition to having become the world &apos;s industrial park , China now has more mobile phone subscribers than the combined populations of the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia and New Zealand , and the number of Internet users has just surpassed that in the US . 
All of this development raises a fundamental question : how should we make sense of the explosive productivity growth that has become China &apos;s new hallmark ? 
Those who cling to old ideological stereotypes face an almost impossible task in reconciling China &apos;s rapid growth with what they condemn as China &apos;s failing system . 
The truth is that ever since the end of the 1970 &quot; s , China has become convinced that peace and stability are the most important preconditions for its development . 
Thus , anything that may distract China from its focus on peace , stability , and development has been strongly resisted . 
This may help explain why T3 in Beijing is such a success , and why Chinese are now more united than ever before in condemning attempts to hijack or sully the Olympics for ulterior motives . 
I hope that when millions of overseas passengers pass through T3 , including those who do so during the Beijing Olympics , they will pause and reflect upon the distance China has traveled over the past three decades in its reform and opening to the outside world . Granted , China still has further to go , and many people may find fault with much in the country . 
But they should not refuse to acknowledge that China &apos;s mission to turn a nation of 1.3 billion poor people into a developed country through peace and free trade is one of the great , honorable , and most difficult sagas in human history . 
Following the disturbances in Tibet and the troubles affecting the Olympic torch &apos;s progress around the world , some voices abroad are showing a greater inclination to dismiss , vilify , humiliate , or even split China . 
But it would be best for all to pause a moment , contemplate T3 in Beijing , consider what it represents , and reflect on what an accomplishment the quick completion of such an iconic structure is for an emerging country like China .
