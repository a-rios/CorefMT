Sustainable Cities 
NEW YORK - To most people , big , densely-populated cities look like ecological nightmares , wastelands of concrete and garbage and diesel fumes and traffic jams . 
By the most significant measures , the greenest community in the United States is New York City , the only American city that approaches environmental standards set elsewhere in the world . 
The average New Yorker generates 7.1 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually ; that is more than the average Swede , who generates 5.6 metric tons , but it is less than 30 % of the US average of 24.5 metric tons . 
Residents of Manhattan , the most densely populated of the city &apos;s five boroughs , generate even less . 
The key to New York &apos;s relative environmental benignity is its extreme compactness . 
Manhattan &apos;s density is approximately 67,000 people per square mile , or more than 800 times that of the US as a whole and roughly 30 times that of Los Angeles . 
Moving people closer together reduces the distances between their daily destinations and limits their opportunities for reckless consumption , as well as forcing the majority to live in some of the most inherently energy-efficient residential structures in the world : apartment buildings . 
New Yorkers , individually , use less water , burn less fossil fuel , and produce less solid waste . 
Their households also use much less electricity : 4,696 kilowatt hours per year , compared with 16,116 kilowatt hours in Dallas , Texas . 
Most important , New York &apos;s highly concentrated population and comprehensive public transit system enable the majority of residents to live without owning automobiles , an unthinkable deprivation almost anywhere else in the US . 
At an environmental presentation in 2008 , I sat next to an investment banker who was initially skeptical when I explained that New Yorkers have a significantly lower environmental impact than other Americans . 
&quot; But that &apos;s just because they &apos;re all crammed together , &quot; he said . 
Well , yes . 
He then disparaged New Yorkers &quot; energy efficiency as &quot; unconscious , &quot; as though intention were more important than results . 
In fact , unconscious efficiencies are the most desirable ones , because they require neither enforcement nor a personal commitment to cutting back . 
I spoke with one energy expert , who , when I asked him to explain why per-capita energy consumption was so much lower in Europe than in the US , said , &quot; It &apos;s not a secret , and it &apos;s not the result of some miraculous technological breakthrough . 
It &apos;s because Europeans are more likely to live in dense cities and less likely to own cars . &quot; 
In European cities , as in Manhattan , the most important efficiencies are built-in . 
China and many other non-Western countries are rapidly urbanizing . 
This trend , which has been under way worldwide for decades , is often decried by American environmentalists , who generally prefer people to move in the opposite direction , toward &quot; the land . &quot; 
But urbanization is usually a good thing , both for those moving to cities and for civilization in general . 
Urban families live more compactly , do less damage to fragile ecosystems , burn less fuel , enjoy stronger social ties to larger numbers of people , and , most significantly , produce fewer children , since large families have less economic utility in densely settled areas than they do in marginal agricultural areas . 
The world &apos;s population is expected to reach nine billion by 2042 . 
That &apos;s an increase of seven times the current population of the US , or of the combined current population of India and China . 
If we are to sustain a world of that size , growth must occur almost entirely in cities . 
Unfortunately , many global trends are pushing in the opposite direction . 
Dependence on automobiles is growing in parts of the world that formerly got by without them . 
China &apos;s pool of licensed drivers is growing exponentially , and India is a decade into one of the largest road-building projects in history , a 3,600-mile superhighway known as the Golden Quadrilateral , which links the country &apos;s four largest cities , plus an extensive network of feeder roads . 
All those new highways , in combination with India &apos;s brand-new &quot; People &apos;s Car , &quot; the $ 2,500 Tata Nano , represent an environmental , economic , and cultural disaster in the making . 
If America &apos;s long history of energy-and-emissions gluttony proves anything , it &apos;s that an automobile-dependent society is vastly easier to create than to un-create . 
Moving from walking , bicycling , and public transit to driving is relatively simple , because it requires only wealth , a desire for independence and status , and an inability or unwillingness to look very far into the future . 
Moving from driving back to transit , bicycling , and walking is far harder , because the cars themselves are only part of the problem . 
Much more critical is the inherent inefficiency of the way of life that cars both enable and make necessary , and of the sprawling web of wasteful infrastructure that high levels of individual mechanized mobility lead affluent societies to create . 
Sooner or later , whatever else happens , the world will run out of inexpensive oil . 
Countries with expanding economies would be better off using their new wealth to create ways of life that can be sustained beyond that inescapable point , rather than recklessly investing in a future that has no future . 
Not jumping off a cliff is easier than turning around in mid-fall .
