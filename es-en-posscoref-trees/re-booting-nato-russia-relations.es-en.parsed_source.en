Re-Booting NATO-Russia Relations 
MOSCOW - The crisis in Georgia last August tested Europe &apos;s security system , and the system failed to fulfill its core task of ensuring common security for the continent as a whole . 
As a result , Europe must re-examine its current security arrangements , analyze what happened , and take this analysis into account in reforming those arrangements . 
Even before the Georgia crisis , Russia already saw a need to revisit the mechanisms of European security , including its international and regional institutions and their functions . 
We suggested a new , legally binding treaty system of mutual security guarantees to ensure equal security throughout Europe . 
The European Union believes that the Russian initiative is well grounded and has shown interest in launching such a project . 
There are leaders in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) who are also willing to take part . 
NATO , however , has stood aside . 
I was supposed to put forward Russian proposals on the new security concept to the NATO-Russia Council ( NRC ) last September . 
When the NRC was created in 2002 , it was devised as a mechanism for dialogue , cooperation , and joint decision-making on issues of mutual interest , including non-proliferation and arms control , the fight against terrorism , civil emergency planning , and military-to-military cooperation . 
The NRC also was supposed to act as a forum for &quot; holding prompt consultations &quot; in crisis situations and to prevent such crises by &quot; early identification of emerging problems . &quot; 
Unfortunately , the Georgian crisis demonstrated that Russia &apos;s dialogue with NATO was less substantial than it should have been . 
Yet NATO-Russia cooperation is of the outmost importance to global security . 
We need NATO and NATO needs us in order to face common threats and challenges . 
On the other hand , Russia will not go cap in hand to NATO . 
We are not interested in the illusion of partnership . 
Indeed , Russia &apos;s foremost foreign-policy goal is a real , strategic partnership with the West in which we work together to solve the multitude of modern security problems . 
I don &apos;t have a crystal ball , but I &apos;m certain that several years from now we should be able to look back at the Georgian crisis as a turning point . 
Already we can name three &quot; growth factors &quot; that will help the new security system to mature - the development of the European Security and Defense Policy , the transformation of NATO , and Russia &apos;s return to its rightful position on the world stage . 
Russia is not becoming assertive , aggressive , or imperial , as many observers claim . 
We are only claiming what is rightfully ours - a place in the front row of international relations . 
The world will have to get used to the fact that Russia is no longer a feeble country . 
Is it so incomprehensible that we have strategic interests and national security concerns ? 
Russia has tried for years to get away from Cold War thinking and to persuade our partners to drop their stereotypes . 
After the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , Russia quickly extended a helping hand to the Americans . 
But the West did not appreciate this gesture . 
Military bases have been impetuously established along Russia &apos;s perimeter . 
The United States plans to establish part of its global missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland . 
The Warsaw Pact ceased to exist 20 years ago , but NATO still proceeds eastward , adding new member states for reasons other than enhancing security and democracy . 
Russia is not interested in confrontation ; we want to focus on our own development , prosperity , and stability . 
But successful development is possible only in the context of transparent and equal international relations , together with stability and security in our neighborhood . 
Thus , we are interested in a strong and independent Europe . 
And the development of EU military capacities and EU security policy is an important factor in European and global security . 
It is time for Europe to stop acting like an occupied continent and start displaying its own political will . 
The action taken by the EU in the course of the Georgian crisis proved that Europeans have such an aspiration and are willing to fulfill their role as a global player , which will become increasingly apparent in the coming years . 
As for NATO , we in Russia think it should adapt and transform itself to suit the new environment . 
During this transformation , NATO must keep in mind that the primary responsibility for global peace and security lies with the United Nations . 
For the moment , though , NATO and its leaders have no clear answer to the question : where do we go from here ? 
The Alliance &apos;s strategic concept is outdated , yet it cannot even agree on when to start preparing a new one . 
Its forces are overstretched in Afghanistan , and its members are using it to advance their own goals . 
A real , working NATO-Russia relationship could provide the Alliance with solutions to problems that it cannot tackle on its own . 
It would also give new impetus to the European security system . 
This is what we want to see in the future - and it is a future that is not possible without Russia . 
To see why , simply compare the importance of combating international terrorism with the value of nurturing Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili &apos;s personal ambitions ; things soon fall into place . 
Europe needs an integrated , solid , and indivisible system of comprehensive security . 
We are not calling for abolishing everything and starting from scratch . 
On the contrary , we must build on existing institutions . 
In short , we need to retain the hardware , but update the software . 
Russia &apos;s initiative for a pan-European security treaty should be the new operating system .
