Alan Greenspan on Trial 
The release of Alan Greenspan &apos;s ghostwritten memoirs The Age of Turbulence has elicited charges that he was not such a great central banker after all . 
Stan Collender of National Journal sees the fingerprints of the White House on these attacks : Greenspan is harshly critical of George W. Bush &apos;s administration , after all , and to attack the credibility of Republican ex-policymakers who are critical of Bush is standard counterpunching for it . 
But what is one to make of the criticisms of Greenspan &apos;s tenure at the Federal Reserve ? 
The indictment contains four counts : that Greenspan wrongly cheered the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages , which fueled the housing bubble ; that he wrongly endorsed Bush &apos;s tax cuts ; that he should have reined in the stock market bubble of the 1990 &quot; s ; and that he should have done the same with the real estate bubble of the 2000 &quot; s . 
To the first two counts , Greenspan now pleads guilty . 
He says that he did not understand how the growth of non-standard mortgages had lured borrowers and investors into bearing dangerous risks . 
He was , he now says , focusing on how fixed-rate mortgages are relatively bad deals for borrowers in times of low inflation , which was a mistake . 
Greenspan also pleads guilty to a mistake in early 2001 . 
He thought that he was giving balanced testimony to Congress on government budget issues . 
He testified that it is important to run surpluses to pay down the debt , but that surpluses must not be so large that the government winds up owning American industry . 
He also testified that tax cuts are better than spending increases to keep surpluses from growing too large , but that uncertainty is enormous , so that any tax cuts should be canceled if they threatened to bring us back to an age of deficits . 
Robert Rubin and Kent Conrad warned him that the press would not interpret his testimony as being balanced , and that Congress would interpret it as an excuse to abandon fiscal discipline . 
They were right . 
Greenspan also pleads guilty to misunderstanding the character of the Bush administration . 
He thought that his old reality-based friends from the Ford administration were back in power . 
He thought that he - and Treasury Secretary Paul O &apos;Neill - could win the quiet &quot; inside game &quot; for sensible policy without resorting to an &quot; outside game &quot; that would make his reappointment in 2004 unlikely . 
He was wrong . 
But how serious are these policy-political crimes to which Greenspan now pleads guilty ? 
In my view , they are misdemeanors . 
Against them you have to set what former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers calls Greenspan &apos;s &quot; golden glove &quot; performance at avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years at the Fed . 
The &quot; felonies &quot; of which Greenspan stands accused are the other two charges : that he should have done more to stop the stock market bubble of the late 1990 &quot; s , and that he should have done more to stop the housing bubble of the early 2000 &quot; s . 
Here , Greenspan holds his ground , and pleads not guilty . 
The only way , he says , for the Fed to have kept stock prices in reasonable equilibrium ranges in the late 1990 &quot; s would have been to raise interest rates so high that they hit the real economy on the head with a brick . 
Interest rates high enough to curb stock market speculation would also have curbed construction and other forms of investment , raised unemployment , and sent the economy into recession . 
To cause a significant current evil in order to avoid a possible future danger when our knowledge is limited and our judgments uncertain is , Greenspan believes , unwise . 
In this , he is following a tradition of caution that extends from Edmund Burke to John Maynard Keynes . 
Greenspan mounts a similar defense concerning the housing bubble . 
High construction employment has been good for American workers in the past half-decade - a period that has not produced much good for them . 
Higher interest rates to reduce the housing boom seem , even in retrospect , ill advised if the cost is mass unemployment . 
And Greenspan eschews paternalism : he would not assume the role of a regulator telling people that they cannot buy a house even though a lender is willing to finance it . 
But Greenspan would have served the country and the world better if he had been somewhat more paternalist in slowing the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages . 
He would have served the country and the world better had he been less of a loyal Republican working the inside game of trying to convince Bush &apos;s political advisors that good policy was important , and more of a nonpartisan steward of America &apos;s long-term fiscal stability . 
Of course , such a Greenspan would never have been re-appointed . 
All in all , Greenspan served the United States and the world well through his stewardship of monetary policy , especially by what he did not do : trying to stop stock and housing speculation by halting the economy in its tracks .
