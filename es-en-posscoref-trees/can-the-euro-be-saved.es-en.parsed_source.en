Can the Euro be Saved ? 
NEW YORK - The Greek financial crisis has put the very survival of the euro at stake . 
At the euro &apos;s creation , many worried about its long-run viability . 
When everything went well , these worries were forgotten . 
But the question of how adjustments would be made if part of the eurozone were hit by a strong adverse shock lingered . 
Fixing the exchange rate and delegating monetary policy to the European Central Bank eliminated two primary means by which national governments stimulate their economies to avoid recession . 
What could replace them ? 
The Nobel laureate Robert Mundell laid out the conditions under which a single currency could work . 
Europe didn &apos;t meet those conditions at the time ; it still doesn &apos;t . 
The removal of legal barriers to the movement of workers created a single labor market , but linguistic and cultural differences make American-style labor mobility unachievable . 
Moreover , Europe has no way of helping those countries facing severe problems . 
Consider Spain , which has an unemployment rate of 20 % - and more than 40 % among young people . 
It had a fiscal surplus before the crisis ; after the crisis , its deficit increased to more than 11 % of GDP . 
But , under European Union rules , Spain must now cut its spending , which will likely exacerbate unemployment . 
As its economy slows , the improvement in its fiscal position may be minimal . 
Some hoped that the Greek tragedy would convince policymakers that the euro cannot succeed without greater cooperation ( including fiscal assistance ) . 
But Germany ( and its Constitutional Court ) , partly following popular opinion , has opposed giving Greece the help that it needs . 
To many , both in and outside of Greece , this stance was peculiar : billions had been spent saving big banks , but evidently saving a country of eleven million people was taboo ! 
It was not even clear that the help Greece needed should be labeled a bailout : while the funds given to financial institutions like AIG were unlikely to be recouped , a loan to Greece at a reasonable interest rate would likely be repaid . 
A series of half-offers and vague promises , intended to calm the market , failed . 
Just as the United States had cobbled together assistance for Mexico 15 years ago by combining help from the International Monetary Fund and the G-7 , so , too , the EU put together an assistance program with the IMF . 
The question was , what conditions would be imposed on Greece ? 
How big would be the adverse impact ? 
For the EU &apos;s smaller countries , the lesson is clear : if they do not reduce their budget deficits , there is a high risk of a speculative attack , with little hope for adequate assistance from their neighbors , at least not without painful and counterproductive pro-cyclical budgetary restraints . 
As European countries take these measures , their economies are likely to weaken - with unhappy consequences for the global recovery . 
It may be useful to see the euro &apos;s problems from a global perspective . 
The US has complained about China &apos;s current-account ( trade ) surpluses ; but , as a percentage of GDP , Germany &apos;s surplus is even greater . 
Assume that the euro was set so that trade in the eurozone as a whole was roughly in balance . 
In that case , Germany &apos;s surplus means that the rest of Europe is in deficit . 
And the fact that these countries are importing more than they are exporting contributes to their weak economies . 
The US has been complaining about China &apos;s refusal to allow its exchange rate to appreciate relative to the dollar . 
But the euro system means that Germany &apos;s exchange rate cannot increase relative to other eurozone members . 
If the exchange rate did increase , Germany would find it more difficult to export , and its economic model , based on strong exports , would face a challenge . 
At the same time , the rest of Europe would export more , GDP would increase , and unemployment would decrease . 
Germany ( like China ) views its high savings and export prowess as virtues , not vices . 
But John Maynard Keynes pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand - countries running surpluses exert a &quot; negative externality &quot; on their trading partners . 
Indeed , Keynes believed that it was surplus countries , far more than deficit countries , that posed a threat to global prosperity ; he went so far as to recommend a tax on surplus countries . 
The social and economic consequences of the current arrangements should be unacceptable . 
Those countries whose deficits have soared as a result of the global recession should not be forced into a death spiral - as Argentina was a decade ago . 
One proposed solution is for these countries to engineer the equivalent of a devaluation - a uniform decrease in wages . 
This , I believe , is unachievable , and its distributive consequences are unacceptable . 
The social tensions would be enormous . 
It is a fantasy . 
There is a second solution : the exit of Germany from the eurozone or the division of the eurozone into two sub-regions . 
The euro was an interesting experiment , but , like the almost-forgotten exchange-rate mechanism ( ERM ) that preceded it and fell apart when speculators attacked the British pound in 1992 , it lacks the institutional support required to make it work . 
There is a third solution , which Europe may come to realize is the most promising for all : implement the institutional reforms , including the necessary fiscal framework , that should have been made when the euro was launched . 
It is not too late for Europe to implement these reforms and thus live up to the ideals , based on solidarity , that underlay the euro &apos;s creation . 
But if Europe cannot do so , then perhaps it is better to admit failure and move on than to extract a high price in unemployment and human suffering in the name of a flawed economic model .
