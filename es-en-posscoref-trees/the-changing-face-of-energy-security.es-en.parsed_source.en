The Changing Face of Energy Security 
For three decades , the rich world has talked about curbing its addiction to imported oil . 
But , despite the anxious rhetoric , the oil-supply problem has become worse and energy security more complex . 
Notwithstanding politicians &quot; repeated calls for energy independence , over the past 30 years the United States , for example , has doubled its dependence on imported oil , which now accounts for nearly two-thirds of its oil needs . 
Threats to cut oil supplies in order to change a country &apos;s foreign policy have a long history , particularly where the Middle East is concerned . 
Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries called for an embargo at the time of the 1967 war , but it had little effect because the US was then largely self sufficient . 
But by the 1973 Yom Kippur war , the Arab oil embargo had a greater effect , owing to America &apos;s growing demand for imported oil . 
The embargo drove up prices and unleashed a period of inflation and stagnation worldwide . 
It also demonstrated that oil is a fungible commodity . 
Even though the embargo was aimed at the US and the Netherlands , market forces shifted oil among consumers , and in the long term all consuming countries suffered shortages of supply and the same price shock . 
Oil embargos turned out to be a blunt instrument that hurt many besides the targeted countries . 
In the aftermath of the oil price shocks , energy security policy has had four components . 
By liberalizing energy prices , governments allowed markets to encourage conservation and new supply . 
In addition , governments introduced modest subsidies and regulations to encourage conservation and renewable energy sources . 
Some governments began to store oil in strategic petroleum reserves that could be used to for short periods in a crisis . 
Rich countries also helped to create the Paris-based International Energy Agency , which coordinates policies ( including strategic reserves ) among consumer countries . 
Such policies still make sense . 
They would probably not be adequate , however , to deal with a prolonged disruption of supplies . 
The world is not running out of oil , but two-thirds of oil reserves are located in the politically unstable Persian Gulf region . 
The US imports only a small portion of its oil from the Persian Gulf . 
Its largest supplier is its stable neighbor , Canada . 
But the lesson of 1973 is that a disruption of Gulf oil supplies would raise prices and damage both rich and poor economies , regardless of how secure their own sources of supply might be . 
Moreover , new dimensions of the problem of energy security have emerged in the last few years . 
One is the great increase in energy demand from the rapidly growing economies of Asia , particularly China . 
China appears to believe that it can secure its energy imports by locking up oil contracts with pariah states like Sudan . 
However , while this short-sighted mercantilist approach creates foreign policy problems over issues like Darfur , it will not really protect China in a time of supply disruption . 
It would be far better to bring China ( and India ) into the IEA , and encourage normal Chinese participation in world markets . 
Another new dimension of the energy security problem is the manner in which high prices and increased reserves have transferred power to energy producing countries . 
State-owned companies now control far more oil and gas reserves than do the traditional private energy companies once known as the seven sisters . 
Many of these state-owned companies in countries like Russia and Venezuela are not responding merely to market forces , but are using their newfound pricing power for political purposes . 
Finally , the energy security problem has been complicated by the problem of global climate change . 
As the science has become increasingly clear , climate change is now a major political issue at the global and national levels . 
Rising sea levels , drought in Africa , and increasingly turbulent storms all pose a new type of threat that must be taken seriously . 
So measures to deal with energy security must address the demand side even more than the supply side . 
Measures that some legislators favor , such as transforming coal into liquids , increase secure supplies , but they imply more carbon dioxide emissions than imported oil does . 
They should be avoided until technologies for clean coal or carbon capture are perfected . 
On the other hand , reducing demand through improved energy efficiency and conservation measures are beneficial for both the security of supplies and the global climate . 
But it is not enough for the US and European Union countries to improve their energy efficiency unless other countries do so as well . 
China and India can pursue security of supply by using their large coal resources , but unless they also have access to improved coal technology , the burdens they impose on the atmosphere will be large . 
This year , China will surpass the US in emissions of greenhouse gases . 
It builds nearly two new coal-fired electricity plants each week . 
In such a world , energy security can no longer be summed up as greater energy independence . 
Instead , we must find better ways to cope with energy interdependence .
