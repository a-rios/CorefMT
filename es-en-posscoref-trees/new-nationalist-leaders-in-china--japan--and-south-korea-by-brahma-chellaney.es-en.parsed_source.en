East Asia &apos;s Turning Point 
NEW DELHI - Political transitions in East Asia promise to mark a defining moment in the region &apos;s jittery geopolitics . 
After the ascension in China of Xi Jinping , regarded by the People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) as its own man , Japan seems set to swing to the right in its impending election - an outcome likely to fuel nationalist passion on both sides of the Sino-Japanese rivalry . 
Japan &apos;s expected rightward turn comes more than three years after voters put the left-leaning Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) in power . 
By contrast , South Korea &apos;s election - scheduled for December 19 , just three days after the Japanese go to the polls - could take that country to the left , after the nearly five-year rule of rightist President Lee Myung-bak , who proved to be a polarizing leader . 
These political transitions could compound East Asia &apos;s challenges , which include the need to institute a regional balance of power and dispense with historical baggage that weighs down interstate relationships , particularly among China , Japan , and South Korea . 
Booming trade in the region has failed to mute or moderate territorial and other disputes ; on the contrary , it has only sharpened regional geopolitics and unleashed high-stakes brinkmanship . 
Economic interdependence cannot deliver regional stability unless rival states undertake genuine efforts to mend their political relations . 
The scandals surrounding the top aides to Lee - nicknamed &quot; the Bulldozer &quot; from his career as a construction industry executive - have complicated matters for the ruling Saenuri Party &apos;s candidate , Park Geun-hye , and buoyed the hopes of her leftist rival , Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party . 
Park is the daughter of former president , General Park Chung-hee , who seized power in a military coup in 1961 . 
Reining in South Korea &apos;s powerful chaebol ( family-run conglomerates ) has become a key issue in the presidential election , with even Park favoring tighter control over them , although it was her father &apos;s regime that helped build them with generous government support . Her populist stance on the chaebol suggests that , if elected , she might similarly pander to nationalist sentiment by taking a tough stance against Japan , especially to play down her father &apos;s service in Japan &apos;s military while Korea was under Japanese colonial rule . 
But , even if Moon becomes president , the new strains in South Korea &apos;s relationship with Japan , owing to the revival of historical issues , may not be easy to mend . 
Earlier this year , Lee , at the last minute , canceled the scheduled signing of the &quot; General Security of Military Information Agreement &quot; with Japan , which would have established military intelligence-sharing between the two countries , both US allies , for the first time . 
Lee also scrapped a bilateral plan to finalize a military-related Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement . 
Weeks later , he provocatively visited the contested islets known as the Dokdo Islands in South Korea ( which controls them ) and the Takeshima Islands in Japan . 
China , meanwhile , has cast a long shadow over the Japanese parliamentary elections . 
In recent months , China has launched a new war of attrition by sending patrol ships frequently to the waters around the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands , which China calls Diaoyu . 
This physical assertiveness followed often-violent anti-Japanese protests in China in September , while a continuing informal boycott of Japanese goods has led to a sharp fall in Japan &apos;s exports to China , raising the risk of another Japanese recession . 
The DPJ &apos;s 2009 election victory had been expected to lead to a noticeable warming of Japan &apos;s ties with China . 
After all , the DPJ came to power on a promise to balance Japan &apos;s dependence on the US with closer ties with the People &apos;s Republic . 
China &apos;s behavior has fueled a nationalist backlash in Japan , helping to turn hawkish , marginal politicians like Shintaro Ishihara into important mainstream figures . 
Japan may be in economic decline , but it is rising politically . 
Indeed , Albert del Rosario , the foreign minister of the Philippines , which was under Japanese occupation during WWII , now strongly supports a re-armed Japan as a counterweight to China . 
But the resurgence of nationalism in Japan is only fanning Chinese nationalism , creating a vicious circle from which the two countries are finding it difficult to escape . 
Shinzo Abe of the Liberal Democratic Party , who is likely to become Japan &apos;s next prime minister , has vowed to take a tougher line on Senkaku and other disputes with China . 
More important , the LDP has called for revising Article 9 of Japan &apos;s US-imposed post-1945 constitution , which renounces war . 
The risks posed by increasing nationalism and militarism to regional peace have already been highlighted by the rise of a new Chinese dynasty of &quot; princelings , &quot; or sons of revolutionary heroes who have widespread contacts in the military . 
The real winner from the recent appointment of the conservative-dominated , seven-member Politburo Standing Committee is the PLA , whose rising clout has underpinned China &apos;s increasingly assertive foreign policy . 
In fact , what distinguishes Xi from China &apos;s other civilian leaders is his strong relationship with the PLA . 
As Xi rose through the Communist Party ranks , he forged close military ties as a reservist , assuming leadership of a provincial garrison and serving as a key aide to a defense minister . 
His wife , Peng Liyuan , is also linked to the military , having served as a civilian member of the army &apos;s musical troupe , and carries an honorary rank of general . 
Against this background , the central challenge for East Asia &apos;s major economies - particularly Japan and South Korea - is to resolve the historical issues that are preventing them from charting a more stable and prosperous future . 
As a Russian proverb warns , &quot; Forget the past and lose an eye ; dwell on the past and lose both eyes . &quot;
