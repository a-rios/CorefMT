The Europe of the Future 
PARIS - Whenever people seek a justification for European integration , they are always tempted to look backwards . 
They stress that European integration banished the specter of war from the old continent . 
And European integration has , indeed , delivered the longest period of peace and prosperity that Europe has known for many centuries . 
But this perspective , while entirely correct , is also incomplete . 
There are as many reasons to strive towards &quot; ever closer union &quot; in Europe today as there were back in 1945 , and they are entirely forward-looking . 
Sixty-five years ago , the distribution of global GDP was such that Europe had only one role model for its single market : the United States . 
Today , however , Europe is faced with a new global economy , reconfigured by globalization and by the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America . 
It is a world where economies of scale and networks of innovation matter more than ever . 
By 2016 - that is , very soon - we can expect eurozone GDP in terms of purchasing power parity to be below that of China . 
Together , the economies of China and India could be around twice the size of the eurozone economy . 
Over a longer time horizon , the entire GDP of the G-7 countries will be dwarfed by the major emerging economies &quot; rapid growth . 
So Europe must cope with a new geopolitical landscape that is being profoundly reshaped by these emerging economies . 
In this new global constellation , European integration - both economic and political - is central to achieving ongoing prosperity and influence . 
Like individuals in a society , eurozone countries are both independent and interdependent . 
They can affect each other both positively and negatively . 
Good governance requires that both individual member states and EU institutions fulfill their responsibilities . 
First and foremost , every eurozone country needs to keep its own house in order . 
This means responsible economic policies on the part of governments , as well as rigorous mutual surveillance of those policies - not just fiscal policies , but also measures affecting all aspects of the economy - by the Commission and member states . 
In a society , law-enforcement institutions can ultimately compel a citizen to abide by the rules . 
In the eurozone , a framework based on surveillance and sanctions has , until the most recent decisions , depended on offending states &quot; willingness to comply . 
But what can be done if a member state cannot deliver on its promises ? 
For countries that lose market access , the approach of providing aid on the basis of strong conditionality is justified . 
Countries deserve an opportunity to correct the situation themselves and to restore stability . 
This approach nonetheless has clearly defined limits . 
So a second stage is now envisaged for countries that persistently fail to meet their policy targets . 
During this second stage , eurozone authorities would play a much deeper and more authoritative role in the formulation of countries &quot; budgetary policies . 
This moves us away from the current framework , which leaves all decisions in the hands of the country concerned . 
Instead , it would be not only possible , but in some cases compulsory , for the European authorities to take direct decisions . 
Implementing this idea also implies embracing a new concept of sovereignty , given the complex interdependence that exists between eurozone countries . 
But it is ultimately in the interests of all eurozone citizens that these changes be made . 
It is my firm conviction that the Europe of the future will embody a new type of institutional framework . 
What might it look like ? 
Would it be too bold to envisage there being an EU finance ministry one day ? 
Any future European finance ministry would oversee the surveillance of both fiscal policies and competitiveness policies , and , when necessary , impose the &quot; second stage . &quot; 
Moreover , it would carry out the usual executive responsibilities regarding supervision and regulation of the EU financial sector . 
Finally , the ministry would represent the eurozone in international financial institutions . 
Recent events have only strengthened the case for pursuing this approach . 
Europe &apos;s leaders are discussing a Treaty change to create stronger economic governance at the EU level , and eurozone citizens are themselves calling for better supervision of the financial sector . 
And I know that our partners in the G-20 look to Europe as a whole , rather than to individual member states , for solutions . 
So , increasingly , it seems that it would be too bold not to consider creating a European finance ministry at some point in the future . 
But an EU finance ministry would be only one component of Europe &apos;s future institutional framework . 
One can imagine that , as various elements of sovereignty come to be shared , the European Council might evolve into the EU Senate , with the European Parliament becoming the lower house . 
Similarly , the European Commission could become the executive , while the European Court of Justice takes on the role of an EU judiciary . 
And , given European countries &quot; long and proud history , I have no doubt that &quot; subsidiarity &quot; will play a major role in the future Europe - significantly greater than in current models of federation . 
Mine are the personal views of a European citizen . 
The future of Europe is in the hands of its democracies , in the hands of Europe &apos;s people . 
Our fellow citizens will decide the direction Europe is to take . 
They are the masters . 
But , however Europe &apos;s institutions take shape , a truly pan-European public debate is essential . 
As Europeans , we identify deeply with our nations , traditions , and histories . 
These are Europe &apos;s roots . 
But we also need to extend our branches more widely . 
So , today , we should not look back . 
We must look forward - to opportunities of collective betterment , and to every country &apos;s potential to be stronger and more prosperous in a well-functioning union .
