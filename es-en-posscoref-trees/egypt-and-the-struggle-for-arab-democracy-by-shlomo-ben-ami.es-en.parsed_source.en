The Arab Wars of Religion 
MADRID - Throughout the Arab world , a struggle between two major historical forces , religion and secularism , is now unfolding . 
It is the type of battle between Caesar and God that took Europe centuries to resolve . 
The future of the Arab Middle East will be decided in the fight between Syria &apos;s Sunni insurgents , supported throughout the region by the Saudi Wahhabis - the patrons of religious fundamentalism - and its secular Baath regime ; between the fundamentalist Hamas and the secular PLO in Palestine ; and between Egypt &apos;s young secular opposition , forged in the protests of Tahrir Square , and the Muslim Brotherhood and radical Salafists . 
So far , the Arab revolts have vindicated the assumption that , given the structure of most Arab societies , toppling secular autocracies inevitably means opening the door to Islamic democracies . 
We saw that dynamic play out in Algeria in the early 1990 &quot; s , with the Islamic Salvation Front &apos;s first-round victory in a parliamentary election ( which prompted the cancellation of the second round ) ; with Hamas &apos;s electoral victory in Palestine in 2006 ; and , most recently , with the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s democratic rise to power in Egypt . 
In both Algeria and Egypt , secular forces were incapable of stemming political Islam &apos;s rise , which could be cut short only by a military takeover . 
The Algerian military coup eventually ushered in a bloody civil war that is estimated to have taken more than 200,000 lives . 
The consequences of the Egyptian coup have still to unfold . 
The secular opposition &apos;s accession to power on the back of a tank might feed the Islamists &quot; rage for years to come . 
The Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s loss of trust in the democratic process would be bad news for Egypt and a boost to Al Qaeda and other jihadists who believe that power can be obtained only through blood and terror . 
The concept of separation of church and state is alien to Islam - former Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini once famously declared that &quot; Islam is politics or it is nothing &quot; - and Islamists have still to prove that they are amenable to democratic governance . 
Indeed , Mohamed Morsi , Egypt &apos;s deposed president , has only himself to blame for his political demise . 
His sectarian , authoritarian behavior polarized his country to such a degree that even the army &apos;s chief , General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi , known for his Islamist sympathies , withdrew his support from the man who had appointed him . 
Likewise , the revival of the Shia-Sunni civil war in Iraq largely reflects the sectarian rule of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki . 
Nor has Hamas &apos;s rise to power in Gaza ushered in inclusive , democratic governance . 
After having failed to reverse Hamas &apos;s electoral victory by military means , the PLO agreed with its Islamist rivals on a plan for national reconciliation ; but this pact remains a dead letter . 
As for Syria , the revolt against one of the most secular autocracies in the Arab world has degenerated into a fight to the death between Sunnis and Shia that is spilling over to other countries in the region . 
A Sunni jihad has now been launched against the Baath regime and its Shia allies , Iran and Hezbollah . 
Neighboring Lebanon , with its fierce Sunni-Shia divide , is already being directly affected . 
The struggle between religion and state in the Maghreb is less violent , but potentially explosive nonetheless . 
Tunisia , where the Arab Spring began , is now caught between secularists and religious fundamentalists . 
The Islamist Ennahda party leads the government , but it faces a serious challenge from the ultra-conservative Salafists of Hizb Ut-Tahrir . 
In Morocco , King Mohammed VI did not conceal his support for the Egyptian coup , but the Islamist Justice and Development Party , which leads his government , denounced it . 
Indeed , Istiqlal , a secular center-right party , left the government in the wake of the Egyptian coup , accusing the JDP , under Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane , of trying to &quot; Egyptianize &quot; Morocco by monopolizing power , as Morsi did in Egypt . 
Even in Turkey , a non-Arab Muslim country with strong aspirations to reconcile Islam with democracy , the agreement between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s Islamist government and the urban middle class to limit official encroachment on secular lifestyles is unraveling . 
Erdoğan now promises to &quot; reconstruct Turkey &quot; in his own authoritarian and religious image . 
The Arabs &quot; march to freedom is bound to be a long and tortuous process - perhaps the main geopolitical test of the twenty-first century . 
Yet the battle between secularism and religion in the Arab world does not have to last centuries , as it did in Europe , if only because contemporary generations can benefit from the long process of social and scientific progress that enabled the West to pave the way to modern democracy . 
One hopes that Egypt &apos;s defeated Islamists will move from the politics of vengeance to a soul-searching process that leads to the recognition that democracy is not a zero-sum game in which the winner takes all . 
The Leninist &quot; democratic centralism &quot; to which Morsi seemed to have subscribed , if maintained , will be a standing provocation to the new generations and their allies in the old state apparatus to rise up , even at the price of civil war .
