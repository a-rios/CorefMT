Creeping China 
NEW DELHI - China &apos;s growing geopolitical heft is emboldening its territorial creep in Asia . 
After laying claim to 80 % of the South China Sea , it has just established a so-called air defense identification zone in the East China Sea , raising the odds of armed conflict with Japan and threatening the principle of freedom of navigation of the seas and skies . 
Meanwhile , the People &apos;s Republic continues to nibble furtively at territory across the long , disputed Himalayan border with India . 
Few seem to fathom the logic behind China &apos;s readiness to take on several neighbors simultaneously . 
China is seeking to alter the status quo gradually as part of a high-stakes effort to extend its control to strategic areas and resources . 
President Xi Jinping &apos;s promise of national greatness - embodied in the catchphrase &quot; China dream &quot; - is tied as much to achieving regional hegemony as to internal progress . 
China &apos;s approach reflects what the Chinese general Zhang Zhaozhong this year called a &quot; cabbage &quot; strategy : assert a territorial claim and gradually surround the area with multiple layers of security , thus denying access to a rival . 
The strategy relies on a steady progression of steps to outwit opponents and create new facts on the ground . 
This approach severely limits rival states &quot; options by confounding their deterrence plans and making it difficult for them to devise proportionate or effective counter-measures . 
This is partly because the strategy - while bearing all the hallmarks of modern Chinese brinkmanship , including reliance on stealth , surprise , and a disregard for the risks of military escalation - seeks to ensure that the initiative remains with China . 
The pattern has become familiar : construct a dispute , initiate a jurisdictional claim through periodic incursions , and then increase the frequency and duration of such intrusions , thereby establishing a military presence or pressuring a rival to cut a deal on China &apos;s terms . 
What is ours is ours , the Chinese invariably claim , and what is yours is negotiable . 
For example , China says &quot; no foundation for dialogue &quot; with Japan exists unless the Japanese accept the existence of a territorial dispute over the uninhabited Senkaku Islands . 
Here , as elsewhere , China has painted its rival as the obstructionist party . 
As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi put it , &quot; Japan needs to recognize that there is such a dispute . 
The whole world knows that there is a dispute . &quot; 
But there is a dispute only because China has succeeded in shaking the status quo in recent years by popularizing the islands &quot; Chinese name ( &quot; Diaoyu &quot; ) and staging incursions into their territorial waters and airspace . 
After steadily increasing the frequency of those incursions since September 2012 , China has recently begun increasing their duration . 
The establishment of a new air defense identification zone extending over the islands is its latest cabbage-style security &quot; layer &quot; - a unilateral power grab that US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel quickly branded &quot; a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region . &quot; 
The zone even covers the sky over the Leodo ( Suyan ) Reef , a submerged rock that both South Korea and China claim . 
As China escalates its campaign of attrition against a resolute Japan , it increases the risk of armed conflict , whether by accident or miscalculation . 
China &apos;s strategy has had more success - without provoking serious risks - against the weaker Philippines . 
This is apparent from China &apos;s effective seizure last year of Scarborough Shoal , located well within the Philippines &quot; exclusive economic zone , and the controlling presence of Chinese vessels this year around the Second Thomas Shoal , part of the disputed Spratly Islands . 
China has not yet tried to evict the eight Filipino marines still living on the Second Thomas Shoal , but Zhang has included this shoal in the country &apos;s &quot; series of achievements &quot; in the South China Sea . 
China is not aiming for control of just a few shoals or other tiny outcroppings ; it seeks to dominate the South and East China Seas strategically and corner maritime resources , including seabed minerals . 
The combined land area of the Senkaku and Spratly Islands amounts to barely 11 square kilometers ; but the islands are surrounded by rich hydrocarbon reserves . 
While seeking to enlarge incrementally its military footprint in the more than 80 % of the South China Sea that it claims , China &apos;s aim in the East China Sea is to break out of the so-called &quot; first island chain , &quot; a string of archipelagos along the East Asian coast that includes the Senkaku Islands and Taiwan . 
By contrast , vast tracts of disputed land are at stake in the resource-rich Himalayan region . 
Here , too , China &apos;s incursions , after increasing in frequency , are now being staged intermittently for longer periods . 
Make no mistake : China &apos;s territorial creep is contributing to Asian insecurity , fueling political tension , and turning the world &apos;s economically most vibrant continent into a potentially global hot spot . 
To be sure , China is careful to avoid any dramatic action that could become a casus belli by itself . 
Indeed , it has repeatedly shown a knack for disaggregating its strategy into multiple parts and then pursuing each element separately in such a manner as to allow the different pieces to fall into place with minimal resistance . 
This shrewdness not only keeps opponents off balance ; it also undercuts the relevance of US security assurances to allies and the value of building countervailing strategic partnerships in Asia . 
In fact , by camouflaging offense as defense , China casts the burden of starting a war on an opponent , while it seeks to lay the foundation - brick by brick - of a hegemonic Middle Kingdom . 
Chinese leaders &quot; stated desire to resolve territorial disputes peacefully simply means achieving a position strong enough to get their way without having to fire a shot .
