High Tensions In the Low Countries 
Belgium and the Netherlands , two founding members of the European Union , are increasingly divided about what that project now means . 
The EU &apos;s Reform Treaty is now the focus of that dispute , but its roots go deeper . 
At one point , according to press reports , the row became so serious that French President Nicolas Sarkozy had to intervene . 
Europe cannot afford a dogfight between these two founding member states , so it &apos;s high time to put emotions aside and review their differences on the future course of European integration . 
As a former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and Benelux Coordinator , I believe that the Netherlands and Belgium can once again play complementary roles . 
From the very beginning , these countries have represented the different aspects of Europe &apos;s identity : Belgium , as an industrial country , continentally oriented , bilingual , and an intermediary with southern Europe , and the Netherlands with its strong agricultural and trading tradition and its Anglo-Saxon and Atlantic orientation . 
Of the two , Belgium tends to be more uncritically supportive of the EU . 
Polls show that more than 80 % of Belgians want yet more integration , whereas roughly 50 % of the Dutch describing themselves as Euroskeptics . 
They value the Union for its economic benefits , but are wary of its politics . 
Belgian-Dutch cooperation has in years past been essential in helping Europe to move forward . 
The Benelux Economic Union treaty of 1944 was an early testing ground for the Europe of the Six , and it was the joint Benelux Memorandum , fathered by the far-sighted J. W. Beyen and presented in Messina in 1955 , that gave the impetus to the creation of the common market . 
Indeed , it was the basis on which Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak and his colleagues worked when setting the scene for the Treaty of Rome and the European Economic Community . 
The Spaak committee devised a system that balanced the voting power of states of varying size . 
Clearly , a system of one vote per member state would have meant domination by Europe &apos;s smaller states . 
Conversely , a system based on population would have gone too far in favoring the big ones . 
Balance was achieved partly by a system of weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers , where most decisions are taken . 
With each enlargement of the Union , this system of decision-making has been largely maintained . 
The equilibrium in voting rights between small and large member states was also secured by vesting exclusive authority to propose regulation in the Commission , which expresses the common interests of the Community . 
This authority was reinforced by requiring unanimity among member states to overrule the Commission - a provision that has strengthened the smaller states against the larger ones . 
As open economies , Belgium and the Netherlands have both been interested in developing the internal market , while differing in their methods . 
Belgium followed the mainly French monetarist school , while the Netherlands shared Germany &apos;s preference for economic convergence before committing to exchange-rate parity . 
Once President Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing and Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt made the joint Franco German proposal for the Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , both Belgium and the Netherlands worked together to achieve that common goal . 
Along with Luxembourg , they were an important factor in creating EMU . 
In 1991 , when the Netherlands held the European presidency , Belgium supported its far-reaching draft for a treaty of European Union . 
The Dutch proposed bringing all European decision-making − economic , foreign policy , justice , and home affairs − into a single framework . 
The proposal turned out to be a step too far and subsequently went down in Dutch history as &quot; black Monday , &quot; named after the day on which the then foreign minister , Hans Van den Broek , faced near-unanimous opposition in the European Council of Ministers . 
Belgium , though , was the one member state that supported the Dutch in this brave venture . 
But the Belgians and Dutch have also been less than cooperative at times . 
When it came to voting rights in the European Parliament and in the Council , the Dutch fought doggedly to get one extra vote in Amsterdam in 1991 and another in Nice in 2000 . 
This may have satisfied nationalist feelings in the Netherlands , as the country is 1.5 times the size of Belgium , but it did not go down well in Belgium . 
The two countries also found themselves in opposing camps over the war in Iraq , and , of course , in their attitudes about further political integration . 
The Netherlands &quot; current reserved stance on further political integration is not in its broader interest . 
But Belgium could have shown greater understanding for the Netherlands &quot; position after Dutch voters decisively rejected the proposed European constitution in the mid-2005 referendum . 
Belgium and the Netherlands need to resuscitate their cooperative efforts within the Benelux framework . 
The Benelux economy is the EU &apos;s fourth largest . 
Belgium will be serving on the United Nations Security Council for the next two years , and has indicated that it wants to give its mandate a European dimension . 
The coming period could thus be used in both countries to review traditional positions and reflect on how European policy can best serve their common needs . 
Traditionally , the Netherlands has thought of itself as the smallest of the EU &apos;s large member states . 
But others generally see it as the largest of the small . 
Accepting this view could have a healthy impact on its behavior in the EU . 
After all , the three largest EU states - Germany , Britain , and France - can be expected to seek agreements among themselves about the Union &apos;s future shape , so the Benelux countries &quot; common goal should be to influence their actions and ensure that their thinking is acceptable to the whole community .
