Slouching Toward Gaza 
With barrages of Kassam rockets being launched daily on Israeli towns from the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip and Israeli politicians competing over who would offer the harshest response , the question for Israel today has been reduced to whether or not to invade . 
But neither side is free of contradictions , and both are trapped in a seemingly insoluble conundrum . 
As a government , Hamas is to be judged by its capacity to provide security and decent governance to Gaza &apos;s population , but as a movement it is incapable of betraying its unyielding commitment to fight the Israeli occupier to the death . 
After all , Hamas was not elected to make peace with Israel or to improve relations with the United States . 
However encouraging some sporadic signs of a shift toward political realism might be , it is not on Hamas &apos;s immediate agenda to betray its very raison d &quot; Ãªtre by endorsing the US-led Annapolis peace process . 
Hamas &apos;s offensive is not an attempt to draw Israel into a costly invasion that might shake its regime . 
Rather , it is a move aimed at establishing a balance of threat based on sustaining a low-intensity conflict even if a new lull is agreed upon . 
A now increasingly arrogant and extremely well armed Hamas expects such a lull to be agreed upon only in exchange for new concessions from both Israel and Egypt . 
These include the opening of Gaza &apos;s borders , including the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing , the release of Hamas detainees in Egypt , the suspension of Israeli operations against Hamas activists in the West Bank , and the right to respond to any perceived Israeli violation of the ceasefire . 
But Hamas &apos;s brinkmanship is a dangerous exercise , for a low-intensity conflict can easily degenerate into an all-out flare-up if its rockets cause a politically unbearable number of casualties on the Israeli side . 
In fact , Israel &apos;s top leaders have already approved the army &apos;s plans for an invasion of Gaza , with the timing and the nature of the casus belli left open . 
Hamas is playing with fire on the Egyptian front , too , having haughtily interrupted the Egyptian-led reconciliation process with Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s PLO and pledging to derail the Egyptian and Saudi initiative to extend Abbas &apos;s presidential term until 2010 . 
Hamas has made clear its intention to appoint as president the Palestinian parliament speaker - a Hamas member now in an Israeli prison - once Abbas &apos;s presidency officially ends on January 9 . 
Hamas radicalism is not devoid of a political purpose - to bury whatever remains of the two-state solution . 
The meager results of the Oslo peace process are regarded by Hamas as vindication of its consistent view that the Oslo accords were doomed to failure , and that Israel and America never intended to respect the minimal requirements of Palestinian nationalism . 
But , while Hamas has never been indifferent to daily political calculations , nor is it confined to them . 
A fundamentally religious movement for whom the future belongs to Islam , Hamas sees itself as being engaged in a long-term armed struggle for the liberation of all of Palestine . 
Nor is the movement &apos;s brinkmanship entirely irrational , for the legacy of Israel &apos;s 2006 abortive attempt to destroy Hezbollah is that , for the first time in the country &apos;s history , the military establishment is advocating restraint and actively curbing the more hawkish measures being proposed in cabinet meetings . 
Israel &apos;s reluctance to invade Gaza stems from a sober analysis of the meaning of such a move . 
Indeed , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , the Labor Party leader , might be ready to pay a high political price during an electoral season by accepting even a new lull that is intermittently violated by Hamas . 
The invasion of such a small and densely populated strip of land where civilians have been systematically used by Hamas as human shields is bound to expose Israel &apos;s military to accusations of war crimes . 
However justified Israel &apos;s action might be , and however critical of Hamas &apos;s repressive regime the international community might be , it will not take long before the wide media coverage of civilian casualties will put Israel , not Hamas , in the dock of world opinion . 
Moreover , reoccupation of Gaza would force Israel to reassume full and exclusive responsibility for the 1.5 million Palestinians now under Hamas control . 
But , even if Israel is ready to pay the price of harsh international condemnation , it is not clear success in such a war really means . 
Is toppling the Hamas regime a realistic option ? 
Ismail Haniyeh &apos;s government might collapse , but Hamas would remain a powerful indigenous Palestinian organization around which the population would certainly rally . 
And , even under renewed occupation , with Israeli armored divisions are deployed throughout the strip , Kassam missiles might still be launched - the ultimate humiliation for the occupier . 
And , finally , after a mortal blow had been dealt to whatever remains of the peace process , and cemeteries in Israel and in devastated Gaza are again filled with new casualties , Israel would want to withdraw , and negotiate yet another ceasefire with ... the same Hamas .
