Post-Soviet Free Trade 
Ever since the Soviet Union collapsed , the independent states that emerged from the wreckage have tried to sort out their trade relations . 
But the flow of goods between countries continues to contract even more than it should . 
What is needed is free trade . 
The twelve members of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) concluded an Agreement on a Free Trade Zone in 1994 , but it does not work . 
Whenever one member is successful in exporting to another , the importing member soon imposes quotas or prohibitive tariffs , impeding economic development . 
The simple solution is a mechanism for conflict resolution . 
The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) has a well-functioning arbitration court with accepted penalties that could be utilized , but only four CIS countries ( Kyrgyzstan , Georgia , Moldova , and Armenia ) have joined the WTO . 
The largest CIS economies-Russia , Ukraine , and Kazakhstan-should hurry up and join as well . 
Alas , instead of adapting tried and tested mechanisms , various CIS countries invent ever more complex schemes , such as the five-state Customs Union , which was renamed the Eurasian Economic Community last year , when its failure became evident . 
The latest invention is the recent declaration by the Presidents of Russia , Belarus , Kazakhstan , and Ukraine to start negotiations on forming a &quot; Unified Economic Space . &quot; 
Three ideas are contained in this nebulous term : a customs union , coordination of accession to the WTO , and a currency union . 
None of these will benefit any participant . 
A CIS customs union failed already , and will fail again in the future . 
It delivered no freer trade than the CIS free-trade zone . 
No participant harmonized its customs with anybody else . 
Russia refuses truly to accept the sovereignty of the other CIS states , and instead wants only to impose its own customs policy , which the others do not accept . 
Now the four presidents propose an independent supranational commission for trade and tariffs in order to forge a common customs policy . 
But there is no reason to believe that this will work any better . 
Simply put , these countries have different foreign-trade interests . 
A country that does not produce a product has no interest in its protection , while countries that do have protectionist interests . 
For instance , Russia &apos;s automotive and aviation industries insist on high import tariffs , while Kazakhstan produces neither cars nor airplanes . 
Russia &apos;s high import tariffs on cars would impose an unjustified consumer tax on Kazakhs . 
Coordination in accession to the WTO sounds good , but would actually delay membership by several years at a time when speed is vital . 
It is much more difficult for Russia , with its large and complex trade , to enter the WTO than it is for Ukraine and Kazakhstan . 
Russia must conclude bilateral protocols with no less than 67 countries , compared with 22 for Ukraine . 
Any coordination through a customs union would reopen concluded negotiations . 
Indeed , Russia has demanded that Ukraine revoke the 11 bilateral protocols for WTO accession that it already signed . 
Meanwhile , until Russia , Ukraine , and Kazakhstan accede to the WTO , the trade situation within the CIS will not improve . 
If they would stop &quot; cooperating &quot; and start competing to be the first to enter the WTO , all three countries could be members within a year . 
The worst idea is the currency union . 
All twelve CIS countries had a currency union in 1992 and 1993 . 
It was an unmitigated disaster that ended in hyperinflation . 
The fundamental problem was that each country had a central bank that issued ruble credits , because no country was prepared to accept central-effectively Russian-control over its monetary policy . 
Why repeat that catastrophe ? 
None of the political preconditions has changed . 
No CIS country would accept a Russian monopoly on the emission of a common currency , and without a central monopoly on the emission of money , a currency union cannot work . 
Even if a currency union could work technically , it makes little economic sense , for several reasons : 
First , a currency should be tied only to a currency with a substantial record of stability , whereas the CIS has seen the world &apos;s greatest currency instability in the last decade ; 
Second , a currency should be pegged only to a currency that is dominant in its foreign trade . 
Russia accounts for just about a quarter of Ukraine &apos;s foreign-trade turnover ; 
Third , a currency union should be undertaken with a large , differentiated economy with substantial financial depth . 
But these economies are small , and most are not highly diversified ; 
Fourth , the members of a currency union should have similar economic structures or at least have business cycles that move in parallel . 
Given Russia &apos;s dependence on exports of oil and natural gas , and Ukraine &apos;s status as a major energy importer , the two countries &apos; business cycles are likely to diverge rather than overlap . 
Whereas Russia would require devaluation when oil prices fall , Ukraine could consider revaluation . 
In short , none of the ordinary prerequisites for a currency union is in place , and the only rationale appears to be Soviet imperial nostalgia . 
For the last three years , Russia , Kazakhstan , and Ukraine have been economically successful , with Russia and Ukraine boosting average annual economic growth rates of 6 % and Kazakhstan around 11 % . 
Sound market-based thinking has driven their domestic economic policies . 
None of them can afford to fool around with economic nonsense in their trade policy .
