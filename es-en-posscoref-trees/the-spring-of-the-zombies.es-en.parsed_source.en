The Spring of the Zombies 
New York - As spring comes to America , optimists are seeing &quot; green sprouts &quot; of recovery from the financial crisis and recession . 
The world is far different from what it was last spring , when the Bush administration was once again claiming to see &quot; light at the end of the tunnel . &quot; 
The metaphors and the administrations have changed , but not , it seems , the optimism . 
The good news is that we may be at the end of a free fall . 
The bottom may be near - perhaps by the end of the year . 
But that does not mean that the global economy is set for a robust recovery any time soon . 
Hitting bottom is no reason to abandon the strong measures that have been taken to revive the global economy . 
This downturn is complex : an economic crisis combined with a financial crisis . 
Before its onset , America &apos;s debt-ridden consumers were the engine of global growth . 
That model has broken down , and will not be replaced soon . 
The collapse of credit made matters worse ; and firms , facing high borrowing costs and declining markets , responded quickly , cutting back inventories . 
Orders dropped abruptly - well out of proportion to the decline in GDP - and those countries that depended on investment goods and durables ( expenditures that could be postponed ) were particularly hard hit . 
We are likely to see a recovery in some of these areas from the bottoms reached at the end of 2008 and the beginning of this year . 
But examine the fundamentals : in America , real estate prices continue to fall , millions of homes are underwater , with the value of mortgages exceeding the market price , and unemployment is increasing , with hundreds of thousands reaching the end of their 39 weeks of unemployment insurance . 
States are being forced to lay off workers as tax revenues plummet . 
The banking system has just been tested to see if it is adequately capitalized - a &quot; stress &quot; test that involved no stress - and some couldn &apos;t pass muster . 
But , rather than welcoming the opportunity to recapitalize , perhaps with government help , the banks seem to prefer a Japanese-style response : we will muddle through . 
&quot; Zombie &quot; banks - dead but still walking among the living - are , in Ed Kane &apos;s immortal words , &quot; gambling on resurrection . &quot; 
Repeating the Savings ampamp ; 
Worse still , they are being allowed to borrow cheaply from the United States Federal Reserve , on the basis of poor collateral , and simultaneously to take risky positions . 
Some of the banks did report earnings in the first quarter of this year , mostly based on accounting legerdemain and trading profits ( read : speculation ) . 
And , if the bets don &apos;t pay off , the cost to the American taxpayer will be even larger . 
The American government , too , is betting on muddling through : the Fed &apos;s measures and government guarantees mean that banks have access to low-cost funds , and lending rates are high . 
If nothing nasty happens - losses on mortgages , commercial real estate , business loans , and credit cards - the banks might just be able to make it through without another crisis . 
In a few years time , the banks will be recapitalized , and the economy will return to normal . 
This is the rosy scenario . 
But experiences around the world suggest that this is a risky outlook . 
Even were banks healthy , the deleveraging process and the associated loss of wealth means that , more likely than not , the economy will be weak . 
And a weak economy means , more likely than not , more bank losses . 
The problems are not limited to the US . 
Other countries ( like Spain ) have their own real estate crises . 
Eastern Europe has its problems , which are likely to impact Western Europe &apos;s highly leveraged banks . 
In a globalized world , problems in one part of the system quickly reverberate elsewhere . 
In earlier crises , as in East Asia a decade ago , recovery was quick , because the affected countries could export their way to renewed prosperity . 
But this is a synchronous global downturn . 
America and Europe can &apos;t export their way out of their doldrums . 
Fixing the financial system is necessary , but not sufficient , for recovery . 
America &apos;s strategy for fixing its financial system is costly and unfair , for it is rewarding the people who caused the economic mess . 
But there is an alternative that essentially means playing by the rules of a normal market economy : a debt-for-equity swap . 
With such a swap , confidence could be restored to the banking system , and lending could be reignited with little or no cost to the taxpayer . 
It &apos;s neither particularly complicated nor novel . 
Bondholders obviously don &apos;t like it - they would rather get a gift from the government . 
Every downturn comes to an end . 
The question is how long and deep this downturn will be . 
In spite of some spring sprouts , we should prepare for another dark winter : it &apos;s time for Plan B in bank restructuring and another dose of Keynesian medicine .
