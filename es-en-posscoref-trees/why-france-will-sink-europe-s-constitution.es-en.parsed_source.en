Why France Will Sink Europe &apos;s Constitution 
If public opinion polls are to be believed , on May 29 the French will reject the European Union &apos;s draft constitutional treaty . 
Because all EU member countries must ratify the constitution , a French &quot; Non &quot; will , in effect , kill it . 
Amazing as this turn of events seems , it has been long in the making . 
It is amazing because France is not just a founding member of the European Community , but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward &quot; ever closer union . &quot; 
But French opposition was also predictable because , for over a decade now , France has veered away from Europe and now finds itself increasingly isolated . 
Of course , Europe has also moved away from France through successive enlargements , but the main roots of the estrangement lie in France itself . 
The French regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige - not only in world politics , but also in culture , science and , importantly , language . 
Europe , in their view , was always a way of reclaiming world influence . 
For three decades , this worked . 
France and Germany had forged an alliance that called the shots in Europe . 
Not interested in geopolitical power - a legacy of its Nazi past - Germany was content to back France &apos;s ambitions as long as the Common Market allowed it to be Europe &apos;s economic powerhouse . 
But that alliance is unraveling as Germany &apos;s own status declines , owing to its mediocre economic performance and the loss of its prestigious Deutschemark . 
Moreover , Germany is increasingly interested in exercising political influence on its own ; as a result , it is no longer happy with what it gets from the alliance with France . 
At the same time , successive EU enlargements over the decades have brought in other powerful contenders , chiefly Spain and the UK , as well as smaller countries who are unwilling to bow before French-German leadership . 
In short , France has lost control of Europe . 
This is not new , but it has only recently started to sink in , and it hurts . 
France is also economically wounded . 
Here is a country that has long cherished its &quot; exception &quot; from the normal rules of market economics , a foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets and claims to offer a well-balanced middle ground . 
The French do not care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a &quot; third way , &quot; for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets in order to defend &quot; higher &quot; values from the single-minded pursuit of materialism . 
This view , propagated since World War II by a quasi-Marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the French do not even bother to understand how markets operate . 
They look upon economics as an ideological battleground , where all views can be entertained without being confronted with logic , much less with facts . 
Yet facts have been hitting hard . 
Growth has been lackluster for a quarter of a century and unemployment remains stubbornly high . 
Urban crime , once described as the wages of unfettered individualism , now resembles what is found in the United States , the French model &apos;s bÃªte noire . 
What has this to do with Europe ? 
The EU , by design , increases economic competition , but France is ill equipped . 
One after the other , most European countries have reformed their economies , shedding the cozy arrangements that used to protect every interest group from the pressure of competition . 
Even Germany , after even worse performance than France , has now taken decisive steps . 
Unable to reform their labor markets because of the fear of street protests , French governments of all political stripes seek to protect their ailing firms , only to face limits imposed by the rules of the Common Market . 
The bloated French public sector , which many see as the employer of last resort , cannot afford its expensive personnel . 
While many private French firms are thriving , they do so by economizing on manpower and , increasingly , by outsourcing production , often to new EU member countries where labor costs are considerably lower . 
Public education is in shambles and France &apos;s higher education system now faces competition from other European countries . 
Humbled by economic malaise and loss of influence , the French are scared . 
They fear the future , because the future means either market-oriented reforms or further economic and political downgrading , both of which are seen as unacceptable , if only because they clash with French self-esteem . 
The European Constitution has little to do with any of these challenges , but a majority of French people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked France &apos;s diminishing status . 
They are alarmed by what they see as the domination of Anglo-Saxon economic principles - the last nail in the coffin of France &apos;s mythical &quot; exception . &quot; 
So the EU is now seen as the Trojan horse that threatens the myriad of state-sanctioned benefits and handouts that every citizen enjoys . 
Of course , most French people would ultimately benefit from doing away with this inefficient web of big and small privileges , but most voters , depressed by poor economic prospects and unnerved by high unemployment , are simply unwilling to take the risk . 
They do not understand the roots of their economic troubles and are nostalgic for better times . 
They mistakenly see the European Constitution as one more challenge , at a time when they want to be nursed and protected . 
Scared people rarely make wise choices .
