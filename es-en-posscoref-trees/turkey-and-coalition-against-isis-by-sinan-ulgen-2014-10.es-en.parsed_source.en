Turkey &apos;s ISIS Crisis 
ISTANBUL - Following the recent safe return of 46 Turkish hostages held by the Islamic State , hopes were raised in the United States that Turkey would finally commit to joining the US-led coalition now fighting the group . 
But Turkey &apos;s willingness to contribute to the coalition remains constrained by the legacy of its ill-fated Syria policy , as well as by a fundamental strategic disconnect between President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan &apos;s government and US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration . 
Since Syria &apos;s civil war began three years ago , Turkey has provided logistical and financial support to virtually all elements of the Syrian opposition , while allowing them to use Turkish territory to regroup after launching military operations across the border . 
Committed to regime change in Syria , Turkey turned a blind eye to some of these groups &quot; brutal tactics , radical ideologies , and big ambitions . 
But there is more behind Turkey &apos;s reticent response to the coalition . 
Turkey fundamentally disagrees with the US in its interpretation of the threat that the Islamic State poses - and how to address it . 
Simply put , whereas the US is approaching the Islamic State as the Middle East &apos;s most pressing problem , Turkey views the group as a symptom of deeper pathologies . 
According to this view , any campaign that focuses exclusively on destroying the Islamic State will do nothing to prevent the emergence of similar threats in the near future . 
And , unlike the US , Middle Eastern countries and their neighbors cannot decide to &quot; pivot &quot; away from the region when the consequences of their poorly designed interventions become too unruly . 
In this context , Turkey &apos;s leaders believe that the international community &apos;s response to the Islamic State should be far more ambitious , seeking to redress the underlying causes of the current disorder . 
Such a strategy would have to include efforts to compel Iraq &apos;s new government to break with the sectarianism of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , while supporting the new leadership &apos;s efforts to provide basic health , educational , and municipal services to all of Iraq &apos;s citizens . 
As for Syria , the only plausible route to normalcy begins with forcing President Bashar al-Assad to cede power . 
To this end , the US and its allies should consider striking Assad &apos;s strongholds in Syria , while establishing safe havens for the moderate opposition under the protective cloak of a no-fly zone . 
Here , Turkey , for which the establishment of safe havens is vital to accommodate Syrians who have been displaced by the conflict , could play a central role . 
Turkey is already bearing a heavy burden of Syrian refugees , having absorbed more than one million since the crisis began in 2011 . 
Following Islamic State attacks against Kurdish enclaves , more than 120,000 refugees crossed into Turkey in a single weekend . 
That is roughly the same number of Syrians allowed to seek refuge in the entire European Union since the crisis began in 2011 . 
An orchestrated military campaign against the Islamic State will undoubtedly displace even more Syrians . 
But , in Turkey &apos;s view , they should not have to cross the border to be safe . 
Instead , Turkey wants to take the lead in building infrastructure that could serve the needs of Syria &apos;s displaced people within the country &apos;s borders . 
Such projects would make sense only within internationally guaranteed safe havens protected by a no-fly zone . Given that the Islamic State poses a graver threat to Turkey than to any other Western country , Turkey has no choice other than to participate in the campaign against it . 
This means , first and foremost , adopting a zero-tolerance policy toward the Islamic State at home , aimed at preventing the group from fundraising and recruiting on Turkish soil . 
Continued improvement of border security and deeper cooperation with Western intelligence agencies on the issue of foreign fighters are also essential . 
But Turkey &apos;s imperative to fight the Islamic State does not trump - much less invalidate - Turkish leaders &quot; concerns about Obama &apos;s long-term goals . 
If the US and Turkey are to work together to eradicate the Islamic State , they will first have to agree on a longer-term strategy for restoring some semblance of order to a crisis-ravaged region .
