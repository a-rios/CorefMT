Europe &apos;s Jihadi Generation 
MADRID ‒ He came from Algeria seeking a better life , anticipating an escape from poverty , oppression , and hopelessness . 
In Paris , he found a low-skill job and had children and grandchildren . 
As French citizens , they had the right to an education and health care . 
But they grew up in the ghettos that ring France &apos;s major cities , surrounded by families like theirs , literally on the margins of society . 
Unable to integrate fully , they had few opportunities for economic advancement . 
Paradise was never gained . 
This story has been repeated millions of times in the countries of Western Europe , with immigrants and their families ending up poor and excluded . 
In the worst-case scenario , they are recruited by extremist groups that seem to offer what they are missing : a sense of belonging , identity , and purpose . 
After a lifetime of marginalization , participation in a larger cause can seem worth the lies , self-destruction , and even death that inclusion demands . 
In the wake of the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris and the thwarting of another attack in Belgium , Europe needs to take a good look at itself . 
It must recognize that second- and third-generation immigrants are susceptible to the blandishments of terrorist organizations because European citizenship has not translated into social and economic inclusion . 
If anything , growing inequality - exacerbated by years of crisis - is making the problem worse . 
People need hope . 
They need to believe in a vision , a project that promises a better future for them and their communities . 
European countries once offered that sense of hope . 
But the crisis , and the official response to it , has replaced hope with frustration and disillusionment . 
This has created fertile ground for anti-immigrant populists and Islamist terrorists alike . 
More than 1,200 French citizens are estimated to have joined the jihadi cause in Syria , along with 600 from the United Kingdom , 550 from Germany , and 400 from Belgium . 
Other European countries , including Spain , are experiencing a similar phenomenon . 
And some European citizens , like the Charlie Hebdo assassins , have acted at home . 
While intelligence services and police forces must be engaged to prevent attacks , devising an effective strategy to counteract extremist movements requires , first and foremost , understanding what drives them . 
Western countries must go beyond defending freedom of speech and improving police coordination to develop lasting solutions that address adherents &quot; economic and social marginalization , while avoiding cultural confrontation and reliance on repression alone . 
More fundamentally , such solutions require abandoning the false dichotomy of liberty and security . 
If security concerns trump basic rights and freedoms , fanaticism will have scored a victory ; and the same thing will happen if expressions of Islamophobia and xenophobia increase . 
A week after the Paris attacks , German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated the sentiment expressed by former President Christian Wulff in 2010 : standing beside Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu , Merkel declared that Islam is as much a part of Germany as Judaism and Christianity . 
This statement represents the right way forward . 
Muslim immigrants , whether first- , second- , or third-generation , must be able to integrate fully into European society , gaining the same opportunities as Europe &apos;s other residents and citizens . 
That principle should be applied at the global level as well , through the establishment of an inclusive framework that fosters development - and encourages the rejection of fanaticism - in the Islamic world . 
The aggressive fundamentalism and infighting that held down Christian societies for centuries has been relegated to the past , and that is where it must remain . 
A religion is not only a belief system ; it is also an institution , a language , and even a kind of market actor , competing for supporters . 
Radical terrorist groups attempt to consolidate their distorted version of &quot; true &quot; Islam as the only institution , imposing their language to win the entire Muslim market . 
Today , groups like the Islamic State and Nigeria &apos;s Boko Haram have joined Al Qaeda in a struggle to attract Muslims from all over the world , thereby securing their leadership in global jihad . 
These groups take advantage of unruly environments and weak or collapsing institutions to gain a territorial foothold . 
Indeed , it was the failed transitions in Syria , Libya , and Yemen after the Arab Spring revolts that fueled the Islamic State &apos;s emergence . 
Millions of young people , though disillusioned by decades of social paralysis , unemployment , and brutal dictatorships , had dared to expect better . 
Though Tunisians have made progress , the other affected populations , like many Muslim immigrants in Europe , have had their hopes shattered . 
Jihad , like any other reductionist political program , is capable of seducing a wide variety of people . 
The attribute they almost always share is a sense of futility or a lack of purpose . 
The West must recognize that , as Afghanistan and Iraq have shown , conflict in the Arab world cannot be resolved through foreign military intervention . 
The only way to restore order and spur progress in the region is by empowering moderate Muslims , so that they can triumph over the forces of radicalism and violence . 
The West &apos;s role is to identify them and offer them acceptance and support . 
This lesson should be applied both abroad and at home .
