A Time for Clarity 
JOHANNESBURG - Terrorism and global warming loom , in many people &apos;s minds , as the greatest threats to the planet . 
In the United States , the Bush administration wants to increase funding for border security and immigration enforcement by nearly 20 % . 
More than $ 150 million is being spent to help transit systems in New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut prevent and respond to terrorist attacks . 
But international terrorism kills about 400 people in total each year . 
How much should we be willing to pay to reduce that death toll by , say , 25 % - a billion dollars , a hundred billion ? 
Meanwhile , in Hawaii , policymakers gathered to discuss a climate change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol . 
The environmental lobby groups want the next treaty to go much further than Kyoto , which is already setting the world back $ 180 billion a year . 
Indeed , efforts to slow global warming through the Kyoto Protocol or a similar treaty will make a miniscule difference , delaying temperature rises by just seven days by 2100 . 
A tenth of the annual cost of the Kyoto Protocol - or a tenth of the US budget this year for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - would prevent nearly 30 million new infections of HIV / AIDS . 
The same sum could similarly be used to help the four million people who will die from malnutrition this year , the 2.5 million killed by indoor and outdoor air pollution , the two million who will die because they lack micronutrients ( iron , zinc , and vitamin A ) , or the two million whose deaths will be caused by a lack of clean drinking water . 
We know how to stop people from dying from malnutrition , pollution , HIV / AIDS , and malaria . 
Effective strategies are cheap and simple : it &apos;s mostly a question of getting what &apos;s needed ( micronutrients , cleaner forms of fuel , free condoms , mosquito nets ) to those in need . 
Death tolls remain high because we have limited resources to solve all the world &apos;s problems , and these problems are not our biggest concerns . 
Governments and NGOs spend billions of dollars each year trying to help the world without explicitly considering whether they are achieving the most they can . 
They set priorities among the well-intentioned projects they finance , merely by deciding to do some things and not others - often based on political realities and media attention rather than rigorous scrutiny . 
Panic about terrorism and climate change doesn &apos;t blind us entirely to other problems facing the planet , but our fear does distort the lens through which we see the big picture . 
I hope that a clearer picture will emerge when a roundtable of international economists convenes in May to assess more than 50 solutions to different global challenges as part of the &quot; Copenhagen Consensus &quot; project . 
The participants will use cost-benefit analysis to weigh up different strategies . 
The result will be a prioritized list of solutions , showing which projects promise the greatest benefits compared to their costs . 
Should the world steam head-on into another Kyoto Protocol-style agreement ? 
Should we make air pollution our top priority ? 
Some object strongly to the idea of using economic tools to weigh the world &apos;s biggest problems . 
But this is a way to get honest about what works and what doesn &apos;t . 
It &apos;s too easy for politicians to throw more money at problems like terrorism , when some nations may already spend too much on security measures that merely shift attacks around . 
We need to know . 
When we acknowledge that some policies achieve little , we can debate other options . 
Maybe there are smarter ways to combat terrorism than expensive wars and ever more homeland security . 
Maybe we can tackle climate change better through less costly , more effective technology pushes . 
Maybe we will end up helping the world more by focusing on air pollution , education , or the condition of women . 
We know how politicians make their spending decisions today . 
In May , we &apos;ll see how some of the world &apos;s best economists - including five Nobel laureates - would invest the same money to get the biggest benefits possible . 
We will discover what could happen if politicians would rise above the distortion of the media &apos;s intense concentration on terrorism and climate change . 
The result should be a clearer focus on the world &apos;s biggest issues and their best solutions .
