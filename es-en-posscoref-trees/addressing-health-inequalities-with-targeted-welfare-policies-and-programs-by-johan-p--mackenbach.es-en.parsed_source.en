Only the Poor Die Young 
ROTTERDAM - People who are lower on the socioeconomic ladder ( indicated by their level of education , occupation , or income ) have shorter and less healthy lives , on average , than those on higher rungs . 
Indeed , life expectancy at birth often varies by 5-10 years , depending on social and economic well-being , with poorer people spending 10-20 more years of life suffering from illness or disability than their wealthier counterparts . 
In the nineteenth century , this situation would not have been surprising , given low average income , widespread poverty , and lack of social security . 
But such data are commonly reported for high-income countries today , including those ranking high on indices of economic prosperity and human development - even Western Europe &apos;s highly developed welfare states . 
Since the end of World War II , Western European countries have tried to reduce socioeconomic inequality , or offset its consequences , through progressive taxation , social security programs , and a wide range of collectively financed provisions , such as public housing , education , health care , and cultural and leisure facilities . 
But , while these policies have reduced inequalities in some social and economic outcomes , including income , housing quality , and health-care access , they have been insufficient to eliminate health inequalities . 
Long-term time-series data indicate that the socioeconomic mortality gap narrowed before the 1950 &quot; s , but has grown substantially since then . 
More puzzling is the fact that more generous welfare policies do not translate into smaller health disparities . 
Even the Nordic countries - world leaders when it comes to creating universal and well-designed welfare policies that cover citizens from cradle to grave - face significant health disparities , despite their relatively low income inequality . 
To be sure , modern welfare states have far from abolished social inequality , with disparities in access to material and human resources continuing to generate highly unequal lives among their citizens . 
But the welfare state &apos;s aim has never been radical redistribution of wealth . 
As a result , their redistributive effects are modest . 
So , while a partial failure of the welfare state may help to explain the persistence of health inequalities , one must look elsewhere to understand - and reverse - their rise . 
Two possible explanations have emerged from the rapidly growing scientific literature on the subject : selective upward social mobility and delayed diffusion of behavioral change . 
In reality , both factors are at work . 
During the twentieth century , social mobility increased slowly but steadily in all high-income countries , with educational achievement and occupational status depending less on family background and more on cognitive ability and other personal characteristics . 
As a result , the lower socioeconomic groups have not only shrunk in size , but have probably also become more homogeneous in terms of personal characteristics that increase the risk of health problems . 
Moreover , people with a higher socioeconomic position tend to adopt new behaviors first , and to abandon more readily behaviors that are found to damage health , such as smoking and high-fat diets . 
Given this , new behavioral recommendations by health authorities tend to exacerbate health inequalities , at least temporarily . 
Significant disparities in smoking , physical exercise , diet , and alcohol consumption afflict many of Western Europe &apos;s welfare states . 
The welfare system , which was created to combat poverty , has been less effective against &quot; diseases of affluence &quot; like heart disease and lung cancer . 
All of this highlights the need for creative solutions to disparities that unnecessarily and unfairly blight the lives of those who have the least , generate massive health-care costs , and pose a barrier to increased labor-force participation ( impeding efforts in some countries to raise the retirement age ) . 
In the last few decades , social policy in most Western European countries has moved away from redistribution . 
This is a mistake , given that the consequences of this shift - rising income inequality , weaker social safety nets , and reduced health-care access - will aggravate health inequalities in the long run . 
In fact , more , better-targeted redistributive policies , which account for the effects of selective upward social mobility and different rates of diffusion of behavioral change , are crucial to improving health outcomes in lower socioeconomic groups . 
Income support should be complemented by preventive health programs , while health literacy programs could help to diminish the link between low cognitive ability and bad health . 
Equal access to health care is not enough . 
Reducing inequalities in health outcomes requires more intensive health care for patients in lower socioeconomic brackets , tailored to their specific needs and challenges . 
For example , revenues from tobacco taxation , which disproportionately affects lower income groups , should be used to fund cessation-support programs that target disadvantaged smokers . 
Significant and persistent health inequality indicates that , by raising the health levels of those with lower incomes or less education , massive strides could be made in improving populations &quot; overall health . 
This may require reshaping the welfare system to some extent , but the payoff would be well worth the effort .
