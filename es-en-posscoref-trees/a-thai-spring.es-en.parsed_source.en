A Thai Spring ? 
BANGKOK - The thunderous results of Thailand &apos;s general election on July 3 will seem familiar to anyone attuned to the political upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa . 
Entrenched incumbent regimes everywhere are under severe stress from advances in information technology , shifts in demographics , rising expectations , and the obsolescence of Cold War exigencies . 
In the absence of a willingness and ability to use violent repression , regime survival can be achieved only through concessions , accommodation , and periodic reinvention . 
With 47 million voters and turnout at 75 % , Thailand &apos;s latest election results pose a decisive challenge to the country &apos;s long-established regime . 
The Pheu Thai party , led by Yingluck Shinawatra , the youngest sister of exiled fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , secured a resounding triumph , winning 265 seats in the 500-member assembly , while the ruling Democrat Party mustered just 159 . 
The return to power of Pheu Thai is extraordinary - and not only because Yingluck will be Thailand &apos;s first female prime minister . 
The establishment-aligned courts dissolved the party &apos;s two previous governments , and banned scores of its leading politicians from office for five years . 
Pheu Thai &apos;s victory thus suggests that a previously marginalized electorate has been permanently awakened . 
A similar majority of the Thai electorate voted for Thaksin &apos;s parties and their pro-poor populist platforms in January 2001 , February 2005 , April 2006 , and December 2007 , defying a military coup , a coup-induced constitution , judicial interventions , and army coercion and repression . 
The recent election marked a profound break from the past . 
In the second half of the twentieth century , Thai elections seemed to alternate with military coups . 
Voters were bought and sold like commodities . 
After elections , voters hardly ever saw or heard from their MPs , who typically went on to engage in corruption and graft in Bangkok - eventually losing legitimacy and paving the way for military coups . 
A new constitution and elections invariably ensued . 
This vicious cycle of coups , constitutions , and elections defined Thai politics for decades . 
That pattern reflected Cold War imperatives . 
The pillars of the Thai state - nation , religion , and the king - struck a unifying , collective chord , and the resulting stability enabled economic development . 
While growth was so concentrated that popular resentment simmered , communism was kept at bay . 
Challenges to the established order , with the military-monarchy-bureaucracy triumvirate as its anchor , were repeatedly put down . 
Back then , Thai schoolchildren sang martial songs each morning , and Thais knew their place in the rigidly elitist pecking order , which was reinforced by socialization and indoctrination in classrooms and living rooms , where only state-controlled media could enter . 
Thais were more like obedient subjects than informed citizens . 
Dissenting views found little traction . 
The rise of Thaksin &apos;s Thai Rak Thai party in 2001 changed all that . 
The party pursued a scientific approach to elections , relied on expensive polling by foreign experts , and offered a clear agenda and strong leadership . 
It was the first post-Cold War party to capture Thais &quot; collective imagination . 
The voices of neglected swaths of the electorate , particularly in the rural north and northeast of the country , began to count . 
Vote-buying became increasingly insufficient . 
A bond between party and voters - a bond based on policy - took root . 
By 2001 , the Cold War was long over . 
Political leaders who dissented from the status quo could no longer easily be jailed on communism-related charges . 
The advent of the Internet had made it harder for the authorities to shape Thai minds , as media sources multiplied and the resulting diffusion of information undermined the effectiveness of state propaganda . 
Moreover , new international norms had come to the fore : external powers that previously turned a blind eye to coups , military dictatorships , and repression now rallied around democracy and human rights . 
Thailand &apos;s demographics also changed . 
The Cold War curriculum of induced unity and stability has no relevance for today &apos;s schoolchildren ; indeed , most university students nowadays were born after the Cold War ended . 
These factors fostered a new political environment , and Thaksin , who was a telecommunications tycoon at the time , was well positioned to seize the opportunity . 
He overhauled the bureaucracy , delivered on his promises to the poor , mapped out an industrial strategy , and re-designed an overstretched foreign policy agenda , among other innovative measures . 
Of course , Thaksin &apos;s rule had a dark underside : corruption , legislated conflicts of interest , cronyism , human rights violations , and abuse of power , among other evidence of misrule . 
Such is Thaksin &apos;s mixed legacy . 
The opportunities , hopes , and dreams delivered to the downtrodden and the vision and plans for Thailand &apos;s future were enmeshed with his own venality . 
But , while Thaksin committed many infractions , his gravest &quot; sin &quot; was to have changed the way Thais think and behave . 
Some see this change as usurpation ; others view it as Thailand &apos;s deliverance into the twenty-first century . 
Thaksin &apos;s adversaries in Thailand &apos;s entrenched regime were unwilling to accede to his policy innovations and populism . 
For them , doing so would be tantamount to admitting that most people in this hospitable , well-endowed kingdom had been kept poor by design all along . 
For his part , Thaksin has sought to portray the recent election results as being all about him . 
But he is best viewed as a self-serving , unwitting agent of political modernization . 
It is these twenty-first-century dynamics and changes , underpinned by an increasingly assertive citizenry , with which the Thai establishment must come to terms if the country is to move forward .
