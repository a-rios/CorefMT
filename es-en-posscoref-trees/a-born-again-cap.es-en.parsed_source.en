A Born-Again CAP 
WAGENINGEN , NETHERLANDS - Born in 1957 , the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) is now more than 50 years old , and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child . 
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union &apos;s future needs . 
The CAP must be born again . 
Work on its renewal is due to start now , with the completed project ready in 2013 . 
But a much more profound re-think is needed . 
The CAP &apos;s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union , which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency . 
Good , healthy , and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens . 
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union &apos;s growing wealth . 
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed , and food security was achieved . 
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project . 
As the EU has evolved and expanded , food systems have become more complex , involving production , processing , supply-chain organization , and wholesale and retail distribution , with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment . 
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny . 
A 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy , entitled 
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries , so with today &apos;s 27 members the possibilities are even greater . 
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land , substantial gains could be made in food production . 
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially . 
Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas , there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP &apos;s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced . 
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered . 
The 
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner , more productive , and efficient agriculture . 
A side benefit for the EU &apos;s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization &apos;s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe . 
Moreover , the CAP &apos;s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place . 
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces , as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society . 
If the market &quot; misbehaves , &quot; farmers could be reduced to poverty , leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe . 
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars . 
1 . 
The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture &apos;s competitiveness . 
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands , substantially contributing to the development and power of the country &apos;s agribusiness . 
Ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness , including horticultural seeds , ornamentals , seed potatoes , and veal , are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country &apos;s trade balance . 
In the EU as a whole , a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture &apos;s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development . 
2 . 
Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use . 
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level , but agricultural production and land use are not among them . 
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure . 
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy . 
3 . 
A policy for European food systems would treat production , processing , distribution , logistics , and retailing in combination . 
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems . 
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation &apos;s &quot; Forward Look on European Food Systems &quot; could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy . 
4 . 
Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land . 
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects . 
5 . 
A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe &apos;s landscapes . 
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere , nor should it ignore cost . 
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land . 
These five pillars involve drastic choices , but they will probably require less money from Europe &apos;s taxpayers , not more . 
They could make a real contribution to cleaner , more productive , and efficient farming and land use , while addressing social needs .
