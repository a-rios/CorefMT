A New Chance for European Politics 
MADRID - Most political leaders in Europe want the European Union to emerge from its current crisis stronger and more united . 
But the economic policies that have been implemented in most EU countries since the crisis began have given rise to an unprecedented threat to deeper integration - and , indeed , to what already has been achieved . 
After five years of financial and economic crisis , anti-European politics has come resoundingly to the fore in many EU countries - France , the United Kingdom , Italy , Austria , Holland , Finland , Greece , Portugal , and even Germany . 
Growing institutional disaffection has become a corrosive reality almost everywhere in Europe . 
The only way to overcome Europe &apos;s existential crisis , and to respond to citizens &quot; demands for change , is to confront Europe &apos;s domestic opponents head-on : politics without palliatives . 
Europe needs , first and foremost , to break the vicious circle of recession , unemployment , and austerity that now has it in its grip . 
That means , first of all , refocusing economic policy on growth , employment , and institutional innovation . 
It is impossible to advance toward political union while seeming to abandon Europe &apos;s citizens along the way , which is the impression that unremitting austerity has created . 
Sacrifice , too many Europeans believe , is not laying the groundwork for a better , more prosperous Europe , but is dragging them into a fatal tailspin . 
European leaders cannot remain passive in the face of the dangerous populist tsunami now crossing the continent , and they know it . 
There is still time to react - by demonstrating strong leadership and prioritizing growth over short-sighted policies - but that time is limited and the clock is ticking . 
Next year will be crucial , for it will mark the end of the current political cycle and the beginning of a new one . 
There will be a new German government , European Parliament elections , and , at the end of the year , a new European Commission . 
It is here that political leaders should devote their efforts . 
No one wants the EU to fail because of its citizens &quot; disaffection . 
To take advantage of the political opportunity offered in 2014 requires launching an open , pedagogical effort now . 
European citizens have already shown a sense of responsibility and capacity for sacrifice , but they should know why hope - in the form of higher employment and living standards - is not futile . 
If that does not happen , next year &apos;s European elections may give rise to an unfortunate paradox . 
Just when , as a result of the Lisbon Treaty , the European Parliament gains more power than it has ever had , the risk of it being condemned to irrelevance is greatest . 
If , reflecting the mood in the member states , the elections result in a fragmented Parliament - possibly rendered less representative by low voter turnout - paralysis , disaffection , and ineffectiveness are guaranteed . 
That is why Europe &apos;s leaders should take advantage of the coming political cycle to correct Europe &apos;s institutional design and strengthen its democratic legitimacy , thereby enabling them to respond to Euro-skepticism and ad hoc bilateral deals with more integration . 
If Europeans are to overcome their fear of giving up sovereignty in order to achieve political union , a civic sense of attachment to Europe and its institutions must be regained and nurtured . 
Achieving this requires , among other things , the recovery of the Franco-German axis as Europe &apos;s driving force . 
It also presupposes a European budget that is sufficient to meet expectations and equal to the challenges that await . 
Resolving these issues is as important as resolving individual countries &quot; economic problems . 
Indeed , they are in large part the same problem . 
Institutions are legitimized in part by their effectiveness , and the EU must recover its authority to defend common interests and harmonize them with national concerns . 
The European Parliament can exercise its power only if citizens feel represented there . 
As Kemal Dervi≈ü , a vice president of the Brookings Institution , recently put it : &quot; If independent technocrats are allowed to determine long-term policy and set objectives that cannot be influenced by democratic majorities , democracy itself is in serious jeopardy . &quot; 
Next year will also mark the centenary of the outbreak of World War I. From that moment until the present , Europe has both endured the worst and enjoyed the best of its history . 
We should bear in mind the enormous symbolism of this date in order to understand how much Europe has changed - and , at the same time , to recognize the need to defend those changes . 
The EU is one of the great political milestones of mankind . 
For this reason , and in order to emerge stronger from the difficult situation in which Europeans now find themselves , Europe &apos;s leaders must work with the conviction that the future is inexorably linked to a more integrated and more capable Union .
