America &apos;s Locust Years 
BERKELEY - It is hard right now to write about American political economy . 
Nobody knows whether the debt-ceiling tripwire will be evaded ; if so , how ; or what will happen if it is not . 
If no deal to raise the debt ceiling is reached by August 3 , interest rates on United States Treasury bonds could spike , or they could remain stable , as investors decide they have other problems to worry about . 
Or the US Federal Reserve , the Peoples Bank of China ( PBC ) , or both - or even some other body - could support the market . 
Or interest rates could rise if people expect a much weaker global economy - and , in a weaker global economy with no inflation , investors should be holding more US Treasuries , not fewer . 
Frankly , no one knows what legislative deal will be struck to raise the debt ceiling . 
All we know as of this writing is that a deal would probably involve cuts in near-term spending , meaning weaker growth and higher unemployment over the next 18 months . 
And we can assume that it would be repealed and replaced by something else come January 2013 , either by a re-elected President Barack Obama , or by a new , Republican president . 
So , rather than talking about the US debt ceiling , let us think instead about all of the things that the debt-ceiling impasse has prevented the US government from doing during the past six months - all of the useful policies that might have been debated and enacted , but were not . 
The risks imposed by global warming , for example , have not gone away . 
The sooner the world starts preparing to deal with those threats , the better . 
Another six months should not be lost . 
The employment-to-population ratio in the US remains flat - mired at the very low levels to which it fell during the recession . 
With households desperately trying to rebuild their balance sheets , and with capital investment remarkably healthy , the only places to boost spending to restore capacity utilization and unemployment to normal levels are exports , government purchases , and construction investment . 
But opportunities to pursue the necessary policies have not been grasped . 
Here , too , another six months should not be lost . 
Likewise , the US could have fulfilled its normal role as the conductor of the international economic orchestra . 
It has not , even as the European Union continues to respond inadequately to its own slow-moving solvency crises . 
The mandarins of northern Europe continue to measure out a drip-feed of support with coffee spoons . 
Another six months have been lost . 
America faces long-run and short-run problems : decaying infrastructure , weakening educational systems , and a dysfunctional health-care system that produces sub-standard outcomes at twice the cost of any other industrial country . 
Solving any of these three problems would go a long way toward resolving the long-run financing imbalance between current tax rates and America &apos;s long-run social-insurance promises that the debt-ceiling debate &apos;s instigators supposedly want to address . 
But the US government won &apos;t address them . 
Six months that could have been spent boosting the long-run growth potential of the American economy through infrastructure investment , educational reform , or an overhaul of health-care financing - greatly easing America &apos;s long-run deficit and debt dilemmas in the process - have been lost . 
During the run-up to World War II , Winston Churchill , speaking in Parliament , lamented &quot; the years that the locusts hath eaten &quot; - the period during which preparatory action to face the great crisis of his day ( the rise of Continental fascism ) could have been taken , but was not . 
Over the past century - with the notable exception of the Great Depression - the US political system has been remarkably good at foreseeing crises long before they have happened , and at least setting the foundation for dealing with them when they have occurred . 
But so far in the third millennium , this skill - or simply run of luck - has deserted the US . 
My view is that the problem would fix itself easily if only the Republican Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower could stage a comeback ( though without Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy ) . 
It is becoming increasingly clear , however , that the problem is one not only for the US , but for the rest of the world as well . 
Since December 7 , 1941 , the world has in large part been able to rely on global governance by a somewhat-competent hyperpower . 
That America may be gone for good . 
If it is , the world needs to develop other institutions for global management - and quickly .
