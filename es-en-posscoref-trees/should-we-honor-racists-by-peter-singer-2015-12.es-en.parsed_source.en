Should We Honor Racists ? 
PRINCETON - In the midst of my Practical Ethics class last month , several students stood up and walked out . 
They were joining hundreds of others in a protest led by the Black Justice League ( BJL ) , one of many student groups that have emerged across the United States in response to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , in August 2014 , and subsequent police killings of unarmed African Americans . 
Later that day , members of the BJL occupied the office of Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber , vowing not to leave until their demands were met . 
The demand that received national attention was for the university &apos;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs , and Wilson College , one of its residential colleges , to be renamed . 
The college dining hall features a large mural of Wilson , which the BJL also wants removed . 
Honoring Wilson , the League says , is offensive to African American students , because Wilson was a racist . 
Wilson was a progressive in domestic affairs and an idealist in foreign policy . 
His administration passed laws against child labor and granted new rights to workers , as well as reforming banking laws and challenging monopolies . 
In the aftermath of World War I , he insisted that foreign policy be guided by moral values , and advocated democracy and national self-determination in Europe . 
Yet his policies for African Americans were reactionary . 
In 1913 , when he became US President , he inherited a federal government that employed many African Americans , some working alongside whites in mid-level management positions . 
Under his administration , racially segregated workplaces and washrooms , which had been abolished at the end of the Civil War , were re-introduced . 
When a delegation of African Americans protested , he told them that they should regard segregation as a benefit . 
Wilson &apos;s name features prominently at Princeton not only because he is one of the university &apos;s most famous alumni ( and the only one to receive the Nobel Peace Prize ) . 
It is also because , before he was US President , he was Princeton &apos;s president , and in the words of Anne-Marie Slaughter , a former dean of the Woodrow Wilson School , the person who &quot; perhaps did more than anyone else to transform &#91; Princeton &#93; from a preppie gentlemen &apos;s preserve into a great research university . &quot; 
Wilson is famous worldwide for the &quot; Fourteen Points &quot; that he proposed as the basis of a peace treaty to end World War I. He called for autonomy for the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires , as well as an independent Polish state . 
No wonder , then , that there is a Wilson Square in Warsaw , that Prague &apos;s main train station is named after him , and that there are Wilson streets in both Prague and Bratislava . 
Among the other Fourteen Points are calls for open covenants - no secret treaties plotting the post-war division of another country &apos;s territory - and for a reduction in trade barriers . 
Perhaps most momentous is the proposal for the formation of &quot; a general association of nations ... for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike . &quot; 
That call led to the founding of the League of Nations , the predecessor of the United Nations , which from 1920 until 1936 had its headquarters in the Palais Wilson , in Geneva . 
The building retains that name , and is today the headquarters of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights . 
History is full of deeply flawed people who did great things . 
In the US , we have only to look at slave-owning founding fathers and early presidents like George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , and James Madison . 
One might plead on their behalf that , in contrast to Wilson , they were at least no worse than the standards that prevailed in their time . 
But is that sufficient grounds to continue commemorating them ? 
A New Orleans school board thought not . 
Should the name of the country &apos;s capital city be reconsidered , too ? 
In his book Veil Politics in Liberal Democratic States , Ajume Wingo describes how &quot; political veils &quot; gloss over a political system &apos;s historical details , creating an idealized visage . 
The same happens to great - or not-so-great - political leaders , who become symbolic vehicles for inculcating civic virtues . 
As our moral standards shift , however , different characteristics of the historical person become more relevant , and the symbol can develop a different meaning . 
When Wilson &apos;s name was added to Princeton &apos;s School of Public and International Affairs in 1948 , Rosa Parks &quot; famous bus ride was still seven years away , and segregation in the American South was not under serious challenge . 
Wilson &apos;s racism therefore becomes more salient , and he ceases to embody the values that are important to Princeton University today . 
Wilson &apos;s contributions to the university , the US , and the world cannot and should not be erased from history . 
They should , instead , be recognized in a manner that creates a nuanced conversation about changing values , and includes both his positive achievements and his contributions to America &apos;s racist policies and practices . 
At Princeton , one outcome of that conversation should be the education of students and faculty who would otherwise be unaware of the complexity of an important figure in the university &apos;s history . 
( I certainly have benefited : I have taught at Princeton for 16 years , and I have admired some of Wilson &apos;s foreign-policy positions for much longer ; but I owe my knowledge of Wilson &apos;s racism to the BJL . ) 
The end result of the conversation we should be having may well be the recognition that to attach Wilson &apos;s name to a college or school sends a message that misrepresents the values for which the institution stands .
