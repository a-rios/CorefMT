Privacy Since Snowden 
LONDON - A year has passed since the American former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden began revealing the massive scope of Internet surveillance by the US National Security Agency . 
His disclosures have elicited public outrage and sharp rebukes from close US allies like Germany , upending rosy assumptions about how free and secure the Internet and telecommunications networks really are . 
Singlehandedly , Snowden has changed how people regard their phones , tablets , and laptops , and sparked a public debate about the protection of personal data . 
What his revelations have not done is bring about significant reforms . 
To be sure , US President Barack Obama , spurred by an alliance between civil-society organizations and the technology industry , has taken some action . 
In a January speech , and an accompanying presidential policy directive , Obama ordered American spies to recognize that &quot; all persons should be treated with dignity and respect , regardless of their nationality or wherever they might reside , and that all persons have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information . &quot; 
Some specific advances , unprecedented in the shadowy world of intelligence agencies , have accompanied this rhetorical commitment to privacy . 
When technology companies sued the government to release details about intelligence requests , the Obama administration compromised , supporting a settlement that allows for more detailed reporting . 
Under this agreement , companies have the option of publishing figures on data requests by intelligence agencies in ranges of 250 or 1,000 , depending on the degree of disaggregation of the types of orders . 
Though this represents a step forward , it is far from adequate , with gaping loopholes that prohibit reporting on some of the most notorious NSA programs , such as the dragnet collection of phone records under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act . 
Moreover , Obama has demurred on the most significant recommendations of the independent review group that he appointed . 
And the &quot; USA FREEDOM Act , &quot; which was meant to stop the mass collection of Americans &quot; phone records , is being diluted by a set of amendments that would enable the government to continue collecting metadata on millions of individuals , without their consent . 
This metadata - covering whom we talk to , when , and for how long - can reveal as much about our private lives as the content itself . 
Worse , relative to the rest of the world , the US has taken the strongest action since the Snowden revelations began . 
Of course , Snowden exposed more about the US government &apos;s surveillance activities than any other country . 
But the documents also included egregious examples of overreach by the Government Communications Headquarters , the United Kingdom &apos;s signals intelligence agency , and information about intelligence sharing in the so-called &quot; Five Eyes &quot; network of the US , the UK , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand . 
The agreements that govern the pooling and exchange of intelligence among these governments remain closely guarded secrets . 
In the UK , public and parliamentary debate on surveillance practices has been minimal , at best . 
And not only does Canadian law prohibit companies from reporting virtually any information about government requests for data ; 
Some countries have even intensified their surveillance activities . 
Immediately following the Snowden revelations , the French government snuck into a military appropriations bill the authority to increase government surveillance of the Internet dramatically , including for &quot; commercial &quot; reasons . 
The European Parliament &apos;s criticism of the mass surveillance practiced by the UK , Sweden , France , and Germany ( and potentially soon by the Netherlands ) seems not to carry much weight for national governments . 
With the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta this month , Snowden &apos;s revelations have also fueled a new movement to create country-specific Internet &quot; bills of rights &quot; establishing the principles of privacy , free speech , and responsible anonymity . 
In a stirring speech at the United Nations last September , Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff placed her country at the forefront of this movement by promoting Brazil &apos;s historic Marco Civil bill . 
But the proposed bill included the requirement that Internet companies keep their servers in Brazil - purportedly to protect information from American intelligence agencies &quot; prying eyes - while easing access to these data for Brazil &apos;s own law-enforcement and security agencies . 
Fortunately , Brazil &apos;s legislators kept these provisions out of the final Marco Civil , which was adopted in April . 
Alas , other governments are threatening to impose similar forced data-localization requirements . 
Such rules run not only contrary to the fundamental principles of an open and interconnected Internet infrastructure ; they also create new privacy risks . 
And they do nothing to solve the basic problem of restricting government access to personal data held by private companies . 
How companies worldwide respond to Snowden &apos;s revelations will have a profound impact on their users &quot; rights . 
So far , some have taken the right approach , pressing for greater transparency , while strengthening encryption on their networks to keep intelligence agencies out . 
Companies throughout the information and communication technology sector have started to make transparency reports an industry standard . 
But more telecommunications companies and hardware manufacturers should join Internet companies and privacy rights advocates to build a broad reform coalition . 
A year ago , Snowden alerted the world to governments &quot; egregious violation of people &apos;s privacy . 
It is up to the technology industry , civil-society organizations , and the general public to keep governments honest in pursuing much-needed reforms . 
Only then can the Internet provide the boon to freedom that it has long promised .
