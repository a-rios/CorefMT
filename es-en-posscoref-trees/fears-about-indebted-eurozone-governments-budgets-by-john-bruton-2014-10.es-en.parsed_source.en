Eurozone Budgets Under the Spotlight 
DUBLIN - Bond markets are notoriously fickle , often driven by sentiment rather than rigorous macroeconomic analysis , and , as the 2008 global financial crisis demonstrated , they are far from infallible . 
They can also be particularly unreliable when assessing an economy &apos;s long-term prospects . 
Though interest rates across the European Union are at historic lows , government debt in the eurozone could come under severe pressure should bond markets re-evaluate the riskiness of sovereign borrowers . 
That is a consideration that should weigh heavily on indebted governments as they submit their budgets for scrutiny to the European Commission . 
It is not just bond traders who can be swayed by irrational exuberance ( or its opposite ) . 
The verdicts of rating agencies on asset quality can also be flawed . 
Too often , the raters seem content to follow rather than lead sentiment . 
Like the proverbial bus driver fixated on what is happening in his rear view mirror rather than watching what is in front of him , too many bond analysts focus on historical economic data as the key determinant of future performance . 
It is against this background that the budget plans submitted by eurozone governments on October 15 will have to be assessed . 
This requirement of the eurozone &apos;s Stability and Growth Pact , specified by Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , applies to member states that fail to meet their commitments to bring their budget deficits below 3 % of GDP . 
The main source of concern is that the low interest rates at which most European governments can currently borrow are not likely to last . 
There are two reasons for this . 
First , sovereign bonds held by banks are treated as risk-free assets under EU rules for calculating banks &quot; solvency and capital-adequacy levels . 
This is a risky assumption , because it implies that no European government will ever fail to repay the bond in full , with all interest due , and on time . 
But the debt levels of some European countries relative to their income raise serious questions about whether their bonds really are risk-free . 
And , assuming that there is no surge in inflation or economic growth , the danger of default cannot be so easily dismissed . 
Second , with low interest rates causing vast sums of money to chase so few opportunities for decent yields , it is understandable that investors have turned to government bonds , thereby driving down yields still further . 
At that point , interest rates on sovereign debt would have to rise to sustain governments &quot; borrowing levels . 
This is not a far-fetched scenario , and its realization would play havoc with the budgets of many indebted eurozone member states . 
Therefore , in assessing member states &quot; draft budgets , governments and the Commission would be foolish to assume that low interest rates on government bonds will be around for the foreseeable future . 
If investors do decide that government bond yields are no longer worth the investment , sovereign borrowers &quot; options may be limited . 
They might be able to defy the European Commission , but they would be hard-pressed to resist the views of the bond markets . 
After all , the world &apos;s financial centers are not only susceptible to bouts of irrationality ; they are also less likely to be swayed by the sort of political rhetoric that might find some sympathy within the Commission or among ministerial colleagues in the EU Council . 
Moreover , the market &apos;s change of heart can occur very quickly and without warning , giving governments little if any time to make the necessary fiscal adjustments . 
But that is less likely to happen if the EU system for coordinating the 18 eurozone members &quot; budget policies ( the so-called Two Pack and Six Pack ) is seen to be respected - especially by the larger countries , such as France and Italy . 
On the other hand , if the system is defied , or reinterpreted in a way that alters its intended meaning , bond markets could once again become nervous . 
Ireland knows better than most countries the difficulties that can arise from having to borrow to fund services or repay maturing debts .
