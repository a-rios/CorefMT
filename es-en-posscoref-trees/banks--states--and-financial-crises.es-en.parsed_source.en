Banks , States , and Financial Crises 
PRINCETON - The most recent phase of the financial crisis , since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , has been characterized by large bank losses and the continued threat of bank collapses . 
The size of the calamity raises the question of whether small countries can really afford bank bailouts . 
But the definition of &quot; small &quot; keeps changing : a few months ago , small meant Iceland , then it meant Ireland , and now it means the United Kingdom . 
The aftermath of the banking crisis requires thinking about not only the most appropriate form of banking legislation , but also the appropriate size of the state . 
There has always been uncertainty about the best design of a banking system , and there has always been competition between different sorts of banking regulation . 
On the one hand , there is the idea - which defined banking for much of American history - that banks should be close to the risks that they must judge . 
This ideal grew out of Andrew Jackson &apos;s titanic struggle with Nicholas Biddle and the Second Bank of the United States . 
Populism was pitted against the financiers , and populism won . 
As a result , most nineteenth-century US banks did not have branches , and were limited to one state . 
The alternative approach was that of Canada , which , because of its roots in secure British rule , had much less fear of political centralization , and was prepared to tolerate a nation-wide banking system . 
Canada &apos;s large banking system distributed risk more widely , and fared better in episodes of financial panic , whether in 1907 or in 1929-1933 . 
The larger-bank principle has two chief attractions . 
First , it promises more effective risk management , because large banks are less exposed to a single sort of customer ( in contrast to rural American banks , which suffered when American farmers suffered ) . 
Second , it lends itself much more effectively to long-term strategic thinking about the overall direction of the national , or even the international , economy . 
But larger banks can get into trouble when these two principles get mixed up . 
The idea of the larger bank reached its high point in continental Europe , and especially in Germany , whose big banking system developed out of trade finance and into industrial finance in the late nineteenth century . 
By that time , countries were looking with eager interest at financial models developed elsewhere . 
After the 1907 panic , the US Congress convened a National Monetary Commission , whose most interesting and attractive potential model for the US was German-style universal banks , which were imitated in Russia , Japan , Italy , and Egypt . 
By 1931 , even Britain found it hard to resist the German model . 
It , too , conducted an official inquiry , establishing the Macmillan Committee to hear evidence about how poorly British banks served British industry , and how the German model did a much better job at converting savings into industrial finance . 
The Great Depression ended this imitative surge in which the universal bank appeared to triumph . 
By an unfortunate coincidence , the Macmillan Committee produced its report on July 13 , 1931 , the day that Germany &apos;s most dynamic universal bank , the Darmst√§dter Bank , failed . 
By the 1990 &quot; s , however , emulation of other banking models was back in fashion . 
Financial empire building drove late twentieth-century globalization . 
There was a competitive race across the Atlantic and - to a lesser extent - the Pacific . 
Indeed , gradual integration of the potentially vast European capital market , and the creation of cross-border European banks as a result of mergers , made it look as if a new European breed of superbanks was emerging . 
Likewise , Japan responded to its banking crisis by creating very large merged institutions , while the US repealed much of the depression-era legislation that restricted banking . 
Finally , after Mexico &apos;s 1994-95 peso crisis and the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis , the US exported its new banking model to the emerging-market economies . 
Spanish and US banks moved heavily into Latin America . 
The appeal here was the opportunity for strategic vision , most clearly seen and pursued by Robert Rubin , first as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration and then as an adviser to the new giant of US banking , Citigroup , which emerged out of a 1998 merger . 
But the new superbanks were inherently vulnerable because of the vast diversity and complexity of their transactions . 
Long before the emergence of the sub-prime mortgage problem , Citigroup was damaged by the behavior of its London traders , who tried to manipulate the European government bond market , and by its Tokyo traders . 
It is much simpler for a transnational manufacturing corporation to implement controls to ensure product quality . 
By contrast , in a company whose business is financial intermediation , millions of judgments are made independently , and their implications may be serious enough to threaten the entire firm . 
When the strategy goes wrong , the recriminations begin . 
Traditional mid-sized European states cannot afford to have a strategic vision for their banks . 
But , even for the US , the notion of a world held together by Citigroup &apos;s business plan is simply too costly . 
There is a danger that in the push to nationalize banks as a consequence of the financial crisis , governments will see it as their duty to implement strategies . 
The strategic vision of a bank shaping the economic fortunes of a country , or the whole world , is as flawed as was the idea of central economic planning . 
In this sense , 2007-2009 is the capitalist equivalent of the communist demise of 1989-1991 .
