The Resistible Rise of Asia ? 
NEW DELHI - A favorite theme in international debate nowadays is whether Asia &apos;s rise signifies the West &apos;s decline . 
To be sure , today &apos;s ongoing global power shifts are primarily linked to Asia &apos;s phenomenal economic rise , the speed and scale of which have no parallel in world history . 
With the world &apos;s fastest-growing economies , fastest-rising military expenditures , fiercest resource competition , and most serious hot spots , Asia obviously holds the key to the future global order . 
But Asia faces major constraints . 
It must cope with entrenched territorial and maritime disputes , such as in the South China Sea ; harmful historical legacies that weigh down its most important interstate relationships ; increasingly fervent nationalism ; growing religious extremism ; and sharpening competition over water and energy . 
Moreover , Asia &apos;s political integration badly lags behind its economic integration , and , to compound matters , it has no security framework . 
Regional consultation mechanisms remain weak . 
Differences persist over whether a security architecture or community should extend across Asia , or be confined to an ill-defined &quot; East Asia . &quot; 
One central concern is that , unlike Europe &apos;s bloody wars of the first half of the twentieth century , which made war there unthinkable today , the wars in Asia in the second half of the twentieth century only accentuated bitter rivalries . 
Several interstate wars have been fought in Asia since 1950 , when both the Korean War and the annexation of Tibet started , without resolving the underlying Asian disputes . 
To take the most significant example , China staged military interventions even when it was poor and internally troubled . 
A 2010 Pentagon report cites Chinese military preemption in 1950 , 1962 , 1969 , and 1979 in the name of strategic defense . 
There was also China &apos;s seizure of the Paracel Islands from Vietnam in 1974 , and the 1995 occupation of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands , amid protests by the Philippines . 
This history helps to explain why China &apos;s rapidly growing military power raises important concerns in Asia today . 
Indeed , not since Japan rose to world-power status during the reign of the Meiji Emperor ( 1867-1912 ) has another non-Western power emerged with such potential to shape the global order . 
After all , by the nineteenth century , Europeans had colonized much of Asia , leaving in place no Asian power that could rein in Japan . 
Today , China is rising alongside other important Asian countries , including South Korea , Vietnam , India , and Indonesia . 
Although China now has displaced Japan as the world &apos;s second largest economy , Japan will remain a strong power for the foreseeable future . 
On a per capita basis , Japan remains nine times richer than China , and it possesses Asia &apos;s largest naval fleet and its most advanced high-tech industries . 
When Japan emerged as a world power , imperial conquest followed , whereas a rising China &apos;s expansionist impulses are , to some extent , checked by other Asian powers . 
Militarily , China is in no position to grab the territories that it covets . 
In fact , China seems to be on the same path that made Japan an aggressive , militaristic state , with tragic consequences for the region - and for Japan . 
The Meiji Restoration created a powerful military under the slogan &quot; Enrich the country and strengthen the military . &quot; 
The military eventually became so strong that it could dictate terms to the civilian government . 
The same could unfold in China , where the Communist Party is increasingly beholden to the military for retaining its monopoly on power . 
More broadly , Asia &apos;s power dynamics are likely to remain fluid , with new or shifting alliances and strengthened military capabilities continuing to challenge regional stability . 
For example , as China , India , and Japan maneuver for strategic advantage , they are transforming their mutual relations in a way that portends closer strategic engagement between India and Japan , and sharper competition between them and China . 
The future will not belong to Asia merely because it is the world &apos;s largest , most populous , and fastest-developing continent . 
Size is not necessarily an asset . 
Historically , small , strategically oriented states have wielded global power . 
In fact , with far fewer people , Asia would have a better balance between population size and available natural resources , including water , food , and energy . 
In China , for example , water scarcity has been officially estimated to cost roughly $ 28 billion in annual industrial output , even though China , unlike several other Asian economies , including India , South Korea , and Singapore , is not listed by the United Nations as a country facing water stress . 
In addition to its growing political and natural-resource challenges , Asia has made the mistake of overemphasizing GDP growth to the exclusion of other indices of development . 
As a result , Asia is becoming more unequal , corruption is spreading , domestic discontent is rising , and environmental degradation is becoming a serious problem . 
Worse , while many Asian states have embraced the West &apos;s economic values , they reject its political values . 
So make no mistake . 
Asia &apos;s challenges are graver than those facing Europe , which embodies comprehensive development more than any other part of the world . 
Despite China &apos;s aura of inevitability , it is far from certain that Asia , with its pressing internal challenges , will be able to spearhead global growth and shape a new world order .
