Did America Really Kill the Trade Talks ? 
It is appalling that the world has decided to blame the United States for the crushing end to five years of global trade talks last month ( the so-called &quot; Doha round &quot; ) . 
I am the first to admit that the US under President George W. Bush has not covered itself with multilateral glory in recent years . 
Give me a break . 
Do people seriously believe that the US has accomplished its majestic trade deficit by shutting its doors to foreign goods ? 
On the contrary , through its low tariffs and general lack of import restrictions , the US has turned itself into an international shopping theme park . 
Americans buy more foreign-made refrigerators , cars , clothing , computers - you name it - than anyone else . 
Happily for world exporters , the same binge mentality that makes a whopping two-thirds of Americans either overweight or obese seems to extend to all their purchasing habits . 
Since the start of this decade , neither recession nor hurricanes nor sky-high oil prices have seemed to dent their appetites . 
The simple fact is that even if US trade negotiator Susan Schwab had refused to make a single &quot; concession , &quot; and if Europe , Japan , and the big emerging markets had kept their best offers on the table , the US would still remain more open than all but a few small countries . 
True , in the endgame of the talks , the US caved in to its wealthy and powerful agribusiness lobby . 
But that was only after five years of intransigence by Europe &apos;s even more powerful farm lobbies . 
And this is not to mention emerging market politicians &quot; failure to grasp that unilaterally reducing their excessive import restrictions would be a good idea even if rich countries sat on their hands . 
What does last month &apos;s trade fiasco mean ? 
Old hands know that global trade deals often rise out of the ashes of failed talks . 
Unfortunately , such an outcome seems improbable now , especially since the US is unlikely to rejoin the talks anytime soon . 
The opposition Democratic Party seems poised to take up growing wage inequality as a central issue in this year &apos;s mid-term US congressional elections and in the 2008 presidential election . 
To be sure , we economists have found that globalization appears to have played a far lesser role in growing wage inequality than have technological advances . 
Even so , the explosion of exports coming out of low-wage regions like China and India is at least a piece of the puzzle . 
The last thing that Bush &apos;s Republicans want is to appear indifferent to the plight of the middle classes . 
So , unfortunately , even if Europe came to its senses and emerging markets showed greater enthusiasm for liberal trade , we may not see a big global deal until the next decade . 
How bad would that be ? 
After all , many Asian countries have achieved impressive export-led growth under the current system . 
And bilateral or regional trade deals can chip away at some of the barriers in the current global system . 
For example , a fundamental problem is that the nature of global trade is constantly evolving , and existing agreements have only limited capacity to adapt . 
Services like education , banking , accounting , and insurance account for an ever larger share of global output ( now roughly two-thirds ) , and further expansion requires significant changes in existing agreements . 
Even if Asia has succeeded by relentlessly exporting manufactures , today &apos;s poorest countries , especially in Africa , can realistically export only agriculture and textiles . 
But these are precisely the range of goods that remain most protected under existing agreements . 
Bilateral deals can help , but they can also lead to higher trade barriers for everyone else . 
The current state of affairs is all the more depressing because global economic growth in the past four years has been the fastest since the early 1970 &quot; s . 
Rapidly expanding global trade , combined with an ever-freer and faster exchange of people and ideas , has been a cornerstone of this growth , particularly of the strong productivity gains that underlie it . 
Absent further trade agreements , there is a big risk that the pace of globalization will slow , with profound consequences for global poverty and welfare . 
Outside Africa , the people who will suffer the most are those in countries like Brazil , India , China , and Mexico , whose leaders rightly took on rich-country farm subsidies , but wrongly failed to recognize the profound costs of the developing world &apos;s own import restrictions . 
So for now , the world must hope that Americans continue gorging on foreign imports . 
Wallis Simpson , the controversial US-born Duchess of Windsor , once famously quipped , &quot; You can never be too rich or too thin . &quot; 
Fortunately for everyone , America &apos;s motto nowadays is &quot; You can never be too rich or too large . &quot; 
When Americans finally decide to go on an import diet , as they will someday , the world &apos;s hypocrisy over the failed global trade talks will become apparent to all .
