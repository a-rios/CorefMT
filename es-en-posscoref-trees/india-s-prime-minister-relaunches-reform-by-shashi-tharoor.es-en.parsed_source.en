Manmohan Singh &apos;s Second Wind 
NEW DELHI - In September , India &apos;s mild-mannered prime minister , Manmohan Singh , turned 80 . 
He also turned a page : After months of being pilloried by every pundit with a soapbox for indecision and weakness , and for presiding over &quot; policy paralysis &quot; while corrupt colleagues allegedly made off with the country &apos;s silver , Singh has boldly seized the initiative . 
A series of reform announcements , and some frank talk to the public , have underscored his new message : &quot; I am in charge . &quot; 
The initial steps that he has announced are impressive . 
Several controversial provisions included in the government &apos;s last budget are being reviewed . 
Foreign direct investment will be allowed to enter the retail sector and civil aviation - bold decisions that cost the government the support of a recalcitrant coalition ally . 
Likewise , the government has reduced subsidies on diesel and cooking gas in the face of vociferous opposition , including a one-day strike that shut down the country . 
And more reforms are in the works , sending an unmistakable signal that India is not ready to be written off , as had seemed to be happening earlier amid tales of investor flight and credit-rating downgrades . 
The rebirth of Singh the reformer came after a long wait . 
As Finance Minister in 1991 , Singh unleashed the liberalization of the Indian economy . 
&quot; No power on earth , &quot; he memorably told Parliament , quoting Victor Hugo , &quot; can stop an idea whose time has come . &quot; 
The measures that he took contributed more than anything else to earning India - long derided for its &quot; license-permit-quota Raj &quot; and its snail-like &quot; Hindu rate of growth &quot; - a global reputation as the world &apos;s next big economic success story . 
As Prime Minister since 2004 , his success story continued even during the global recession . 
But Singh &apos;s most recent chapters have been less positive . 
India &apos;s growth has slipped , while his government has been consumed by one corruption scandal after another . 
His mildness came to be dismissed as timidity , his unflappable manner excoriated as complacency and ineffectiveness . 
The bloom had come off the Indian rose , and Singh - damned by Time magazine as &quot; the underachiever &quot; - was blamed . 
With just a year and a half to go before the next scheduled general election , Singh must walk a tightrope - sending the right signals to global investors that India remains open ( and profitable ) for business , while assuring voters that he has their interests and concerns in mind . 
The famously reticent Singh even delivered a televised address to the public , in both Hindi and English , explaining his decisions . 
That might not be unusual elsewhere , but in India , it was almost unprecedented , thus serving to reaffirm that vital changes were in the works . 
Part of Singh &apos;s problem is that decisions that hurt voters ( higher diesel prices , fewer subsidized cooking-gas cylinders ) have an immediate impact , whereas the benefits of foreign investment , for example , take years to become apparent . 
All politicians in democracies think in the short term ; few have time horizons that extend beyond the next election . 
With his 20-year record of accomplishment to show the public , Singh has a better case than most to be trusted by voters when he says that he is acting in their long-term interest . 
Within Singh &apos;s Congress Party , the pressure will mount to match economic-reform initiatives with &quot; pro-poor &quot; programs . 
The Congress can rightly take credit for the most far-reaching such program , the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme , which assures one member in every poor rural family 100 days per year of paid employment . 
This program , financed from additional revenues generated by earlier reforms , is the poster child for the ruling party &apos;s commitment to ending poverty . 
Funds saved by measures such as raising diesel prices could be spent on new schemes that similarly target the aam aadmi , the common man , by whom the Congress swears . 
There is also talk of a long-delayed Food Security Bill being brought to parliament . 
Land-acquisition reforms are in the air , and the New Delhi rumor mills buzz with talk of an imminent government reshuffle to inject young blood into a notoriously geriatric Council of Ministers . 
Singh &apos;s accomplishments are extraordinary . 
The India that existed when he took office in 1991 was an inefficient , centrally planned economy . 
For 45 years , bureaucrats had occupied its commanding heights , stifling enterprise under a straitjacket of regulations and licenses , erecting protectionist barriers against foreign trade and investment in the name of self-reliance , subsidizing an unproductive public sector , and struggling to redistribute the country &apos;s poverty . 
Twenty years later , India boasts a thriving , entrepreneurial , and globalized economy , with a dynamic business culture . 
Today &apos;s India competes on its own terms and pulls more than ten million people out of poverty every year . 
The prime minister who has done the most to make this possible has returned to the charge , clearly determined to consolidate his legacy after a spate of bad-news stories . 
India , and the world , will watch him with hope .
