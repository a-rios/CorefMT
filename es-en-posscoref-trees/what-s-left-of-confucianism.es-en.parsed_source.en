What &apos;s Left of Confucianism ? 
BEIJING - The Chinese government &apos;s very public display of compassion and transparency in response to the devastating earthquake in Sichuan province appears to have strengthened its authority and its bonds with ordinary Chinese people . 
The government and army worked hand in hand with legions of volunteers and private networks to rescue quake victims . 
Even die-hard cynics were won over by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao &apos;s emotional comforting of the survivors . 
But heroic rescue efforts will not be able to help the government forever , so it is worth asking what can provide long-term political legitimacy . 
After all , communism has lost its capacity to inspire the Chinese . 
So what should replace it ? 
Most Westerners think the answer is liberal democracy , as did many Chinese liberals in the twentieth century . 
But there is another answer , which takes the form of the old and venerable tradition of Confucianism , which is being revived by government officials , critical intellectuals , and ordinary citizens . 
The opening ceremony of the Olympic games will highlight this revival : it will feature not quotes from Marx , but sayings from the Analects of Confucius . 
Such sayings as &quot; The world &apos;s peoples are all brothers &quot; and &quot; Isn &apos;t one of life &apos;s greatest pleasures to have friends visiting from afar ? &quot; will be beamed to billions worldwide , expressing the best that Chinese culture has to offer . 
Here , however , we run into trouble . 
Ever since the Han dynasty ( more than 2,000 years ago ) , Chinese governments have manipulated the most prominent political interpretations of Confucianism for their own purposes . 
Confucianism has been combined with Legalism , China &apos;s other main political tradition , to justify such practices as blind obedience to the ruler , subordination of women , and the use of harsh punishments . 
The &quot; official &quot; Confucianism being revived today may be less dangerous - it emphasizes social harmony , meaning the peaceful resolution of conflicts - but it remains a conservative morality . 
But there is another interpretation of Confucianism - let &apos;s call it &quot; left Confucianism &quot; - that stresses intellectuals &quot; obligation to criticize bad policies , obliges governments to provide for the people &apos;s material well-being and support those without key family relations , and calls for governments to adopt a more international-minded outlook and to rely on moral power rather than military might to pursue political aims . 
It leaves open basic metaphysical commitments and takes a plural and tolerant view of religious life . 
It emphasizes equality of opportunity in education as well as meritocracy in government , with leadership positions being distributed to the community &apos;s most virtuous and qualified members . 
Such values owe their origin to the &quot; original Confucianism &quot; of Confucius , Mencius , and Xunzi , which existed before Confucianism became established as state orthodoxy . 
In imperial times , the critical tradition was carried forward by such scholars as Huang Zongxi . 
Today , new Confucian leftists such as Gan Yang are calling for the creation of a &quot; Confucian socialist republic . &quot; 
Confucian scholars such as Jiang Qing openly acknowledge that their interpretation of Confucianism most closely parallels socialist ideals : not the &quot; actually existing socialism &quot; in today &apos;s China , but the socialist ideals defended by Karl Marx and others . 
This Confucian tradition aims to influence contemporary politics , but it also remains separate from state power and orthodoxy , always ready to point to the gap between ideals and reality . 
Indeed , left Confucianism &apos;s departure from the status quo is precisely the point : it is meant to provide a moral standard for social critics and to inspire visions of a more desirable political future . 
Unlike communism , it offers a future that derives its legitimacy from tradition and building upon what the past has to offer - including the socialist tradition - rather than destroying it . 
Thus , left Confucians favor institutional reform , arguing that the long-term stability and legitimacy of political institutions requires that they be founded on Chinese traditions . 
Jiang Qing advocates a tri-cameral legislature - a democratically elected People &apos;s House representing the common people &apos;s interests , a House of Exemplary Persons to secure the good of all those affected by government policies , including foreigners and minority groups , and a House of Cultural Continuity that would maintain China &apos;s various religions and traditions . 
Such concrete proposals for political reform inspired by Confucian values can rarely be published in mainland China . 
In fact , there are fewer constraints imposed on public discussion of liberal-democratic institutions precisely because few Chinese are inspired by Western-style liberal democracy . 
Today , the most viable alternative to China &apos;s political status quo is left Confucianism .
