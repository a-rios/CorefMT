Saying No to the Warmongers 
NEW YORK - The accord struck in Vienna to rein in Iran &apos;s nuclear activities has warmongers fulminating . 
Citizens worldwide should support US President Barack Obama &apos;s brave effort to outmaneuver them , taking heart from the fact that the signatories include not just the United States , but all five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany . 
Many of the warmongers are to be found in Obama &apos;s own government agencies . 
Most Americans struggle to recognize or understand their country &apos;s permanent security state , in which elected politicians seem to run the show , but the CIA and the Pentagon often take the lead - a state that inherently gravitates toward military , rather than diplomatic , solutions to foreign-policy challenges . 
Since 1947 , when the CIA was established , the US has had a continuous semi-covert , semi-overt policy of overthrowing foreign governments . 
In fact , the CIA was designed to avoid genuine democratic oversight and provide presidents with &quot; plausible deniability . &quot; 
It has gone on to topple dozens of governments , in all regions of the world , with no accountability there or at home . 
I recently examined one period of CIA activity in my book To Move the World : JFK &apos;s Quest for Peace . 
Soon after Kennedy assumed the presidency in 1961 , he was &quot; informed &quot; by the CIA of its plot to overthrow Fidel Castro . 
Kennedy felt stuck : Should he sanction the planned CIA invasion of Cuba or veto it ? 
New to the gruesome game , Kennedy tried to have it both ways , by letting it proceed , but without US air cover . 
The CIA-led invasion , executed by a motley group of Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs , was a military failure and a foreign-policy disaster , one that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis the following year . 
During the missile crisis , most senior security officials advising the president wanted to launch military action against Soviet forces , a course that could well have ended in nuclear annihilation . 
Kennedy overruled the warmongers , and prevailed in the crisis through diplomacy . 
By 1963 , Kennedy no longer trusted the advice of the military and the CIA . 
Indeed , he regarded many of his putative advisers as a threat to world peace . 
That year , he used diplomacy relentlessly and skillfully to achieve a breakthrough nuclear agreement with the Soviet Union , the Limited Test Ban Treaty . 
The American people strongly - and rightly - supported Kennedy over the warmongers . 
But three months after the treaty was signed , JFK was assassinated . 
Kennedy tried ; his successor , Lyndon Johnson , did not , and the debacle of Vietnam ensued . 
Jimmy Carter tried ; 
Reagan did not ( his CIA helped to unleash death and mayhem in Central America throughout the 1980s ) . 
Clinton mostly tried ( except in the Balkans ) ; 
George W. Bush did not , and generated new wars and turmoil . 
On the whole , Obama has tried to restrain the warmongers , yet he has given in to them frequently - not only by relying on weaponized drones , but also by waging covert wars in Syria , Libya , Yemen , Somalia , and elsewhere . 
Nor did he truly end the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ; he replaced troops on the ground with US drones , air strikes , and &quot; private &quot; contractors . 
Iran is surely his finest moment , a historic milestone that demands full-throated approval . 
The political difficulty of making peace with Iran is similar to that of JFK &apos;s peacemaking with the Soviet Union in 1963 . 
Americans have been suspicious of Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 and the subsequent hostage crisis , in which Iranian students held 52 Americans at the US embassy for 444 days . 
Few Americans know that the CIA overthrew a democratic Iranian government in 1953 . 
Iranians had had the temerity to elect a progressive , secular prime minister who believed that the country &apos;s oil belonged to its people , not to the United Kingdom or the US . 
Likewise , following the 1979 Iranian Revolution , the US armed Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq to go to war with Iran , resulting in hundreds of thousands of Iranian deaths in the 1980s . 
And US-led international sanctions , imposed from the 1990s onward , have aimed to impoverish , destabilize , and ultimately topple the Islamist regime . 
Today , the warmongers are trying to scuttle the Vienna accord . 
Saudi Arabia is in a violent struggle with Iran for regional supremacy , with geopolitical competition converging with the Sunni-Shia rivalry . 
Israel , the Middle East &apos;s only nuclear power , wants to retain its strategic monopoly . 
The US warmongers seem to view any Islamist state as ripe for toppling . 
Obama is correct that America &apos;s true interests , and those of the world , are with peace , not continued conflict , with Iran . 
The US is not a partisan in the Shia-Sunni struggle ; if anything , the US confronts mainly Sunni terrorism , funded from Saudi Arabia , not Shia terrorism backed by Iran . 
Obama is also right that , despite Israel &apos;s arguments , the agreement will reduce the possibility of Iran ever becoming a nuclear state . 
The best way to ensure that outcome is to normalize relations with it , help its economy recover , and support its integration into the international community . 
Iran is a great and ancient culture . 
Its opening to the world as a place of business , tourism , the arts , and sports would be a boon to global stability and prosperity . 
The new treaty will verifiably prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for at least a decade - and keep it bound to nuclear non-proliferation thereafter . 
This is the time to begin a broader US-Iran rapprochement and build a new security regime in the Middle East and the world that leads toward full global nuclear disarmament . 
To get there requires , above all , replacing war ( including the CIA &apos;s secret wars ) with commerce and other forms of peaceful exchange .
