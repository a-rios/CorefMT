The Future Global Economy 
WASHINGTON , DC - As the world enters yet another year in the shadow of continued financial and economic crisis , a broader view of the contours of the future global economy is required . 
The longer-term trends are clear . 
Dynamic emerging markets from Asia to Latin America are rising in prominence . 
The United States and Japan remain important drivers of the global economy but face major debt and deficit challenges . 
Europe is going through a difficult but historic process of re-engineering and integration . 
The Middle East is transforming before our eyes . 
Sub-Saharan Africa is breaking through to sustained development - creating a new frontier of growth after decades of stagnation . 
These changes are shaping our future in a positive way . 
Yet there are still considerable roadblocks to overcome . 
The global economic recovery remains too weak . 
With more than 200 million unemployed around the world , prospects for job creation are still too dim . 
There is a tough road ahead if we are to turn optimism into reality . 
I see three key milestones . 
First , and most obviously , we need to put the crisis behind us , once and for all . 
All of this should be complemented by a rebalancing of global demand toward dynamic markets , including emerging economies . 
Perhaps the greatest obstacle will be the huge legacy of public debt , which now averages about 110 % of GDP in the advanced economies - the highest level since World War II . 
This leaves governments highly exposed to subtle shifts in confidence . 
It also ties their hands , especially as they seek to build the physical and institutional infrastructure of the twenty-first century while respecting social promises . 
The needs of aging populations will add to these pressures . 
So we face a twofold imperative - securing growth while reducing debt . 
The key now is not only to move from deliberation to action on the policies that we know are needed , but to move together and on all fronts . 
The second milestone is a better global financial system . 
We need to move beyond the system that gave us the crisis - a financial sector in which some , as the ancient Greeks might say , toyed with hubris and unleashed nemesis . 
Of course , there has been important progress , especially on the Basel III agenda to create more resilient capital and liquidity buffers . 
As a result , the system as a whole is not yet much safer than it was in September 2008 , when Lehman Brothers collapsed . 
It is still too complex ; activities are still too concentrated in large institutions ; and the specter of &quot; too big to fail &quot; remains . 
Continuing excesses and repeated scandals show that the culture of finance has not really changed . 
Many in the financial-services industry are concerned about the costs of new regulations . 
A recent IMF study shows that better regulation would indeed nudge banks &quot; lending rates up , but by relatively little . 
We also found that increasing capital buffers to appropriate levels helps , rather than hurts , economic growth . 
Reforming financial-sector taxation would also help to reduce excessive risk-taking and leverage . 
The bottom line is that the costs of reform are affordable . 
The third milestone relates to the quality and inclusiveness of growth . 
While growth is essential for the future global economy , it must be a different kind of growth - inclusive and not simply the fallout of unfettered globalization . 
The policy implications of such a reorientation are profound . 
It requires a fiscal policy that focuses not only on efficiency , but also on equity - particularly on fairness in sharing the burden of adjustment , and on protecting the weak and vulnerable . 
It means expanding access to credit and financial services everywhere . 
Achieving these milestones presupposes greater global cooperation . 
A world that is bound closely together must be a world that works closely together if it is to prosper together . 
There is simply no other choice . 
We are multiple players , but we are engaged in a single game - a game that must be cooperative , not simply competitive . 
In such a world , multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund play a vital role in boosting economic cooperation . 
The year 2013 offers the chance to put the economic crisis behind us and to shape the world for the better . 
The IMF will support them in building a fairer and more prosperous future .
