The Great Bank Debate 
OXFORD - Christine Lagarde , the International Monetary Fund &apos;s managing director , recently said of the unfinished agenda for global financial-sector reform : &quot; To start , we need concrete progress with the too-important-to-fail conundrum . 
We need a global-level discussion of the pros and cons of direct restrictions on business models . &quot; 
Five years on from the start of the crisis , with the publication of the Liikanen report on European Union banking reform , that debate has finally begun . 
The Liikanen proposals have much in common with those made in 2011 by the United Kingdom &apos;s Independent Commission on Banking ( ICB ) , which I chaired . 
Both sets of recommendations stress the importance of an interlocking package of measures that combine much greater loss-absorbency with structural reform . 
And both make the same economic case for such reforms : to insulate basic banking services from investment banking risks ; to make resolution easier and thus more credible ; to shield taxpayers from risks that belong in the private sector ; and hence to ensure that banks &quot; risk-taking is subject to adequate market discipline . 
Moreover , both Liikanen and the ICB favor structured universal banking - legally separate entities with separate capital , management , and so forth - rather than calling for its demise , as urged by those who want to split commercial from investment banking fully . 
For large banks , Liikanen would separate trading from deposit banking , while the ICB &apos;s proposals , which are now incorporated in draft legislation in Britain , would ring-fence retail banking . 
This by itself is a distinction without a difference . 
After all , a fence to protect the deer from the lions is the same as a fence to keep the lions away from the deer . 
Unlike their cousin the Volcker Rule , neither Liikanen nor the UK approach attempts to draw a line between types of trading . 
Judging whether trading is proprietary might not quite require &quot; windows into men &apos;s souls &quot; ( which in another context Queen Elizabeth I wisely avoided ) , but America &apos;s experience shows that it is difficult all the same . 
Still , the Liikanen and UK designs are not identical . 
Nor should they be . 
The UK has a much larger banking system relative to its economy &apos;s size than does Europe as a whole - let alone the United States . 
The UK &apos;s system is exposed to different risks , which it is in Europe &apos;s interest to have well managed . 
Moreover , Liikanen is not a one-size-fits-all approach , as it explicitly proposes powers to require wider separation , if needed , to ensure resolvability . 
One clear difference , though , is that Liikanen , unlike the UK proposals , allows securities underwriting in deposit banks . 
This contrasts with the US , even after the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act &apos;s ban on affiliation between banks and companies engaged principally in underwriting securities . 
And it sits oddly with separating trading and derivatives from deposit banking , since underwriting is akin to selling a large put option , and typically riskier than normal market-making . 
With underwriting on the trading side of the fence , the deposit bank could still supply the service to customers , but as a broker , not as a dealer . 
Underwriting belongs with the lions . 
Aside from its implementation difficulties , there are good reasons not to introduce the Volcker rule , rather than the ICB / Liikanen proposals , in the UK and Europe . 
First , it does not do enough to shield retail banking from investment-banking risks , of which only a small share relate to proprietary trading . 
Second , the US has a very different banking system to begin with , including various regulations on how depository institutions can relate to affiliated trading entities . 
This suggests that a better question is whether to introduce the Volcker rule in addition to , rather than instead of , ring-fencing . 
In the interest of simplicity , I would say no . 
Enforcing total separation instead of ring-fencing would provide a stronger barrier , but at a potentially high cost , including a risk to financial stability . 
After all , full separation implies that resources from elsewhere in a given banking group are unavailable to address a retail-banking crisis resulting from , say , a slump in residential and commercial property prices . 
Such crises can happen . 
So the ICB concluded that its reform package for the UK would achieve the main aims of full separation at a lower cost , and without creating the risk to financial stability that could come from having undiversified , correlated , stand-alone domestic retail banking . 
To be sure , the success of this approach depends on the fence staying strong . 
That requires good initial design and constant regulatory vigilance , but so does full separation . 
Structural reform of banks does not solve all problems . 
But , at least for the UK and the rest of Europe , it is a key part of the overall reform package , along with much stronger capital and liquidity standards , loss-absorbent debt ( including &quot; bail-ins &quot; by creditors ) , real resolvability , and so on . 
Structural reform is also fundamental to the moves toward a European banking union , for a union with well-capitalized and safely structured banks has much better prospects than one without . 
Otherwise , mutualization of contingent liabilities could exacerbate the too-important-to-fail problem . 
Now that structural reform is explicitly on the agenda , the debate about European banking reform is entering a new phase . 
But , as the IMF has stressed , the debate needs to go beyond Europe . 
Moreover , it is more than a debate about public policy , because , in the post-crisis world , market incentives might point toward forms of separation between retail and investment banking . 
But market incentives surrounding various business models will remain distorted so long as taxpayers are liable for bank losses .
