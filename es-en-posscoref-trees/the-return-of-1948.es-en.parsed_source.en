The Return of 1948 
TEL AVIV - The forthcoming United Nation &apos;s conference commemorating the 60th anniversary of UNRWA ( The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ) could not come at a better moment . 
The restitution of lands occupied in 1967 will obviously continue to be indispensable to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , but it is the legacy of the 1948 war that both parties to the conflict have now put at the center of the debate . 
Oddly , it was Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who , by requesting that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state , reopened the 1948 file . 
That demand brought the quest for peace back to its fundamentals , where the question of the refugees is bound to play a central role . 
Netanyahu &apos;s intention was essentially to force the Palestinians into admitting that the right of return of refugees applies only to the Palestinian state , not Israel . 
But the true significance of his demand lies in that it &apos;s being pronounced at a time when Prime Minister Salam Fayaad &apos;s policies are posing a genuine challenge to the Palestinian national movement to choose between an ethos of vindication and one of state building . 
Under Fayaad , the Palestinian Authority seems to be superseding the Palestinian national movement &apos;s diaspora-based emphasis in favor of state-building within the territorial confines of the occupied territories . 
It is as if the voice of the diaspora were being silenced in Palestine . 
Conspicuously , the recently elected PLO Executive Committee - which in the past consisted exclusively of representatives of the Palestinian Diaspora - now has only one member from the diaspora , a delegate from Lebanon . 
This could mark a sea change in the evolution of Palestinian nationalism . 
In Zionism , the Jewish community in Palestine was the focus of decision making , with the Jewish Diaspora a strategic back-up . 
But the situation was reversed in the case of the Palestinians : the ethos of the diaspora , with the plight of the refugees at its center , has been the beating heart of the Palestinian cause and the focus of decision making for the national movement . 
As a result , the Palestinian community in the occupied territories was always subservient to the primacy of the Palestinian Diaspora . 
When it sought to assume a leading role - during the first Intifada in 1987 , for example , its effort was suppressed by the diaspora-based PLO . 
Fayaadism , by contrast , seeks the &quot; Zionization &quot; of the Palestinian national movement . 
It imbues the Palestinian cause with a positive ethos of nation- and state-building by superseding Palestinian nationalism &apos;s diaspora-centered preoccupations - and thereby transcending the paralyzing obsession with a never-fulfilled vindication of rights and justice . 
In the peace process as it has been conducted up to now , the Israelis always wanted to concentrate on the issues of 1967 - that is , land and security . 
The Palestinians , however , always wanted to return to the issues of 1948 : refugees , dispersion , and what Akram Hanya , a close Arafat confidant , defined as the need &quot; to make the Israelis face the tribunal of history . &quot; 
It looks as if now the roles have been inversed . 
Precisely when Israel managed to domesticate the Palestinian national movement by forcing it to abandon its revolutionary path in favor of state-building and economic development - a reorientation undertaken by Zionism as well - the Israelis decided to draw the Palestinians back to the fundamentals of the conflict . 
Indeed , despite of the rise of Fayaadism , the Palestinian national movement will be careful not to betray its real sources of legitimacy : the ethos of dispossession and the refugee . 
The decisions taken at the last Fatah Convention were explicit in calling for the refugees to &quot; return to their homes and cities . &quot; 
The Palestinians are attempting to hold the stick at both ends , claiming before the world their endorsement of the two-state solution while calling for the right of return at the same time . 
Any sober Palestinian leadership must know by now that the rhetorical promise of a return to an abandoned house and to the olive tree is an irresponsible mirage that fundamentally contradicts the rationale for a separate Palestinian state . 
Peace is frequently not about justice but about stability . 
The Palestinians must align their national conversation with what is realizable , while Israel must resolve its own contradictions and address the refugee problem in a way that secures the legitimacy and durability of a future peace agreement with the Palestinians . 
Because Israel will have to implement practical measures of resettlement and compensation that will not be based on an automatic right of physical return , a symbol of genuine moral compensation is also called for . 
Instead of suppressing the memory of the refugees , Israel needs to recognize that in 1948 the land was bisected by the sword , and that the Jewish state came into being partly because of the massive uprooting and dispossession of Palestinian communities . 
Israel should develop enough self-confidence in its solidity as a nation to integrate into its schools &quot; curriculum the tragedy of the Palestinian Naqbah . 
The resolution of conflicts of this nature requires the recovery of historical memory and a proper hearing of the two parties &quot; historical narratives , perhaps through the creation of Truth and Reconciliation Committees . 
Israel &apos;s consolation would be that the Palestinians , too , will have to come to terms with their share of responsibility for the calamities that have befallen them . 
Only an acceptable deal on the refugees can definitely close the 1948 file - and only then can the conflict in Palestine end .
