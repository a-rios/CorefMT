Houses in the Air 
Over the past six months , attention and worry have shifted from America &apos;s enormous trade deficit to its surging property markets and real-estate bubble . 
At least two of the reasons for high - and rising - home prices in the United States are well understood . 
What remains highly uncertain , however , is whether an obviously overheating market can be cooled without sending America , and its main trading partners around the world , into an economic tailspin . 
The US housing boom is due , first , to low interest rates , which mean that large amounts of money can be borrowed for mortgages with moderate monthly payments . 
Low interest rates strengthen the ability to pay , and thus boost demand . 
And , with demand high and housing supply fixed - at least in the short run - prices go up . 
Second , the 70-year period that began with the widespread diffusion of the automobile -during which one could get nearly anywhere in a typical metropolitan area in half an hour or less - is over . 
Before there was widespread automobile ownership , land prices depended on location , and proximity to the central city or to the local railroad station carried a premium . 
Now , with serious congestion slowing traffic in major cities to a crawl , the land gradient in housing prices is steep once again . 
Perhaps this steepening of the location gradient could be delayed for a decade if we were willing to shift to denser residential patterns . 
We could , for example , tear down San Francisco &apos;s row houses and replace them with buildings more like those of New York &apos;s Upper West Side . 
These two factors - low mortgage rates , and the fact that the country has filled up so much that our cars no longer marginalize location costs - go a long way toward explaining the surge in housing prices over the past decade or so . 
But they don &apos;t go all the way . 
On top of these two powerful fundamental factors sits a bubble . 
Both groups &quot; demand is inherently ephemeral . 
When the first group discovers that housing prices don &apos;t always go up , they will try to dump their properties . 
And when the second group discovers that interest rates don &apos;t always stay low , many of them will be unable to meet their higher mortgage payments and will likewise try to dump their properties . 
But if it does , it will probably be due to a sharp rise in interest rates . 
This could happen for two reasons . 
First , investors , recognizing that the dollar is overvalued and that they are likely to suffer large losses when it returns to its fundamental value , could start selling their Treasury bonds , corporate bonds , and mortgage-backed securities . 
As the prices of these assets fall , their yields will rise . 
At some point , the yields on bonds and mortgages will be high enough that investors &quot; appetite for yield will balance their fear of exchange-rate depreciation . 
In the corridors around my office , all the economists agree that this factor should have pushed US interest rates up three years ago . 
But so far it has not . 
Does this mean that a hurricane could hit world financial markets at any moment ? 
Yes . 
Or it could also mean that economists &quot; baseline model of the international economy - especially the assumption of &quot; uncovered interest parity , &quot; which holds that foreign interest income expressed in the domestic currency should equal the domestic interest rate - is simply wrong . 
The second factor that could push US interest rates sharply upward is not fear of a decline in the future value of the dollar , but the fact of a past decline in its value . 
The US imports the equivalent of 16 % of its GDP . 
A 40 % fall in the value of the dollar - of which half passes through to increased dollar prices of imports - thus implies a 3.2 % rise in the overall price level . 
A Federal Reserve committed to effective price stability will likely raise interest rates rather than allow any year &apos;s inflation rate to jump from 3 % to 6 % . 
If there is a sharp spike in interest rates - caused either by capital flight in anticipation of a dollar decline or by tight monetary policy in reaction to a dollar decline comes to pass - we will see how good the Federal Reserve really is . 
If interest rates rise too far , then the collapse in housing values will lead to large-scale foreclosures and a collapse in consumption spending as well . 
This would mean a depression not just for the US , but for Asia and probably Europe as well , for the US can remain the world &apos;s importer of last resort and guarantor of effective demand only as long as its domestic consumption is strong . 
But if interest rates don &apos;t rise far enough , the value of the dollar will spiral downward and US inflation will spiral upward like in the 1970 &quot; s , setting the stage for the type of extremely painful measures imposed by then Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker . 
In these circumstances , straight is the gait and narrow is the path that the Federal Reserve will have to walk - hardly an enviable position . 
And yet journalists - not very experienced reporters , to be sure - ask me who is likely to get the &quot; plum job &quot; of Fed Chair next year .
