The Tragedy of the Climate Commons 
PORTSMOUTH - By now , the danger from climate change and other forms of environmental degradation is so evident that it seems crazy to ignore it . 
And yet the world has failed thus far to devise an adequate response to the problem . 
Our first stab at a solution , the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , set only modest goals and failed to include the world &apos;s biggest polluters . 
The effort in Copenhagen in 2009 to craft a more potent global agreement ended in a breakdown of negotiations . 
Our collective failure to take action is not the result of having chosen leaders who are insane or irrational . 
The reason we seem incapable of coming together to protect the climate is known as the &quot; tragedy of the commons &quot; : a shared resource tends to be rapidly depleted because no single actor - whether a country or a person - considers how their actions affect other users . 
In other words , because you reap all of the benefits , but suffer only part of the costs , you are tempted to over-exploit the resource . 
And , so far , there is little reason to believe that we are on track to find a way to ensure a happier ending . 
The soon-to-be-endangered Atlantic bluefin tuna is one example . 
We have a shared interest in preventing the species from being fished to extinction . 
And yet individual fishermen have little reason not to catch as many tuna as possible , as any animal that escapes their net will likely end up in another &apos;s . 
A similar logic applies to countries considering fishing quotas ; as a result , bluefin stocks are running low . 
One approach to ending the tragedy of the commons was devised some 50 years ago by the economist Ronald Coase . 
With private ownership established , market mechanisms could restore efficiency . 
Such a solution might work for fish , provided that migrating populations could be tracked ; but it is far harder to apply it to something like the climate . 
How , after all , would one assign property rights to atmospheric composition ? 
The alternative approach - embodied by the Kyoto Protocol - is to implement quotas limiting individual actors &quot; permissible greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Only then is a market created to allow actors to buy the emissions permits they need and sell those they do not use . 
In theory , this approach provides an incentive for the participants to cooperate , as the arrangement &apos;s breakdown would accelerate the depletion that all have agreed to avoid . 
In practice , however , these types of deals are difficult to conclude and often are violated . 
For starters , domestic politics can pose an obstacle to participation in international treaties , especially when policymakers facing re-election are dependent on the support of interest groups with goals that run counter to the public &apos;s welfare . 
Decisions made during US President George W. Bush &apos;s two terms in office offer an illuminating contrast . 
In 2001 , during his first 100 days in office , Bush blocked or overturned many laws and regulations protecting the environment , and he put a definitive end to American participation in the Kyoto Protocol . 
The mining and oil industries - important sources of support for his next presidential election campaign - had gotten their money &apos;s worth . 
Once Bush &apos;s re-election was secured , however , he had less incentive to seek the support of these powerful lobbies . 
During his second term , Bush created the world &apos;s largest ocean preserve - a 360,000-square-kilometer area around the Hawaiian Islands . 
Because Bush was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term , the way was opened for more environmentally friendly policies . 
Another impediment to cooperation is geopolitical . 
If conflict over valuable resources is unavoidable , as examples throughout history suggest , there is little reason for a country not to exploit a given resource to the maximum possible extent prior to the emergence of scarcities . 
To the extent that countries believe that resource-based conflict is inevitable in the future , negotiations to limit resource depletion become more likely to break down in the short run . 
Of the two obstacles , domestic interest-group politics is the more easily surmountable . 
Over the past two centuries , political leaders have become more accountable to constituencies within and outside of their countries &quot; borders , and voters have become less susceptible to lobbying groups and the media . 
Further education of the electorate may be the key to speeding up this process . 
The geopolitical concerns are more difficult to address . 
The challenge of persuading countries to cooperate is similar to the one governments have always faced in inducing their citizens to contribute to the common good ; everyone benefits from good roads , but most people would prefer not to contribute to the cost of their construction . 
According to the American economist Mancur Olson , these types of cooperation problems are easier to solve when there are as few decision-makers as possible . 
Within a country , the problem is overcome by providing governments with the coercive capacity to collect taxes , redistribute public goods , and mediate conflicts between citizens . 
By extension , one solution to the global problem would be for all of humanity to be ruled by a universal government , accountable to its constituents , and endowed with the authority to enforce its decisions . 
Such a scenario is of course extremely unlikely ; nation-states will never agree to hand over their sovereignty to a world government . 
In the absence of alternatives , the best solution , it seems , would be a reduction in the number of actors - a return to a bipolar world in which two superpowers decide for themselves and their subordinates . 
But , while this solution would contain the problem of the commons , the dangers could outweigh the benefits . 
Last time , international cooperation was underpinned by fear of blowing up the planet . 
Now , too , fears of mutually assured destruction could re-emerge .
