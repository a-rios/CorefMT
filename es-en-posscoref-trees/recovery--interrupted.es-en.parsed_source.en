Recovery , Interrupted 
NEW YORK - Since the 2008-2009 slump lifted in mid-2009 - and especially following the exposure of the massive public-debt problems in Greece , Ireland , and elsewhere in Europe - most G-7 governments have reversed their earlier counter-recessionary positions . 
With the important exception of the United States , G-7 leaders have been pushing since mid-2010 for urgent fiscal consolidation , effectively overturning their earlier recovery efforts , and urging austerity measures to balance their budgets , despite the weakness , unevenness , and uncertainty of the economic upturn . 
Austerity-based fiscal consolidation is likely to fail , because sustainable public budgets are best achieved on the basis of strong economic growth . 
Indeed , the logic of fiscal consolidation requires those economies that have recovered strongly to phase out their recovery efforts , while those that have not continue such efforts . 
The virtual abandonment of recovery efforts in most developed economies presumes that stronger Asian economic growth outside Japan can lift the world economy from its current trajectory . 
However , even continued strong performance by Asia &apos;s emerging markets is unlikely to be enough to secure a strong global recovery . 
In fact , the likely renewed slowdowns in the G-7 economies will jeopardize growth in emerging markets as well . 
This prospect has been ignored , despite warnings by the International Monetary Fund , the United Nations , and others . 
Moreover , the shift from recovery efforts to fiscal consolidation and , more recently , to current-account rebalancing , has undermined the initial G-20-led coordinated recovery efforts . 
Instead , finger-pointing grew more widespread in 2010 , impeding policy coordination and cooperation - the very sources of the G-20 &quot; s earlier success . 
The outcome of early November &apos;s US mid-term elections has effectively denied the Obama administration the option of fiscal expansion . 
Instead , the US Federal Reserve has turned to a second round of &quot; quantitative easing . &quot; 
Rather , it will increase banks &quot; excess-reserve balances . 
Critics suggest that QE2 is really intended only to create inflationary expectations and thus encourage acquisition of more risky assets by reducing rates on Treasury bills with longer-term maturities ( 5-7 years and 7-10 years ) . 
Many observers consider QE2 a blunt instrument that is unlikely to achieve its objectives , although it may weaken the dollar , which many think will redress recurrent US trade deficits . 
Indeed , after an initial dip , the dollar started to strengthen again , later reinforced by the return of euro risk . 
After making limited progress on encouraging faster renminbi appreciation , the US has tried to limit current-account surpluses , with China the main target . 
Understandably , China has resisted , probably mindful of the post-1985 yen appreciation &apos;s association with the end of Japan &apos;s four-decade-long post-war boom . 
The UN and others have long drawn attention to global imbalances . 
However , these imbalances did not trigger the crisis alone , and reducing them certainly is not the most urgent priority , given the prospect of protracted stagnation in most of the G-7 and its likely adverse consequences for the world economy . 
The US enjoys a privileged role in the international monetary system as issuer of the world &apos;s de facto reserve currency . 
Hence , the US current-account deficit cannot be addressed without dealing with related problems : first , the lack of a proper international reserve-currency arrangement , and , second , the perceived need of emerging-market economies with liberalized capital accounts to accumulate reserves for protection against volatile capital flows . 
These issues can be addressed only through systemic reform over the medium term , while the recovery effort should remain the global priority in the near term . 
Meanwhile , agreeing on Basel 3 banking standards in just two years is commendable , especially as Basel 2 took a decade to negotiate . 
However , Basel 3 only indirectly addresses the &quot; shadow banking system , &quot; despite its role in triggering the crisis and the future threats it poses for financial stability . 
More worryingly , Basel 3 retains , if not deepens , biases in the Basel 2 rules against bank lending to developing countries , such as for trade finance . 
With the G-7 struggling and emerging-market countries expected to support , if not lead , global recovery , that is an astonishingly short-sighted decision .
