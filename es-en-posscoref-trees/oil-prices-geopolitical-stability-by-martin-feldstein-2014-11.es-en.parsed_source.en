The Geopolitical Impact of Cheap Oil 
CAMBRIDGE - The price of oil has fallen more than 25 % in the past five months , to less than $ 80 a barrel . 
If the price remains at this level , it will have important implications - some good , some bad - for many countries around the world . 
If it falls further , as seems likely , the geopolitical consequences on some oil-producing countries could be dramatic . 
The price of oil at any time depends on market participants &quot; expectations about future supply and demand . 
The role of expectations makes the oil market very different from most others . 
In the market for fresh vegetables , for example , prices must balance the supply and demand for the current harvest . 
By contrast , oil producers and others in the industry can keep supply off the market if they think that its price will rise later , or they can put extra supply on the market if they think the price will fall . 
Oil companies around the world keep supply off the market by reducing the amount of oil that they take out of the ground . 
Conversely , producers can put more oil on the market by increasing production or by running down their inventories . 
The market expectations reflected in today &apos;s price reflect lower future demand and increased future supply . 
Lower demand reflects both the current weakness of economic activity , particularly in Europe and China , and , more important , the longer-term changes in technology , which will increase cars &quot; fuel efficiency and induce the use of solar power and other non-oil energy sources . 
The increase in the future potential supply of oil reflects new output produced by fracking , the development of Canada &apos;s tar sands , and Mexico &apos;s recent decision to allow foreign oil companies to develop the country &apos;s energy sources . 
These changes in demand and supply suggest that the future price of oil will be lower than industry participants expected until just a few months ago . 
Some of the recent changes in expected future demand and supply could have been anticipated earlier . 
The historic volatility of oil prices reflects these psychological shifts as well as changes in objective reality . 
Today &apos;s oil price is also linked to anticipated future interest rates . 
More specifically , oil producers have an investment choice : They can increase production now , selling the additional oil at today &apos;s price and investing the proceeds at the existing long-term interest rate , or they can leave the oil in the ground as an investment . 
A low rate of interest encourages producers to leave oil in the ground . 
When the current abnormally low interest rates on long-term bonds rise over the next few years , it will become more attractive for producers to increase the supply of oil and invest the resulting income at the higher rate . 
Unless expectations about the fundamentals of future supply and demand change , the rise in the interest rate will cause oil prices to fall further . 
The low price of oil is good news for the United States economy , because it implies higher real incomes for American consumers . 
Within the US , the lower price is transferring real income from oil producers to households , which raises short-term demand because households spend a higher proportion of their incomes than oil firms do . 
For the same reason , the lower price also gives a boost to aggregate demand in Europe , Asia , and other oil-importing regions . 
The big losers from falling oil prices include several countries that are not friends of the US and its allies , such as Venezuela , Iran , and Russia . 
These countries are heavily dependent on their oil revenue to support their governments &quot; spending - especially massive transfer programs . 
Even at $ 75 or $ 80 a barrel , these governments will have a difficult time financing the populist programs that they need to maintain public support . 
Although Saudi Arabia and several of the Gulf states are also major oil exporters , they differ from other producers in two important ways . 
First , their cost of extracting oil is extremely low , which means that they will be able to produce profitably at the current price - or even at a much lower price . 
Second , their enormous financial reserves allow them to finance their domestic and international activities for an extended period of time , as they seek to transform their economies to reduce their dependence on oil revenue . 
A further decline in the price of oil could have major geopolitical repercussions . 
President Vladimir Putin would no longer be able to maintain the transfer programs that currently sustain his popular support . 
There would be similar consequences in Iran and Venezuela . 
It is not clear whether these countries &quot; current regimes could survive a substantial and sustained future decline in oil prices . 
By contrast , it is obvious that oil-importing countries would benefit greatly - as they already are .
