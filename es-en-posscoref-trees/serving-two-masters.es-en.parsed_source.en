Serving Two Masters 
Talk about corruption in developing countries  -  and in some developed ones  -  is running rampant . 
In the past , corruption was usually said to be located within the ranks of public servants , and this was used as a partial justification for privatization , especially in developing countries . 
Cheerleaders of the private sector , however , failed to reckon with the ability of company bosses to indulge in corrupt practices on an almost unfathomable scale , something American corporate capitalism has demonstrated amply of late . 
Corrupt bosses put to shame petty government bureaucrats who steal a measly few thousand dollars  -  even a few million . 
The scale of theft achieved by those who ransacked Enron , Worldcom , and other corporations is in the billions of dollars , greater than the GDP of many countries . 
My research over the past thirty years focused on the economics of information . 
With perfect information  -  an assumption made by traditional economics , though one not fully appreciated by free market advocates  -  these problems would never have occurred . 
Shareholders would instantly realize that the books were cooked , and roundly punish the offending company &apos;s share price . 
But information is never perfect . 
Because of tax advantages and inappropriate accounting practices firms richly rewarded executives with stock options . 
With these in hand , company bosses could ensure that they were well paid without doing anything to benefit their company &apos;s bottom line . 
All they needed to do was boost the stock price , then cash in their option . 
It was a system almost too good to be true : while executives received millions in compensation , no one seemed to be bearing the cost . 
Of course , this was a mirage : by issuing such options shareholder value was diluted . 
Moreover , this was worse than dishonest : stock options provided managers with strong incentives to get the value of their stocks up fast . 
What mattered was not a company &apos;s long-term strength but its short-term appearance . 
Corporate officers respond to incentives and opportunities . 
Over the last decade-and-a-half , executive compensation in America soared . 
So , too , did the fraction of that compensation that is tied to a company &apos;s stock price , to the point where the fraction related to long-term performance is quite small . 
It was as if managers were actively discouraged from looking at fundamentals . 
The proponents of markets are right that incentives matter , but inappropriate incentives do not create real wealth in the economy , only a massive misallocation of resources of the sort we see now in such industries as telecoms . 
Overinflated prices lead firms to overinvest . 
As research over the past three decades demonstrates , when information is imperfect  -  as it always is !  -  Adam Smith &apos;s invisible hand , by which the price system is supposed to guide the economy to efficient outcomes , is invisible in part because it is absent . 
With the wrong incentives , with the kinds of incentives that were in place in corporate America , a drive for the creation of the appearance of wealth took hold , at the cost of actual wealth . 
By the same token , auditing firms that make more money from consulting than from providing auditing services have a conflict of interest : they have ( at least in the short run ) an incentive to go easy on their clients , or even , as consultants , to help their clients think of ways - &quot; within the rules , &quot; of course  -  that improve the appearance of profits . 
Or analysts at investment banks that earn large fees from stock offerings may  -  as we have seen not so long ago  -  tout stocks even when they are dubious about them . 
If these banks also have a commercial bank division , they may have an incentive to maintain credit lines beyond a prudent level , because to cut such lines would put at risk high potential future revenues from mergers and acquisitions and stock and bond issues . 
Moreover , a distortion of private incentives affects public incentives as well , and the two become intertwined . 
As &quot; money talks &quot; in politics , private incentives distort public policy and prevent it from correcting market failures in ways that , in turn , further distort private incentives . 
America &apos;s Securities and Exchange Commission &apos;s head recognized the problems posed by conflicts of interests in accounting , but his efforts to put in place rules to address the problem met with overwhelming resistance from the industry - until the scandals made change irresistible . 
Similarly , the accounting problems with executive stock options were recognized by the Financial Accounting Standards Board , but again early efforts at reform met with resistance , from the obvious sources . 
Here , political pressure , including from the US Treasury , was put on the supposedly independent Board not to make the change . 
These problems arise at both the national and international levels . 
Some countries try to fight against this vicious circle . 
For example , because we rightly suspect government officials who move too quickly into private sector jobs related to their public roles , many democracies have rules against such &quot; revolving doors . &quot; 
To be sure , there are costs in imposing such restrictions  -  they may , for example , deter qualified individuals from accepting public employment  -  and the restrictions seldom eliminate conflicts of interest altogether . 
But restrictions of this kind - affecting both private and public sectors  -  are often necessary because of imperfect information : we cannot really be sure what motivates an individual , even if the individual seems of the highest integrity . 
The loss of public confidence that may result from not acting may be even higher than the cost of governmental regulation  -  indeed , this loss recently resulted in billions of dollars of reductions in the value of shares . 
Conflicts of interest will never be eliminated , either in the public or private sector . 
But by making ourselves more sensitive to their presence and becoming aware of the distorted incentives to which they give rise , as well as by imposing regulations that limit their scope and increasing the amount of required disclosure , we can mitigate their consequences , both in the public and the private sector .
