Small Farms &quot; Large Benefits 
ROME - As drought becomes increasingly common , farmers worldwide are struggling to maintain crop yields . 
In the United States , farmers are experiencing the most severe drought in more than a half-century . 
As a result , global corn , wheat , and soybean prices rose in July and August , and remain high . 
But the severe dry spell parching croplands across the US is only the latest in a global cycle of increasingly frequent and damaging droughts . 
In Africa &apos;s Sahel region , millions of people are facing hunger for the third time since 2005 . 
Lack of rain in the region and volatile global food prices have made a bad situation worse . 
Indeed , it is the world &apos;s poor - particularly those in rural areas - that suffer the most from these combined factors . 
This does not bode well for our future . 
By 2050 , global food production will have to increase by 60 % to meet demand from a growing world population with changing consumption habits . 
To ensure food security for all , we will have to increase not just food production , but also availability , especially for those living in developing countries . 
That means breaking down barriers and inequalities , building capacity , and disseminating knowledge . 
In Africa , smallholder farmers - who provide 80 % of the sub-Saharan region &apos;s food - need infrastructure for agricultural development , including irrigation and roads , as well as better market organization and access to technology . 
The International Fund for Agricultural Development sees enormous potential in Africa &apos;s agricultural sector , which experienced 4.8 % growth in 2009 , compared to 3.8 % in the Asia-Pacific region and only 1.4 % in Latin America and the Caribbean . 
Given that agriculture amounts to roughly 30 % of sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s GDP , and accounts for more than 60 % of employment in most African countries , the sector &apos;s development could reduce poverty in the region substantially . 
Not only in Africa - in countries like Burkina Faso and Ethiopia - but also in emerging countries like China , India , and Vietnam , experience has repeatedly shown that smallholder farmers can lead agricultural growth while stimulating broader economic development . 
Small farmers , both women and men , are Africa &apos;s biggest agricultural investors . 
And agriculture-driven GDP growth is more than twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth in other sectors . 
But African farmers encounter significant barriers to achieving their potential . 
On average , they apply less than 10 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare , compared to 140 kilograms in India . 
Furthermore , less than 5 % of agricultural land is irrigated , and improved crop varieties are rarely used . 
Agricultural development efforts should , therefore , focus on promoting the growth and sustainability of smallholder farmers and small rural businesses . 
This requires a more supportive regulatory environment , technical assistance , as well as connections to suppliers , distributors , and finance providers . 
Countries that are experiencing significant agricultural growth , such as Brazil and Thailand , have benefited from public-sector investment in research and infrastructure development . 
We should consider not only how to improve the ability of smallholder farmers to grow food ; we also must strengthen their ability to participate in markets , while improving the way those markets function . 
Moreover , sustainable investment linkages between smallholder farmers and the private sector are needed . 
By enabling farmers to increase their output and incomes , smallholder-inclusive private investment can bolster economic growth and food security . 
Finally , farmers &quot; organizations , which are crucial intermediaries between producers and corporate investors , must be involved in the formulation of plans and policies aimed at agricultural development . 
A vibrant rural sector can generate demand for locally produced goods and services , thereby stimulating sustainable employment growth in agro-processing , services , and small-scale manufacturing . 
Such opportunities would allow young people to thrive in their rural communities , rather than being forced to search for work in urban areas . 
Africa can feed itself . 
But that is not all : With knowledge , technology , infrastructure , and enabling policies , smallholder farmers in Africa and elsewhere can drive sustainable agricultural development , contribute to global food security , and catalyze economic growth worldwide .
