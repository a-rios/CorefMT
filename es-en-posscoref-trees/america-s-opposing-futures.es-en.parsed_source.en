America &apos;s Opposing Futures 
I recently learned something interesting : American international finance economists and American domestically oriented macroeconomists have very different - indeed , opposing - views of the likely consequences of America &apos;s huge current-account deficit . 
Domestically oriented macroeconomists , by contrast , see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis , but as an opportunity to accelerate growth . 
Domestically oriented macroeconomists look at the situation roughly like this : at some point in the future , foreign central banks will become less willing to continue buying massive amounts of dollar-denominated securities in order to prop up the greenback . 
When they cease their large-scale dollar-purchase programs , the value of the dollar will fall - and it will fall hard . 
But , according to this view , as the dollar &apos;s value declines , US exports will become more attractive to foreigners and American employment will rise , with labor re-allocated to the newly-vibrant export sector . 
It will be like what happened in Britain after it abandoned its exchange-rate peg and allowed the pound to depreciate relative to the Deutschmark , or what happened in the US in the late 1980 &quot; s , when the dollar depreciated against the pound , the Deutschmark , and - most importantly - the Japanese yen . 
International finance economists see a far bleaker future . 
They see the end of large-scale dollar-purchase programs by central banks leading not only to a decline in the dollar , but also to a spike in US long-term interest rates , which will curb consumption spending immediately and throttle investment spending after only a short lag . 
To be sure , international finance economists also see US exports benefiting as the value of the dollar declines , but the lags in demand are such that the export boost will come a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending . 
Eight to ten million people will have to shift employment from services and construction into exports and import-competing goods , implying that structural unemployment will rise . 
Moreover , there may be a financial panic : large financial institutions with short-term liabilities and long-term assets will have a difficult time weathering a large rise in long-term dollar-denominated interest rates . 
This mismatch can cause financial stress and bankruptcy just as easily as banks &quot; local-currency assets and dollar liabilities caused stress and bankruptcy in the Mexican and East Asian crises of the 1990 &quot; s and in the Argentinean crisis of this decade . 
When international finance economists sketch this scenario , domestically oriented macroeconomists respond that it sounds like a case of incompetent monetary policy . 
Why should the Federal Reserve allow long-term interest rates to spike just because other central banks have ceased their dollar-purchase programs ? 
Should not the Fed step in and replace them with its own purchases of long-term US Treasury bonds , thereby keeping long-term interest rates at a level conducive to full employment ? 
To this , international finance economists respond that the Fed does not have the power to do so . 
When forced to choose between full employment and price stability , the international finance economists say that the Fed will choose price stability , because its institutional memory of the 1970 &quot; s , when inflation ran rampant , remains very strong . 
Therefore , since a fall in the value of the dollar raises import prices , and thus functions as a negative shock to the supply side of the economy , the Fed will have to raise , not lower , interest rates , and sell , not buy , bonds . 
Serious economists whom I respect enormously find themselves taking strong positions on opposite sides of this debate . 
I &apos;m not wise enough to say which side is right , but I certainly know which side I hope is wrong .
