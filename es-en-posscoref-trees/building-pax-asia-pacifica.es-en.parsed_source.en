Building Pax Asia-Pacifica 
MANILA - One of the main sources of tension in Asia nowadays are the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea , where the Philippines , Vietnam , China , and others have conflicting claims . 
In Chinese media reports , the heightened &quot; unfriendliness &quot; in the region has allegedly arisen from &quot; bad rumors and speculations &quot; on the part of Filipino commentators . 
But the reality is starker : the intrusions by Chinese aircraft into Filipino airspace in May ; 
Will armed conflict result from these recurring - and , it seems , escalating - disputes between the Philippines and Vietnam on one side , and China on the other ? 
War , of course , is in no one &apos;s interest . 
But the risk posed by these disputes is growing , because China &apos;s relations with both the Philippines and Vietnam are at their lowest point in decades . 
Given these tensions , it is no surprise that the issue of disputed sovereignty in the South China Sea is almost certain to claim center stage at this month &apos;s ASEAN Regional Forum , and at the East Asia summit in Bali that will follow it . 
Last June , I gave the keynote speech at the celebrations marking the 36th anniversary of the establishment of Philippines-China diplomatic relations and the 10th anniversary of Philippines-China &quot; Friendship Day &quot; in the presence of 5,000 of my countrymen and a smattering of Chinese officials . 
Yet on that same day , the headlines in Chinese papers were blasting the Philippines for its historic claim to ownership of the Spratly Islands . 
Of course , the governments of both countries recognize the need to maintain the stability and cooperation that have made East Asia the world &apos;s fastest growing region . 
The same is true of Vietnam &apos;s government and that of the United States . 
But there is no institutionalized means to discuss and resolve the dispute , which is taking on greater significance almost daily , owing to the belief that vast mineral and energy resources lay on the sea bed around the Spratlys . 
Now is the time for China , the Philippines , Vietnam , other claimants , and the US to take action to begin to diminish these tensions . 
What is needed , above all , is a covenant among the leaders of the Asia / Pacific region that will make peaceful dispute resolution binding on all stakeholders , big or small . 
Only such a pledge can provide the type of certainty that investors - any investors - will need if the Spratly resources are to be developed . 
Certainly , China &apos;s leaders talk as if this is their goal . 
In April , at this year &apos;s Boao Forum ( the Asian Davos ) on Hainan Island , Chinese President Hu Jintao asserted : &quot; Peace and development remain the overriding themes of the times . 
The world needs peace , countries deserve development , and people want cooperation .... China will always be a good neighbor , good friend , and good partner of other Asian countries . &quot; 
It is past time to make those sentiments a reality ; more than a pledge to resolve disputes peacefully is needed . 
Asia &apos;s governments must also begin to adhere to a far more expansive idea of open regionalism , which means that countries like India should have a voice in Asia / Pacific affairs , and they must respect the Asian interests of countries beyond the region . 
The US , for example , should be made welcome to participate - or continue to participate - in peacekeeping and security cooperation . 
But how is Asia to reach consensus on this point ? 
Ever since 1994 , when Vietnam &apos;s President Le Duc Anh held the presidency of ASEAN , I have proposed to ASEAN leaders that the Spratlys be demilitarized as a first step toward building trust . 
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) and associated international commitments must become the basis for productive dialogues leading to binding covenants . 
Joint exploration and development of the resources within and beneath the archipelago could then begin . 
More broadly , the urgent task for Asian statesmen over the next 5-10 years will be to replace the region &apos;s Pax Americana , which has guaranteed regional stability for decades , with a more comprehensive Pax Asia-Pacifica that is built on inclusiveness and burden-sharing . 
But such an Asia-Pacific peace will be durable only if it is based on a balance of mutual benefits rather than on the balance of power . 
Clearly , this concept implies burden-sharing by all Asia-Pacific countries to ensure the region &apos;s harmony and security . 
Pax Asia-Pacifica &apos;s institutions will need to be built , as Europe &apos;s peace was built after World War II , on strong , cooperative undertakings among the most powerful countries and regional blocs - the US , China , Japan , India , South Korea , Russia , and the ASEAN 10 . 
The region &apos;s continued economic growth and progress require that we Asians contain our rivalries and avoid the arms buildups that , unfortunately , now seem to be underway .
