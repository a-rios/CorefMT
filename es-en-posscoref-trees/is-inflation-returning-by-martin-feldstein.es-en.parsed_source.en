Is Inflation Returning ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Inflation is now low in every industrial country , and the combination of high unemployment and slow GDP growth removes the usual sources of upward pressure on prices . 
Nevertheless , financial investors are increasingly worried that inflation will eventually begin to rise , owing to the large expansion of commercial bank reserves engineered by the United States Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) . 
Some investors , at least , remember that rising inflation typically follows monetary expansion , and they fear that this time will be no different . 
Investors have responded to these fears by buying gold , agricultural land , and other traditional inflation hedges . 
The price of gold recently reached a four-month high and is approaching $ 1,700 an ounce . 
Prices per acre of farmland in Iowa and Illinois rose more than 10 % over the past year . 
And the recent release of the US Federal Reserve Board &apos;s minutes , which indicate support for another round of quantitative easing , caused sharp jumps in the prices of gold , silver , platinum , and other metals . 
But , unlike private investors , Fed officials insist that this time really will be different . 
They note that the enormous expansion of commercial banks &quot; reserves has not led to a comparable increase in the supply of money and credit . 
While reserves increased at an annual rate of 22 % over the past three years , the broad monetary aggregate ( M2 ) that most closely tracks nominal GDP and inflation over long periods of time increased at less than 6 % over the same three years . 
In past decades , large expansions of bank reserves caused lending surges that increased the money supply and fueled inflationary spending growth . 
But now commercial banks are willing to hold their excess reserves at the Fed , because the Fed now pays interest on those deposits . 
The ECB also pays interest on deposits , so it , too , can in principle prevent higher reserves from leading to an unwanted lending explosion . 
The Fed &apos;s ability to pay interest is the key to what it calls its &quot; exit strategy &quot; from previous quantitative easing . 
When the economic recovery begins to accelerate , commercial banks will want to use the large volume of reserves that the Fed has created to make loans to businesses and consumers . 
If credit expands too rapidly , the Fed can raise the interest rate that it pays on deposits . 
Sufficiently high rates will induce commercial banks to prefer the Fed &apos;s combination of liquidity , safety , and yield to expanding the quantity of private lending . 
That , at any rate , is the theory ; no one knows how it would work in practice . 
How high would the Fed - or the ECB , for that matter - have to raise the interest rate on deposits to prevent excessive growth in bank lending ? 
What if that interest rate had to be 4 % or 6 % or even 8 % ? 
Would the Fed or the ECB push its deposit rate that high , or would it allow a rapid , potentially inflationary lending growth ? 
The unusual nature of current unemployment increases the risk of future inflation still further . 
Nearly half of the unemployed in the US , for example , have now been out of work for six months or longer , up from the traditional median unemployment duration of just 10 weeks . 
The long-term unemployed will be much slower to be hired as the economy recovers than those who have been out of work for a much shorter period of time . 
The risk , therefore , is that product markets will tighten while there is still high measured unemployment . 
Inflation will begin in product markets , rather than in the labor market . 
Businesses will want to borrow , and banks will want to expand their lending . 
Under these conditions , the Fed will want to raise the interest rate to prevent an acceleration of inflation . 
But , if the unemployment rate is then still relatively high - say , above 7 % - some members of the Fed &apos;s Open Market Committee may argue that the Fed &apos;s dual mandate - low unemployment as well as low inflation - implies that it is too soon to raise interest rates . 
There could also be strong pressure from the US Congress not to raise interest rates . 
Although the Fed &apos;s legal &quot; independence &quot; means that the White House cannot tell the Fed what to do , the Fed is fully accountable to Congress . 
The recent Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation took away some of the Fed &apos;s powers , and the legislative debate surrounding the bill indicated that there could be wide support for further restrictions if Congress becomes unhappy with Fed policy . 
Politicians &quot; desire to keep interest rates low in order to reduce unemployment is often in tension with the Fed &apos;s concern to act in a timely manner to maintain price stability . 
The large number of long-term unemployed may make the problem more difficult this time by causing the unemployment rate to remain high even when product markets are beginning to experience rising inflation . 
If that happens , Fed officials will face a difficult choice : tighten monetary policy to stem accelerating price growth , thereby antagonizing Congress and possibly facing restrictions that make it difficult to fight inflation in the future ; or do nothing . 
Either choice could mean a higher future rate of inflation , just as financial markets fear . 
Although the ECB does not have to deal with direct legislative oversight , it is now clear that there are members of its governing board who would oppose higher interest rates , and that there is political pressure from government leaders and finance ministers to keep rates low . 
Rising inflation is certainly not inevitable , but , in both the US and Europe , it has become a risk to be reckoned with .
