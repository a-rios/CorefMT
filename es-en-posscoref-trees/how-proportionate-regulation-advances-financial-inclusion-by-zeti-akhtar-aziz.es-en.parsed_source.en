Financial Inclusion Now 
KUALA LUMPUR - Making the financial system accessible to the world &apos;s poorest people can unlock their economic potential , improve their lives , and benefit the wider economy . So it is no surprise that financial inclusion of the poor has become an important component of public policymaking . 
Central banks and regulators worldwide are taking the lead in making financial inclusion a priority , in addition to their traditional mandates of maintaining monetary and financial stability . 
Financial inclusion is about providing an opportunity for the world &apos;s 2.5 billion unbanked and financially underserved to participate in the formal financial system , thereby helping to lift them out of poverty and enter the economic mainstream . 
Greater financial inclusiveness promises a more cohesive society and more balanced growth and development . 
Moreover , financial systems themselves stand to benefit from becoming more comprehensive and progressive . 
The additional consumers participating in the formal financial system will strengthen national economies and , in turn , enrich the global economy . 
Indeed , as developing countries move toward middle-income status , financial inclusion is a key component of continued progress . 
In countries with high levels of financial exclusion , consumers are left to rely on unregulated informal services . 
These inferior substitutes often imply exorbitant costs for borrowers - and financing that is usually too short term for productive investment activity . 
Moreover , the lack of consumer protection and regulatory and supervisory frameworks exposes informal activities to vulnerabilities that can harm borrowers and jeopardize financial stability . 
Increasing the availability of formal financial services to those who have long been denied them requires establishing a balanced regulatory framework . 
Oppressive , blanket regulation , which may be necessary in complex and unpredictable financial markets , may not be relevant in a rural community - or , worse , it may stifle efforts to promote financial inclusion . 
Indeed , proportionality is an important aspect of regulation , enabling prudential measures that , rather than exceed or underestimate , are commensurate with the risks that need to be addressed . 
Little wonder , then , that high levels of exclusion in developing and emerging countries have prompted policymakers to embrace proportionate regulation , thereby gaining the flexibility to encourage innovation in the provision of financial services while preserving financial stability . 
Bangladesh , for example , has adapted its financial regulations for microfinance institutions . 
This has helped to catalyze the growth of sustainable microfinancing to local women-owned enterprises . 
Kenya &apos;s &quot; test and learn &quot; approach to regulation has unleashed the potential of mobile-phone-based financial-service delivery through M-PESA , which offers consumers a safe and convenient alternative to cash . 
There are many other examples of successful implementation of proportionate regulation that have resulted in greater financial inclusion without compromising financial stability . 
In Malaysia , agent-banking regulation ( which safeguards consumers &quot; interests while supporting financial institutions &quot; business models ) has led to the expansion of branchless banking to reach previously unserved rural areas . 
Similarly , Mexico &apos;s &quot; tiered &quot; approach to financial access - according to which requirements for opening bank accounts are proportionate to risk , with low-value accounts subject to higher transaction restrictions - has expanded access to basic accounts , while mitigating the risk of money laundering . 
And Pakistan and Indonesia , by basing capital requirements for microfinance institutions on the size of the population that they expect to serve , are enabling these institutions to serve distinct market niches sustainably . 
Policymakers in many countries have recently been considering the role of financial standard-setting bodies ( SSBs ) in advancing financial inclusion . 
In particular , they are focusing on the specific challenges that arise when applying supervisory standards in a developing country that is pursuing financial stability and inclusion . 
Although global standards supposedly reflect the principles of proportionality , they provide insufficient guidance for the national regulators , banking institutions , and financial-sector assessors who are trying to apply them effectively in diverse environments . 
This lack of contextual clarity has led to excessively conservative interpretations of the regulations - and thus to the creation of unintended barriers to financial inclusion . 
Addressing this will require input from policymakers with practical experience applying international standards , particularly in emerging economies . 
At the same time , in order to ensure continued progress toward financial inclusion , representatives from developing and emerging economies must play a greater role in shaping future standards . 
The Alliance for Financial Inclusion , a network of central bankers and financial policymakers from more than 80 developing countries , is already contributing to more effective and proportionate global regulation by facilitating increased engagement with SSBs . 
This September , Malaysia &apos;s central bank will advance the process by hosting AFI &apos;s Global Policy Forum . 
Such collaborative efforts among developing countries ultimately foster closer cooperation between them and their developed counterparts . 
This will lead to better outcomes for the global financial system , the global real economy , and , most important , the people who have been excluded from both for far too long .
