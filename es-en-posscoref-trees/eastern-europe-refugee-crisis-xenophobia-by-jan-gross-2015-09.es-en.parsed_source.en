Eastern Europe &apos;s Crisis of Shame 
BERLIN - As thousands of refugees pour into Europe to escape the horrors of war , with many dying along the way , a different sort of tragedy has played out in many of the European Union &apos;s newest member states . 
The states known collectively as &quot; Eastern Europe , &quot; including my native Poland , have revealed themselves to be intolerant , illiberal , xenophobic , and incapable of remembering the spirit of solidarity that carried them to freedom a quarter-century ago . 
These are the same societies that clamored before and after the fall of communism for a &quot; return to Europe , &quot; proudly proclaiming that they shared its values . 
But what did they think Europe stands for ? 
Since 1989 - and particularly since 2004 , when they joined the EU - they have benefited from massive financial transfers in the form of European structural and cohesion funds . 
Today , they are unwilling to contribute anything to resolve the greatest refugee crisis facing Europe since World War II . 
Indeed , before the eyes of the entire world , the government of Hungary , an EU member state , has mistreated thousands of refugees . 
Prime Minister Viktor Orb치n sees no reason to behave otherwise : the refugees are not a European problem , he insists ; they are a German problem . 
Orb치n is not alone in this view . 
Even Hungary &apos;s Catholic bishops are following Orb치n &apos;s line , with Laszlo Kiss-Rigo , Bishop of Szeged-Csanad , saying that Muslim migrants &quot; want to take over , &quot; and that the Pope , who has called on every Catholic parish in Europe to take in a refugee family , &quot; doesn &apos;t know the situation . &quot; 
In Poland , a country of 40 million people , the government initially expressed a readiness to accept 2,000 refugees - but only Christians ( Slovakia proposed a similar stipulation ) . 
Refugees are not an Eastern European problem , a Polish journalist told National Public Radio in the United States , because these countries did not participate in the decision to bomb Libya ( neither did Germany ) . 
Have Eastern Europeans no sense of shame ? 
For centuries , their ancestors emigrated in droves , seeking relief from material hardships and political persecution . 
And today their leaders &quot; heartless behavior and callous rhetoric play to popular sentiment . 
Indeed , the electronic version of Poland &apos;s largest newspaper , Gazeta Wyborcza , now publishes a stunning notice at the end of every article about refugees : &quot; Because of the extraordinarily aggressive content of remarks advocating violence , contrary to the law , and calling for racial , ethnic , and religious hatred , we will not allow readers to publish comments . &quot; 
Not so long ago , in the immediate postwar years , Eastern European Jewish Holocaust survivors fled from the murderous anti-Semitism of their Polish , Hungarian , Slovak , or Romanian neighbors to the safety of displaced persons camps in , of all places , Germany . 
&quot; Safe Among the Germans &quot; proclaimed the title of an important book by the historian Ruth Gay about these 250,000 survivors . 
Now Muslim refugees and survivors of other wars , having found no refuge in Eastern Europe , also are fleeing to safety among the Germans . 
In this case , history is not a metaphor . 
On the contrary , the root cause of the Eastern European attitudes now on grim display is to be found in World War II and its aftermath . 
Consider the Poles , who , deservedly proud of their society &apos;s anti-Nazi resistance , actually killed more Jews than Germans during the war . 
Although Poland &apos;s Catholics were cruelly victimized during the Nazi occupation , they could find little compassion for the fate of Nazism &apos;s ultimate victims . 
In the words of J칩zef Mackiewicz , a conservative , anti-Communist Polish writer with impeccable patriotic credentials : &quot; During the occupation there was not , literally , a single person who would not have heard the saying - &quot; One thing Hitler has done correctly is to wipe out the Jews . &quot; 
But one should not talk about this openly . &quot; 
Of course , there were Poles who helped Jews during the war . 
Indeed , the number of Polish &quot; Righteous Among Nations , &quot; recognized by Israel &apos;s Yad Vashem for their wartime heroism , is the largest among all European countries ( unsurprisingly , given that prewar Poland had Europe &apos;s largest Jewish population by far ) . 
But these remarkable individuals typically acted on their own , against prevailing social norms . 
They were misfits who , long after the war had ended , insisted on keeping their wartime heroism a secret from their neighbors - afraid , it seems , that their own communities would otherwise shun , threaten , and ostracize them . 
All occupied European societies were complicit to some degree in the Nazi effort to destroy the Jews . 
Each made a different contribution , depending on country-specific circumstances and conditions of German rule . 
But the Holocaust played out most gruesomely in Eastern Europe , owing to the sheer number of Jews in the region and the incomparable ruthlessness of the Nazi occupation regimes . 
When the war ended , Germany - because of the victors &quot; denazification policies and its responsibility for instigating and carrying out the Holocaust - had no choice but to &quot; work through &quot; its murderous past . 
This was a long , difficult process ; but German society , mindful of its historical misdeeds , has become capable of confronting moral and political challenges of the type posed by the influx of refugees today . 
And Chancellor Angela Merkel has set an example of leadership on migrants that puts all of Eastern Europe &apos;s leaders to shame . 
Eastern Europe , by contrast , has yet to come to terms with its murderous past . 
Only when it does will its people be able to recognize their obligation to save those fleeing in the face of evil .
