Global Action for Global Recovery 
WASHINGTON , DC - The global economy has entered a dangerous new phase . 
There is a path to sustained recovery , but it is narrowing . 
To navigate it , we need strong political will around the world - leadership over brinksmanship , cooperation over competition , and action over reaction . 
One of the main problems today is too much debt in the global financial system - among sovereigns , banks , and households , and especially among the advanced economies . 
These countries face a weak and bumpy recovery , with unacceptably high unemployment . 
The eurozone debt crisis has worsened , and financial strains are rising . 
Political indecision in some quarters is making matters worse . 
Social tensions bubbling beneath the surface could well add fuel to the crisis of confidence . 
In these circumstances , we need collective action for global recovery along four main policy lines : repair , reform , rebalancing , and rebuilding . 
First , repair . 
Before doing anything else , we must relieve some of the balance-sheet pressures - on sovereigns , households , and banks - that risk smothering the recovery . 
Advanced countries need credible medium-term plans to stabilize and reduce public debt . 
But consolidating too quickly can hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects . 
There is a solution . 
Credible measures that deliver and anchor savings in the medium term will help create space to accommodate growth today - by allowing a slower pace of consolidation . 
Of course , the precise path is different for each country , as some are under market pressure and have no choice , while others have more space . 
It is also important to relieve pressure on household and banks . 
With respect to the United States , I welcome President Barack Obama &apos;s recent proposals to address growth and employment ; actions like more aggressive principal-reduction programs or helping homeowners to take advantage of low-interest rates would also help . 
And , in Europe , the sovereigns must address firmly their financing problems through credible fiscal consolidation . 
In addition , to support growth , banks must have sufficient capital buffers . 
The second issue is reform , with the financial sector a high priority . 
On the positive side , we have broad agreement on higher-quality capital and liquidity standards with appropriate phase-in arrangements . 
But substantial gaps remain and must be addressed through international cooperation in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage . 
I would also include the social dimension under the reform banner - particularly the need to identify and nurture sources of growth capable of generating sufficient jobs . 
This is especially important for the young . 
The third target of collective action , rebalancing , has two meanings . 
First , it means shifting demand back to the private sector when it is strong enough to carry the load . 
Rebalancing also involves a global demand switch from external-deficit countries to those running large current-account surpluses . 
With lower spending and higher savings in the advanced economies , key emerging markets must take up the slack and start providing the demand needed to power the global recovery . 
But this rebalancing , too , has not happened sufficiently , and if the advanced economies succumb to recession , nobody will escape . 
The fourth policy imperative is rebuilding . 
Many countries , including those with low income levels , need to rebuild their economic defenses - for example , by strengthening their budget positions - to protect themselves against future storms . 
This will also help to provide the space for growth-enhancing public investment and important social safety nets . 
In these circumstances , the International Monetary Fund - with its 187 member countries - is uniquely positioned to foster collective action . 
Our policy advice can help shine a light on the pressing issues of the day - growth , core vulnerabilities , and interconnectedness . 
Our lending can provide breathing space for countries in difficulty . 
And , looking beyond the crisis horizon , the IMF can also help construct a safer and more stable international financial system . 
This is no time for half-measures or muddling through . 
If we seize the moment , we can navigate our way out of this crisis and restore strong , sustainable , and balanced global growth . 
But we need to act quickly - and together .
