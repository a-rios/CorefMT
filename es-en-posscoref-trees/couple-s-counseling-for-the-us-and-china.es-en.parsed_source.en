Couple &apos;s Counseling for the US and China 
BEIJING - China has undoubtedly benefited from the world system created and supported by the United States . 
Indeed , Richard Nixon &apos;s journey to China in 1972 opened the door for China &apos;s return to the international community . 
Most of the next two decades were a honeymoon for Sino-American relations . 
On the economic front , the US not only granted China most-favored-nation trade status , but also tolerated China &apos;s mercantilist approach to international trade and finance , notably its dual-track exchange-rate regime . 
In the 1990 &quot; s , bilateral economic ties continued to expand . 
American support for China &apos;s integration into the world system culminated with the country &apos;s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 . 
Since then , China &apos;s exports have grown five-fold . 
Of course , China &apos;s inadequate intellectual-property protection has damaged relations ( a shortcoming that may be harming Chinese firms more than US firms by deterring American - and other advanced country - companies from deploying new technologies in China ) . 
In fact , China &apos;s approach is akin to gambling against the odds . 
Successful hi-tech innovations are random events that follow the law of large numbers . 
When left to the market , many firms and individuals try to innovate , so the overall probability of success can increase dramatically . 
The market allows the law of large numbers to work , whereas concentrated government support for a few favored firms undermines it . 
But neither of these flaws , nor the exchange rate , is at the root of today &apos;s global imbalances . 
Consider the exchange rate . 
The United Kingdom maintained a current-account surplus for the century before World War I , and the US did the same for about 80 years before 1980 . 
Moreover , the economies that managed to narrow their external gaps with the US substantially after World War II , notably Germany , Japan , South Korea , Singapore , and Taiwan , ran current-account surpluses throughout their rapid-growth periods . 
One possible explanation is that the relationship between GDP growth rates and a country &apos;s current-account position is not linear . 
Compared to countries with very slow growth rates , countries with reasonably high growth rates should borrow . 
For &quot; catch-up &quot; countries , like China , rapid growth is often accompanied by brisk structural change that moves factors of production , especially labor , from low-productivity activities to economic sectors with much higher productivity . 
China &apos;s exchange-rate policy is problematic not because it promotes exports , but because it has forced the country to accumulate a huge pile of wasteful foreign reserves . 
The Chinese government &apos;s reluctance to allow faster exchange-rate appreciation may reflect its aversion to large , unforeseeable fluctuations , particularly given its determination to make the renminbi an international reserve currency . 
While China &apos;s economy is hampered by structural difficulties , the US is not free of similar challenges . 
Frankly , I am always struck by US economists &quot; reluctance to discuss the structural problems that caused the current crisis , and that hinder America &apos;s recovery . 
Most seem to believe that the crisis result from bad monetary policy and lax financial-sector regulation ; some even blame the savings accumulated by Asian countries , especially China . 
That may be true of the immediate causes of the crisis . 
While this model has , of course , helped the US to become the world &apos;s leading economy , it has also delivered severe structural problems . 
For example , to sustain high innovation , the US has maintained the most flexible labor market among mature economies . 
Companies often lay off a whole department of scientists to shift to a new product , destroying not only human capital , but also human lives . 
Moreover , flexible labor markets imply adversarial labor relations , particularly when compared to northern European countries . 
These countries are less innovative than is the US , but their economies and societies may be more resilient . 
Meanwhile , the jewel of American capitalism , the financial sector , caused the crisis and is underpinning the US current-account deficit . 
Finally , America &apos;s global hegemony has proven to be a curse as well as a blessing . 
The US dollar accounts for 60 % of world trade , and the US has the strongest military in the world , making it a safe haven for global investors . 
The policies adopted or discussed by American policymakers and scholars nowadays - quantitative easing , fiscal-stimulus packages , government-deficit reduction - seek to cure only the symptoms of a deeper malaise . 
As a first step to recovery , the US must undertake serious financial-sector reforms . 
As Lenin pointed out , financial capitalism is the highest form of capitalism - that is , it is the end of capitalism . 
Lenin may have gotten the underlying analysis wrong , but today we know that his conclusion may have been right for another reason : financial capitalism forces a country into unsustainable indebtedness . 
Unfortunately , America &apos;s financial reforms have been half-baked at best . 
For three decades , &quot; reform &quot; was a word reserved for the Chinese side of the Sino-American relationship . 
The US , one hopes , will grow to like the sound of it .
