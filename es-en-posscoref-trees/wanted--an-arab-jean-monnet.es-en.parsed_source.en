Wanted : An Arab Jean Monnet 
The Middle East is beyond doubt one of the most dangerous crisis regions worldwide . 
The next war , terrorist attack , or failed peace initiative may lurk just around the corner . 
Compared to the politics of this region , a rollercoaster ride is downright calming . 
And yet the Middle East is also a region that , throughout its innumerable conflicts , has hardly changed , languishing in a strange kind of standstill . 
There must be an intrinsic correlation between the lack of developmental dynamism of most Middle Eastern societies and the fact that the region is so crisis-prone . 
The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians stands out as an example of the static nature of this key geopolitical region , because it seems to be completely unaffected by any international upheaval . 
The Ottomans , the British , decolonization , the Cold War , numerous American Presidents , and even more international mediators have come and gone , but the parameters of this conflict and the inability to find a solution never seem to change . 
However , this impression - correct where the past is concerned - might prove deceptive in the future , because two global megatrends will subject the region to more profound change than all the many previous political crises and wars were able to bring about . 
The first is globalization , by which ever-larger parts of the Arab world , beginning with the Persian Gulf and its oil countries , will be influenced , albeit slowly , both economically and culturally . 
With the shift of wealth and power from the West to the East , the pressures of globalization will increasingly come from the East . 
In Morocco , for instance , investment from the Arab oil countries has already significantly reduced Europe &apos;s importance . 
The inherent contradiction between a governance structure incapable of change and economic modernization , between cultural and religious conservatism and social and normative transformation , will therefore increase and bring about new , additional frictions if positive answers to these fundamental changes cannot be found . 
The second megatrend is the global climate crisis . 
Apart from those countries that are threatened - partly or completely -by rising sea levels , global warming will primarily affect the desert belts and their already precarious water supplies . 
And , while the conflicts in the Middle East are primarily about territory , this includes the scarce water resources so essential for survival . 
Rapid population growth , a dramatic increase in water consumption due to industrial , agricultural , and tourism growth , and rising standards of living will make the water issue even more important to the region &apos;s political stability than it is already . 
A sustainable answer to questions of such vital importance to the Middle East only makes sense if it is regional in character . 
And the same applies to the increasing demand for energy : although the region as a whole is rich in energy resources , their uneven geographical distribution suggests that any viable solution must be built on cooperation . 
Of course , resolving the political crises and conflicts remains the top priority . 
To make regional peace and stability possible , however , the region &apos;s very young and rapidly increasing populations require an economic perspective that makes their participation in globalization possible - in a dignified manner and grounded in their own culture and history . 
The Middle East &apos;s individual states won &apos;t be able to manage this without regional cooperation . 
In fact , the preconditions for intra-regional cooperation - up to partial integration of the interests of the countries involved - look more auspicious than they did in Western Europe in the early 1950 &quot; s . 
Europe had neither a common language , nor was it as religiously and culturally as homogeneous as the Middle East . 
For Europe , the starting point was visionary leaders like Jean Monnet and the creation of new institutions like the Coal and Steel Community . 
In the Middle East , the process of regional integration could begin with water and energy . 
This would , finally , give the Middle East - a region poor in growth and rich in conflicts - a distinct identity , making it a player in global economic terms as well , and thus enabling it to become the architect of its own future . 
Europe , once the continent of war , has shown that this is possible . 
And Europe can help the Middle East - its neighboring region - achieve this strategic objective . 
An instrument for it already exists : the new Union for the Mediterranean . 
In any case , the time of standstill in the Middle East is coming to an end . 
Imagination , vision , and pragmatic perseverance will be necessary . 
What is needed now is an Arabian Jean Monnet .
