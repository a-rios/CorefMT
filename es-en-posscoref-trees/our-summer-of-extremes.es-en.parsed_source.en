Our Summer of Extremes 
BERLIN - This summer has been one of weather-related extremes in Russia , Pakistan , China , Europe , the Arctic - you name it . 
But does this have anything to do with global warming , and are human emissions to blame ? 
While it cannot be scientifically proven ( or disproven , for that matter ) that global warming caused any particular extreme event , we can say that global warming very likely makes many kinds of extreme weather both more frequent and more severe . 
For weeks , central Russia has been in the grips of its worst-ever heat wave , which has caused probably thousands of fatalities . 
As a result of drought and heat , more than 500 wildfires have raged out of control , smothering Moscow in smoke and threatening several nuclear facilities . 
Russia &apos;s government has banned wheat exports , sending world grain prices soaring . 
Meanwhile , Pakistan is struggling with unprecedented flooding that has killed more than a thousand people and affected millions more . 
In China , flash floods have so far killed more than a thousand people and destroyed more than a million homes . 
On a smaller scale , European countries like Germany , Poland , and the Czech Republic have also suffered serious flooding . 
Meanwhile , global temperatures in recent months have been at their highest levels in records that go back 130 years . 
Arctic sea-ice cover reached its lowest recorded average level for the month of June ever . 
In Greenland two huge chunks of ice broke off in July and August . 
Are these events connected ? 
Looking only at individual extreme events will not reveal their cause , just like watching a few scenes from a movie does not reveal the plot . 
This decade has been marked by a number of stunning extremes . 
In 2003 , the most severe heat wave in living memory broke previous temperature records by a large margin and caused 70,000 deaths in Europe . 
In 2005 , the most severe hurricane season ever witnessed in the Atlantic devastated New Orleans and broke records in terms of the number and intensity of storms . 
In 2007 , unprecedented wildfires raged across Greece , nearly destroying the ancient site of Olympia . 
Last year , more than a hundred people were killed in bush fires in Australia , following drought and record-breaking heat . 
But that is extremely unlikely . 
All weather is driven by energy , and the sun ultimately provides this energy . But the biggest change in Earth &apos;s energy budget by far over the past hundred years is due to the accumulation in our atmosphere of greenhouse gases , which limit the exit of heat into space . 
Owing to fossil-fuel emissions , there is now one-third more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than at any time in at least a million years , as the latest ice drilling in Antarctica has revealed . 
The changes in the planet &apos;s energy budget caused by solar variations are at least ten times smaller in comparison . 
And they go in the wrong direction : in recent years , the sun has been at its dimmest since satellite measurements began in the 1970 &quot; s . 
So , when unprecedented extreme weather events occur , the prime suspect is naturally the biggest atmospheric change that has happened over the past hundred years - one that has been caused by human emissions . 
The fact that heat waves like the one in Russia become more frequent and extreme in a warmer world is easy to understand . 
Extreme rainfall events will also become more frequent and intense in a warmer climate , owing to another simple fact of physics : warm air can hold more moisture . 
For each degree Celsius of warming , 7 % more water is available to rain down from saturated air masses . 
Drought risk also increases with warming : even where rainfall does not decline , increased evaporation dries out the soils . 
The carbon-dioxide effect can also change the preferred patterns of atmospheric circulation , which can exacerbate extremes of heat , drought , or rainfall in some regions , while reducing them in others . 
The problem is that a reduction in those extremes to which we are already well-adapted provides only modest benefits , whereas the new extremes to which we are not adapted can be devastating , as recent events in Pakistan show . 
The events of this summer show how vulnerable our societies are to weather-related extremes . 
With swift and decisive action , we can still limit global warming to a total of 2ยบ Celsius or a bit less . 
Even that much warming would require a massive effort to adapt to weather extremes and rising sea levels , which needs to start now . 
With weak action , like that promised by governments in Copenhagen last December , we will be on course for 3-4ยบ Celsius of global warming . 
And , with no action at all , the planet could even heat up by 5-7ยบ Celsius by the end of this century - and more thereafter . 
Knowingly marching down that road would be insane . 
We must face the facts : our emissions of greenhouse gases probably are at least partly to blame for this summer of extremes . 
Clinging to the hope that it is all chance , and all natural , seems naive . 
Let us hope that this summer of extremes is a last-minute wake-up call to policy makers , the corporate world , and citizens alike .
