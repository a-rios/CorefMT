The Art of Capital Flight 
CAMBRIDGE - What impact will China &apos;s slowdown have on the red-hot contemporary art market ? 
That might not seem like an obvious question , until one considers that , for emerging-market investors , art has become a critical tool for facilitating capital flight and hiding wealth . 
These investors have become a major factor in the art market &apos;s spectacular price bubble of the last several years . 
So , with emerging market economies from Russia to Brazil mired in recession , will the bubble burst ? 
Just five months ago , Larry Fink , Chairman and CEO of BlackRock , the world &apos;s largest asset manager , told an audience in Singapore that contemporary art has become one of the two most important stores of wealth internationally , along with apartments in major cities such as New York , London , and Vancouver . 
Forget gold as an inflation hedge ; buy paintings . 
What made Fink &apos;s elevation of art to investment-grade status so surprising is that no one of his stature had been brave enough to say it before . 
I am certainly not celebrating the trend . 
I tend to agree with the philosopher Peter Singer that the obscene sums being spent on premier pieces of modern art are disquieting . 
We can all agree that these sums are staggering . 
In May , Pablo Picasso &apos;s &quot; Women of Algiers &quot; sold for $ 179 million at a Christie &apos;s auction in New York , up from $ 32 million in 1997 . 
Okay , it &apos;s a Picasso . 
A Swiss collector reportedly paid close to $ 300 million in a private sale for Paul Gauguin &apos;s 1892 &quot; When Will You Marry ? &quot; 
Picasso and Gauguin are deceased . 
The supply of their paintings is known and limited . 
Nevertheless , the recent price frenzy extends to a significant number of living artists , led by the American Jeff Koons and the German Gerhard Richter , and extending well down the food chain . 
For economists , the art bubble raises many fascinating questions , but an especially interesting one is exactly who would pay so much for high-end art . 
The answer is hard to know , because the art world is extremely opaque . 
Indeed , art is the last great unregulated investment opportunity . 
Much has been written about the painting collections of hedge fund managers and private equity art funds ( where one essentially buys shares in portfolios of art without actually ever taking possession of anything ) . 
In fact , emerging-market buyers , including Chinese , have become the swing buyers in many instances , often making purchases anonymously . 
But doesn &apos;t China have a regime of strict capital controls that limits citizens from taking more than $ 50,000 per year out of the country ? 
Yes , but there are many ways of moving money in and out of China , including the time-honored method of &quot; under and over invoicing . &quot; 
For example , to get money out of China , a Chinese seller might report a dollar value far below what she was actually paid by a cooperating Western importer , with the difference being deposited into an overseas bank account . 
It is extremely difficult to estimate capital flight , both because the data are insufficient and because it is tough to distinguish capital flight from normal diversification . 
As the late MIT economist RÃ¼diger Dornbusch liked to quip , identifying capital flight is akin to the old adage about blind men touching an elephant : It is difficult to describe , but you will recognize it when you see it . 
Many estimates put capital flight from China at about $ 300 billion annually in recent years , with a marked increase in 2015 as the economy continues to weaken . 
The ever-vigilant Chinese authorities are cracking down on money laundering ; but , given the huge incentives on the other side , this is like playing whack-a-mole . 
Presumably , the anonymous Chinese buyers at recent Sotheby &apos;s and Christie &apos;s auctions had spirited their money out of the country before bidding , and the paintings are just an investment vehicle that is particularly easy to hold secretively . 
The art is not necessarily even displayed anywhere : It may well be spirited off to a temperature- and humidity-controlled storage vault in Switzerland or Luxembourg . 
Reportedly , some art sales today result in paintings merely being moved from one section of a storage vault to another , recalling how the New York Federal Reserve registers gold sales between national central banks . 
Clearly , the incentives and motives of art investors who are engaged in capital flight , or who want to hide or launder their money , are quite different from those of ordinary investors . 
The Chinese hardly invented this game . 
It was not so long ago that Latin America was the big driver in the art market , owing to money escaping governance-challenged economies such as Argentina and Venezuela , as well as drug cartels that used paintings to launder their cash . 
So how , then , will the emerging-market slowdown radiating from China affect contemporary art prices ? 
In the short run , the answer is ambiguous , because more money is leaking out of the country even as the economy slows . 
In the long run , the outcome is pretty clear , especially if one throws in the coming Fed interest-rate hikes . 
With core buyers pulling back , and the opportunity cost rising , the end of the art bubble will not be a pretty picture .
