Have We Become Too Flexible ? 
LONDON - As 2015 begins , the reality of deficient global demand and deflationary risks in the world &apos;s major economies is starkly apparent . 
In the eurozone , GDP growth is slowing , and inflation has turned negative . 
Japan &apos;s progress toward its 2 % inflation target has stalled . 
Even economies experiencing more robust economic growth will miss their targets : inflation in the United States will not reach 1.5 % this year , and China &apos;s rate reached a five-year low of 1.4 % last November . 
In the advanced economies , low inflation reflects not just the temporary impact of falling commodity prices , but also longer-term wage stagnation . 
In the US , the United Kingdom , Japan , and several eurozone countries , median real ( inflation-adjusted ) wages remain below their 2007 levels . 
Indeed , in the US , real wages for the bottom quartile have not risen in three decades . 
The developing world is not doing much better . 
As the International Labor Organization &apos;s latest Global Wage Report shows , wage gains are lagging far behind productivity growth . 
Because real income growth is vital to boost consumption and prices , central bankers and politicians are now in the novel business of encouraging wage increases . 
Last July , Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann welcomed the fact that some German companies had raised wages above inflation . 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has gone a step further , repeatedly urging companies to increase wages - and encouraging them to do so by reducing corporate tax . 
So far , however , jawboning has had little effect . 
This failure would not have surprised the monetarist economists who observed the high inflation of the 1970s . 
At the time , many policymakers blamed rapid price increases on &quot; cost push &quot; factors , such as pressure from trade unions for excessive wage hikes . 
Finance ministers and central banks frequently urged wage moderation , with many countries even introducing formal policies governing wages and prices . 
But these policies proved largely ineffective . 
Instead , it seemed increasingly clear that , as Milton Friedman put it , &quot; inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon . &quot; 
If nominal demand grows faster than real potential growth , inflation is inevitable ; and nominal demand growth can be constrained only through a mix of fiscal and monetary policy . 
Indeed , inflation was finally crushed in the early 1980s , when central banks raised interest rates to whatever level was required to constrain nominal demand , even if it led to high transitional unemployment . 
But , though central banks claimed credit for the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; of global inflation that followed , structural factors ( which determine the intensity of cost-push effects ) also played a crucial role . 
For starters , the entry of China &apos;s massive labor force into the global market economy changed the power balance between capital and labor in the advanced economies . 
Trade unions &quot; membership and influence declined sharply , owing to increased global competition and , in some countries , deliberate legal reforms . 
Minimum wages , particularly in the US , were allowed to fall relative to median incomes . 
More recently , technological advances have become an increasingly important driver of structural transformation , with information technology and job automation reducing wage rates for low-skill jobs and further eroding the political and market power of organized labor . 
Today &apos;s ultra-flexible labor markets , characterized by part-time , temporary , and zero-hours contracts , are very different from those that generated cost-push inflation in the 1960s and 1970s . 
The result in many countries has been stagnant real wages , increased inequality , and a potential structural bias toward deficient nominal demand . 
Given that wealthy people have a higher propensity to save , increased inequality tends to produce sluggish demand growth - unless , that is , the savings of the wealthy are lent to the poor . 
As a result , while central bankers before the 2008 financial crisis viewed themselves as heroes in a battle against inflation , they increasingly found themselves offsetting structural deflationary pressures by setting interest rates low enough to stimulate credit booms . 
This led to excessive debt creation , financial crisis , and now a chronic aggregate-demand shortfall , with households , companies , and governments all seeking to reduce their debt . 
But , though structural factors and debt overhangs underpin today &apos;s inadequate demand , a purely macroeconomic response might still solve the problem . 
The best way to achieve that is not through the current mix of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing . 
After all , though this approach would eventually stimulate demand , it would do so by driving up asset prices - thereby exacerbating wealth inequality - and by re-stimulating the private-credit growth that fueled the financial crisis . 
But policymakers always have another option for creating nominal demand : printing money to finance their fiscal deficits . 
The permanent availability of this approach - what Friedman called &quot; helicopter &quot; money - makes deficient nominal demand one of the very few economic problems for which there is always an answer . 
Nonetheless , such a purely macroeconomic approach to the battle against deflation would almost certainly not be optimal . 
A better strategy would also entail policies that address the structural drivers of stagnant wages and consumption . 
One of those drivers is excessive labor-market flexibility . 
Though the easing of rules for hiring and firing workers has probably helped to boost employment in some countries , such as the UK , it may also be depressing real wages . 
Just as labor markets can be too rigid , they can be too flexible . 
Raising minimum wages could help limit the erosion of real earnings in the bottom quartile . 
Because deflation , like inflation , is ultimately a monetary phenomenon , fiscal and monetary weapons are the most critical means to combating it . 
But the potential importance of structural policies should not be ignored .
