Japan &apos;s Financial Truant 
TOKYO - When asked if he had ever read the classic economics textbook by Paul Samuelson , something almost all first-year students in the subject read , Japanese Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Naoto Kan replied : &quot; I read about 10 pages . &quot; 
Of course , no textbook can provide all the answers a finance minister needs in today &apos;s post-crisis world , particularly to meet Japan &apos;s daunting challenges . 
But many Japanese were dumbfounded to learn that their finance minister began to grapple with the basic principles of economics only after assuming office . 
Kan assumed his current office in Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama &apos;s administration this past January . 
A civil-rights activist for much of his career , Kan is one of the few members of the Hatoyama government with previous cabinet experience , having served for 10 months in 1996 as Minister of Health and Welfare . 
An aggressive debater , Kan is often mentioned as a candidate to succeed Hatoyama should he leave his post - a live possibility , given the prime minister &apos;s plummeting approval ratings and strained relationship with Ichiro Ozawa , the kingpin of Hatoyama &apos;s Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) . 
Kan became finance minister after his predecessor Hirohisa Fujii suddenly resigned , citing ill health . 
But Kan stumbled out of the gate by calling , during his first press conference , for a weaker yen - a statement that drew an instant rebuke from Hatoyama . 
Kan &quot; s international debut was equally inauspicious . 
At the G-7 meeting in Canada in February , the focus was on the Greek financial crisis and its international implications . 
Kan jokingly told journalists that he was glad the meeting was not addressing Japan &apos;s public debt , which has now reached almost ¥ 900 trillion . 
The meeting , it turns out , was &quot; all Greek &quot; to him . 
As a member of the European Union , Greece at least can hope for assistance from other EU members . 
Japan , however , stands alone with its massive debt . 
Likewise , whereas Greece &apos;s nominal gross national product is at least growing , Japan remains mired in deflation . 
And while stock markets are recovering in much of the developed world , Japanese stocks continue to stagnate . 
When Kan led the DPJ in opposition , he avoided discussing any raise in the rate of consumption tax . 
But now that his party is in power and must face the reality of running the second largest economy in the world , and coping with its huge debt burden , he is tossing aside his long-held views , broaching the subject of tax increases to help close the government &apos;s gaping budget deficit . 
With Hatoyama continuing to oppose an increase in consumption tax in the next four years , the issue will be a test of the government &apos;s fundamental seriousness . 
In last year &apos;s general election , the DPJ offered countless rosy promises . 
New childcare allowances of ¥ 26,000 per month were to be introduced , at a cost of ¥ 5.2trillion. 
The gasoline tax , which brings in ¥ 2.6 trillion , was to be abolished . 
And Japan &apos;s greenhouse-gas emissions were to be cut by 25 % relative to 1990 &quot; s levels . 
In attempting to fulfill these inconsistent pledges , government spending this year will reach an all-time high of ¥ 92.3 trillion . 
But tax revenue will cover only a fraction of that , as it is estimated at only ¥ 37trillion for 2010 . 
So , to meet the budget shortfall , a staggering ¥ 44.3 trillion in government bonds will be issued . 
Coming at a time when governments with even less debt than Japan need to show that they are putting their financial houses in order , Japan &apos;s budget sends precisely the wrong signal to markets . 
Japan &quot; s consumption tax ( essentially the same as VAT in Europe ) was introduced in 1989 at a rate of 3 % , and increased to 5 % in 1997 , after heated political battles . 
Japan is no different from other countries in witnessing such disputes over taxes . 
What is different is that , given the extent of the country &apos;s fiscal problems , the government still continues to think of taxes only in partisan terms . 
Voters chose the DPJ in order to change Japan , but they have mostly seen the same old political scandals . Hatoyama has been accused of receiving shady donations - &quot; childcare allowances &quot; - from his heiress mother . 
Ozawa , the all-powerful Secretary General of DPJ , has been accused of using party funds to buy real estate , and of receiving bribes from construction companies . 
Such scandals have tainted Japanese politics for decades . 
But , just as Kan is planning only to &quot; discuss &quot; raising taxes , the supposedly clean DPJ is planning only to discuss the problem of money in politics by establishing a new non-partisan commission to investigate the problem . 
Japan , however , cannot afford to waste time building a new apparatus to prevent party-financing scandals . 
The country has laws on the books to handle the matter . 
They simply need to be enforced . 
What is needed , and badly , is a nonpartisan body to find a sustainable way to pay for the country &apos;s social security programs . 
Social security expenditures will face a shortfall of ¥ 6 trillion this year . 
Given Japan &apos;s aging population , there is a natural increase in the social security budget of ¥ 1 trillion per year . 
The country simply cannot keep on piling debt upon debt . 
To stop the country &apos;s fiscal rot , Japan must achieve a consensus on the type of social services that national and local governments should offer , for how long , and at what cost . 
The problem is too grave to be left to partisan bickering . 
Securing Japan &apos;s fiscal health , as well as the physical health of its people , is the most urgent issue the country has faced in half-a-century .
