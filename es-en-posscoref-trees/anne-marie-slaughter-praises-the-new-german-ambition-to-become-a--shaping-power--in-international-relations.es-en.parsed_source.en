Germany Steps Up 
WASHINGTON , DC - Since the start of his first administration , US President Barack Obama has repeated a simple mantra concerning other countries : &quot; With power comes responsibility . &quot; 
France has demonstrated repeatedly that it understands and accepts this responsibility ; 
Several weeks ago , German President Joachim Gauck &apos;s opening address to the 50th annual Munich Security Conference reflected on the Federal Republic &apos;s evolution over those five decades , a period that gave rise to &quot; a good Germany , the best we have ever known . &quot; 
And , because Germany benefits more than most countries from the current open , value-based international order , it has , Gauck said , a greater responsibility to defend and extend that order . 
Gauck &apos;s speech reflected the thinking in an important new report , entitled New Power , New Responsibility , released by the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik and the German Marshall Fund of the United States . 
The report - the product of several months of debate within the German foreign-policy and security community - identifies Germany &apos;s current values and interests as a commitment to &quot; human dignity , freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and to an international order that is based on universal norms . &quot; 
As Gauck proclaimed , Germany &apos;s &quot; overriding strategic objective &quot; must be the &quot; preservation and continued adaptation &quot; of this order . 
To achieve this objective , Germany must become a &quot; shaping power , &quot; a state with the ability to solve problems and resolve conflicts affecting all or part of the international community . 
The traditional determinants of states &quot; power relative to other states - geography , demography , economic heft , and military might , coupled with the availability of resources and technological proficiency - remain important ; but they are often insufficient to confer actual influence in international politics . 
A shaping power builds relationships and invests in institutions that allow it to work well with others and to create and mobilize &quot; coalitions and networks of like-minded states . &quot; 
As a shaping power with an enormous stake in preserving and extending the openness of the international system , Germany has a special responsibility to help integrate new global powers into that system . 
Here is where things get interesting . 
Germany has long sought a seat on the United Nations Security Council , making common cause with Japan , Brazil , and India . 
Under this scenario , Germany would play a role in global peace and security through the European seat , as well as serving as a periodic rotating member . 
Moreover , Germany recognizes the need to consolidate Europe &apos;s voting power and reduce the number of European seats in other global institutions , such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , to make room for emerging powers . 
This renewed commitment to a strong and united Europe is the second pillar of a twenty-first-century German foreign policy . 
New Power , New Responsibility calls for &quot; deepening &quot; the European Union through measures that would include democratizing EU financial decision-making by directly engaging national parliamentarians and exchanging tighter European fiscal constraints on member governments &quot; budgets for a European banking union , a eurozone budget , and Eurobonds . 
In foreign and security policy , New Power , New Responsibility proposes strengthening the role of the EU High Representative and the role of the European Action Service . 
Current EU High Representative Catherine Ashton continues to prove the worth of EU foreign-policy institutions by , for example , brokering a remarkable peace between Serbia and Kosovo and playing a key role in nuclear negotiations with Iran . 
The third surprise concerns the use of force . 
Gauck told Germans in no uncertain terms that they had to be willing to use force , at least as a last resort , and reproached those of his fellow citizens &quot; who use Germany &apos;s guilt for its past as a shield for laziness or a desire to disengage from the world . &quot; 
More controversially , Gauck proclaimed the need for Security Council authorization of any use of force , but also hinted at a Kosovo precedent for possible military intervention in Syria . 
As he put it , when the international community confronts a clear case for the use of force to protect a population from its own government , but the Security Council is divided , &quot; the relationship between legality and legitimacy will continue to be awkward . &quot; 
The participants in the deliberations that resulted in New Power , New Responsibility split on this question . 
Some argued for an absolute requirement of Security Council authorization , while others recognized an imperative to contemplate humanitarian intervention without such authorization in &quot; very narrowly defined exceptional cases . &quot; 
US Secretary of State John Kerry also spoke at the Munich Security Conference . 
But , by not referring to Gauck &apos;s speech , he missed an opportunity to underline the success of one of Obama &apos;s key foreign-policy tenets : as the US steps back from its role as global policeman and focuses more on diplomacy than force , other countries must step up . 
Even more important , Kerry and Obama would do well to think hard about a key lesson embedded in Gauck &apos;s speech and the report behind it . 
Countries that want to retain power in a changing global order must learn to share it , which requires accepting and embracing the contours of a new world . 
The Obama administration should think hard about Security Council reform . 
It should signal a real willingness to replace an order that reflects the world of 1945 with one that reflects the world of 2015 .
