The Last Pagans of Iraq 
SINGAPORE - With US President Barack Obama belatedly ordering air strikes and humanitarian airdrops of food and relief supplies to refugees in northern Iraq , the world is finally taking action against the Islamic State . 
Within a few months , the jihadist group , which until recently called itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , has taken control of large parts of both countries , where it has proclaimed a new &quot; Caliphate . &quot; 
But the real reason to fear the Islamic State is not its lust for power ; it is the systematic , cold-blooded way in which its members are erasing the region &apos;s social , cultural , and demographic past . 
Within a few weeks , the Islamic State has virtually eliminated the entire Shia Muslim and Christian populations from the lands that it controls . 
The city of Mosul , home to one of the world &apos;s oldest Christian communities , no longer has any Christians left . 
Priceless Assyrian artifacts have been publicly destroyed in a campaign against idolatry . 
Indeed , the Islamic State has not even spared Sunni co-religionists who do not adhere to their extreme interpretation of Islam . 
As terrible as all of this is , the worst of the persecution has been aimed at the Yezidi , an ancient religious group that lives among the Kurds . 
The rest are scattered across neighboring countries like Syria , Armenia , and Turkey . 
More recent immigrant communities are to be found in Germany and the United States . 
Although influenced over the centuries by Christianity and Islam , the Yezidi religion has ancient pagan roots that go back at least to the late Bronze Age . 
Interestingly , their beliefs have many similarities with Hinduism - for example , they believe in reincarnation , say their prayers facing the sun at sunrise and sunset , and even have a system of castes . 
They also worship Tawûsê-Melek , the peacock angel - a bird that is found in the Indian sub-continent but not in Yezidi lands . 
While the origins of the Yezidi are uncertain , cultural and genetic evidence suggests that they may be remnants of Indian tribes that migrated west in the second millennium BC . 
There is considerable evidence of Indian links with the Middle East during the Bronze Age . 
For example , Zoroastrianism , the religion of ancient Iran - to which Yezidi religious beliefs have been linked - is closely related to early Hinduism . 
Over the centuries , both Christians and Muslims dubbed the Yezidi &quot; devil worshippers , &quot; and subjected them to relentless persecution , which was especially extreme under the Ottoman Turks in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . 
A series of massacres killed hundreds of thousands and almost led to their extinction . 
Under Saddam Hussein , the Yezidi were not subjected to overt religious persecution , though they remained under pressure to Arabize their culture . 
Matters have since taken a turn for the worse . 
In April 2007 , gunmen dragged 23 Yezidi men from a bus and shot them dead . 
Four months later , a series of coordinated car-bomb attacks killed at least 300 more , including women and children . 
The Yezidis now face their greatest crisis ever . 
The Islamic State gave the Christians of Mosul the choice to convert , pay the jizya ( a special tax levied on non-Muslims under Sharia law ) , or leave . 
The Yezidi have been given no such choice and are killed on sight as &quot; devil worshippers . &quot; 
The Yezidi heartland around Mosul is now largely under the Islamic State &apos;s control . 
The small town of Sinjar , the only place in the world with a Yezidi majority , fell in the first few days of August as Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw . 
Reports of large-scale massacres are trickling in . 
Many refugees escaped into the mountains , where they are trapped in shrinking enclaves . 
Hundreds are said to have died already of thirst and starvation . 
The most sacred Yezidi pilgrimage site at Lalish runs the risk of being demolished . 
Sadly , there has been little media outrage at the predicament faced by the Yezidi . 
Perhaps the US airdrops and promised strategic interventions , together with a possible coordinated operation by Kurdish forces ( rearmed by the US ) , may rescue the survivors , but it appears unlikely that they will be able to return to their homes soon . 
Centuries ago , the last Zoroastrians fled persecution in Iran for India . 
Their descendants , the tiny Parsi community , still live there . 
Today , who will give refuge to the last pagans of Iraq ?
