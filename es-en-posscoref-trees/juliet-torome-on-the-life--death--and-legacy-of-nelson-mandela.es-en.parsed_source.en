Mandela &apos;s Children 
NAIROBI - Before I knew that Nelson Mandela existed , I thought our then-leader , Kenyan President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi , was the world &apos;s only statesman . 
I was five years old , and no world existed for me outside Nairagie Enkare , my birthplace in rural Maasailand . 
Moi was a mythical figure to me , because he didn &apos;t live in Nairagie Enkare , yet he was always present through radio , a technology too complicated for a child like me to understand . 
Every newscast from the government-controlled radio station began with what &quot; His Excellency , Holy President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi &quot; had said or done . 
He visited a school . 
He planted a tree . 
He helped a women &apos;s group . 
He attended church . 
He said agriculture was the backbone of our nation . 
He said we were fortunate to live in Kenya . 
Throughout the day , the airwaves were filled with songs repeating the Father of the Nation &apos;s message , and reminding Kenyans to follow in his footsteps . 
Perhaps because what came over the radio was so predictable , people sought alternative news from the BBC Swahili Service . 
On most evenings , at six o &apos;clock , men gathered to listen at the homes of the few , like my father , who had radios . 
The news lasted only 30 minutes , so everyone had to be absolutely quiet . 
But , on February 11 , 1990 , the men began to say repeatedly , &quot; He is free ! 
He is free ! 
Nelson Mandela is free ! &quot; 
I &apos;m sure that my father and his friends had heard earlier from government radio that Mandela had been released , but they waited for verification from the BBC . 
They left before the news was over to go to a bar to celebrate . 
When my father came home that night , he was singing praises for Mandela . 
I never asked my father who Mandela was . 
The following year , I enrolled in school and began to learn that the world extended beyond Nairagie Enkare . 
My teachers explained to me why Mandela &apos;s freedom , after 27 years in prison , meant so much to Africans - from big cities to small villages . 
Europeans , I learned , had colonized Africa and stripped Africans of the right to self-governance . 
As African countries began to gain independence in the 1950 &quot; s , the white minority in South Africa was tightening its grip on power through a racial-segregation system known as apartheid . 
It was Mandela &apos;s fight against apartheid that led to his imprisonment . 
By 1980 , black Africans had taken over governance in every country on the continent except South Africa . 
Mandela &apos;s release from prison ten years later moved Africa one step closer to absolute independence . 
That mission was completed in 1994 , when apartheid fell and South Africans chose Mandela as their first democratically elected president . 
As I learned more about Mandela , I wondered how he had achieved the unimaginable , overcoming a 27-year ordeal to become the leader of Africa &apos;s largest economy . 
And , just when I thought that he had already made his mark on history , he shocked the world by announcing that he would not seek re-election after the end of his first term in 1999 . 
I was 14 then , old enough to understand how unusual it was for an incumbent African president to retire willingly . 
In my own country , for example , people were beginning to wonder whether Moi would leave office in 2002 , when his second term expired . 
He had ruled Kenya for 13 years before a move in 1991 to reintroduce multi-party democracy paved the way for an election the following year . 
Moi was allowed to run again , as long as he honored the constitutional two-term limit . 
I feel extremely fortunate and honored that the start of my formal education coincided with Mandela &apos;s re-emergence in African politics . 
His patience , civility , and politics of reconciliation provided me a better example of democracy and good governance than any civics class could have done . 
Mandela embodied the type of leader that Africans had in mind when they struggled for freedom from the European empires . 
Africans wanted leaders who would reconcile and reunite them - leaders who would restore to them the dignity that colonialism had robbed . 
Unfortunately for many African countries , freedom and independence ended up in the hands of a few who had tasted and become addicted to the repressive practices that Africans had spent decades fighting . 
They amassed untold wealth as hunger and disease ripped their societies apart and pushed more Africans deeper into poverty . 
Indeed , more than two decades after Mandela walked through the prison gates , supposedly completing Africa &apos;s struggle for freedom , &quot; Big Men &quot; in countries like Congo and Zimbabwe continue to cling to power against the will of their people . 
Nevertheless , I am encouraged by the fact that , since Mandela left office , many African presidents - including Moi and Thabo Mbeki , Mandela &apos;s successor - have adhered to their countries &quot; constitutions and left office without a fight . 
I am also hopeful that Mandela has inspired other young people like me to continue Africa &apos;s liberation peacefully - the Mandela way .
