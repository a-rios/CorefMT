Europe &apos;s Crisis of Values 
NEW YORK - Xenophobia and extremism are symptoms of societies in profound crisis . 
In 2012 , the far-right Golden Dawn won 21 seats in Greece &apos;s parliamentary election , the right-wing Jobbik gained ground in my native Hungary , and the National Front &apos;s Marine Le Pen received strong backing in France &apos;s presidential election . 
Growing support for similar forces across Europe points to an inescapable conclusion : the continent &apos;s prolonged financial crisis is creating a crisis of values that is now threatening the European Union itself . 
When it was only an aspiration , the European Union was an immensely attractive idea that fired many people &apos;s imagination , including mine . 
I regarded it as the embodiment of an open society - a voluntary association of sovereign states that were willing to give up part of their sovereignty for the common good . 
They shared a common history , in which the French Revolution , with its slogan of liberty , equality , and fraternity , left a lasting legacy . 
Building on that tradition , member states formed a union based on equality and not dominated by any state or nationality . 
The euro crisis has now turned the EU into something radically different . 
Far from being a voluntary association , the eurozone is now held together by harsh discipline ; far from being an association of equals it has become a hierarchical arrangement in which the center dictates policy while the periphery is increasingly subordinated ; instead of fraternity and solidarity , hostile stereotypes proliferate . 
The integration process was spearheaded by a small group of farsighted statesmen who subscribed to open-society principles and practiced what Karl Popper called &quot; piecemeal social engineering . &quot; 
They recognized that perfection is unattainable ; so they set limited objectives and firm timelines - and then mobilized the political will for a small step forward , knowing full well that when they achieved it , its inadequacy would become apparent , requiring further steps . 
That is how the European Coal and Steel Community was gradually transformed into the EU . 
France and Germany used to be in the forefront of the effort . 
As the Soviet empire disintegrated , Germany &apos;s leaders recognized that German reunification was possible only in the context of a more united Europe , and they were prepared to make considerable sacrifices to achieve it . 
When it came to bargaining , the Germans were willing to contribute a little more and take a little less than others , thereby facilitating agreement . 
At the time , German statesmen would assert that Germany had no independent foreign policy , only a European one . 
This stance led to a dramatic acceleration in European integration , culminating in the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the introduction of the euro in 1999 . 
A period of consolidation ( which included the introduction of euro banknotes and coins in 2002 ) followed . 
Then came the crash of 2008 , which originated in the United States but caused greater problems in Europe than anywhere else . 
Policymakers responded to the collapse of Lehman Brothers by announcing that no other systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail , which required substituting state credit for frozen markets . 
Shortly thereafter , however , German Chancellor Angela Merkel asserted that such guarantees had to be provided by each state individually , not by Europe collectively . 
That marked the beginning of the euro crisis , because it exposed a flaw in the single currency of which neither the authorities nor financial markets were aware - and which is still not fully recognized today . 
By creating the European Central Bank , the member states exposed their own government bonds to the risk of default . 
Developed countries that issue bonds in their own currency never default , because they can always print money . 
Their currency may depreciate , but the risk of default is absent . 
By contrast , less developed countries that borrow in foreign currencies may run out of currency reserves . 
When a fiscal crisis hit Greece , the financial world suddenly discovered that eurozone members had put themselves in the position of developing countries . 
There is a close parallel between the euro crisis and the Latin American debt crisis of 1982 , when the International Monetary Fund saved the international financial system by lending just enough money to the heavily indebted countries to enable them to avoid default . 
Latin America suffered a lost decade . 
Today , Germany is playing the same role as the IMF did then . 
The setting differs , but the effect is the same . 
The euro crisis pushed the financial system to the verge of bankruptcy , which has been avoided by imposing strict austerity and lending countries like Greece just enough money to avoid default . 
As a result , the eurozone has become divided into creditors and debtors , with the creditors in charge of economic policy . 
There is a center , led by Germany , and a periphery , consisting of the heavily indebted countries . 
The creditors &quot; imposition of strict austerity on the periphery is perpetuating the eurozone &apos;s division between center and periphery . 
Economic conditions are continuing to deteriorate , causing immense human suffering . 
The innocent , frustrated , and angry victims of austerity provide fertile ground for hate speech , xenophobia , and all forms of extremism . 
Thus , policies designed to preserve the financial system and the euro are transforming the EU into the opposite of an open society . 
There is an apparent contradiction between the euro &apos;s financial requirements and the EU &apos;s political objectives . 
The financial requirements could be met by replicating the arrangements that prevailed in the global economy in the 1980 &quot; s and dividing the eurozone into a center and periphery ; but that could not be reconciled with the principles of an open society . 
There are ways in which the policies pursued to preserve the euro could be modified to meet the EU &apos;s political objectives . 
For example , individual countries &quot; government bonds could be replaced by Eurobonds . 
Unfortunately , that is not the case . 
The financial problems are pressing - and monopolizing politicians &quot; attention . 
Europe &apos;s leaders are so preoccupied with the crisis of the day that they have no time to ponder the long-term consequences of their actions . 
As a result , they continue on a course that perpetuates the division between center and periphery . 
This is such a dismal prospect that it must not be allowed to happen . 
Originally , the EU was conceived as an instrument of solidarity and cooperation . 
Today , it is held together by grim necessity . 
That is not the Europe we want or need . 
We must reverse this intolerable transformation . 
We must find a way to recapture the spirit of solidarity and shared values that once inspired the European imagination .
