China &apos;s Inflation Muddle 
BEIJING - Even as the debt crises in Europe and the United States loom large and the global economic recovery falters , inflation is making a comeback worldwide . 
Indeed , emerging-market economies are bracing for a serious bout of it - together with the dire political consequences that it will bring . 
China &apos;s headline consumer price index ( CPI ) jumped 6.4 % year on year in June , reaching its highest level since July 2008 . 
Against the background of a shaky global recovery , concerns have grown considerably over a possible hard landing for the Chinese economy , caused by monetary tightening aimed at controlling inflation . 
In China , food prices account for about a third of the CPI basket , with the price of pork bearing a large weight . 
As a result , the CPI is jokingly called the &quot; pork price index . &quot; 
In June , pork prices rose 57 % year on year , contributing nearly two percentage points to the overall inflation rate . 
Unfortunately , macroeconomic policy can do little about the &quot; hog cycle &quot; and usually should not respond to it . 
While China &apos;s inflation problem should not be exaggerated , complacency would be dangerous . 
Current inflation is more broad-based than it appears , regardless of the controversy surrounding the adequacy of China &apos;s CPI basket in reflecting the reality of underlying price movements . 
In fact , annual increases in non-food prices accelerated to 3 % in June , up from 2.9 % in May . 
According to China &apos;s National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) , living expenses increased by 6.1 % year on year in May . 
Many worry that non-food prices may rise higher . 
Barring unexpected shocks , I believe that China &apos;s inflation may peak soon . 
From a macroeconomic perspective , China &apos;s current inflation is attributable both to demand-pull and cost-push factors . 
Historically , inflation in China has followed GDP growth with a lag . 
Today &apos;s inflationary pressures are partly the result of the lagged impact of the stimulus package that China adopted in 2009 to fight off the effects of the global financial crisis . 
But China &apos;s GDP growth has already started to fall towards its potential level , which , according to the consensus view , is around 9 % . 
In fact , most Chinese economists predicted last year that inflation would peak in early 2011 . 
Changes in China &apos;s financial conditions reinforce this view . 
Historically , there is a lag of 8-12 months between M1 monetary growth and inflation . 
The growth rate of M1 started to fall in late 2009 . 
If past experience is a reliable guide , a decline in inflation is already overdue . 
The interference of cost-push factors contributed to the unexpected persistence of inflation . 
The rise in commodity prices since mid-2010 - China &apos;s commodity price index has increased by more than 100 % since its 2009 low - has had an important impact . 
Moreover , Chinese wages have been rising rapidly . 
China &apos;s current macroeconomic situation shares many similarities with the situation that it faced in 2007 and the best part of 2008 , when , owing to strong investment and export demand , GDP growth surged significantly beyond its potential . 
Worried about worsening inflation and a budding real-estate bubble , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBC , the central bank ) gradually tightened its monetary stance . 
Yet inflation continued to worsen , peaking at 8.7 % in February 2008 . 
The most difficult period for Chinese decision-makers was between February and September 2008 , when , despite abundant signs of a softening in domestic demand , overall demand remained strong , as did inflation . 
To tighten or not to tighten : that was the question . 
The PBC continued to tighten . 
But the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 brought global economic growth to a screeching halt . 
China &apos;s GDP growth fell dramatically , owing to the collapse of external demand . 
To offset the negative shock , the Chinese government enacted a four-trillion-renminbi stimulus package , and the PBC shifted its policy stance abruptly . 
There is no question about the necessity for the turnaround . 
However , with hindsight , one might ask whether an earlier loosening by the PBC would have been wiser . 
With taming inflation its top priority , the PBC has raised banks &quot; mandatory reserve ratio six times this year . 
Commercial banks must deposit with the central bank 21.5 % of deposits as reserves . 
Recently , the PBC raised the one-year lending rate and the one-year deposit to 6.56 % and 3.5 % , respectively . 
Currently , China &apos;s inflation is not as bad as it was in 2007-2008 . 
The rise in house prices has begun to stabilize , and the impact of the rise in commodity prices is tapering off . 
External demand in the second half of 2011 is unlikely to be strong , owing to the shaky global recovery . 
The steady increase in production costs , partly attributable to high borrowing costs , is squeezing enterprises &quot; profit margins of - small and medium-sized enterprises in particular . 
Declining profits and rising enterprise bankruptcies are posing challenges to China &apos;s monetary authority . 
In view of the need for structural adjustment , the PBC should maintain a tight monetary stance . 
But , with a coming decline in headline inflation and mounting concerns about growth , the PBC is likely to prove a bit more accommodating in the second half of 2011 . 
In short , although China will miss its inflation target of 4 % for this year , price growth will remain under control . 
In the second half of 2011 , China &apos;s growth rate could fall further , but there will be no hard landing . 
China &apos;s economic problems are more structural than cyclical . 
Owing to a lack of distinct progress in restructuring and rebalancing the domestic economy , the next five years will be difficult , and the window of opportunity for adjustment will close rapidly . 
But , viewing China &apos;s performance in the context of the past 30 years , there is no reason to believe that the country cannot muddle through once again .
