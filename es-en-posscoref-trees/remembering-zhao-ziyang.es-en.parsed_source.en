Remembering Zhao Ziyang 
The conditions under which Zhao Ziyang lived at the time of his death , in utter isolation from Chinese society due to an illegally imposed 16-year house arrest , shames both Chinese justice and the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) . 
Zhao &apos;s persecution was the persecution of a leader who dedicated himself for over a decade to groundbreaking efforts that became the foundations of China &apos;s economic reform . 
In the late 1970 &quot; s , Chinese peasants had long since lost their rights to own their land , owing to collectivization and the establishment of the People &apos;s Commune . 
It is a right they have never regained . 
Zhao , however , was the first to advocate giving autonomy back to the peasants and so initiated the first pilot tests to abolish the People &apos;s Commune . 
Chinese industry had been transformed into subsidiaries of government through nationalization and central planning . 
Zhao was the first to propose &quot; expanded autonomy for Chinese enterprises &quot; and &quot; restoration of a healthy relationship between government and industry . &quot; 
Expanded autonomy for enterprises and the peasantry were critical first steps whose success led eventually to full-blown economic reform . 
These were among the many incremental victories Zhao won to help China &apos;s people break out of the suffocating stagnation of Maoist socialism . 
As China &apos;s Premier , Zhao implemented ten years of economic reforms that brought steady progress in which the people , especially the peasantry , enjoyed tangible improvements . 
But Zhao was also the only CCP leader to propose a political reform package to tackle China &apos;s system of one-party rule . 
The Party &apos;s unchallenged monopoly on political power systematically ensured that every mistake it made - such as the dreadful decade of the Cultural Revolution - turned into a prolonged nationwide crisis . 
For genuine and long-term stability , Zhao proposed reforms that ultimately aimed at the legalization and systemization of democracy . 
He wished to establish the kind of democratic politics that could support and nurture a healthy market economy . 
Although the short-term practical objectives of Zhao &apos;s political reforms were limited by the circumstances in which they were proposed , the measures all aimed at containing Communist Party power and represented a concrete step toward returning , peacefully , power to China &apos;s people . 
Zhao &apos;s package - a sharp break with Mao &apos;s totalitarianism - was approved by the 13th Party Congress , officially the highest authority within the CCP . 
During his twenty months as CCP General Secretary , Zhao created a culture in which the Politburo refrained from interfering in the courts , and he stopped its attempts to control literature and the arts . 
Zhao abolished the policy of enterprises being run by Party organizations and the system by which fa ren ( &quot; legal representatives &quot; ) were the core of enterprises . 
Unfortunately , Zhao &apos;s political reforms were terminated upon his fall from power . 
The dreadful result was the indiscriminate denial of civil rights and the principles of democracy , and the rise of what today &apos;s leaders call &quot; socialism with Chinese characteristics &quot; - a bitter euphemism for unchecked Party and government power entwined with commercial interests . 
Zhao &apos;s fate is also a chilling reminder of other injustices that are on the consciences of those now in power . 
The only reason for Zhao &apos;s continued ill treatment was his opposition to the violent repression of the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989 . 
It should have been his decision to make as General Secretary , but things were not as they should have been . 
It should be remembered that former General Secretary Hu Yaobang , who had been forced to step down two years earlier by Deng Xiaoping because of his liberal stance , died in April 1989 , triggering spontaneous and peaceful student demonstrations in Beijing , which spread across the country . 
Half a million college students in Beijing alone were involved in this movement . 
It lasted 50 days and was heartily supported by Beijing residents and people all around the country , from all walks of life . 
Zhao pointed out to the Politburo that the sentiments expressed by the students and residents in their commemoration of Hu , in their protests against corruption , and their desire for democracy were really the same sentiments that they themselves held . 
He believed that it should be possible to resolve the student protests and respect the principles of democracy and the rule of law . 
Under Zhao &apos;s direction , the Politburo and its Standing Committee called for dialogue with the students . 
This hopeful direction changed completely , however , when Deng Xiaoping revealed his desire for a violent crackdown . 
In the end , it came down to a fight among five members of the Politburo Standing Committee : Li Peng and Yao Yiling sought to deploy the military . 
Zhao opposed this . 
Qiao Shi and Hu Qili initially sided with Zhao , but then withdrew their support and , instead , asked Deng Xiaoping to make the final decision . 
With deep divisions evident , Deng chose to bypass all existing institutions , the Party &apos;s Politburo , the Central Committee , and the National People &apos;s Congress and its Standing Committee . 
Without further discussion , Deng mobilized 500,000 troops to enter Beijing to crack down on the unarmed students and civilians . 
The Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 was a tragedy for China , and another tragedy for the twentieth century . 
Sixteen years have passed , but the pain remains , buried in the hearts and minds of the people . 
In the years that have passed , China &apos;s leaders were responsible not only for Zhao &apos;s unlawful house arrest but also for a systematic effort to erase his name from history . 
But their attempts to conceal the truth about the past only reveal their weakness and their shamelessness . 
For one thing they cannot change : Zhao Ziyang remains with us , in the Chinese people &apos;s ongoing struggle for rights and democracy .
