A Korean Helsinki Process ? 
SEOUL - Last month , North and South Korea narrowly avoided a catastrophic military confrontation . 
After 40 hours of strenuous negotiations , the South agreed to stop loudspeaker broadcasts into the demilitarized zone between the two countries , in exchange for the North expressing &quot; regret &quot; for the South Korean soldiers killed by a landmine blast in the DMZ three weeks earlier . 
While the crisis featured North Korea &apos;s familiar belligerence and aggressive rhetoric , there were also some interesting new twists . 
Understanding these developments could help to generate enough momentum to initiate , after more than seven years of confrontation , genuine inter-Korean cooperation and help guide the peninsula toward a more peaceful and secure future . 
The first new development is the South Korean leadership &apos;s much firmer response to provocations from the North . 
In 2010 , the South Korean public was sharply critical of the military &apos;s failure to retaliate immediately following the North &apos;s sinking of the Cheonan , a South Korean warship carrying more than 100 personnel , and its shelling of Yeonpyeong Island later that year . 
After the recent landmine blasts , by contrast , President Park Geun-hye would not back down from her demands that the North , which denied planting the mines , apologize . 
Her approval ratings soared to 50 % , from around 34 % the previous month . 
This shift , while popular in South Korea , carries serious risks for the peninsula . 
If an unyielding South becomes engaged in another military game of chicken with the often-audacious and always-erratic North , the results could be catastrophic . 
In this sense , an institutional framework for permanent inter-Korean peace is more urgent than ever . 
The second development relates to China , which remained silent throughout the latest crisis - a significant departure from its stance in 2010 , when it actively sided with North Korea on the international diplomatic stage . 
Of course , it is impossible to know whether China &apos;s response this time marks a genuine strategic withdrawal from its role as the North &apos;s only ally and key economic benefactor . 
China &apos;s leaders may simply have decided that a tactical disciplining of the North &apos;s leadership was in order . 
But , at a time when China &apos;s relationship with South Korea is deepening , the silence has been deafening . 
If China really is distancing itself from North Korea , Kim Jong-un &apos;s regime will be almost entirely isolated internationally . 
Will Kim respond to that isolation recklessly , by continuing to antagonize the South , or pragmatically , by becoming more flexible ? 
That is not an easy question to answer . 
It should be clear to Kim by now that his parade of provocations is not benefiting his country . 
His bellicose behavior in 2013 , for example , worsened his relationships with China , South Korea , and the United States simultaneously ; and in the recent crisis , all he earned was a halt to mocking loudspeaker broadcasts . 
But Kim is not exactly known for his pragmatism or diplomacy . 
Kim &apos;s intentions may become clearer next month , when the North is expected to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Korean Workers &quot; Party by conducting a nuclear test and launching a new intercontinental missile . 
But China , South Korea , and the US - whose policies toward North Korea are now more closely aligned than ever - should not simply wait to see what happens . 
The third new development on the peninsula is a growing awareness among North Koreans of their country &apos;s dire situation . 
At this point , the shift is most apparent among North Korean soldiers in the DMZ , for whom the South &apos;s recent broadcasts were highly demoralizing . 
Today &apos;s young soldiers represent the so-called Jangmadang ( &quot; black market &quot; ) generation that came of age under the marketization process that followed the massive famine in the mid-1990s . 
Exposed to South Korean movies , music , and other products , they recognize the yawning gap between their government &apos;s propaganda and the country &apos;s grim reality . 
The South &apos;s loudspeaker broadcasts drove the point home . 
As the marketization process continues , soon it won &apos;t be just the soldiers who see through the regime &apos;s propaganda . 
The time for bottom-up change in the North may not be far off . 
This opens up a new policy option for the West : impelling North Korea to dial back its foreign and security policy by deepening its economic and social engagement with the rest of the world . 
The benefits for the North would drastically change the regime &apos;s strategic calculus , particularly concerning nuclear weapons . 
International linkages - or , rather , sanctions that blocked the benefits of such linkages - were vital to Libya &apos;s decision to denuclearize and Iran &apos;s willingness to reach an agreement with world powers regarding its nuclear program . 
Sanctions have been less effective in North Korea , largely because the population did not know what it was missing . 
Similarly , growing connections between groups within the Soviet bloc and the West played a major role in bringing about the 1975 Helsinki Accords . 
The accords represented an effort to improve East-West relations during the Cold War , and included an emphasis on human rights . 
Most important , they achieved the kind of sustained engagement that is badly needed on the Korean Peninsula today . 
Without such an approach , North and South Korea could , before long , be locked in another military standoff . 
The next one may not end so well as the last .
