Making the Euro Whole 
NEW YORK - The architects of the euro knew that it was incomplete when they designed it . 
The euro had a common central bank but no common treasury . 
This was unavoidable , because the Maastricht Treaty was meant to bring about a monetary union without a political union . 
European authorities were confident , however , that if and when the euro ran into a crisis , they would be able to overcome it . 
After all , that is how the European Union was created , taking one step at a time , knowing full well that additional steps would be required . 
With hindsight , one can identify other deficiencies in the euro of which its architects were unaware . 
The euro was supposed to bring about economic convergence , but it produced divergences instead , because its architects did not realize that imbalances may emerge not only in the public sector , but in the private sector as well . 
After the euro came into force , commercial banks could refinance their holdings of government bonds at the discount window of the European Central Bank , and regulators treated government bonds as riskless . 
This caused interest-rate differentials between various countries to shrink , which generated real-estate booms in the weaker economies and reduced their competitiveness . 
At the same time , Germany , suffering from the after-effects of reunification , had to tighten its belt . 
Trade unions agreed to concessions on wages and working conditions in exchange for job security . 
That is how the divergences emerged . 
Yet the banks continued to load up on the government bonds of the weaker countries in order to benefit from the minuscule interest-rate differentials that still remained . 
The consequences of the lack of a common treasury first became apparent after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 , when governments , in order to prevent financial markets from collapsing , had to guarantee that no other systemically important financial institution would be allowed to fail . 
At that time , Angela Merkel rejected a Europe-wide guarantee , insisting that each country should guarantee its own institutions . 
Interestingly , interest-rate differentials widened only in 2010 , when the newly elected Greek government announced that the previous government had vastly understated the true fiscal deficit . 
That was the start of the euro crisis . 
The lack of a common treasury is now in the process of being remedied , first by a rescue package for Greece , then by creating a temporary emergency facility , and - the financial authorities being a little bit pregnant - eventually by establishing some permanent institution . 
Unfortunately , it is equally certain that the new arrangements will also be flawed . 
Besides the lack of a common treasury , the euro suffers from other shortcomings , which the authorities do not seem to have fully understood . 
This complicates matters enormously . 
The authorities are confronted by not only a currency crisis , but also a banking crisis and a crisis in macroeconomic theory . 
The authorities are committing at least two mistakes . 
One is that the bondholders of insolvent banks are being protected at the expense of taxpayers for fear of provoking a financial crisis . 
This is politically unacceptable . 
The Irish government elected next spring is bound to repudiate the current arrangements . 
Markets recognize this , which is why the Irish rescue brought no relief . 
Second , high interest rates charged on rescue packages make it impossible for weaker countries to improve their competitiveness vis-Ã -vis stronger ones . 
Divergences will continue to widen , and weaker countries will continue to weaken indefinitely . 
Mutual resentment between creditors and debtors is liable to grow , and there is a real danger that the euro may destroy the EU &apos;s political and social cohesion . 
Both mistakes can be corrected . 
With regard to the first , emergency funds ought to be used to recapitalize the banking systems , as well as to provide loans to sovereign states . 
The former would be a more efficient use of funds than the latter . 
Properly capitalizing the banking system would leave countries with smaller deficits , enabling them to regain access to capital markets sooner . 
It is better to inject equity into the banks now rather than later , and it is better to do it on a Europe-wide basis than leave each country to act on its own . 
This would create a European regulatory regime . 
Europe-wide regulation of banks encroaches on national sovereignty less than European control over fiscal policy . 
And European control over banks is less amenable to political abuse than national control . 
With regard to the second problem , the interest rate on rescue packages should be reduced to the rate at which the EU itself can borrow on the market . 
This would have the advantage of developing an active Eurobond market . 
These two structural changes may not be sufficient to provide the eurozone countries in need of rescue an escape route from their predicament . 
Additional measures , such as &quot; haircuts &quot; for holders of sovereign debt , may be needed . 
Having been properly recapitalized , banks could absorb this , and two obvious mistakes that condemn the EU to a bleak future would be remedied .
