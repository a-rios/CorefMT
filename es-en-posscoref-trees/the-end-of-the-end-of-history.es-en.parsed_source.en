The End of the End of History 
Throughout modern times liberal states have always co-existed alongside many kinds of tyranny . 
Similarly , the modern world has always contained numerous economic systems - many varieties of capitalism , planned and guided economies , and a host of hybrid economic systems not easily classified . 
Diplomacy and international law developed to cope with the fact of diverse regimes . 
Yet throughout the 20 th century global politics was shaped by the project of unifying the world within a single regime . 
Insofar as it remained committed to Marxist ideology , the long-term goal of the Soviet regime was world communism . 
The whole world was to be a single socialist economy , administered by forms of governance that were to be everywhere the same . 
This Marxist project is now widely and rightly viewed as utopian . 
Even so , its disappearance as a force in world politics has not been accompanied by an acceptance of a diversity of political systems . 
With communism &apos;s fall we were , in Francis Fukuyama &apos;s famous phrase , at the &quot; end of history , &quot; a time when western governments could dedicate themselves to unifying the international system into a single regime based on free markets and democratic government . 
But this project is as utopian as Marxism once was , and promises to be considerably more short-lived than the Soviet Union . 
Many reasons exist for why the Soviet bloc collapsed , but - contrary to conventional opinion - economic inefficiencies were not central among them . 
The Soviet bloc disintegrated because it could not cope with nationalist dissent in Poland and the Baltic states and more generally because a single economic and political system could not meet the needs of vastly different societies and peoples . 
Marxism is a version of economic determinism . 
It predicts that differences between societies and peoples narrow as they achieve similar levels of economic development . 
Nationalism and religion have no enduring political importance , Marxists believed . 
In the short run , they can be used to fuel anti-imperialist movements . 
Ultimately , they are obstacles to the construction of socialism . 
Guided by these beliefs , the Soviet state waged an incessant war on the national and religious traditions of the peoples they governed . 
In practice , Soviet rulers were compelled to compromise in order to remain in power . 
Few could be described as wholehearted ideologues . 
Even so , the Soviet system &apos;s rigidity was largely the result of the fact that it was established on a false premise . 
The basis of the Soviet system was the Marxian interpretation of history in which every society is destined to adopt the same economic system and the same form of government . 
The USSR fell apart because its monolithic institutions could not accommodate nations - Czechs and Uzbeks , Hungarians and Siberians , Poles and Mongols - whose histories , circumstances and aspirations were radically divergent . 
Today , the global free market constructed in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse is also falling apart - and for similar reasons . 
Like Marxists , neo-liberals are economic determinists . 
They believe that countries everywhere are destined to adopt the same economic system and therefore the same political institutions . 
Nothing can prevent the world from becoming one vast free market ; but the inevitable process of convergence can be accelerated . 
Western governments and transnational institutions can act as midwives for the new world . 
Implausible as it sounds , this ideology underlies institutions such as the International Monetary Fund . 
Argentina and Indonesia have very different problems , but for the IMF the solution is the same : they must both become free-market economies . 
Russia at the time of communism &apos;s fall was a militarized rust-belt , but the IMF was convinced that it could be transformed into a western-style market economy . 
An idealized model of Anglo-Saxon capitalism was promoted everywhere . 
Unsurprisingly , this highly ideological approach to economic policy has not succeeded . 
Indonesia is in ruins , while Argentina is rapidly ceasing to be a first-world country . 
Russia has put the neo-liberal period behind it and is now developing on a path better suited to its history and circumstances . 
Countries that have best weathered the economic storms of the past few years are those - like India , China and Japan - which took the IMF model with a large grain of salt . 
To be sure , like the few remaining Marxists who defend central economic planning , the ideologues of the IMF claim that their policies did not fail ; they were not fully implemented . 
But this response is disingenuous . 
In both cases , the policies were tried - and failed at great human cost . 
If the global free market is unraveling , it is not because of the human costs of its policies in countries such as Argentina , Indonesia and Russia . 
It is because it no longer suits the countries that most actively promote it . 
Under the pressure of a stock market downturn , the US is abandoning policies of global free trade in favor of more traditional policies of protectionism . 
This turn of events is not surprising . 
Throughout its history , America has always tried to insulate its markets from foreign competition . 
So history has once more triumphed over ideology . 
With America &apos;s loss of interest the chief prop of neo-liberal policies has been pulled away . 
Mainstream politicians may still nod reverently when the global free market is invoked , but in practice the world is reverting to an older and more durable model . 
It is being tacitly accepted that in future , as in the past , the world will contain a variety of economic systems and regimes . 
The global free market is about to join communism in history &apos;s museum of discarded utopias .
