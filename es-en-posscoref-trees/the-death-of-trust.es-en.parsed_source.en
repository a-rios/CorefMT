The Death of Trust 
BANGKOK - A friend recently asked a seemingly na√Øve question : &quot; What is money ? 
How do I know I can trust that it is worth what it says it is worth ? &quot; 
We learn in introductory economics that money is a medium of exchange . 
But why do we accept that ? 
Banknotes are just pieces of paper with a number attached to them . 
We believe in banknotes because we collectively decide to trust the government when it says that 100 is 100 , not 10 or 50 . 
Money , therefore , is about trust , without which no society can function . 
Just as we obey our leaders &quot; orders to fight and die because we trust their judgment , we entrust our careers and our money to those who run Citigroup and Goldman Sachs and other such banks , because we believe their leaders will be fair to their employees and clients , and honorable in their business practices . 
We do not grow up wishing to work for crooks and liars . 
Once that trust breaks , bad things happen . 
Money ceases to have credibility . 
Leaders become figures of contempt or worse . 
As I write , inflation in Zimbabwe has reached an unimaginable ( if not unpronounceable ) level of more than 500 quintillion per cent . 
One quintillion is one million trillion . 
A year ago , inflation was &quot; only &quot; 100,000 % . 
This is what happens when trust vanishes . 
Fortunately , Zimbabwe is not a country of real consequence for world stability . 
But the Weimar Republic and China in the 1940 &quot; s were . 
One opted for Hitler and the other for Mao Zedong to restore trust . 
So the risks are clear . 
Are we now seeing an erosion of trust in America and in the United Kingdom ? 
The first warning sign surfaced in 2001 , with the bankruptcy of Enron in the United States . 
Its fraudulent accounts were certified by Arthur Andersen . 
Now , India &apos;s Satyam , audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers , is found to be missing billions in cash . 
If we cannot rely on the best auditors , can we continue to trust chartered accountants ? 
Bond rating agencies have issued misleading ratings on companies in questionable health . 
Will we ever again be able to trust a triple A rating issued by , say , Moody &apos;s ? 
Banks have been holding our money for safekeeping since the fourteenth century , when the Florentines invented the practice . 
The Royal Bank of Scotland , founded in 1727 , when laissez-faire philosopher Adam Smith was only four years old , has just become a socialist state-owned-enterprise thanks to the bank &apos;s incompetent leaders , who acquired over-priced banks filled with toxic assets . 
Citicorp , Bank of America , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , and other symbols of &quot; excellence &quot; all would have collapsed but for public bailouts . 
And yet for decades we thought that the people who were managing those firms were much smarter than we were . 
We grew up admiring leaders such as Robert Rubin , John Thain , and Henry Paulson . 
Rubin , a former US Treasury Secretary and ex-Chairman of Goldman Sachs , presided over the collapse of Citigroup while taking home $ 150 million in bonuses . 
Should he really have been rewarded at all for his &quot; performance &quot; ? 
Just this week , the technically bankrupt Citigroup &apos;s senior executives were about to buy a new $ 50 million luxury French jet for themselves , until the White House stopped it . 
Thain , also a former president of Goldman Sachs , helped himself and his Merrill Lynch staff to $ 4 billion in bonus payments even after he had to sell the firm to Bank of America to save it from bankruptcy . 
After he was caught spending $ 1.2 million , even as Merrill Lynch disintegrated , to decorate his new office , Bank of America had to fire him to placate growing revulsion over Wall Street &apos;s out-of-control culture of entitlement . 
Paulson , the outgoing Treasury Secretary and another Goldman Sachs veteran , left a loophole in his rescue package big enough for a truck to drive through . 
That loophole allowed his former friends and colleagues on Wall Street to pay themselves billion-dollar bonuses while keeping those firms afloat with taxpayers &quot; money . 
The universities these men attended - Harvard and Yale for Rubin ; 
MIT and Harvard for Thain ; 
Dartmouth and Harvard for Paulson - have been magnets for the world &apos;s finest young minds . 
The rest of us thought that these institutions could instill the wisdom , insight , and character of which we all wished we had more . 
Perhaps parents all over the world should re-examine their often obsessive craving for these &quot; name-brand &quot; universities , pushing their children as if an Ivy League degree was an end in itself . 
Now we know that Wall Street &apos;s titans were never all that smart , and certainly not very ethical , for they failed the only test that counts . 
All of the firms they led collapsed , and were saved only by money from those who could never get a senior job on Wall Street or a place at Harvard . 
These Wall Street princes were smarter in one way , however : they managed to pocket a fortune while the rest of us are stuck with the mess they left behind . 
Bernard Madoff who hailed from down-market part of New York City and attended a middling university will spend time behind bars , but none of the titans of Wall Street with blue-chip pedigree will ever do so . 
History has not been kind to societies that lose trust in the integrity of their leaders and institutions . 
We need to save our economic system from its abusers , or else .
