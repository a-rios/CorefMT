Doing Development Better 
CAMBRIDGE - Jim Yong Kim &apos;s appointment as World Bank president may have been predictable , given the long-standing tradition that renders the selection an American prerogative . 
But even the appearance of competition between Kim and the other candidates , Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Jos√© Antonio Ocampo , served to expose a deep fissure within the field of development policy , because Kim and his two rivals represented dramatically different approaches . 
The vision for which Kim stands is bottom-up . 
It focuses directly on the poor , and on delivering services - for example , education , health care , and microcredit - to their communities . 
This tradition &apos;s motto could be , &quot; Development is accomplished one project at a time . &quot; 
The other approach , represented by Okonjo-Iweala and Ocampo , takes an economy-wide approach . 
It emphasizes broad reforms that affect the overall economic environment , and thus focuses on areas such as international trade , finance , macroeconomics , and governance . 
Practitioners in the first group idolize NGO leaders like Mohammad Yunus , whose Grameen Bank pioneered microfinance , and Ela Bhatt , a founder of India &apos;s Self-Employment Women &apos;s Association ( SEWA ) . 
The heroes of the second group are reformist finance or economy ministers such as India &apos;s Manmohan Singh or Brazil &apos;s Fernando Henrique Cardoso . 
At first sight , this might seem like another dispute between economists and non-economists , but the rift runs within , rather than between , disciplinary boundaries . 
For example , recent work with field experiments and randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , which has caught on like wildfire among development economists , lies strictly in the tradition of bottom-up development . 
The relative effectiveness of the two visions is not easy to determine . 
Proponents of the macro approach point out that the greatest development successes have typically been the product of economy-wide reforms . 
The dramatic reductions in poverty achieved by China over the span of a few decades , as well as by other East Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan , resulted largely from improved economic management ( as much as earlier investments in education and health may have played a role ) . 
Reforms in incentives and property-rights arrangements , not anti-poverty programs , enabled these economies to take off . 
The trouble is that these experiences have not proved as informative for other countries as one might have wished . 
Asian-style reforms do not travel well , and , in any case , there is significant controversy about the role of specific policies . 
In particular , was the key to the Asian miracle economic liberalization or the limits that were placed on it ? 
Moreover , the macro tradition vacillates between specific recommendations ( &quot; set low and uniform tariffs , &quot; &quot; remove interest-rate ceilings on banks , &quot; &quot; improve your &quot; doing business &quot; ranking &quot; ) that find limited support in cross-country evidence , and broad recommendations that lack operational content ( &quot; integrate into world economy , &quot; &quot; achieve macroeconomic stability , &quot; &quot; improve contract enforcement &quot; ) . 
Development specialists in the bottom-up tradition , for their part , can deservedly claim success in demonstrating the effectiveness of education , public health , or microcredit projects in specific contexts . 
But , too often , such projects treat poverty &apos;s symptoms rather than its causes . 
Poverty is often best addressed not by helping the poor to be better at what they are already doing , but by getting them to do something altogether different . 
This calls for diversification of production , urbanization , and industrialization , which in turn require policy interventions that may lie at considerable distance from the poor ( such as fixing regulations or targeting the value of the currency ) . 
Moreover , as with macro-level economic reforms , there are limits to what can be learned from individual projects . 
An RCT conducted under specific conditions does not generate usable hard evidence for policymakers in other settings . 
Learning requires some degree of extrapolation , converting randomized evaluations from hard evidence into soft evidence . 
The good news is that there has been real progress in development policy , and , beneath the doctrinal differences , is a certain convergence - not on what works , but on how we should think about and do development policy . 
The best of the recent work in the two traditions shares common predilections . 
Both favor diagnostic , pragmatic , experimental , and context-specific strategies . 
Conventional development policy has been prone to fads , moving from one big fix to another . 
Development is held back by too little government , too much government , too little credit , the absence of property rights , and so on . 
The remedy is planning , the Washington Consensus , microcredit , or distributing land titles to the poor . 
By contrast , the new approaches are agnostic . 
They acknowledge that we do not know what works , and that the binding constraints to development tend to be context-specific . 
Policy experimentation is a central part of discovery , coupled with monitoring and evaluation to close the learning loop . 
Experiments do not need to be of the RCT type ; 
China certainly learned from its policy experiments without a proper control group . 
Reformers in this mold are suspicious of &quot; best practices &quot; and universal blueprints . 
They look instead for policy innovations , small and large , that are tailored to local economic circumstances and political complications . 
The field of development policy can and should be reunified around these shared diagnostic , contextual approaches . 
Macro-development economists need to recognize the advantages of the experimental approach and adopt the policy mindset of enthusiasts of randomized evaluation . 
Micro-development economists need to recognize that one can learn from diverse types of evidence , and that , while randomized evaluations are tremendously useful , the utility of their results is often restricted by the narrow scope of their application . 
In the end , both camps should show greater humility : macro-development practitioners about what they already know , and micro-development practitioners about what they can learn .
