The Sugar Season 
The holiday season that is now upon us is a time for festivity , and usually of overeating . 
In fact , this seasonal upsurge in sugar consumption is just part of a huge transition in world health that is now underway . 
Many countries , especially developing countries , are facing the consequences of huge changes in lifestyle : modifications in diet , lower levels of physical activity , and increased tobacco use . 
These changes are determined , to a large extent , by the globalization and expansion of food markets , and by ever-greater levels of urbanization . 
Both of these factors incite sedentary behavior at home and at work , as well as profound alterations in dietary habits . 
So it should be no surprise that noncommunicable diseases ( NCD &apos;s ) , including cardiovascular diseases ( CVD &apos;s ) , obesity , diabetes and cancer , now kill roughly 33 million people around the world each year , and cause almost 60 % of total deaths . 
Indeed , they account for almost half the global burden of disease . 
By 2020 , that contribution is expected to rise to 73 % of all deaths and 60 % of the global burden of disease . 
Moreover , more than 60 % these deaths occur in the developing world , and here NCD &apos;s increasingly appear in younger age groups , which can have huge implications for how productive a country &apos;s workers are . 
Recent data from China reflect the extent of the problem . 
In China &apos;s rural areas , with more than 800 million people , NDC &apos;s account for more than 80 % of deaths . 
Many countries are now afflicted by a double burden of diseases . 
Countries that still struggle with malnutrition and illnesses like malaria , tuberculosis , and HIV / AIDS , now must contend with an explosion of CVD &apos;s , diabetes , and obesity , as well as soaring rates of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol . 
Indeed , five of the 10 leading causes of death worldwide are related to diet and physical activity : high blood pressure , high cholesterol , low intake of fruit and vegetables , high body mass index , and insufficient exercise . 
Clearly , effective strategies to tackle the NCD burden require a critical examination of what people are eating and their levels of physical activity . 
The World Health Organization , together with a group of international experts , has developed a global strategy on diet , physical activity , and health over a period of 18 months through an extensive series of consultations in more than 80 countries , and with the input of United Nations bodies , civic groups , and food producers . 
One of the strategy &apos;s key conclusions is that reducing the burden of NCD &apos;s requires a multi-sectoral approach . 
Like a toolbox , the strategy provides WHO members with a comprehensive range of policy options from which to choose . 
Governments can act . 
Transport ministries should provide safe roads so that children can bike to school . 
Finance ministers could tax unhealthy food and subsidize healthy food . 
Education ministers should demand healthy school meals . 
Many countries are already developing their own national strategies . 
Most of what WHO is recommending has been endorsed by public health officials for many years . 
Of course , there is considerable debate about what precisely makes for a healthy diet . 
This debate is both welcome and to be expected ; improving diet and finding ways to increase physical activity is a complex issue . 
Moreover. there will always be groups with their own interests , using arguments that we do not have sufficient evidence to act . 
The strongest critique has come from sugar associations , who claim that the upper limit of 10 % on caloric intake from sugar is not based upon scientific evidence . 
However , more than twenty national and international reports from around the world by scientific bodies governing dietary recommendations set similar or lower targets for sugar intake . 
The growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health . 
The implementation of the WHO &apos;s strategy could lead to one of the largest-ever positive shifts in human health , putting populations throughout the world on pathways to lifelong and sustained improvements in well-being .
