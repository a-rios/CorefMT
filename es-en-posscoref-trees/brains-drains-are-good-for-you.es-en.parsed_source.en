Brains Drains Are Good for You 
Societies that take in &quot; brain drained &quot; scientists and others benefit enormously . 
Innovative and entrepreneurial French Huguenots contributed mightily to the launch of the Industrial Revolution in Britain . 
American universities benefited mightily from refugee German Jews fleeing Adolf Hitler . 
Today &apos;s Silicon Valley would not be what it is without its brilliant Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs . 
The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich ( ETH ) has the highest number of Nobel Prize winners of any institution in the world , no doubt partly due to the fact that 35 % of its faculty is foreign . 
From Cordoba 1000 years ago to California today , the most intellectually stimulating places are crossroads for bright people from different cultures . 
Societies that fail to attract foreign brains stagnate . 
Take Japan . 
Japan &apos;s homogeneity helped create the economic nationalism that drove the country for several decades , but today most of Japan &apos;s universities , research institutes and laboratories , think-tanks and elite publications , suffer from sclerotic inbreeding . 
Japan &apos;s current lethargy is due , in part , to the in-bred languor of Japanese intellectual life . 
But aren &apos;t countries that export their &quot; brains &quot; impoverished by the process ? 
It depends . 
Spain , for example , saw its best minds drained away for five centuries , notably following Fascism &apos;s victory in the Spanish Civil War . 
When Franco died in 1975 , Spain &apos;s future path was not obvious , as evidenced by the attempted coup of February 1981 . 
Poor , dictatorial , marginalized from Europe , Spain &apos;s experience during the last quarter- century is one of history &apos;s most successful transition stories , as it became a prosperous , thriving democracy and ceased being a major exporter of brains . 
Indeed , many of Spain &apos;s best minds have returned home . 
Historically , a big exporter of people , per inhabitant , has been Ireland . 
Poverty and the rigid social control of a reactionary Roman Catholic Church made the country inhospitable to intellectual life  -  to Britain &apos;s and America &apos;s great advantage , because both received many bright Irish fleeing the stultifying intellectual life of their homeland . 
As generally happens , the less intellectually endowed remained behind . 
Yet , from Third World poverty levels two decades ago , Ireland has surpassed its former colonial master in GDP per capita . 
Becoming a committed European player , fostering foreign direct investment , including venture businesses , promoting financial services and IT resulted in a formidable brain drain reversal for Ireland . 
After Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan in 1949 to form the Republic of China in opposition to Mao &apos;s People &apos;s Republic , he sought to maintain his dictatorial regime but was made to recognize the importance of building Taiwan &apos;s economy so as to strengthen the island . 
Thanks to generous US aid  - Taiwan was for several decades second only to Israel in the amount of American aid received  - Taiwan could send its best university students , especially engineers , to study abroad . 
Now Taiwan has the highest proportion of engineers to total population in the world . 
Many Taiwanese engineers studied in prestigious American universities , with the result that in Boston people sometimes refer to M.I.T. as &quot; Made in Taiwan &quot; rather than the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
As late as the 1980s , only two out of ten Taiwanese who studied in the US returned home , due to its bleak social , intellectual and political environment . 
Then Taiwan did several things : by establishing science parks , it provided a good environment for R D ; by deregulating , it provided opportunities for entrepreneurs ; last , but emphatically not least , by ending the dictatorship and ushering in democracy , it provided the basis for that universal desire of people to pursue their individual freedom and happiness . 
In the 1990s , thanks to its returning brains , Taiwan became a high-tech powerhouse . 
South Korea &apos;s story over the last 50 years parallels Taiwan &apos;s story . 
The military dictatorship established by Park Chung-hee in 1962 adopted an aggressive economic development policy , partly to contain North Korea . 
The Park government recognized the importance of investing in education , including primary , secondary and tertiary . 
The problem for a dictator in building universities is that students are needed , and students often protest ! 
Once Korean students overthrew the dictatorship of Park &apos;s successor , Chung Doo-hwan , Korean scientists , engineers , economists , and others , returned home en masse , bringing knowledge acquired in the US with them . 
So a brain drain can be a good thing for recipient countries and also for brain exporting countries . 
Good , that is , if the drain is reversed one day . 
Most people everywhere prefer to stay home , or return home , rather than live in permanent exile . Kimchi is simply not as good in Los Angeles as in Pusan , nor is chapathi as good in Manchester as in Hyderabad . 
Brain drains put enormous pressure on brain exporting countries to improve their governance , their institutions , and their economic and their social freedoms . 
Such improvements are the ultimate test of a successful society . 
For this reason especially , but also for many others , the more brains that are drained , the better !
