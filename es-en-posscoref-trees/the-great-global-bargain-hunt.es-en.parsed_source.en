The Great Global Bargain Hunt 
TOKYO - Few recent elections have grabbed world attention in the way that Greece &apos;s vote on June 17 did . 
Now that the center-right New Democracy , which finished first , has formed a coalition government with the center-left PASOK and the Democratic Left , the key issue for Prime Minister Antonis Samaras &apos;s administration is whether it can implement the austerity measures agreed with Greece &apos;s eurozone partners in exchange for continued support from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union . 
The situation remains dangerous - and not only for Greece . 
Spain and Italy face the redemption of government bonds valued at € 13.2 billion ( $ 16.5 billion ) and € 17 billion , respectively , in July , with redemptions continuing every month thereafter like an unstoppable tsunami , ensuring continued turmoil in Europe and beyond . 
Given the global menace posed by Europe &apos;s sovereign-debt and banking crises , measures to strengthen the European banking system and encourage fiscal integration gained some momentum at the recent G-20 summit in Los Cabos , Mexico . 
The summit &apos;s concluding statement declared that countries with ample finances are prepared to provide economic stimulus if growth weakens . 
One result of this promise is that pledges to boost the IMF &apos;s funding have now reached $ 456 billion . 
These pledges come on top of the $ 430 billion expansion of IMF funding that was announced in April , so the Fund should have the financial firepower to act in any crisis - if , that is , the money pledged at the G-20 summit is actually contributed . 
The BRICS ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) , which are all members of the G-20 , now account for 43 % of the world &apos;s population and 18 % its economy . 
Their share of &quot; international responsibility &quot; was revealed at the recent summit : contributions to the IMF of $ 43 billion by China , $ 10 billion by Brazil , Russia , and India , and $ 2 billion by South Africa . 
Mexico , the G-20 &quot; s host , also pledged $ 10 billion . 
This renewed international cooperation was intended , of course , to protect the global financial system . 
Various countries , however , are also strengthening their own positions with little regard for the impact of their actions on the international financial system . 
The most active of these countries is , of course , China , which can call upon its vast and still-rising foreign reserves of $ 3.3 trillion to push its interests in every corner of the globe . 
For example , although China has done little to bolster the Greek government &apos;s balance sheet , its active approach to the crisis has been conspicuous . 
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited Greece in October 2010 and agreed to strengthen cooperation between China and Greece during a meeting with then-Prime Minister George Papandreou - timely support that the weakened Greek government was delighted to receive . 
But the form of Chinese support for Greece will likely benefit China far more than Greece in the long term . 
Indeed , in an editorial published on June 15 , China Daily described Greece as a &quot; gateway &quot; for China into Europe . 
Already , the China Ocean Shipping Company ( COSCO ) has obtained a 35-year lease to operate the second pier at the port of Piraeus , one of the busiest in the world , for € 3.5 billion , and has purchased a truck-loading facility and packaging center in the Piraeus suburbs . 
The company has also expressed its intention to acquire 23 % of Piraeus Port Authority , and is seeking to lease or acquire ports on the island of Crete . 
Likewise , though COSCO &apos;s bid for the Thessaloniki Container Terminal met local opposition , Chinese investors are in negotiations with the Greek government to acquire a 20-year interest ( 2026-2046 ) in Athens International Airport for € 500 million . 
China may look like a white knight for Greece , which remains mired in fiscal crisis and severe recession ; but this was also a perfect chance for China to go bargain hunting around the world . 
So instead of using its vast foreign exchange reserves to bolster the international system , China is picking up strategic assets on the cheap . 
Consider Iceland , which suffered bitterly following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 . 
An enormous Chinese Embassy has been built in Reykjavik with an eye to improving China &apos;s intelligence about future developments in the Arctic Ocean . 
For almost a decade , people have wondered how China would use its gargantuan foreign-exchange reserves , particularly whether it would challenge the supremacy of the dollar . 
It now seems clear that China intends to use its foreign reserves to further its own global geopolitical strategy , not to buttress the international system that has enabled its three-decade boom . 
As governments and citizens around the world become aware of the influence that China can buy with its deep pockets , is an anti-Chinese backlash inevitable ? 
Or have some countries been so scarred by the financial crisis that they don &apos;t care where their next meal ticket comes from ? 
Time will tell , but there is a danger that Chinese hubris is beginning to extend to global finance .
