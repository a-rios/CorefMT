America \ u0027s Crisis Election 
CAMBRIDGE - On November 4 , Americans will elect their 44th president amidst the worst financial turmoil the country has known since the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 . Both candidates are United States senators with little experience as executives , so their ability to manage the crisis has become a central issue in the election . 
At the beginning of the campaign , many observers predicted that Iraq would be the major issue in 2008 . 
Instead , it is the financial crisis . 
In principle , this should help Barack Obama and the Democrats , because polls show them stronger on economic issues , whereas Republicans and John McCain do better on security issues . 
After the Republican convention , polls showed McCain ahead in early September , but after the financial meltdown , Obama took the lead . 
Although both men have warily embraced the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial sector , the contrasts between the two men are sharp . 
Obama is not only the first African-American nominee of a major party , but also one of the youngest candidates ever . 
McCain has experience as a naval aviator and more than two decades in the Senate . 
If elected , he would be the oldest incoming president . 
The two men differ in temperament as well as experience . 
McCain is a man of strong traditional values who prides himself on his willingness to act quickly and decisively , which he sought to do during the negotiations on the bailout by suspending his campaign to return to Washington . 
That effort appears to have backfired , because the Republicans that he leads initially balked at passing the legislation . 
But McCain has shown himself to be resilient . 
In 2007 , many people wrote off his campaign , but he had the skills to resurrect it and capture the Republican nomination . 
His choice of Alaska &apos;s Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate shook up the presidential campaign . 
Obama , while an inspirational orator , has shown a cool and calm demeanor in responding to both the financial crisis and the turbulence of political campaigning . 
When embarrassed by comments made by the pastor of his church , he delivered an exceptional speech about race in America . 
If anything , some of Obama &apos;s Democratic supporters wish he would show more emotion in responding to criticism . 
One should be careful , however , about reading too much into national opinion polls measuring the candidates &quot; popular support . 
American presidents are elected by an Electoral College in which each state votes in proportion to the number of members it has in Congress . 
Since even the smallest states have two senators , this leads to overrepresentation of lightly populated Western states that tend to vote Republican . 
In 2000 , Al Gore won the popular vote , but George W. Bush prevailed in the electoral college . 
Thus , the two candidates &quot; campaigns are focusing heavily on a dozen or so states in which voters are closely divided and could sway the electoral college outcome . 
Each campaign is now desperately trying to gauge the impact of the financial crisis on these battleground states . 
Not only does the Electoral College confuse predictions based on national opinion polls , but there is also the possibility of surprises which can lead to last-minute reversals . 
A mistake in a presidential debate can turn the tide of public opinion overnight , as happened to President Gerald Ford in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1976 . 
Conversely , Ronald Reagan &apos;s performance in his debate with Carter in 1980 is often credited with his victory . 
Another event that could turn the tables would be an &quot; October surprise &quot; associated with terrorism , which could switch the agenda from the financial crisis back to security , the Republicans &quot; stronger suit . 
In 2004 , shortly before the election , Osama bin Laden released a video tape that may have helped President Bush defeat Senator John Kerry . 
From bin Laden &apos;s point of view , Bush &apos;s policies were more useful for his efforts to recruit supporters than Kerry &apos;s might have been . 
One would assume that Obama would prove even more unsettling to bin Laden . 
A recent BBC poll of 22 countries found that if the world could vote , Obama would win in a landslide . 
The pro-Obama margin varied from 82 % in Kenya ( where Obama &apos;s father was born ) to 9 % in India . 
But Americans do not like outside interference in their elections . 
When Obama attracted a crowd of 200,000 to a speech in Berlin last summer , Republicans criticized him as an elitist who appeals to crowds overseas but not to blue-collar workers at home . 
On the other hand , in a September poll that asked Americans to rate a series of foreign-policy goals for the next president , 83 % ranked &quot; improving America &apos;s standing in the world &quot; as most important . 
And certainly the election of the first African-American as president would do wonders to restore the soft power that the Bush administration squandered over the past eight years . 
Some people worry that Obama might be good for American soft power , but not for its hard power . 
Machiavelli famously said that it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved . 
Machiavelli may be correct , but we sometimes forget that the opposite of love is not fear , but hatred . 
And Machiavelli made it clear that hatred is something a prince should carefully avoid . 
When the exercise of hard power undercuts soft power , it makes leadership more difficult - as Bush found out after the invasion of Iraq . 
Both McCain and Obama possess impressive hard-power political and organizational skills ; otherwise , they would not be where they are today . 
But when it comes to the soft power skills of emotional intelligence , vision , and communication , Obama outranks McCain . 
Whether that will sway American voters wary of financial turmoil on November 4 remains to be seen .
