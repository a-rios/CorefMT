Can Radiation Be Good For You ? 
STANFORD - The earthquake- and tsunami-related problems at Japan &apos;s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plant have inspired endless commentary and speculation . 
Unfortunately , much of the debate about the disaster and its implications has been uninformed and problematic . 
Radiation levels have increased by as much as 400 times the normal level 12 miles from the Fukushima plant ; increased radioactivity has been found in milk , fish , and a variety of vegetables farmed in the region ; and drinking water in Tokyo , 140 miles ( 225 kilometers ) from Fukushima , has been declared unsuitable for consumption by infants . 
Several countries have banned imports of milk and vegetables from the affected region . 
What are we to make of all this ? 
Radiation at these levels poses a minimal threat to human health for anyone outside the immediate area of the nuclear-power station itself . 
Most of the radiation is Iodine-131 , which is good news for several reasons . 
First , this isotope has a short half-life - only about eight days - so it decays to negligible levels in a short time ( in 10 weeks , less than 0.1 % is left . ) 
Second , it indicates that the source of the radiation is the reactor itself , rather than spent fuel rods ( which harbor much longer-lived and more dangerous radioisotopes ) . 
Third , a readily available and effective antidote exists for those at risk : non-radioactive iodine , available in tablets or liquid , which blocks the uptake of I-131 into the thyroid gland . 
Moreover , limits for radioactivity in food commonly incorporate orders of magnitude of the margin of safety , and are predicated on long-term ingestion . 
And Japan &apos;s limits for radiation exposure are even more conservative ( i.e. , lower ) than those set by international agencies . 
Another factor that might mitigate radiation damage is a phenomenon called hormesis - a biphasic dose-response relationship in which something such as a toxic heavy metal or ionizing radiation that is harmful at moderate to high doses may actually produce adaptive beneficial effects at low doses . 
In other words , we don &apos;t see a completely linear relationship between the dose of the potential toxin and a deleterious effect ; rather we see a distribution that looks something like a &quot; check mark , &quot; with concentration on the horizontal axis and some measure of damage on the vertical axis . 
Hormesis is a byproduct of evolution . 
From the beginnings of life on earth , organisms have been exposed to potentially harsh conditions , with individual cells commonly exposed to toxic substances such as chemicals and radiation . 
In order to avoid early death and extinction , organisms developed complex mechanisms to cope with such environmental hazards , including altering the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins to activate pathways that protect against or repair damage . 
For example , the biologist Paul Z. Myers of the University of Minnesota has described an animal study in which fish embryos experience non-linear toxicity from alcohol , a toxin that causes severe deformities in zebrafish embryos at high doses and prolonged exposure . 
According to Myers ( http : / / scienceblogs.com / pharyngula / 2011 / 03 / will _ radiation _ hormesis _ protec.php ) , 
&quot; I &apos;ve done concentration series , where we give sets of embryos exposures at increasing concentrations , and we get a nice linear curve out of it : more alcohol leads to increasing frequency and severity of midline and branchial arch defects . 
With one exception : at low concentrations of about 0.5 % alcohol , the treated embryos actually have reduced mortality rates relative to the controls , and no developmental anomalies . &quot; 
In other words , there appears to be a kind of overcompensation that explains the enhanced protective mechanisms that are elicited by small amounts of a toxin . 
Protective mechanisms are activated to a greater degree than would be necessary merely to neutralize the threat , resulting in a net beneficial effect . 
There are some epidemiological studies that have been touted as offering real-world illustrations of hormesis in humans , but they have palpable shortcomings . 
An excellent analysis of them by surgical oncologist David H. Gorski , M.D. , Ph.D. ( http : / / www.sciencebasedmedicine.org / ? p = 11636 ) was prompted by an American pundit &apos;s outrageous exaggeration of the likely benefits from hormesis in Japan . 
She declared that , &quot; the only good news is that anyone exposed to excess radiation from the nuclear power plants is now probably much less likely to get cancer . &quot; 
But that would be true only for incremental radiation exposures at extremely low levels . 
In light of what we know now - and even with the data that we are likely to have in the near future - we cannot be certain about the exposures . 
Some workers at Fukushima are likely to have received higher doses of radiation ( not only of I-131 , but also of other , longer-lived , more dangerous radioisotopes , such as Cesium-137 ) than would activate the hormetic response ; in March , three workers suffered radiation burns from highly radioactive water that breached their protective clothing . 
And people ( especially infants or children ) exposed to high levels of I-131 before they could be protected by iodine prophylaxis might well have received cancer-inducing doses . 
One thing is certain : at all but extremely low doses - perhaps only slightly higher than background levels - radiation causes cancer . 
Beyond that , radiation physics and hormesis are very arcane and complex phenomena , and understanding them requires more than superficial knowledge . 
If you want to comprehend all the nuances , get a science degree from M.I.T. or the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule in Zurich . 
Otherwise , stay tuned , learn from the experts , and don &apos;t jump to conclusions .
