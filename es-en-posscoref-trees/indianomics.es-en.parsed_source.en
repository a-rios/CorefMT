Indianomics 
NEW DELHI - Nowadays , economists are assailed by irresolute thoughts : what , for example , is the right term to apply to current global economic conditions ? 
Is it &quot; depression , &quot; &quot; recession , &quot; or , finally , &quot; recovery &quot; ? 
What of the euro ? 
As these debates fill the air in finance ministries and economics departments around the globe , India continues its steady GDP growth , now projected to reach 9.4 % this year . 
Indeed , the government says that the growth rate will hit double figures soon . 
Although many people seem amazed that India has maintained rapid growth for so long - even in the face of the global downturn - surprise is unwarranted . 
India &apos;s proportion of global GDP stood at 25 % in 1750 , but slumped to 1.6 % in 1900 , at the high noon of imperialism . 
India is simply rising again to reassert its traditional global position . 
Can India achieve this ? 
Many challenges confront India on its path to sustained strong growth , principally that of converting the country &apos;s vast promise into reality . 
In order to achieve this in a true democracy , India must ensure distributive justice . 
It must ensure that enhanced purchasing power leads to a markedly improved quality of life for all of India &apos;s citizens . 
Currently , India has a window of opportunity , nearly unique in nature , thanks to a huge demographic dividend : almost 60 % of the country &apos;s population is below the age of 30 . 
But this advantage is limited in duration , lasting two or perhaps three decades . 
If it is not used now , it will dissipate . 
To seize this opportunity , India first must move decisively away from state capitalism , the remnants of which continue to retard the country &apos;s economic progress . 
India &apos;s economic future lies in maximizing its private sector &apos;s dynamism , which demands an acceleration of institutional reform , including privatization at both the national and state level . 
But , as the Indian economist and frequent policymaker Vijay Kelkar has put it , &quot; India needs to fashion &#91; its &#93; own sui generis model of growth and development ... towards an advanced economy , always promoting inclusive growth , and thus gain the benefits of enhanced efficiency , greater equity , and better governance under a liberal democracy . &quot; 
Simply copying American , British , or other Western policies and institutions will not work . 
Moreover , India is not China ; it cannot be - indeed , it must not be . 
That is why it should not hanker after any ersatz export-led or state-directed growth . 
India &apos;s second great challenge is to resolve its enormous infrastructure shortcomings . 
India is no longer primarily an agricultural economy ; indeed , agriculture accounts for only around 20 % of GDP . 
But this does not mean that agriculture should be neglected ; on the contrary , it remains a way of life for many millions of Indians , who need capital and new technology . 
Raising farm productivity and income requires improved irrigation , wasteland reclamation , warehousing , marketing , transport development , and the free movement of produce within the country . 
This is why rapid strengthening of India &apos;s physical and social infrastructure is central to its progress . 
This leads us to examining India &apos;s current fixation with GDP growth as a national panacea . 
The theory is that the government , as the agent of the people , collects taxes and delivers public goods in return . 
In this sense , the Indian state has been rather a poor agent ; it collects little and delivers a pittance - and what it does deliver is of grossly inadequate quality . 
Yet the Indian state continues to ask for a disproportionately high price from the people . 
This must change , by directly targeting the alleviation of poverty - and ultimately its elimination . 
I accept that the most powerful anti-poverty program is economic growth , but it works only if and when it is accompanied by distributive justice . 
Only such &quot; just &quot; growth can eventually be converted into high GNC : &quot; Gross National Contentment , &quot; a truer index of economic well-being . 
Rather than endless debates about higher budgetary allocations , India needs to find practical ways to promote effective , targeted , self-adjusting , and self-liquidating anti-poverty programs . 
It is not the amount of money allocated by government that matters . 
The true litmus test of budget expenditures is what actually gets delivered . 
Only an inclusive approach to reform can meet peoples &quot; expectations , and in turn spread contentment . 
India does not need more laws . 
It needs more effective and more accountable governments . 
It does not need more regulations , but rather a vastly larger canvas for individual freedom and opportunity . 
India &apos;s economy must be freed from the organizing principle of state control , so that individual enterprise and creativity can become its main engine . 
India is at the threshold of an era of unprecedented growth . 
But to cross it , Indians must craft a new idea of India - as the flagship of a modern global economy that unleashes the dynamism of all citizens .
