The Wealth of Species 
Although broad scientific consensus has identified the loss of biological diversity as one of the world &apos;s most severe environmental threats , public recognition of the scale of the danger is lagging . 
Ecologists and other environmental scientists bear some of the blame for failing to make their concerns meaningful to ordinary people . 
But their challenge is made more difficult by nay-sayers who claim that fears about declining biodiversity are a tree-huggers &apos; conspiracy to elevate Nature above people . 
Nothing could be further from the truth : the threat to biodiversity can mean the loss of critical features of humanity &apos;s life-support systems , and therefore threatens our personal and economic well-being . 
Remedial action can no longer be delayed . 
Those who maintain that the biodiversity crisis is manufactured , or at least over-hyped , often point to the sometimes exaggerated estimates of extinction rates that appear in the press . 
Critics seize upon these embellishments to argue that there is really not much of a problem . 
Wrong . 
Extinctions are only the tip of the iceberg . 
To focus on how many species have become extinct , or will go extinct , obscures the fact that a large number of species have become greatly contracted in the range of their habitats , primarily due to human activity . 
We appropriate land and resources for our purposes , release harmful wastes , and introduce alien species that displace natives . 
Extinct or endangered species are indicators of a much bigger problem . 
Little comfort can be taken in the fact that a species survives if it persists only at a fraction of its historical abundance , or if it is restricted to a narrow part of where it once thrived . 
Such relics may escape the graveyard of species , but they no longer provide the services to humanity that they once did . 
We must then find substitutes that are more costly and less satisfactory . 
For example , marine fish populations that were once reliable sources of food for billions of people , and vital parts of the economies of nations , have been decimated . 
Many such stocks , such as Newfoundland cod , which supported huge fisheries for centuries , have been reduced to a tiny proportion of their former levels . 
Salmon stocks are endangered up and down the West Coast of the US , and ecologically unsustainable aquaculture is now the major source of salmon supplies for restaurants and supermarkets . 
We are reducing fisheries to smaller and less attractive fish , and the situation could get much worse as those disappear . 
Why care about the loss of biodiversity ? 
Clearly , the loss of fish stocks deprives our palates , and puts parts of our food supply at risk . 
But much more is at stake . 
In natural and managed systems alike , biodiversity supplies us with food , with fiber , and with fuel . 
We also mine natural systems for pharmaceuticals . 
Indeed , the majority of commercially available drugs owe their origins directly or indirectly to the diversity of plant and microbial life . 
This is not just ancient history , irrelevant in the era of molecular biology : naturally derived compounds , such as taxol , still provide some of the most promising avenues for the treatment of cancers and other diseases . 
As biodiversity shrivels , we lose a vast store of information and potential cures . 
Natural systems also provide natural purification systems for air and water , supply pollinators for agriculture , mediate our climate , and recycle the elements upon which our life-support systems depend . 
As we lose natural systems and biodiversity , we diminish our quality of life , threatening our existence . 
So why haven &apos;t the world &apos;s peoples united to solve the problem ? 
The answer is all too familiar . 
Competition among nations and among peoples trumps cooperation , and regional and global conflicts obstruct the pathways to a sustainable future . 
There is insufficient incentive , even at local levels , for taking the long view , and for restraining our tendency to consume in order to benefit all of humanity . 
As a result , we discount the future heavily . 
As individuals , we ask , If others are not going to restrain their activities , why should I ? 
Governments use the same logic , and this makes it difficult to agree upon effective biodiversity conventions to sustain vanishing resources . 
For biodiversity loss , as with so many global environmental challenges , the problem is that the social costs are not captured in market prices . 
Human nature is such that voluntary actions , either by individuals or by nations , cannot be relied upon to lead to the essential constraints on profligate tendencies at such a large scale . 
So we need to tighten the feedback loops and create stronger incentives for behaviors that advance the common good , including that of future generations . 
To cite one example : because Costa Rica &apos;s government pays private landowners for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services , deforestation rates in that country have diminished dramatically . 
We also need international conventions to change systems of accounting to include fully the social costs of our bahavior , as advocated by organizations such as the Stockholm-based Beijer Institute for Environmental Economics . 
Incentives that reinforce practices that preserve biodiversity must be applied at all levels if they are to influence individual actions and social norms . 
Without collective action , we face a bleak future of disappearing biodiversity and a steadily declining quality of life .
