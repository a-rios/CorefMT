America &apos;s Saving Rate and the Dollar &apos;s Future 
CAMBRIDGE - The saving rate of American households has risen sharply since the beginning of the year , reaching 6.9 % of after-tax personal income in May , the highest rate since 1992 . 
In today &apos;s economy , that is equivalent to annual savings of $ 750 billion . 
While a 6.9 % saving rate is not high in comparison to that of many other countries , it is a dramatic shift from the household-saving rate of less than 1 % that the United States experienced in 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 . 
Before it began rising last year , the US household saving rate had been declining for more than 20 years in response to the increasing level of household wealth . 
The rising stock market and the higher value of homes induced individuals to consume more of their incomes and to save less . 
As a result , most working individuals reduced the amount that they saved for their retirement , and retirees were able to increase their spending . 
The net saving rate fell to near zero . 
The sharp drop in household wealth over the past two years , however , put an end to that . 
Dramatically lower share prices and a 35 % fall in home prices reduced household wealth by $ 14 trillion , a loss equal to 140 % of annual disposable income . 
Looking ahead , the saving rate may rise even further , and will , in any case , remain high for many years . 
The increase in the household saving rate reduces America &apos;s need for foreign funds to finance its business investment and residential construction . 
Taken by itself , today &apos;s $ 750 billion annual rate of household saving could replace that amount in capital inflows from the rest of the world . 
Since the peak annual rate of capital inflow was $ 803 billion ( in 2006 ) , the increased household saving has the potential to eliminate almost all of America &apos;s dependence on foreign capital . 
The annual capital inflow is equal each year to the US current-account deficit - the sum of the trade deficit plus the net interest and dividends that America &apos;s government and businesses owe to the rest of the world . 
The fall in the capital inflow would therefore bring with it a fall in the trade deficit . 
Since reducing the trade deficit requires increasing exports and shrinking imports , the international value of the dollar must decline to make US products more attractive to foreign buyers and US goods and services more attractive to American consumers . 
Without a fall in the dollar and the resulting rise in net exports , a higher saving rate and reduced consumer spending could push the US economy into a deep recession . 
By contrast , the lower dollar makes reduced consumption consistent with full employment by shifting consumer spending from imports to domestic goods and services , and by supplementing this rise in domestic demand with increased exports . 
But this direct link between higher household saving and a lower dollar will only be forged if higher household saving is not outweighed by a rise in government dis-saving , i.e. , by a larger government deficit . 
Put differently , the value of the dollar reflects total national saving , not just savings in the household sector . 
Unfortunately , the US fiscal deficit is projected to remain high for many years . 
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the US government &apos;s budget deficit will average 5.2 % of GDP over the next decade , and be 5.5 % of GDP a decade from now . 
If that high level of government borrowing occurs , it will absorb all of the available household savings even at the current elevated level . 
That would mean that the US would continue to need substantial inflows of foreign capital to fund business investment and housing construction . 
So the dollar would have to stay at its current level to continue to create the large trade deficit and resulting capital inflow . 
It is , of course , possible - I would say likely - that China and other foreign lenders will not be willing to continue to provide the current volume of lending to the US . 
Their reduced demand for dollars will cause the dollar to decline and the trade deficit to shrink . That reduced trade deficit and the resulting decline in capital inflows will lead to higher real interest rates in the US . 
Although the higher level of household saving will limit the rise in US interest rates , it will not change the fact that the combination of large future fiscal deficits and foreign lenders &quot; reduced willingness to buy US securities will lead to both a lower dollar and higher US interest rates .
