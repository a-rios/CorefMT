Nuclear Targets 
LOS ANGELES  -  
The drumbeat appears to be growing louder . 
Western leaders repeatedly declare that no option is off the table to stem Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
And , in mid-November , London &apos;s Sunday Times reported that Israel put defenses around its Dimona nuclear reactor on &quot; red alert &quot; 30 times , as worries grew that Syria would avenge Israel &apos;s September attack on a suspected nuclear site in Syria . 
Israel &apos;s fear reflects the region &apos;s unique history . 
Since World War II , strikes to halt nuclear activities have taken place exclusively in the Middle East : Iraq was struck by Iran ( 1980 ) , Israel ( 1981 ) , and the United States ( 1991 , 2003 ) , while Iraq bombed Iran ( 1984-87 ) and Israel ( 1991 ) . 
But raids never generated significant radiological consequences , because plants were under construction , contained inconsequential amounts of nuclear material , had radioactive elements removed prior to the attack , or because the attacker missed the mark . 
A successful strike on Dimona , however , would be another matter . 
So , given the threat of radioactive releases , does the plant &apos;s continued operation outweigh the risks ? 
Dimona is unique . 
It is the region &apos;s largest nuclear plant and sole producer of atomic weapons materials . 
Since it went into operation in the mid-1960 &quot; s , it has generated elements for an estimated 200 nuclear weapons . 
Israel &apos;s first prime minister , David Ben Gurion , inaugurated the enterprise to compensate for Israel &apos;s strategic vulnerability , a fledgling army , and the West &apos;s unwillingness to enter into a formal alliance to defend the Jewish state . 
Dimona is no Chernobyl . 
It generates only about 5 % of that failed Soviet reactor &apos;s power . 
Still , the plant - along with its spent nuclear fuel , extracted plutonium , and nuclear reprocessing waste - poses significant radiological hazards that a military strike could disperse into the environment . 
Israeli officials tacitly acknowledge the risk . 
Authorities have distributed potassium iodide tablets to the nearby towns of Yerham , Dimona , and Aruar . 
Potassium iodide blocks thyroid absorption of radioactive iodine , an early risk in a nuclear release . 
But it would not obstruct serious health consequences from other radioactive elements . 
And , depending on weather and the nuclear discharge , the radioactive consequences may not remain localized . 
Light contamination and hot spots could impact Israeli , Palestinian , and Jordanian urban centers some distance away . 
Beyond health effects , contamination could terrorize affected populations , prompting temporary flight and permanent relocation . 
For decades , Israel dealt with this risk through effective air defenses and disdain for its adversaries &quot; ability to strike Dimona . 
In May 1984 , after I authored a book about the consequences of military attacks on nuclear facilities , an Israeli intelligence officer came to California to question me about the vulnerability of the reactor and a proposed nuclear power plant . 
The officer belittled the risk , arguing that no Arab air force had ever overcome Israeli air defenses , and none ever would . 
At that time , history provided odd support . 
Although Egyptian reconnaissance aircraft had flown near Dimona in 1965 and 1967 without incident , during the 1967 war , Israel shot down one of its own Mirage jet fighters when it strayed over the facility . 
In 1973 , Dimona &apos;s defenders downed a wayward Libyan civilian airliner heading for the reactor , killing 108 people . 
But the 1991 Persian Gulf War upset whatever solace Israel could take from the past . 
Iraqi Scud missiles bombarded Tel Aviv , and one came close to hitting Dimona . 
Hezbollah &apos;s bombardment of northern Israel in 2006 , further demonstrated the country &apos;s vulnerability to missile attack . 
And , while Israel &apos;s Arrow ballistic missile defenses , which now surround Dimona , may be superior to the Patriot system that failed in 1991 , Syria &apos;s more advanced Scuds and Iran &apos;s Shahab 3 rocket present a more capable challenge than Saddam &apos;s projectiles . 
Dimona has produced all the plutonium that Israel reasonably needs , and the reactor - one of the world &apos;s oldest - has suffered minor mishaps and evident deterioration , raising the specter of more serious accidents . 
So , if Israel cannot guarantee the plant &apos;s defense against attack , it should close it . 
By doing so , Israel could also derive political benefits . 
It could claim that closure demonstrates its commitment to reducing regional nuclear tensions , while sending a message about the wisdom of building reactors in the world &apos;s most volatile region . 
Indeed , about a dozen Middle East and North African countries propose to build nuclear power plants . 
Given the historic targeting of atomic installations , planners should consider whether providing adversaries with radiological targets far larger than Dimona makes sense . 
Until the Middle East resolves its political differences , it may not .
