The Fukushima Syndrome 
BIRMINGHAM - The dramatic events that unfolded at Japan &apos;s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plant after last year &apos;s tsunami are commonly referred to as &quot; the Fukushima disaster . &quot; 
We need look no further than this description to begin to understand the significant misconceptions that surround nuclear energy . 
It was the tsunami , caused by the largest earthquake ever to strike Japan , that killed more than 16,000 people , destroyed or damaged roughly 125,000 buildings , and left the country facing what its prime minister described as its biggest crisis since World War II . 
Yet it is Fukushima that is habitually accorded the &quot; disaster &quot; label . 
In fact , although what happened was shocking , the events in the hours and days after a giant wave slammed over the nuclear plant &apos;s protective seawall might be interpreted as a remarkable testament to nuclear power &apos;s sound credentials . 
To be sure , the environmental impact on those living close to Fukushima may take many years to remediate . 
The first is safety ; the second is radiation . 
We need to promote a much more inclusive and informed dialogue about both if nuclear power is to be assessed on its genuine merits , rather than dismissed on the grounds of little more than ignorance and intransigence . 
Would the many people who would ban nuclear power also prohibit air travel ? 
After all , the parallels between the two industries are central to the question of safety . 
We are often told that air travel , statistically speaking , has a better safety record than any other form of transport . 
The numerous interrelated reasons for this might usefully be summarized by comparing an airplane to a bicycle . 
We all appreciate that an airplane is a sophisticated device , and that a bicycle is not . 
We also acknowledge that the consequences of an airplane crash are liable to be far more catastrophic than , say , those of a cyclist clipping a curb on his way home from the shops . 
Accordingly , designing and manufacturing an airplane is many times more demanding and thorough than designing and assembling a bicycle is . 
The same can be said of the approximately 450 nuclear reactors around the world . 
The fact is that the industry &apos;s safety record is second to none when measured against those of its rivals . 
Like airplanes , nuclear reactors are conceived and constructed to mind-boggling standards . 
For all of the tension and fear surrounding the fight against a nuclear meltdown at Fukushima , we should not forget that the plant - and with it the notion of a nuclear-energy industry - was subjected to an extraordinary test , in the strictest sense of the word . 
Were it not for some design flaws that would not be repeated today , Fukushima might well have survived intact - and history would be so different . 
Indeed , nuclear energy is a safer proposition now than ever before , but , for many people , the mere spectacle of an event like Fukushima - regardless of the outcome - is sufficient to draw the opposite conclusion . 
If a 747 crashed into a nuclear facility , we would be unlikely to hear calls for all airplanes to be outlawed , but the clamor for every reactor on the planet to be shut down immediately would probably be deafening . 
Remember , too , that Fukushima was built in the 1970 &quot; s , and that the technology on which it was based dated from a decade earlier . 
Its successors are radically different in how they work , as is the regulatory framework , which sets astonishing new benchmarks for the care and quality required at every stage of the process . 
The case against nuclear power is deeply rooted in concerns over safety in general and radiation in particular . 
The Fukushima accident , having reinforced too many opinions and reshaped too few , makes it vital that we try to bring clarity to these issues - especially in those countries , including the United Kingdom , where the notion of a sustainable energy policy remains undetermined . 
While we know the corollaries of high levels of radiation exposure , what happens at the other end of the scale is less clear . 
The world is full of radioactivity - walls , concrete , even bananas contain traces - and our bodies have adapted to it . 
In countries like Brazil and India , people live in environments that have 20-200 times the radiation commonly found in the UK , apparently with no negative genetic effects . 
Some experts even argue that we may need a degree of radioactivity to stimulate our immune systems . 
Of course , there remain concerns around the vital issues of waste disposal and proliferation . 
Again , consensual debate is required . 
But that requires formulating a roadmap that tells us where we stand and what we must do . 
We need to create the necessary culture of dialogue within industry and academia . 
Above all , we need to enhance the public &apos;s grasp of the energy sector as a whole . 
Currently , there is too much &quot; I know &quot; and &quot; This is what I firmly believe , &quot; frequently from influential people , in cases where there is no incontestable right or wrong . 
Fukushima is one of them . 
It is still not too late - not quite - to start couching the broader discussion of nuclear energy in language that will inform rather than alarm , and in terms that will nurture well-balanced judgments rather than entrench long-held biases .
