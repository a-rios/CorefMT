The Frontiers of Power 
SINGAPORE - There are close to 1.5 billion people in the world without access to electricity , more than half in the Asia Pacific region . 
Unfortunately , in today &apos;s world it is almost impossible to find viable income-generating activities without access to electricity . 
Renewable energy technologies ( RETs ) are invaluable to those who live outside the boundaries of power grids . 
The Renewable Energy Policy Network for the Twenty-First Century ( REN21 ) estimates that there are tens of millions of rural households served by renewable energy around the globe . 
Why doesn &apos;t the power grid reach these households in the first place ? 
For starters , they are typically located in remote villages where grid access is prohibitively expensive . 
Governments lack both the means and motivation , owing to their inability to recoup costs from poor villagers , often because subsidized electricity prices depress revenues . 
In some cases , grid expansion makes sense after removing these distortions . 
These households resort to traditional fuels such as wood , oil , and candles for heating and lighting , leading to severe indoor pollution , not to mention chronic fire hazards . 
Study after study has shown the devastating effects that indoor pollution has on women , children , and public-health finances . 
Moreover , these fuels are not cheap , costing isolated households a significant proportion of their income . 
Off-grid RETs represent a viable solution , and come in various forms : solar home systems , mini-hydroelectric generators , rooftop wind turbines , and village-level mini-grids using a mix of diesel generators and local renewable sources , to name a few . 
A solar home system connects a photovoltaic panel to florescent lightbulbs , radio , and even TV , via a battery and load controller . 
A World Bank study has shown that a 20-watt solar home system can cut monthly kerosene consumption in rural households by roughly 15 liters . 
Many ask why the most expensive technology should be used for the poorest people . 
A 20-watt panel could cost roughly $ 200 - a huge sum for households earning $ 2,000 or less annually . 
However , with installment financing , monthly costs become not only manageable , but competitive with traditional fuels . 
The monthly leasing cost of the 20-watt panel in question , when stretched over 10 years , can be as little as $ 1.60 . 
Governments in poor and developing countries have been promoting projects to distribute off-grid RETs for decades , supported by multilateral institutions , bilateral aid programs , or non-governmental organizations . 
The private sector has typically stayed out , owing to long cost-recovery periods , small market size , and lack of consumer credit . 
But the nature of these projects is now changing . 
The often-debilitating impact of the traditional foreign-aid model on developing countries &quot; nascent private sectors has led to a fundamental reconsideration . 
New projects are more market-driven , with donors &quot; focus gradually shifting to building the capacity of domestic regulatory and technical institutions , and to strengthening the position of existing private-sector firms to serve the market . 
It was precisely such a model that led to the emergence in China of the World Bank &apos;s famous &quot; Golden Sun &quot; standard for solar panels , which focused disproportionately on strengthening technical institutions . 
The project is often credited for leading to the boom in manufacturing of photovoltaic panels in China , which has dethroned Germany and the United States to become the world &apos;s largest producer . 
There are many ways to undertake rural electrification using off-grid RETs . 
Governments can choose household-level technologies or village-level micro-grids ; involve aid donors or use other modes of financing ; offer subsidies to encourage private entrepreneurs or energy-service concessions to existing utilities ; lease the equipment by providing consumer credit or sell it up front . 
The important thing is to recognize that there is a broad spectrum of available options , and that efforts need to be ramped up on a massive scale . 
In India alone , every third person lacks access to electricity . 
If we want to avoid isolating communities and ensure inclusive economic growth , we need to start with the basics .
