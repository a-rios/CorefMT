The Nine Lives of Daniel Ortega 
Once again , Nicaragua faces a possible Sandinista restoration . 
The country votes on November 5 in an unprecedented presidential election with four competitive candidates , and the question on everyone &apos;s lips is whether Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega , who lost by more than 10 % in each of the last three presidential votes , will succeed in regaining power this time . 
Nicaragua &apos;s politics are polarized between a Sandinista minority and a majority that is clearly anti-Sandinista , yet Ortega has a real chance of winning . 
Despite conspicuous efforts by the Bush administration to unify Nicaragua &apos;s right , the anti-Sandinista forces are divided . 
The traditional wing , the Constitutional Liberal Party ( PLC ) , controlled by former President Arnoldo Alemán , who is under house arrest since being convicted of corruption , has José Rizo as its candidate . 
The moderate wing , the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance ( ALN ) , is led by banker Eduardo Montealegre , with huge support from the private sector and the Bush administration . 
But the FSLN ( the Sandinista National Liberation Front ) , too , has suffered a major rupture , with the emergence of a new option on the democratic left in the form of a breakaway Sandinista faction that has managed to win the support of independent voters . 
Its candidate , the economist Edmundo Jarquín , is a former expert on governance issues at the Inter-American Development Bank . 
A backroom deal reached between Alemán and Ortega in 2000 , intended to carve up power between the two men , established a 40 % threshold for a candidate to win the presidency in the first round . 
In addition , and in exchange for personal benefits , then President Alemán promulgated a rule that looks tailored-made to suit Ortega : candidates can win on the first round with only 35 % of votes if there is a 5 % difference between the leading contender and the runner-up . 
The emerging forces represented by Montealegre and Jarquín agree on the need for political reform to undo that Ortega / Alemán pact , which has politicized the judiciary , the national accounts , and the electoral system . 
Concerning economic policy , they differ on the degree of continuity or change that should be pursued , and over recent reforms that have produced moderate economic growth but with no improvement whatsoever in the living conditions of the 50 % of the population who live in poverty . 
Paradoxically , Ortega enters the final stages of the campaign with about 33 % of the vote , far below his historical high of 42 % . 
Yet he may just win due to the divided opposition . 
In a parody of John Lennon &apos;s song &quot; Give Peace a Chance , &quot; Ortega barnstorms the country in the manner of a religious preacher , offering &quot; peace , jobs , and reconciliation . &quot; 
He condemns wild capitalism , but proposes no systemic change as an alternative . 
But polls that put Ortega in the lead should be read cautiously , because many voters keep their views hidden . 
With this warning in mind , three scenarios are possible : 
· Ortega cannot win in the first round . 
As in previous elections , the hidden vote turns massively against him . 
He then is soundly defeated in a run-off against Montealegre as anti-Ortega voters unite against him . 
If that happens , Nicaragua would have a president with a strong popular mandate and the possibility of establishing a viable democratic alliance in Congress . 
Ortega wins outright in the first round , fueling economic uncertainty , as investors , savers , and external donors are seriously worried by his past . 
How long they would worry , of course , depends on his behavior in office . 
Despite his revolutionary rhetoric , Ortega would have no chance of enacting substantial change , because he would lack a Congressional majority . 
Even so , the country &apos;s stability , always precarious , would depend on his relations with the US , which have long been poisoned by mutual hostility . 
Moreover , his victory would mean a new and unconditional ally for Chávez , one with more symbolic than real influence , but economically dependent on Venezuela in a region dominated by the influence of the United States and the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas . 
The electoral result is too close to define a non-controversial winner after the first round . 
It is feared that the Supreme Electoral Council , strongly dominated by the FSLN and the PLC , may not administer the vote counting impartially . 
And , even if massive fraud is not foreseeable , selective fraud remains a risk . 
This poses a huge challenge for international electoral observers - the Organization of American States , the European Union , and the Carter Center - if they are to prevent a situation similar to , or even more serious than , Mexico &apos;s recent post-election impasse . 
The only certain result that will come out this election is that a new Congress will emerge , and that it will weaken the Alemán-Ortega pact that has held current President Enrique Bolaños administration hostage . 
Thus , any new government will have more room for democratic maneuver in a fragmented Congress of four strong electoral blocs . 
Nicaragua faces a hugely complex future . 
But that complexity is much more promising than the current immobility .
