Feeding Young Minds 
NEW DELHI - Of the many sad news stories emerging recently from India , the saddest in a long time concerns the deaths of 23 schoolchildren in July in Chhapra , the main town in the impoverished rural Saran district of the state of Bihar . 
The children were poisoned by their midday meals - a vital part of a government-run nutrition program in schools - which apparently were cooked in oil that had been carelessly stored in used pesticide containers . 
The sheer horror - parents seeing their kids safely off to school , only to have them be killed there by something intended to benefit them - is unbearable . 
The reaction has been predictable breast-beating about the inefficiency of India &apos;s government services ( particularly in rural areas ) , the country &apos;s woeful standards of hygiene , and inattentive implementation of even flagship national schemes by the country &apos;s 28 state governments . 
The midday meal scheme itself has been trashed in India and abroad as wasteful and counter-productive . 
&quot; Free school meals kill Indian children , &quot; one headline screamed . 
Another commentator even went so far as to claim that there is &quot; little evidence to suggest that schoolchildren are actually getting any nutritional value from it at all . &quot; 
Critics of the scheme view it as symptomatic of big government run amok and ask why it is necessary for any government to feed schoolchildren . 
The answer , in India , is that no one else could . 
While various small school-lunch programs existed , the idea of a massive government-backed scheme originated three decades ago in the southern state of Tamil Nadu . 
When Tamil Nadu &apos;s chief minister at the time , the film star M.G. Ramachandran , introduced free school meals statewide , the measure was widely criticized as populist and fiscally irresponsible . 
Children , his detractors argued , go to school to learn , not to eat . 
But if children do not get enough to eat , they cannot learn : empty stomachs make it difficult to fill minds . 
Tamil Nadu &apos;s voters , who supported the scheme at election time , silenced the critics . 
So did the scheme &apos;s results - improved literacy rates and nutrition levels . 
Soon , other states were imitating the program , and in 1995 , India &apos;s central government followed suit , supplementing state governments &quot; budgets so that children throughout the country could enjoy the same benefit . 
Today , 87 % of government schools implement the scheme . 
The midday meal scheme - which costs India &apos;s government about $ 2 billion a year , with additional funding coming from state governments - feeds 120 million schoolchildren in more than a million primary schools across the country . 
By providing free and balanced nutrition to schoolchildren , it has provided a powerful incentive to poor families to send their kids to school and , equally important , to keep them there throughout the day . 
Indeed , thanks to the scheme , school-attendance rates have improved , sometimes by as much as 10 % , and dropout rates have declined . 
And obliging children of different castes to eat the same meal at the same time in the same place has broken down social barriers in a highly stratified society . 
Children whose families could not afford to feed them properly have benefited significantly . 
In drought-affected areas , the midday meal scheme has allowed children who otherwise would have starved to overcome malnourishment . 
Allegations that the scheme lacks nutritional value have been disproved . 
One scholar , Farzana Afridi , reported in the Journal of Development Economics that the program &quot; improved nutritional intakes by reducing the daily protein deficiency of a primary school student by 100 % , the calorie deficiency by almost 30 % , and the daily iron deficiency by nearly 10 % . &quot; 
But , while the midday meal scheme &apos;s benefits have ensured its popularity , the quality of its implementation has varied across states . 
The national government provides funds for cooks and helpers , and has devised guidelines for the program &apos;s implementation , but schools are under the jurisdiction of state governments , some of which are more capable than others of maintaining the standards required to provide a reliable service . 
Many northern states , such as Bihar , have lagged in providing kitchens , storage facilities , and utensils . 
The rule requiring at least two adults to taste meals before they are served to children has often been ignored , as it was in the Chhapra tragedy . 
Attempts to enforce the rule have met unexpected resistance from teachers , who are obliged to rotate tasting duty : they object that they are at school to teach students , not to taste food . 
Some teachers &quot; unions have refused to perform the task . 
Sadder still has been the reaction of some parents in Bihar , who have withdrawn their children from school rather than risk their being poisoned . 
Such concerns are understandable but manifestly exaggerated . 
The Chhapra tragedy has at least focused attention on a scheme that public opinion has largely taken for granted . 
But it would be a great pity if , in examining what went wrong , deficiencies in the program &apos;s implementation were to obscure its accomplishments . 
The midday meal scheme has transformed lives and helped educate a generation of poor schoolchildren . 
It should be emulated by other developing countries , not shunned because of a preventable disaster . 
Indeed , the Chhapra tragedy would be compounded were it to end up derailing a program that is benefiting millions of children and their families every day .
