In Defense of Angela Merkel 
PARIS - The recent cover of Der Spiegel showing German Chancellor Angela Merkel in front of the Acropolis surrounded by Nazi officers serves an important purpose : it finally poses , in a way that cannot be evaded , the question of Germanophobia in Europe . 
The abuse of Germany has dragged on for quite some time . 
Demonstrations in Cyprus in March 2013 included banners bearing caricatures of Merkel done up as Adolf Hitler . 
In Valencia at around the same time , on the occasion of the annual Fallas celebration , there was Merkel as an evil headmistress delivering to the head of the Spanish government and his ministers &quot; The Ten Commandments of Angela the Exterminator . &quot; 
She ended up being burned in effigy in the flames of the bonfires of St. Joseph . 
Two months later , in Portugal , similar parades featured the same Hitlerized Merkel caricatures , borne by howling demonstrators dressed in mourning clothes and decrying the German leader &apos;s &quot; policy of massacring the poor . &quot; 
And , naturally , there was Greece , where the phenomenon reached its apogee during the near-riots of October 2012 , in which the world was treated to the spectacle of Nazi and German flags flown together - and then burned - together before the Acropolis in scenes that presaged the Der Spiegel cover . 
In Italy , the right-wing daily newspaper Il Giornale had no scruples about devoting its headline for August 3 , 2012 , to the emergence of the &quot; Fourth Reich . &quot; 
Likewise , conspiracy websites in the countries of northern Europe claim that Germany &apos;s eagerness to support Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko against Russian President Vladimir Putin is a reenactment of Hitler &apos;s subjugation of Ukraine . 
Then there is France , where the game seems to be to see who can come out on top in populist denunciations of the new and detestable &quot; German empire . &quot; 
From the extreme right , National Front leader Marine Le Pen chides Merkel for the &quot; suffering &quot; that she is imposing on the peoples of Europe . 
From the opposite extreme , we have the Left Party &apos;s Jean-Luc Mélenchon thundering against Merkel &apos;s &quot; austerity &quot; policy and inviting her to &quot; shut up . &quot; 
The problem with this Germanophobia is not simply that it is stupid , or that it is yet another symptom of the decomposition , before our eyes , of the noble European project of integration and ever-closer union . 
No , the problem with today &apos;s Germanophobia is that , contrary to what the sorcerer &apos;s apprentices who stoke it would have us believe , their behavior is not a sign of their opposition to the true fascism that lies on the horizon , but rather of their allegiance - and even contribution - to it . 
Why ? 
There are several reasons . 
For starters , to oppose Germany &apos;s social , economic , and foreign policies by equating Merkel with Hitler is to banalize Hitler . 
However legitimate disagreement with those policies may be , Germany is one of the continent &apos;s most scrupulous and exemplary democracies . 
To say that it resembles in any way the Nazi regime - which in Europe still stands for the destruction of democracy ( indeed , civilization itself ) - is to exonerate that regime , and to reassure and encourage today &apos;s neo-fascists , allowing them , whether intentionally or not , to reenter the public debate . 
What is more ( and this is key ) , those keenest to discredit Merkel just happen to be the same people who do not hesitate to waltz with Viennese neo-Nazis or to form an alliance , as in Athens , with the leaders of a genuinely extremist party . 
All of the clamor raised around a Germany that has supposedly &quot; reunited with its demons &quot; masks the voice of fascistic parties - from Greece &apos;s Golden Dawn to Hungary &apos;s Jobbik , Slovakia &apos;s SNS , Belgium &apos;s Vlaams Belang , and Bulgaria &apos;s Ataka - that are in the process of establishing themselves in Europe . 
It should also be noted that Merkel is a woman , and that hatred for women - the disdain in which they , right alongside the Jews , were regarded by the racist theoreticians of the 1920s and 1930s - has been an essential dimension of every expression of fascism . 
Likewise , the slogans slung about in Valencia in October 2012 - with demonstrators urged to chant at the chancellor &apos;s effigy , &quot; You will love money above all else &quot; and &quot; You will honor the banks and the Bank &quot; - had the unmistakably foul odor of the old mantras about &quot; the golden calf &quot; and the &quot; cosmopolitan plutocracy . &quot; 
People have finally come to understand that anti-Americanism , born on the extreme right and fed , in Germany , for example , by the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and his acolytes , is a fixture of fascism . 
It is now time for us to understand that the same is true of Germanophobia . 
In France , it appeared with the French anti-Semitic novelist and activist Maurice Barrès , who saw in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant a vehicle for the &quot; Jewification &quot; of European minds . 
It triumphed with Charles Maurras &quot; Action Française and its protracted war with &quot; Jewish and Germanic abstractions . &quot; 
And it culminated with the red-brown cells that , even today , on sites that I prefer not to mention , offer &quot; grub &quot; and a &quot; hideout &quot; for persons willing to &quot; bump off &quot; the &quot; bosses &quot; on the chancellor &apos;s &quot; payroll . &quot; 
The history of ideas has its logic , reason , and folly , its unconscious and its trajectory . 
It is both futile and dangerous to deny any of them . 
That is why , today , it is critically important , in the face of a dark force that is rising , swelling , and unfurling in Europe , to defend Angela Merkel .
