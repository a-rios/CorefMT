Saudi Arabia &apos;s Theater of Reform 
Having raised expectations for real political reform in Saudi Arabia , King Abdullah has instead announced that the time for change has not yet arrived . 
After reshuffling the cabinet , everything remains the same . 
The Saudi population , 50 % of which is under 15 years old , will continue watching the same old princes on national TV , some who have been in office for forty years , symbolizing the rot at the heart of Saudi politics . 
The paradox here is that as Saudi Arabia becomes far more active diplomatically in trying to sort out the problems and Iraq , it has become paralyzed domestically . 
This was not what ordinary Saudis expected . 
For the past year and a half , they were anticipating a cabinet reshuffle intended to enhance the king &apos;s reputation as a keen advocate of reform . 
The symbolic significance of a new cabinet was expected to reflect its redefinition of the Saudi nation and its future . 
There was hope of inclusion of marginalized groups , such as a Shia minister for the first time in the Kingdom &apos;s history , and action against corruption , represented by the removal of long-serving ministers . 
Instead , a crippling malaise has engulfed the Kingdom , as Saudi Arabia &apos;s peculiar inertia has produced idle talk of reform that cannot mask the realities of stagnation . 
The inertia goes beyond the cabinet reshuffle : the judiciary - with 700 judges - also remains unchanged . 
The irony is that while King Abdullah has energetically taken on a leading role in the region &apos;s turbulent affairs , he seems unable to respond to Saudi Arabia &apos;s acute lag in democratic reform in comparison to neighbors like Jordan and the Gulf states . 
So why is Abdullah not exercising leadership ? 
And why , despite international pressure and domestic desire , did he not appoint a successor to the ailing Crown Prince Sultan , for the tradition of the Saudi kings is to have not only the direct but the second in line to the throne known ? 
Why are the Wahhabi clerics , the main opponents of reform and progress , continually indulged as the Kingdom &apos;s de facto co-rulers ? 
Abdullah , simply put , is not master of his own house . 
While it is easy to hold hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad , Hamas leader Ismail Haniya , Russian President Vladimir Putin , or US President George W. Bush , such reassuring images of cordial relationships are harder to come by at home . 
Abdullah faces the obstinacy of dozens of half-brothers and the recalcitrance of thousands of male cousins and nephews , in addition to the dogmatic admonitions of the entrenched Wahhabis . 
These opposing forces within the Kingdom have created an almost insurmountable roadblock . 
With consensus seemingly impossible , formulation of any coherent policy to meet the nation &apos;s needs is beyond reach . 
Instead the al-Saud princes and their Wahhabi partners live in wary co-existence , dominating different spheres of influence . 
Inertia in Saudi Arabia is deeply rooted in its two sources of legitimacy , oil and Islam . 
Since Abdullah became king in August 2005 , high oil prices have sustained the old system of patronage , paying people for silence and stifling any initiative for change . 
Moreover , the Saudi king &apos;s role as custodian of Islam &apos;s holy places is misused to stall reform , saying that any change must be carefully calibrated and engineered to meet the unique situation of a nation that carries this awesome responsibility . 
Reform in Saudi Arabia is in every sense a bizarre compromise between the opposing forces of the al-Saud &apos;s prominent wings and the forces of the official Wahhabi religious establishment . 
One result has been pseudo-democracy . 
Municipal elections have taken place , but they were partial , heavily managed , and of no consequence . 
The Shoura , or consultative council , is toothless : appointed by the king , it is unable to legislate and will remain un-elected for the foreseeable future . 
The same is true of the &quot; National Dialogue &quot; set up by Abdullah but not legitimized by the official Wahhabi establishment . 
Talks among representatives of Shia , Wahhabi-Ismaili , and other sects within the National Dialogue were recently televised , but this was pure theater of reform , nothing more , and the Saudi population is no longer willing to suspend its disbelief . 
Exposure to the outside world through travel , satellite TV , and the Internet has increased public demand for political rights , including the democratic representation that state paternalism has historically denied . 
The borders of the kingdom cannot be sealed to ideas and from the desire for change , with people avidly watching Al Jazeera - officially banned in Saudi Arabia - as it reports about elections in Kuwait and democratic debates in other Gulf countries . 
Denial is not a policy ; it is a suicide pact . 
Oil and Islamic custodianship can allow the rulers to fund a false sense of security , but only for so long . 
Oil prices go down as well as up . 
Like people , nations that deceive themselves are consigned to a future of uncertainty and instability . 
But self-deception is a choice . 
Many of the Saudi octogenarian princes , and especially King Abdullah , know what needs to be done . 
The people also know what needs to be done . 
If the monarchy consults them and begins to manage expectations properly , reconciliation and stability remain possible .
