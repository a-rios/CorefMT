Mikhail Gorbachev and the End of the Cold War 
Earlier this month , Mikhail Gorbachev celebrated his 75th birthday with a concert and conference at his foundation in Moscow . 
Unfortunately , he is not popular with the Russian people , who blame him for the loss of Soviet power . 
But , as Gorbachev has replied to those who shout abuse at him , &quot; Remember , I am the one who gave you the right to shout . &quot; 
When he came to power in 1985 , Gorbachev tried to discipline the Soviet people as a way to overcome economic stagnation . 
When discipline failed to solve the problem , he launched perestroika ( &quot; restructuring &quot; ) . 
And when bureaucrats continually thwarted his orders , he used glasnost , or open discussion and democratization . 
But once glasnost let people say what they thought , many people said , &quot; We want out . &quot; 
By December 1991 , the Soviet Union ceased to exist . 
Gorbachev &apos;s foreign policy , which he called &quot; new thinking , &quot; also contributed to the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Gorbachev said that security was a game from which all could benefit through cooperation . 
Rather than try to build as many nuclear weapons as possible , he proclaimed a doctrine of &quot; sufficiency , &quot; holding only a minimal number for protection . 
He also believed that Soviet control over an empire in Eastern Europe was costing too much and providing too little benefit , and that the invasion of Afghanistan had been a costly disaster . 
By the summer of 1989 , East Europeans were given more degrees of freedom . 
Gorbachev refused to sanction the use of force to put down demonstrations . 
By November , the Berlin Wall had fallen . 
Some of these events stemmed from Gorbachev &apos;s miscalculations . 
After all , he wanted to reform communism , not replace it . 
But his reforms snowballed into a revolution driven from below rather than controlled from above . 
In trying to repair communism , he punched a hole in it . 
Like a hole in a dam , once pent-up pressure began to escape , it widened the opening and tore apart the system . 
By contrast , if the Communist Party &apos;s Politburo had chosen one of Gorbachev &apos;s hard-line competitors in 1985 , it is plausible that the declining Soviet Union could have held on for another decade or so . 
It did not have to collapse so quickly . 
Gorbachev &apos;s humanitarian tinkering contributed greatly to the timing . 
But there were also deeper causes for the Soviet demise . 
One was the &quot; soft &quot; power of liberal ideas , whose spread was aided by the growth of transnational communications and contacts , while the demonstration effect of Western economic success gave them additional appeal . 
In addition , the huge Soviet defense budget began to undermine other aspects of Soviet society . 
Health care deteriorated and the mortality rate increased ( the only developed country where that occurred ) . 
Eventually , even the military became aware of the tremendous burden caused by imperial overstretch . 
Ultimately , the deepest causes of the Soviet collapse were the decline of communist ideology and economic failure . 
In the early Cold War , communism and the Soviet Union had considerable soft power . 
Many communists led the resistance against fascism in Europe , and many people believed that communism was the wave of the future . 
But Soviet soft power was undercut by the exposure of Stalin &apos;s crimes in 1956 , and by the repression in Hungary in 1956 , Czechoslovakia in 1968 , and Poland in 1981 . 
Although in theory communism aimed to establish a system of class justice , Lenin &apos;s heirs maintained domestic power through a brutal security apparatus involving lethal purges , gulags , broad censorship , and ubiquitous informants . 
The net effect of these brutal measures was a general loss of faith in the system . 
The Soviet economy &apos;s decline , meanwhile , reflected the diminished ability of central planning to respond to global economic change . 
Stalin had created a command economy that emphasized heavy manufacturing and smokestack industries , making it highly inflexible - all thumbs and no fingers . 
As the economist Joseph Schumpeter pointed out , capitalism is &quot; creative destruction , &quot; a way of responding flexibly to major waves of technological change . 
At the end of the twentieth century , the major technological change of the third industrial revolution was the growing role of information as the scarcest resource in an economy . 
The Soviet system was particularly inept at handling information . 
The deep secrecy of its political system meant that the flow of information was slow and cumbersome . 
Economic globalization created turmoil throughout the world at the end of the twentieth century , but the Western market economies were able to re-allocate labor to services , restructure their heavy industries , and switch to computers . 
The Soviet Union could not keep up . 
Indeed , when Gorbachev came to power in 1985 , there were 50,000 personal computers in the Soviet Union ; in the US , there were 30 million . 
Four years later , there were about 400,000 personal computers in the Soviet Union , and 40 million in the US . 
It is difficult for a country to remain a superpower when the world doesn &apos;t want 92 % of what it produces . 
The lessons for today are clear . 
While military power remains important , it is a mistake for any country to discount the role of economic power and soft power . 
But it is also a mistake to discount the importance of leaders with humanitarian values . 
The Soviet Union may have been doomed , but the world has Gorbachev to thank for the fact that the empire he oversaw ended without a bloody conflagration .
