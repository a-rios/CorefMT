Brazil &apos;s Statute of Virtual Liberty 
RIO DE JANEIRO - It seems like the plot of a horror movie - the type where a little-noticed glitch in the matrix threatens to cause global chaos . 
This time , it was a simple , but fateful , programming misstep that suddenly left millions of consumers &quot; most sensitive information vulnerable to hackers . 
News headlines screamed about online dangers that we could barely understand , alerting swarms of digital pirates to a bounty of new criminal opportunities . 
Companies worldwide scrambled to secure their online safety . 
The story of the so-called &quot; Heartbleed &quot; bug , however , is all too real . 
It points to a stark truth : In a shockingly short time , we have become completely dependent on the Internet , a frontier we are only beginning to comprehend , let alone map and regulate . 
Important debates - such as freedom versus security , privacy versus piracy , and cyberspace &apos;s impact on democracy - are far from being resolved . 
Yet fears over Heartbleed and similar such threats , and the furor surrounding the aggressive American surveillance tactics revealed by former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden , have already put many countries in a defensive posture . 
In many places , efforts to protect Internet freedom have been stymied . 
But , as my home country , Brazil , has shown , a different path is possible . 
Brazil &apos;s House of Representatives has passed a genuine Internet &quot; Bill of Rights , &quot; which was unanimously approved by the senate and signed into law by President Dilma Rousseff last week - much to the delight of civil-society advocates . 
The legislation , widely described as an Internet constitution , seeks to safeguard online freedom of expression and limit government collection and usage of Internet users &quot; metadata . 
The bill ensures &quot; net neutrality &quot; ( meaning that Internet service providers must treat all information and users equally ) , and subjects global companies , such as Google and Facebook , to Brazilian law and precedent in cases involving its own citizens . 
Inspiration for Brazil &apos;s embrace of Internet freedom stemmed in part from US President Barack Obama &apos;s historic election campaign in 2008 . 
By tapping millions of small donations through social networking sites , he revolutionized election fundraising and seemed to open up new horizons for democracy and civic engagement . 
But not everyone was convinced . 
A wave of legislation - criminalizing various types of Internet use , such as music sharing , and allowing greater government surveillance - appeared to be turning back the liberal tide . 
In Brazil , too , the authorities acquired greater control over the Internet , as the country moved to the forefront of the international fight against cybercrime . 
The situation started to change in 2009 , after Brazil &apos;s then-president , Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva , participated in an Internet freedom event , and vowed afterwards to block any legislation restricting online freedoms . 
He also pledged to submit the bill that resulted in the newly adopted law . 
Interestingly , the bill was not drafted by the usual cast of bureaucrats . 
Instead , the process was opened up to the public , with ordinary citizens allowed to contribute via a government blog . 
Advocates of free software mixed it up with law enforcers and lobbyists from the likes of Google and Yahoo , in a pioneering example of &quot; wiki-democracy . &quot; 
In 2011 , after two years of debate and discussion , a draft bill was sent to Congress . 
Opposition was fierce . 
Lobbyists sought to water down the proposed legislation , with telecommunications companies particularly opposed to its net-neutrality provisions . 
Nevertheless , the coalition of forces backing the bill - civil-society groups supported by a 350,000-strong petition organized by legendary Brazilian musician and former Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil - overcame traditional political interests . 
In the process , they seem to have ushered in a new model of lawmaking . 
Elsewhere in the world , however , developments have moved in a different direction . 
Obama &apos;s electoral afterglow dimmed . 
The Internet-inspired uprisings in Iran and then in much of the Arab world were brutally crushed . 
New revelations about government surveillance , together with Heartbleed-type security scares , continue to test the world &apos;s faith in online freedom . 
Yet , despite the fears - and the dangers inherent in a free Internet - the world must not give up exploring the transformative potential of cyberspace . 
Those who are losing their resolve need to only look south , where Brazil is leading the way .
