Letter from Palestine 
Are Israelis and Palestinians really ready to strike a peace agreement ? 
Events have certainly moved at a brisk pace in recent months , with one obstacle after another to a lasting deal seeming to come down . 
Yasir Arafat &apos;s death was followed by the choice of his successor in a direct election with universal suffrage , which was accompanied by Israel &apos;s decision - one unique in the world - to help , not hinder the democratic process in territories it occupies . 
As a result , no one doubts Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s legitimacy . 
Moreover , with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon &apos;s announcement of his intention to withdraw Israel &apos;s army unilaterally from Gaza , the occupation itself is once again an open question , offering opportunities for further progress . 
Indeed , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s support for the Gaza withdrawal has helped open the door to real negotiations . 
Such an impressive sequence of events has not been seen for a long time in that troubled region . 
As a result , many - in and outside the Middle East - have become optimistic again . 
Even Sharon ventures a few favorable comments , and American diplomats express visible sighs of relief that progress toward peace can at last be made . 
I can attest to the gathering momentum towards peace , having just returned from Palestine , where I led a nearly five-week mission of European Union observers , the largest ever put in place by the EU . 
The mission was 260-strong on the day of the election and the counting of the vote , while 40 of us had been there for the whole five-week period . 
My testimony about the election is categorical : the circumstances were difficult , but the voting was unconstrained and without cheating . 
Given the conditions , the 60 % voter turnout was astonishing . 
There can be no doubt that Abbas was democratically elected . 
Nor is there any doubt that the Palestinian people made a choice for democracy , which entails a choice for a negotiated peace with Israel . 
But this leaves out the terrorists , who have not made this choice . 
They are not numerous , but they are very dangerous . 
Only genuine progress towards a just peace settlement will neutralize them as a political force . There is no question that current conditions present a unique window of opportunity . 
But we must keep in mind the major difficulties that can limit our ability to seize this opportunity , and the international community must make these difficulties very clear to both parties . 
The first difficulty is that , although Sharon evidently intends to go through with his military withdrawal from Gaza , he is vague about what he wants to achieve in future negotiations . 
Indeed , he has never made the slightest allusion to the idea of including the West Bank and Jerusalem in such negotiations . 
The second difficulty concerns the fact that Sharon has always appeared to believe that it is within the means of the Palestinian Authority to eradicate all terrorism arising from Palestinian territories and aimed at Israel . 
However , all external observers know very well that this is not the case , even if Abbas can undoubtedly succeed in reducing the level and number of attacks . 
In order for the Palestinian people as a whole to cease to glorify , support , and shelter terrorists , they need to discover real hope for a new life for themselves . 
The creation of such hope now depends exclusively on Israel , which must act immediately to boost the many Palestinians who yearn for peace , rather than insisting on a total disappearance of terrorism . 
Delay will only retard terrorism &apos;s disappearance . 
The third difficulty concerns the fact that , on both sides , most religious authorities , rabbis and imams alike , have maintained a hard-line stance . 
They continue to preach that the respective &quot; taboos &quot; of their communities , the very issues that block all efforts to make peace - in particular , the status of Jerusalem and the right of &quot; return &quot; to Israel for Palestinian refugees - are untouchable and non-negotiable . 
To make these religious authorities acknowledge their responsibility is a duty that all of international civil society , including religious leaders , must embrace . 
None of this is undoable . 
All of it will be demanding . 
We must all seize this moment .
