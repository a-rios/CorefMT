Turkey and the IMF 
CAMBRIDGE : Without warning , Turkey dove into financial crisis . 
Within days , $ 6 billion in foreign exchange was lost defending the lira . 
Only $ 18 billion remain , barely enough for another week if all-out exchange rate defense becomes necessary . 
Unlike in other crises , the IMF arrived in time , bringing both enough money and the policy commitments needed to make its rescue plans plausible . 
So , two cheers for the IMF for heading off an unnecessary crisis . 
Ever since the Asian crisis of 1997 the IMF &apos;s policies have been under attack . 
As events unfold in Turkey we should ask : are there alternatives to the IMF &apos;s regime ? 
The pain from a short period of IMF imposed high interest rates will , I believe , be far less than that which would follow the imposition of capital controls or currency and banking collapse . 
Turkey has teetered near crisis for years . 
Its budget and current account deficits are large , public debt is high , banks are bad , and foreign short-term debt is high relative to reserves . 
Turkish politics - ranging from human rights abuses to Islamic fundamentalism to deep-rooted corruption - complicate matters even more . 
With so much tinder around , it is surprising that a wildfire did not start before now . 
The immediate catalyst for this crisis was minor . 
A Turkish bank saw a Romanian subsidiary go bankrupt . 
A run on the Turkish bank followed . 
Other banks with dubious portfolios and / or legal problems came under pressure . 
Capital started to flee the country . 
This is the emerging market paradigm : it is presumed that banks are always much more incompetent than meets the eyes . 
At first , Turkey &apos;s central bank acted as lender of last resort , keeping bad banks afloat . 
This only fed the run on deposits and drained foreign exchange reserves . 
Within days , Turkey &apos;s authorities realized that they were repeating Indonesia &apos;s mistakes of 1997 . 
Exchange reserves would be exhausted saving dodgy banks yet , in the end , both banks and the currency would be lost . 
Enter the IMF . 
The IMF , indeed , is behind the decision to let interest rates go sky high as well as its decision to put one doubtful bank into receivership . 
Interest rates climbed thousands of percentage points , but within days money came back to Turkey . 
As rates declined slightly , nearly $ 2 billion returned . 
More is expected as the government sticks to its credit targets . 
High interest rates and extra fiscal measures will , of course , slow growth , but that is essential to taming inflation . 
The IMF program may also help knock down roadblocks to privatizing Turk Telecom , and the whiff of instability may inspire Europe to push Turkey &apos;s membership in the EU ahead . 
It is too soon , however , to proclaim victory . 
Offshore banks with exposure in Turkey may begin to curtail their risks , and that would mean a drain reserves far larger than what the IMF delivered . 
Also , continuing high rates - and they remain at emergency levels - add deficits and debt and worsen the banking system . 
It is tempting to ask whether letting the exchange rate simply go might not have been a better answer . 
But in a high inflation economy like Turkey , and in the context of high growth , a big depreciation would only have reignited inflation , knocking the country back into crisis . 
If the IMF had not delivered the necessary money , severe capital controls would have been imposed . 
Had Turkey gone that route , every country that gets into trouble in the future would likely have followed . 
That is a serious global issue . 
It was certainly on the mind of the IMF but such concerns would not have deterred Turkey . 
There is one more interesting aspect to this IMF intervention . 
In the IMF , the US Treasury , among certain German officials and in other powerful financial centers , there is now deep suspicion of anything that remotely looks like a fixed exchange rate . 
Indeed , Argentina is one of the last countries with such an arrangement and it is in the IMF emergency room . 
So why wasn &apos;t a floating rate considered ? 
The IMF stuck to its program because it recognized that Turkey faced a banking problem not an exchange rate one . 
The IMF is to be congratulated for understanding that the exchange rate is not the solution to every problem .
