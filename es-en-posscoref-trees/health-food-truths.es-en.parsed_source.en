Health Food Truths 
&quot; Low-carbohydrate &quot; pasta is in a category of health foods known in the trade as &quot; lesser evils &quot; - foods with fewer unwanted calories , fat , trans fat , sugars , salt , or carbohydrates . 
There is now a whole industry of such products , as well as health foods classified as &quot; natural , &quot; &quot; organic , &quot; and &quot; functional . &quot; 
But are these foods really better for you ? 
In the United States , &quot; organic &quot; has a precise meaning established by the US Department of Agriculture . 
&quot; Natural , &quot; however , means whatever the food producer or manufacturer says it means . 
So-called &quot; functional &quot; foods - or &quot; techno-foods &quot; - are those to which manufacturers add omega-3 oils , artificial sweeteners , indigestible starches , cholesterol reducers , soy or milk ( whey ) proteins , phytochemicals , and other ingredients to enable them to take advantage of &quot; qualified &quot; health claims permitted by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . 
Sales of lesser-evil and functional foods have done well in recent years , bringing in about $ 85 billion in US sales in 2004 . 
If you routinely buy such foods , you are among LOHAS ( Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability ) consumers - the health food industry &apos;s cherished demographic base . 
You buy low-carbohydrate products , energy and nutrition bars , vitamin- and mineral-fortified foods and beverages , soy foods , and practically anything with a health claim . 
Like many people , I thought that small , innovative companies dominated functional foods . 
In fact , PepsiCo holds a 25 % share of the market with products like Quaker cereals and fortified Tropicana juices , which qualify for FDA-approved health claims . 
Coca-Cola , General Mills , Kellogg , Kraft , Nestl√© , and Groupe Danone all have market shares ranging from 4 % to 7 % . 
These companies &quot; control of this market makes sense if you think about what they are selling . 
The most popular functional foods are soft drinks , sports drinks , breakfast cereals , snacks , energy bars , and juice drinks . 
About three-quarters of breakfast cereals make health claims for the whole grain or fiber that has been added to make them &quot; functional . &quot; 
Moreover , as Nancy Childs , a business school professor , wrote in Nutrition Business Journal in 2004 , functional foods for obesity , for example , promise their manufacturers &quot; a double reward &quot; : eligibility for qualified health claims and possible reimbursement under Medicare as a disease treatment . 
They also provide &quot; balance to food company product portfolios , thereby limiting corporate liability on both legal and stock valuation fronts &quot; - a reference to potential claims against companies that their products might cause obesity or poor health . 
But many of these products are basically sugar water or sugary foods that might as well be cookies , with ingredients added or removed to appeal to LOHAS customers who would otherwise not buy them . 
A private testing laboratory , ConsumerLab.com , found that hardly any of the &quot; vitamin waters &quot; it tested contained what their labels said they did , and some had only 20 % to 50 % of the amounts of nutrients listed . 
Likewise , half the fat in most power and energy bars - which bring in $ 2 billion in annual sales - is saturated and some is trans . 
Many bars targeted to low-carbohydrate dieters have misleading &quot; net carb &quot; calculations . 
Some do not disclose their content of sugar alcohols , and some have so much of these additives that they are almost certain to produce laxative effects or gas . 
Others are so highly fortified with vitamin A or D that ConsumerLab advises against giving them to young children . 
Even if I had not seen these results and warnings , I wouldn &apos;t eat power and energy bars , which , according to the magazine Consumer Reports , taste &quot; gritty , chalky , or chemical . &quot; 
I agree . 
When I ask friends and colleagues why they buy the bars , they say : &quot; Because I know they are healthy and I don &apos;t care how they taste . &quot; 
Well , I do . 
I can &apos;t see the point of eating indigestible vitamin-and-fiber supplemented carbohydrates flavored with artificial sweeteners . 
If I think I need more vitamins , I prefer to take a multivitamin supplement . 
If I need a hundred or so calories in a hurry , I prefer a banana , a handful of nuts , or , for that matter , a delicious candy bar . 
This is not to diminish the value of some of the lesser evils - low-fat milk and yogurt , for example . 
But most foods posing as &quot; health food &quot; raise the same question as vitamin-supplemented candy : does adding vitamins really make a food better for you ? 
Real health foods do not need to be made functional to be good for you . 
They are functional just the way they are .
