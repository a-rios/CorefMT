The Ethics of Big Food PRINCETON - Last month , Oxfam , the international aid organization , launched a campaign called &quot; Behind the Brands . &quot; 
The goal is to assess the transparency of the world &apos;s ten biggest food and beverage companies concerning how their goods are produced , and to rate their performance on sensitive issues like the treatment of small-scale farmers , sustainable water and land use , climate change , and exploitation of women . 
Consumers have an ethical responsibility to be aware of how their food is produced , and the big brands have a corresponding obligation to be more transparent about their suppliers , so that their customers can make informed choices about what they are eating . 
In many cases , the biggest food companies themselves do not know how they perform on these issues , betraying a profound lack of ethical responsibility on their part . 
Nestlé scored highest on transparency , as they provide information on at least some of their commodity sources and audit systems . 
But even its rating is only &quot; fair . &quot; 
General Mills was at the bottom of the ranking . 
In addition to this lack of transparency , Oxfam &apos;s report identifies several deficiencies common to all of the Big 10 food companies . 
The Big 10 are also not taking sufficient responsibility to ensure that their larger-scale farm suppliers pay a decent living wage to their workers . 
There are 450 million wage workers in agriculture worldwide , and in many countries they are often inadequately paid , with 60 % living in poverty . 
Some of the Big 10 are doing more than others to develop ethical policies in these areas . 
Unilever has committed itself to sourcing more raw materials from small-scale farmers , and has pledged 100 % sustainable sourcing for all of its main commodities by 2020 . 
This policy gave Unilever the highest score on openness to small farmers , with a rating of &quot; fair . &quot; 
Danone , General Mills , and Kellogg &apos;s were at the bottom , with a rating of &quot; very poor . &quot; 
For many years , Nestlé was criticized for marketing infant formula in developing countries , where breast-feeding was available and much healthier than bottle-feeding . 
It revised its policies in response to that criticism , but more recently has been targeted again for using child and forced labor to produce its cocoa . 
In 2011 , the company used the Fair Labor Association to assess its supply chain . 
The assessment confirmed that many of Nestlé &quot; s suppliers were using child and forced labor , and the company has now begun to address the problem . 
As a result , Nestlé , along with Unilever and Coca-Cola , scored &quot; fair &quot; on workers &quot; rights . 
Kellogg &apos;s received the lowest score in this category . 
Agriculture is a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions , accounting for more than the entire transport sector , and it is also one of the sectors most at risk from climate change , as recent changes in rainfall patterns have made evident . 
Clearing tropical forests for grazing or palm-oil production releases large quantities of stored carbon into the atmosphere . 
Grazing ruminant animals , like cattle and sheep , also contribute significantly to climate change . 
Here , too , the big brands receive low grades from Oxfam , mostly for failing even to track the emissions for which they are directly or indirectly responsible . 
Nestlé was the only company to achieve a &quot; fair &quot; rating , with Associated British Foods at the bottom , with a &quot; very poor &quot; rating . 
Anyone with Internet access can visit Oxfam &apos;s Web site and see how the big brands rank on each of seven ethically significant indicators . 
The highest scores currently are in the &quot; fair &quot; range , with not a single Big 10 company receiving a &quot; good &quot; rating in any category . 
Individual consumers are encouraged to contact the companies directly and urge them to demonstrate greater responsibility for the way in which they obtain the ingredients for their products . 
In this way , Oxfam hopes , its &quot; Behind the Brands &quot; campaign will trigger a &quot; race to the top &quot; in which big corporations compete to achieve the highest possible score , and to become known as truly transparent actors that produce food and beverages with a high degree of ethical responsibility . 
The changes that have already occurred show that if big corporations know that their consumers want them to act more ethically , they will do so . 
To be effective , such a campaign requires individual consumers to take it upon themselves to become better informed about the food and beverages that they consume , to make their voices heard , and to make purchasing choices that are influenced by ethics as well as by taste and price .
