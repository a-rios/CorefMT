From Prague Spring to Velvet Revolution 
WARSAW - What was the Prague Spring , or the events of 1968 more generally ? 
Their meaning , it seems , has become more , not less , debatable with the passage of time . 
My generation was forged by protests and police truncheons , by the hopes generated not only by the Prague Spring , but also by the Polish student movement that March , the Paris events of May , and the first signs of Russian democracy voiced in the early books of Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn . 
For those of us imprisoned in Poland , the Prague Spring was a harbinger of hope . 
Even Poland &apos;s communist newspapers , read behind bars , somehow conveyed news of the great changes taking place in our neighbor to the south . 
So I remember my shock when I learned about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August , and the trauma that lingered long after . 
On the tenth anniversary of that invasion , Václav Havel , Jacek Kuron , and I , along with other dissidents , met on the Czech-Polish border . 
There is a photograph of that occasion : future presidents , ministers , and parliamentarians who were at that time pursued by the police like common criminals . 
These encounters were an extension of the climate of the Prague Spring . 
We all felt that we were creating something new , something that might , one day , turn out to be an important component of democracy in our countries . 
And so it was . 
In August 1989 , I proposed in the Polish Diet a draft resolution apologizing to the Czechs and Slovaks for Polish involvement in the 1968 invasion . 
I felt that a historical circle was being closed : the ideas of the Polish March and the Prague Spring , the ideas of our mountain meetings , were becoming political facts . 
Three months later , the Velvet Revolution began in Prague . 
The main difference between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution was that the former was mostly the work of Communist Party members and others who wanted to bring about &quot; socialism with a human face . &quot; 
As a result , some people nowadays dismiss the Prague Spring as a power struggle between communists . 
But there were many roads to - and through - communism , and many of them converged with national traditions . 
Indeed , communism was attractive for many reasons , including the idea of universal justice and humanized social relations ; a response to the great spiritual crisis after World War I and , later , to the Nazis &quot; genocide ; and the conviction that Western dominance of the world was nearing its end . 
Finally , in a world divided by Yalta , communism was , for some , the only realistic choice for central Europe . 
In Czechoslovakia in 1968 , communist reformers appealed to democratic ideals that were deeply rooted in the country &apos;s pre-World War II past . 
Alexander Dubcek , the leader of the Czechoslovak communists and the symbol of the Prague Spring , personified hope for democratic evolution , real pluralism , and a peaceful way to a state governed by law and respectful of human rights . 
By contrast , in Poland , which had witnessed its own tentative opening in the March student movement , a nationalist-authoritarian faction exploited all that was intolerant and ignorant in Polish tradition , employing xenophobia and anti-intellectual rhetoric . 
Polish Interior Minister Mieczyslaw Moczar , the leader of the nationalist faction , combined communist rhetoric with a language proper to fascist movements in order to mobilize the masses against the &quot; cosmopolitan-liberal intelligentsia . &quot; 
The Polish freedom movement of 1968 lost its confrontation with police violence ; the Prague Spring was crushed by the armies of five Warsaw Pact members . 
But in both countries , 1968 gave birth to a new political consciousness . 
The Polish and Czech opposition movements that emerged only a few years later had their roots in the events of 1968 . 
The Prague Spring was provoked by a crisis in the Communist Party , but the claim that it was merely a result of political squabbles among Party members falsifies history and rejects a significant fragment of the national heritage . 
Attitudes towards communism were always a controversial subject for the anticommunist opposition . 
Some rejected communism in all its forms . 
The majority though , in one way or another , had some contact with communism , through intellectual fascination , participation in state institutions , or the cold conviction that only by accepting the reality of life under communism could one do something useful for one &apos;s country . 
These people , &quot; tainted by communism , &quot; constituted the majority of the participants in all revolts against the communist dictatorships . 
There was , however , another , category of people : the &quot; careful and untainted , &quot; who absented themselves from the world of politics . 
They hated communism , but , convinced that the system could not be reformed , they avoided the democratic opposition . 
While others took risks or sat in jails , they functioned in official and legal structures . 
One should not blame anyone today for such behavior . 
But it is surprising when these people accuse participants in the Prague Spring and the democratic opposition of links with communism . 
Communism was obviously an instrument of Soviet domination over conquered societies , but it was also a modus vivendi for large parts of these nations under the conditions in which they were obliged to live . 
Imre Nagy , the leader of the Hungarian revolt in 1956 , and Dubcek became parts of their national legends , which belies the claim that communism was exclusively a foreign imposition . 
The Prague Spring appealed to elementary values : freedom , pluralism , tolerance , sovereignty , and rejection of the dictates of communist orthodoxy . 
When I recall these events after 40 years , I see not only revolt , but also the great illusion that it might be possible to outfox the Kremlin and painlessly move society from communism to democracy . 
This belief was naïve , but it also underpinned a national awakening in which the potential for freedom found its voice .
