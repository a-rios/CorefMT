Latin America &apos;s Glossed Decade 
SANTIAGO - The Inter-American Development Bank declared last July that this would be &quot; Latin America &apos;s Decade . &quot; 
A couple of months later , The Economist endorsed that idea , which has since been repeated by countless apologists and experts . 
There is nothing like a little economic growth to get pundits &quot; juices flowing . 
Compared with the region &apos;s mostly sluggish performance over the last three decades , this looks like takeoff velocity . 
Latin America &apos;s stock markets are up sharply since the crisis , as are property prices in those few countries that keep track of house values . 
No wonder so many are so excited . 
The mood about Latin America was equally optimistic at the start of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Bank loans from the US were plentiful , and countries like Argentina , Chile , and Uruguay were growing fast . 
The early and mid-1990 &quot; s witnessed another wave of optimism . 
Commodity prices were high , external financing plentiful , and many Latin American countries grew . Having adopted the liberalizing reforms dictated by the Washington Consensus , Latin America was thought to have turned the corner . 
But then came Mexico &apos;s Tequila Crisis in 1994 , followed by the Asian meltdown , which hit Latin American economies hard . 
Brazil blew up in 1998 , and Argentina melted down in 2001 . 
I do not mean to suggest that Latin America is on the verge of another debt crisis - far from it . 
In many countries - including Brazil , Peru , and Colombia - macroeconomic management is far better than it was in the 1980 &quot; s or early 1990 &quot; s . 
But today &apos;s situation shares two features with the earlier episodes of financial euphoria over Latin America : sky-high commodity prices and cheap international money . 
In fact , for many of the region &apos;s countries , the terms of trade are higher and the relevant global interest rates lower than they have ever been . 
These factors , more than any virtuous policy change in recent years , are propelling growth . 
Indeed , today there are two Latin Americas : natural resource-rich South America and natural resource-poor Central America and Mexico . 
Not surprisingly , South America is growing much faster than its neighbors to the North - 4.4 versus 2.7 % in 2010-11 , according to a recent Inter-American Development Bank report . 
The report estimates that Argentina &apos;s economy will expand by 6.1 % in that period , while Costa Rica &apos;s will grow by 3.8 % and El Salvador &apos;s by just 1.6 % . 
Is there a single economist who believes that Argentina &apos;s policies are almost four times better than El Salvador &apos;s ? 
Plentiful international capital is also making a difference . 
The financial markets &quot; recent darling is Brazil , which grew at a breakneck 7.5 % pace in 2010 , fueled by almost $ 100 billion in capital inflows . 
By the end of 2016 , Brazil will have hosted both the World Cup and the Olympic Games . 
Few doubt Brazil &apos;s primacy when it comes to soccer . 
In this cup , Brazil does not even make it to the playoff round of 32 , occupying 58th place in the competitiveness ranking of 139 countries compiled by the World Economic Forum . 
Ahead of Brazil one finds Montenegro , Mauritius , and Azerbaijan . 
In the past , episodes of dirt-cheap money and commodity prices on steroids ended badly for Latin America . 
Will this time be different ? 
Pardon the economist &apos;s stock answer : it all depends . 
First of all , it depends on whether countries can prevent financial bubbles from developing . 
The IMF recently asked in a report : &quot; Are bubbly conditions taking hold ? &quot; 
After pointing to soaring credit growth in most South American countries ( in Brazil , growth in mortgage lending exceeded 40 % during 2010 , more than tripling the stock of credit outstanding in 2007 ) , the Fund concluded that &quot; the current expansion does not yet rise to the level of a credit boom , &quot; though &quot; it would if the expansion were sustained for a prolonged period . &quot; 
Notice the &quot; not yet . &quot; 
When a doctor says that a patient is &quot; not yet &quot; dead , family members should start to worry . 
In the same report , the IMF rang alarm bells over potential equity bubbles , pointing out that &quot; stock prices are currently above trend levels in most countries , with signs of stretched valuations in a few countries ( Chile , Colombia , and Peru ) . &quot; 
In Chile , the report met with irate denials from the brokers and fund managers who make their living selling Chilean stocks to investors . 
Whether the current episode will end in tears also depends on fiscal policy . 
Once upon a time in Latin America , fiscal policies were extremely pro-cyclical : whenever commodity prices fell , governments lost access to capital markets , so they had to eliminate their deficits just when conditions called for fiscal expansion . 
This has slowly begun to change . 
With public debt much lower than in the past , several Latin American countries ran counter-cyclical deficits for the first time in 2009 , thereby cushioning the domestic impact of the external blow from the global financial crisis . 
The problem is that governments in the region have yet to realize that countercyclical fiscal policy implies rowing against the current in both parts of the cycle : spending more when times are bad ( the easy part ) and spending less when times are good ( the true test of virtue ) . 
Today , fiscal policy remains too expansionary in virtually every Latin American country . 
That fiscal impulse , coupled with high commodity prices and abundant credit , continues to fuel economic growth today - often at the expense of stability and growth tomorrow . 
Latin America &apos;s time has finally come , too many pundits will keep saying . 
If only they were right .
