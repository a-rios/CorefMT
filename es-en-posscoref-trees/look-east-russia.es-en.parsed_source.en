Look East , Russia 
MOSCOW - Over the past 18 months , Russia &apos;s relations with Asia have begun to improve . 
Both President Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have repeatedly pointed to the need for an economic turn to Asia . 
Dozens of protocols and agreements on new projects have been signed with China . 
Nevertheless , Russia has yet to devise a long-term and comprehensive Asian strategy . 
The main force holding Russia back is , to put it bluntly , ignorance . 
Indeed , for some Russians , any economic movement towards Asia is tantamount to a departure from a European path of development . 
There is , of course , no Asian alternative to Russia &apos;s cultural and political orientation towards Europe . 
But a partial economic reorientation towards Asia does not pose any real risk of disengagement from Europe ; on the contrary , over the past two years , Russia has officially made a decisive turn in favor of closer integration with the European Union . 
Europe currently accounts for more than 50 % of Russia &apos;s trade turnover . 
But the European market will not grow to any significant extent for the foreseeable future . 
Europe &apos;s retained wealth and accrued cultural resources will allow the old continent to live in relative comfort in the decades ahead , even if it gradually cedes its position in the production of goods and services . 
Indeed , Europe is likely to become a tourist and leisure destination for hardworking Asians . 
While Russia needs to integrate itself with Europe &apos;s remaining islands of innovation ( Germany , above all ) , it is the growth potential of the Asia-Pacific region that will determine the country &apos;s future . 
Here , the main partner is China , which Russia now supplies with fertilizers , seafood , timber , nonferrous metals , and increasing volumes of crude oil . 
Unlike the West , Russia imports from China not so much consumer goods as engineering products . 
In most industries , head-to-head competition with Asia would be senseless , given Russia &apos;s higher labor costs . 
But , if current trends persist , Russia east of the Urals , and later the entire country , will become an appendage of China - a warehouse of resources , and then an economic and political vassal . 
No &quot; aggressive &quot; or unfriendly effort by China will be needed ; 
There is no immediate geopolitical threat in this situation . 
Territorial expansion is not a Chinese historical trait , and the two countries have excellent political relations . 
But the Chinese are already offering Russia projects that are similar to those that they promote in African states : the development of resources with Chinese money and Chinese labor . 
Russia must act now to secure a more dignified and beneficial place in a future world order . 
That goal requires that Russia rely on its real competitive advantages . 
Consider basic foodstuffs . 
Rising food prices plague most of Asia , while Russia &apos;s potential for expanding grain output is enormous . 
According to some estimates , Russia could increase its arable area by 10 million hectares , and its crop yields by 250 % , thereby boosting grain exports dramatically . 
But an even larger vision is needed . 
A modern Asian strategy for Russia - call it &quot; Project Siberia &quot; - should combine Russian political sovereignty with foreign capital and technologies . 
Investment should come not only from China , but also from the United States , Japan , South Korea , the ASEAN countries , and the EU , all of which are keen to prevent China &apos;s exclusive dominance east of the Urals . 
The workforce can be found to undertake the development projects in Russia &apos;s east , including clusters of high-yielding agricultural production for grain , fodder , meat , poultry , pork , and possibly beer . 
There are still a few million surplus workers in Central Asia . 
And , yes , some will have to be brought in from China . 
Of course , such a strategy will require highways , bridges , railways , and seaports . 
( There are practically no grain-export terminals in Russia &apos;s eastern regions , for example . ) 
Some Russians fear that if China is allowed to build these projects , crowds of Chinese will flock into the country . 
My answer is this : if we stay where we are , like the proverbial dog in the manger , the hay - Russia &apos;s economy - will rot . 
The strategy should be to transform Russia &apos;s eastern regions into one of rising Asia &apos;s resource and food bases . 
Russia &apos;s east should become a provider of relatively high value-added goods , rather than just an exporter of timber , oil , ore , and seafood , as is the case now . 
Such a scenario would reverse the gloomy demographic and economic trends in Russia &apos;s eastern territories , and would strengthen Russia &apos;s geopolitical position in the process . 
What makes Project Siberia so efficient is that it benefits everyone . 
Russia would maintain effective sovereignty over the eastern territories while creating a new platform for development . 
China , Asia , and the world would get a new resource and food-supply base , easing emerging shortages . 
And , last but not least , the vision of peaceful global integration would receive a powerful boost .
