The Inequality Nightmare 
ABU DHABI - &quot; The poor cannot sleep , because they are hungry , &quot; the Nigerian economist Sam Aluko famously said in 1999 , &quot; and the rich cannot sleep , because the poor are awake and hungry . &quot; 
We are all affected by deep disparities of income and wealth , because the political and economic system on which our prosperity depends cannot continue enriching some while it impoverishes others . 
During hard times , the poor lose faith in their leaders and the economic system ; and when times are good , too few enjoy the benefits . 
The GINI coefficient , a measure of economic inequality , has been rising for many years in developing as well as developed countries , including the United States . 
In Europe , inequalities have intensified as a result of rapidly rising unemployment , especially among young people . 
Some have reacted by rioting ; others have backed far-right xenophobic political parties ; many more seethe quietly , growing ever more resentful of politicians and the system they represent . 
The problem is starkest in the world &apos;s megacities , which account for around 80 % of global GDP . 
But even in the most developed cities , disparities can be marked . 
For example , as you travel on the London Underground just six miles ( or 14 stops ) east from the heart of government at Westminster to Canning Town , the life expectancy of the inhabitants at each successive stop falls by six months . 
But inequality is most acute in emerging economies where urbanization has been fastest . 
By 2030 , an estimated 2.7 billion more people will have migrated to cities , almost entirely in developing countries . 
Many will encounter hopelessness and exclusion there , rather than the good jobs and better life for which they came . 
Megacities like Mumbai , Nairobi , and Kinshasa are essentially small cities surrounded by huge slums - pockets of wealth in a sea of despair . 
None resembles the likes of Tokyo , New York , or London , which , despite areas of deprivation , are notable for a more equitable distribution of wealth . 
Such disparities are equally apparent at the national level , especially in some of Africa &apos;s resource-rich countries . 
While demand for private jets is booming , 60 % of the population lives on less than $ 1.25 a day . 
As the world overall grows richer , the benefits continue to flow overwhelmingly to a tiny elite . 
As a result , efforts to promote more inclusive growth have become crucial , not only for moral reasons , but also to ensure the survival of the global economic system . 
This involves more than wealth distribution . 
It means creating real jobs to draw workers away from the informal economy , so they can benefit from workplace protections ( and pay taxes ) . 
Every country will have its own specific priorities , and the range of possible policy measures is quite broad . 
It might include a social safety net , promotion of gender equality , support for farmers , improvement of access to financial services , or countless other initiatives . 
But two overriding sets of policies appear to apply in almost all cases , according to a recent World Economic Forum debate on how best to spread the wealth . 
The first seeks to ensure that poor children have access to a reasonably good education as a means to reduce intergenerational poverty . 
The second set of policies , which are particularly relevant in resource-rich countries , aims at guaranteeing all citizens - and especially the poorest - a share of revenues from what are unquestionably national assets . 
Such policies have been shown to work in places like Brazil , whose pioneering Bolsa Familia ( or family allowance ) policy provides cash transfers to poor families on the condition that their children attend school , eat properly , and fulfill other criteria to improve well-being . 
Mexico &apos;s &quot; Opportunity &quot; program performs a similar function . 
Oil-rich Alaska pays dividends from its resource revenues to all of its citizens , a model that several developing countries are seeking to emulate . 
Although economists continue to debate the advantages and disadvantages of such schemes , they are not particularly complicated to set up . 
The challenge lies in forging partnerships and agreeing goals . 
Governments , businesses , non-governmental organizations , and individual citizens , rich or poor , all have a role to play . 
If we ignore the dangers of wealth disparities for much longer , the consequences will be far more distressing than a few sleepless nights .
