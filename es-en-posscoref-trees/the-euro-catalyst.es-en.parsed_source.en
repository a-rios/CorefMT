The Euro Catalyst 
PARIS - In 2000 , shortly after the launch of the euro , I wrote a book arguing that countries adopting the common currency should be forced in one way or another to implement structural reforms . 
Ten years later , where do we stand ? 
Surprisingly , the first country to reform was Germany . 
Thanks to an environment favorable to export-oriented firms and , most notably , to wage discipline , Germany began to post significant balance-of-payment surpluses . 
This is evident today on a dramatic scale , and is sustaining German economic growth , and one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe . 
The story is markedly different in other eurozone members . 
The &quot; PIIGS &quot; ( Portugal , Italy , Ireland , Greece , and Spain ) greatly benefited from the euro , thanks not only to the removal of currency-related trade barriers , but also because their interest rates suddenly fell to levels unthinkable in pre-euro times . 
Furthermore , because these countries no longer faced current-account constraints , they could spend beyond their means without any immediate apparent damage to their economies . 
With this artificial boost to their economic growth , they had little incentive to press ahead with unpopular reforms in line with the European Union &apos;s Lisbon agenda . 
Then came the global crisis . 
During these hard times ( 2007-2009 ) , the euro &apos;s usefulness and the eurozone &apos;s resilience were welcomed the world over . 
Only during the exit from the crisis did problems begin to surface . 
The size of public debts , which had been ballooning in many countries during the crisis , together with growing competitiveness gaps between member states , began worrying markets . 
Some investors , doubtful of the sustainability of some countries &quot; public debt , began to worry about the viability of the euro itself . 
Reactions to this perilous momentum came without delay . 
At the European level , there has been a swift and impressive mobilization of resources . 
And EU President Herman van Rompuy is preparing a framework for enhanced fiscal surveillance , prevention , and resolution . 
As Jean Monnet , one of the &quot; founding fathers &quot; European integration , presciently observed in his memoirs 35 years ago , &quot; the European construction is moving ahead during crisis , and it will be the sum of the solutions brought about in order to overcome them . &quot; 
No one can deny that structural reforms are currently underway in all eurozone countries that have been struck by the crisis . 
Suddenly , reform became une imp√©rieuse obligation , if not - given the pressure of financial markets - a matter of outright survival . 
Consider Greece , the eurozone member in the most acute predicament . 
Reforms of the labor market , the pension system , and those underway or planned in many sectors and professions - all of which generate huge reserves for enhanced growth and , therefore , hope - reflect a profound change in the public &apos;s perception of the country &apos;s long-term needs . 
Indeed , despite endemic social unrest , a large majority of Greeks acknowledges the need for change and does not oppose it . 
Euroskeptics will say that it is not the euro , but the crisis itself , that has catalyzed reform . 
To be sure , the euro alone has not been a sufficient trigger . 
But , given past European experience , there is serious reason to doubt that , in the absence of the euro , the crisis alone would have provided the necessary impetus . 
Before the euro , a country facing a public-finance crisis would have been forced into a predictable , hopeless sequence : devaluation of its currency , followed by inflation , which alleviated the public-debt burden . 
It wasn &apos;t long before it was back to &quot; business as usual , &quot; with hardly any structural reform . 
How many Greek crises , after all , paved the way to Greece &apos;s current crisis ? 
Competitive devaluation , which skeptics are calling for , must be avoided this time around . 
Eurozone members facing a loss of competitiveness can no longer afford to skirt difficult but necessary reforms through a monetary &quot; quick fix &quot; that shifts the burden onto their trade partners : as always , beggar-thy-neighbor policies reward laxity and penalize virtue . 
As for the structural reforms now underway or in the planning stage , the most important question is not whether the euro , the crisis , or a combination of the two brought them about , but whether they will succeed . 
Clearly , failure would impose huge political costs that leaders will be impelled to take all necessary steps to avoid . 
They already have shown remarkable determination , providing grounds to be optimistic that this time things will , indeed , be different .
