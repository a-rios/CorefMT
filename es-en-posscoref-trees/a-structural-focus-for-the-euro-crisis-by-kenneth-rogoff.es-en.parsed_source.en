Europe &apos;s Lost Keynesians 
CAMBRIDGE - There is no magic Keynesian bullet for the eurozone &apos;s woes . 
But the spectacularly muddle-headed argument nowadays that too much austerity is killing Europe is not surprising . 
Commentators are consumed by politics , flailing away at any available target , while the &quot; anti-austerity &quot; masses apparently believe that there are easy cyclical solutions to tough structural problems . 
The eurozone &apos;s difficulties , I have long argued , stem from European financial and monetary integration having gotten too far ahead of actual political , fiscal , and banking union . 
This is not a problem with which Keynes was familiar , much less one that he sought to address . 
Above all , any realistic strategy for dealing with the eurozone crisis must involve massive write-downs ( forgiveness ) of peripheral countries &quot; debt . 
These countries &quot; massive combined bank and government debt - the distinction everywhere in Europe has become blurred - makes rapid sustained growth a dream . 
This is hardly the first time I have stressed the need for wholesale debt write-downs . 
Two years ago , in a commentary called &quot; The Euro &apos;s Pig-Headed Masters , &quot; I wrote that &quot; Europe is in constitutional crisis . 
No one seems to have the power to impose a sensible resolution of its peripheral countries &quot; debt crisis . 
Instead of restructuring the manifestly unsustainable debt burdens of Portugal , Ireland , and Greece ( the PIGs ) , politicians and policymakers are pushing for ever-larger bailout packages with ever-less realistic austerity conditions . &quot; 
My sometime co-author Carmen Reinhart makes the same point , perhaps even more clearly . 
In a May 2010 Washington Post editorial ( co-authored with Vincent Reinhart ) , she described &quot; Five Myths About the European Debt Crisis &quot; - among them , &quot; Myth # 3 : Fiscal austerity will solve Europe &apos;s debt woes . &quot; 
We have repeated the mantra dozens of times in various settings , as any fair observer would confirm . 
In a debt restructuring , the northern eurozone countries ( including France ) will see hundreds of billions of euros go up in smoke . 
Northern taxpayers will be forced to inject massive amounts of capital into banks , even if the authorities impose significant losses on banks &quot; large and wholesale creditors , as well they should . 
These hundreds of billions of euros are already lost , and the game of pretending otherwise cannot continue indefinitely . 
A gentler way to achieve some modest reduction in public and private debt burdens would be to commit to a period of sustained but moderate inflation , as I recommended in December 2008 in a commentary entitled &quot; Inflation is Now the Lesser Evil . &quot; 
Sustained moderate inflation would help to bring down the real value of real estate more quickly , and potentially make it easier for German wages to rise faster than those in peripheral countries . 
It would have been a great idea four and a half years ago . 
It remains a good idea today . 
What else needs to happen ? 
The other steps involve economic restructuring at the national level and political integration of the eurozone . 
In another commentary , &quot; A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold , &quot; I concluded that &quot; without further profound political and economic integration - which may not end up including all current eurozone members - the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade . &quot; 
Here , all eyes may be on Germany , but today it is really France that will play the central role in deciding the euro &apos;s fate . 
Germany cannot carry the euro on its shoulders alone indefinitely . 
France needs to become a second anchor of growth and stability . 
Temporary Keynesian demand measures may help to sustain short-run internal growth , but they will not solve France &apos;s long-run competitiveness problems . 
At the same time , France and Germany must both come to terms with an approach that leads to far greater political union within a couple of decades . 
Otherwise , the coming banking union and fiscal transfers will lack the necessary political legitimacy . 
As my colleague Jeffrey Frankel has remarked , for more than 20 years , Germany &apos;s elites have insisted that the eurozone will not be a transfer union . 
But , in the end , ordinary Germans have been proved right , and the elites have been proved wrong . 
Indeed , if the eurozone is to survive , the northern countries will have to continue to help the periphery with new loans until access to private markets is restored . 
So , given that Germany will be picking up many more bills ( regardless of whether the eurozone survives ) , how can it best use the strength of its balance sheet to alleviate Europe &apos;s growth problems ? 
Certainly , Germany must continue to acquiesce in an ever-larger role for the European Central Bank , despite the obvious implicit fiscal risks . 
There is no safe path forward . 
There are a number of schemes floating around for leveraging Germany &apos;s lower borrowing costs to help its partner countries , beyond simply expanding the ECB &apos;s balance sheet . 
For meaningful burden-sharing to work , however , eurozone leaders must stop dreaming that the single currency can survive another 20 or 30 years without much greater political union . 
Debt write-downs and guarantees will inevitably bloat Germany &apos;s government debt , as the authorities are forced to bail out German banks ( and probably some neighboring countries &quot; banks ) . 
But the sooner the underlying reality is made transparent and becomes widely recognized , the lower the long-run cost will be . 
To my mind , using Germany &apos;s balance sheet to help its neighbors directly is far more likely to work than is the presumed &quot; trickle-down &quot; effect of a German-led fiscal expansion . 
This , unfortunately , is what has been lost in the debate about Europe of late : However loud and aggressive the anti-austerity movement becomes , there still will be no simple Keynesian cure for the single currency &apos;s debt and growth woes .
