The Lawless Sheriff 
I usually limit myself in my newspaper commentaries to my area of expertise , economics . 
But as an American , I am so horrified by what has happened in my country - and what my country has done to others over the past two years - that I feel I must speak out . 
I believe American abuses of human rights and the canons of civilized peoples that have come to light in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Guantanamo Bay , and the more horrendous abuses that almost surely will come to light later , are not merely the act of aberrant individuals . 
They are the result of a Bush administration that has trampled on human rights and international law , including the Geneva conventions , and tried to undermine basic democratic protections , ever since it took office . 
Sadly , torture and other atrocities do happen in war - and the Iraq war is certainly not the only time torture has been used - but I believe that the Bush administration is responsible for creating a climate in which international law and democratic processes have been disregarded . 
When Vice President Dick Cheney spoke at the last World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , he was asked how the administration could justify what was taking place in Guatanamo Bay , where prisoners are being kept without being charged and without counsel . 
Cheney &apos;s answer was jarring : he said that because the detainees were captured in Afghanistan where they had been trying to kill US troops , the rules regarding prisoners of war did not apply . 
Many in the audience were shocked by his remarks , but Cheney seemingly failed to grasp how appalled his audience was . 
They were not concerned with legalisms , about whether , technically , the Geneva conventions did or did not apply . 
They were concerned about basic canons of human rights . 
Among the most appalled were those who had recently struggled to achieve democracy , and were continuing to fight for human rights . 
The Bush administration has also trampled on citizens &apos; basic right to know what their government is doing , refusing , for example , to disclose who was on the task force that shaped its energy policy - though one really doesn &apos;t need that information to see that it was shaped by the oil industry and for the oil industry . 
When abuses occur in one area , they can quickly spread to others . 
For weeks the Bush administration kept the report on abuses in Iraqi prisons from the American people by pressuring CBS not to air the photographs in its possession . 
Similarly , it was only through the use of the Freedom of Information Act that the dramatic photographs of the coffins of US soldiers coming home were finally made public . 
The American media have not emerged unscathed . 
Why did CBS refuse to release information of vital concern to the public ? 
The abuses should have been covered months ago . 
Amnesty International held a press conference on the topic in Baghdad in July 2003 . 
And while the pictures and the story of Abu Ghraib ran on front pages in Europe and elsewhere , it was at first buried in many American newspapers , including leaders like The New York Times . 
Were they worried about offending the Bush administration ? 
Defenders of President Bush , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and the military emphasize the difficulty of the task they face in Iraq , human frailty and fallibility , and the fact that there are always a few &quot; rotten apples . &quot; 
America &apos;s system of government , however , recognizes all of this , and attempts to guard against it . 
Had the letter and spirit of these safeguards been followed , we would not have been in this war at all , or at least not alone . 
Yes , it is conceivable that Bush did not have accurate information about whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction . 
But under the international rules that America is supposed to follow , wars should not be undertaken based on the judgment of one individual and his cabal . 
The judgment of the world was that the evidence was not there - and the world was right . 
Had Bush only gone along with the democratic processes enshrined in the UN Charter , the trauma of Iraq need not have occurred . 
We know that individuals and institutions make mistakes . 
Such mistakes are all the more likely in times of stress . 
We have to put in place rules and procedures , safeguards , a system of due process , to make it more likely that justice is done ; and in times of stress it is all the more important that we respect these safeguards . 
It is clear that the checks needed to prevent abuse in the Iraqi and Afghan prisons were not in place , and that the Bush Administration had created a climate that made such abuses more likely , if not inevitable . 
More fundamentally , something has gone wrong with the system of checks and balances in America &apos;s democracy . 
Congress and the press should have checked the president . 
The international community tried . 
Unfortunately , the global system of international law and governance remains too weak to prevent the determined misbehavior of the president of the world &apos;s most powerful country if he is hell bent on starting a war on his own . 
It is at moments such as these that we realize how thin a veneer our civilization may be . 
As statements of shared values and principles , the UN Charter , the Declaration of Human Rights , and the Geneva conventions are great achievements . 
Whether they have the force of law is not the point ; they provide guidance for civilized behavior . 
Each of them was motivated by the horrific lessons of the past . 
Let us hope that , emerging out of today &apos;s scandals , there will be a renewed commitment to live up to these ideals and to strengthen the institutions that were designed to enforce them .
