Is Europe &apos;s Financial Crisis Over ? 
LONDON - The European Central Bank &apos;s recently announced policy of bond buying , what it calls &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMTs ) marks a convergence of European central banks with their Anglo-Saxon counterparts . 
While the ECB &apos;s actions represent the best chance yet to put an end to a crisis that has been playing out since 2010 , the Bank has markedly raised the stakes for governments . 
The ECB &apos;s policy framework is well suited to fighting systemic blazes , but poorly suited to local fires , which thus can spread uncontrollably . 
The OMT program , which allows the ECB to buy sovereign bonds of countries that have agreed to reform their economies , significantly levels the playing field between the Bank and its advanced-economy peers . 
Spain has the same fiscal and structural problems that it had prior to the OMT program &apos;s launch , but now it has an external lender of last resort . 
That is a game-changer . 
Under the pre-OMT regime , a capital outflow from Spain , whether through the sale of government bonds or the liquidation of private claims , resulted in tighter monetary conditions . 
The sale of sovereign bonds under the fixed exchange-rate regime put direct upward pressure on their yields , while sales of private securities by foreigners had a similar effect , but through indirect channels . 
Monetary tightening was forestalled only to the extent that another source of foreign capital ( either private or ECB ) could replace the outflow . 
The point at which credit risk becomes exchange-rate / redenomination risk is ambiguous . 
But the metamorphosis tends to go hand in hand with localized monetary contractions that exacerbate the correlated risk of sovereign default and bank failures . 
In Spain , as in Greece before it , the monetary squeeze has become chronic as banks run short of ECB-eligible collateral . 
Under the OMT program , the ECB can replace foreign outflows from sovereign-bond markets through direct purchases , putting Spain on par with non-eurozone countries like the United Kingdom . 
And , to the extent that there is even an informal price target associated with the ECB &apos;s commitment to purchase bonds , foreign outflows , at least from the sovereign-bond market , are automatically replaced , in full , with ECB cash . 
Without the ECB &apos;s willingness to buy a potentially unlimited volume of sovereign bonds to achieve its very imprecise objective of mitigating redenomination risk , the eurozone would have been doomed to recurring episodes of internal funding stress . 
The OMT program breaks the volatile liquidity cycle that stems from chronic shortages of bank collateral and a limited fiscal transfer mechanism . 
More broadly , the ECB &apos;s marginal lending facility is an indirect means of monetizing sovereign debt . 
It is an even less direct way to address the private , related-debt overhang . 
But it works . 
That said , much can still go wrong . 
The ECB has bought time , but it has also raised the stakes . 
The credibility of its pledge depends as much on what it will do ( buy unlimited quantities of government bonds ) as on what it will not do ( buy them from countries that do not fulfill conditionality ) . 
Without a credible threat to cut off wayward sovereigns , the ECB &apos;s pledge provides a free lunch to investors and governments alike . 
The problem is that following through on that threat would severely test the ECB &apos;s commitment to do whatever it takes . 
After all , if markets truly believed that the ECB would refuse to backstop errant governments , investors would run away from participating countries at the first sign that conditionality was not being met . 
As with its predecessor , the Securities Markets Program , the OMT program is legally and democratically questionable : it violates the spirit , but not the letter , of the European Union treaty &apos;s no-bailout clause ; its promise of equal treatment with private creditors still has no precedent ; and it involves back-door fiscal transfers , leaving the ECB heavily exposed to political backlash - witness the visceral reaction of the German press to ECB President Mario Draghi &apos;s announcement . 
But OMTs also fit well with a large body of historical evidence that , in times of crisis , policymakers must focus on extinguishing the fire , rather than negotiating over who owns the water and what its cost should be . 
The OMT program will cause credit conditions to ease , but without necessarily reversing the financial balkanization of the eurozone that has occurred over the last three years . 
Reversal of that process will likely not occur until the three key elements of banking union - common supervision , common deposit insurance , and a common resolution fund - are within tangible reach . 
Indeed , if Spanish savers become truly afraid of redenomination risk in the interim , the OMT will not matter : they will just take their cash and deposit it as quickly as possible in , say , a German bank . 
The eurozone is still prone to bad equilibria as long as growth on its periphery remains weak . 
Even with OMTs , there remain crucial differences between the eurozone and the Anglo-Saxon economies . 
Fixed exchange rates within the eurozone impose a constraint that simply does not exist in the UK or the United States , and quantitative easing by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve is unconditional in nature . 
With OMTs , the ECB has converged toward the Fed in its ability to backstop each of its individual parts . 
Whether that hastens or hinders political progress toward fiscal and banking federalism is the next big question . 
In the interim , OMTs enable financial markets to start breathing again . 
The acute crisis is over , at least for now . 
But the existential challenge - political agreement on the key elements of banking and fiscal union - is only just beginning . 
Unless it is met , the eurozone &apos;s financial disintegration will eventually resume .
