Showdown in Tibet 
On March 14 , the otherworldly calm of Lhasa , Tibet &apos;s holy city , was shattered by riots and gunfire . 
The spark that triggered unrest in the Tibetan part of what is now a largely ethnic Han Chinese city is unclear , but occurred somewhere near the Ramoche Temple when Chinese security forces attempted to stop a demonstration by monks . 
Whatever the details , only a spark was needed to set off the most serious disturbances in Tibet since the riots of 1987-1989 , or perhaps since the Tibetan Revolt of March 1959 , which sent the Dalai Lama into exile . 
It was the 49th anniversary of that revolt , on March 10 , that led monks from two large monasteries near Lhasa to stage demonstrations , in which many of them were arrested , raising tensions in the city . 
While denying much of what subsequently happened , Chinese officials did reveal the scale of the riots : 422 Chinese-owned shops partially or completely burned , more than 200 million yuan ( $ 28 million ) in damage , 325 people injured , and 13 killed - all of them Han Chinese . 
China admitted to no deaths among the Tibetan protesters , claiming that its security forces had exercised restraint and had not even fired a single shot . 
This contradicted Tibetan reports of dozens of deaths , perhaps as many as 100 , and accounts of foreign tourists who said they heard shots and saw the bodies of Tibetans gunned down by the security forces . 
China claimed that the &quot; Dalai Clique &quot; had &quot; organized , premeditated , and carefully engineered and instigated &quot; incidents of &quot; beating , smashing , looting , and burning , &quot; in an attempt to use the upcoming Olympic Games in Beijing to publicize his cause of Tibetan independence . 
But the only evidence China offered was international Tibetan support groups &quot; statements that they intended to demonstrate at events associated with the Olympics . 
The claim that force had not been used came from the Tibetan head of the supposedly autonomous government of Tibet , Jampa Phuntsok , who was in Beijing at the time for a meeting of China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress . 
Significantly , he remained in Beijing , while the Han Chinese head of the Communist Party in Tibet , Zhang Qingli , returned to handle the situation . 
Phuntsok also claimed that the People &apos;s Liberation Army had not been used to put down the riot - a sensitive issue because China does not like to admit that the PLA is used internally , as it was during the 1989 Tiananmen massacre . 
He said that only the Public Security Police and People &apos;s Armed Police had been used . 
However , foreign military experts observed that the type of armored vehicles used in Lhasa and shown on film were of the type issued only to elite PLA units , though their PLA markings were obscured . 
In the aftermath of the Lhasa riots , similar disturbances occurred across the Tibetan Plateau , now divided into the Tibet Autonomous Region and several autonomous districts in the neighboring provinces of Qinghai , Gansu , Sichuan , and Yunnan . 
More Tibetan deaths were reported , with China admitting that in some of these instances its security forces had opened fire &quot; in self-defense . &quot; 
Chinese security forces then began to move into all Tibetan areas in large numbers . 
China unleashed a barrage of propaganda claiming that the world should condemn the Dalai Lama , not China , for instigating the riots , and that only innocent Chinese had suffered . 
But the evidence suggests that the riots in Lhasa and elsewhere were an expression of Tibetan frustration at years of Chinese control and repression . 
The situation is unlikely to improve . 
On the contrary , China now reports that it is rounding up &quot; criminals &quot; across Tibet and will &quot; re-educate &quot; them about their misguided beliefs in Tibetan freedom and independence . 
World leaders have called on China to exercise restraint and begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama . 
Neither is likely . 
World leaders seem inclined against a boycott of August &apos;s Olympic Games , or even of the opening ceremonies , which will highlight China &apos;s policies aimed at a &quot; harmonious society and harmonious world , &quot; and will certainly feature performances by happy national minorities , including Tibetans . 
As in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre , the world appears to prefer good economic and diplomatic relations with China over all else .
