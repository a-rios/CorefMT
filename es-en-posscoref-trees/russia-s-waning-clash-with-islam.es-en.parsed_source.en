Russia \ u0027s Waning Clash with Islam 
As the so-called &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; between Islam and the West commands world attention , Russia &apos;s war in Chechnya has frequently been seen as a major front in that broader battle . 
So it is noteworthy that , as the US-led invasion of Iraq - and with it , America &apos;s clash with the Islamic world - grows more heated , Russia &apos;s battle with Muslim Chechens may be waning into something like peace . 
The recent referendum in Chechnya on a new constitution coincided with the start of the war in Iraq . 
The outcome was better than anyone in the Kremlin could have hoped for : 89 % of the Chechen electorate turned out to vote , and 96 % of voters supported the Moscow-drafted constitution . 
These numbers surprised even President Vladimir Putin . 
At a cabinet meeting after the vote , he openly suggested that his officials might have been just a little too &quot; proactive &quot; in achieving such overwhelming results . 
How should we interpret this &quot; Yes &quot; vote by the Chechen population ? 
The numbers speak for themselves . 
Of course , ballot rigging took place . 
But if officials falsified 10 % , 20 % , or even 30 % of the ballots - and no one suggests such a level of fraud - the vote in favor of the constitution would still amount to an overwhelming majority of Chechnya &apos;s population . 
Even if one subtracts the votes cast by Russian soldiers ( 5 % of the total ) , most of those who participated in the vote supported keeping Chechnya in Russia . 
The mere fact that a vote took place is important . 
Exhausted by the ongoing war , most Chechens now are ready to resolve their problems within the framework provided by Russia &apos;s elastic federal structure . 
They are prepared to discuss a constitution according to which they remain within the Russian Federation , but with a great deal of local autonomy , such as the republic of Tartarstan enjoys . 
A simple , practical calculation was also in play . 
The Chechens hope that adopting a constitution , followed by the election of a Chechen president , will spare them the horrors of purge and arrests that would invariably have followed had either side secured a military victory . 
Pavel Krasheninnikov , president of the State Duma &apos;s Committee on Legislation , recently promised an amnesty for the guerillas , which could never have been issued without President Putin &apos;s express approval . 
Add to this the fact that a constitutional settlement makes material support and compensation from the Russian government more realistic , and it becomes apparent why Chechens now see a glimmer of hope , albeit still somewhat faint , that peace will leave them better off than pressing on with armed struggle . 
The separatists &apos; silence as the referendum took place was something of a surprise , despite the fact that the vote was a moment of truth for them as much as for Putin &apos;s government . 
If guerillas loyal to Aslan Maskhadov ( the man elected president of Chechnya some years ago ) or Shamil Basaev ( another guerrilla commander ) had committed a terrorist act at merely one voting station , the huge turnout of Chechens voluntarily expressing &quot; pro-Russian &quot; sentiments would not have been possible . 
By not staging terrorist acts , the rebels admitted that they are not what they were in 1995 or 1997 . 
If Russians are stunned by the outcome of the Chechen referendum , so too is the international community . 
Some organizations - the Council of Europe &apos;s Parliamentary Assembly and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , to cite two examples - greeted the referendum results with skepticism , citing the lack of independent foreign observers during the voting . 
Other bodies want to revive the idea of creating an international tribunal to investigate war crimes in Chechnya . 
Given the strength of the vote in its favor , and the importance that Putin &apos;s administration has given to the war in Chechnya , Russia &apos;s government is unlikely to give much weight to these quibbles . 
What the Kremlin will care about is the looming choice of Chechnya &apos;s president . 
The election will take place this December , which coincides with scheduled elections for the Duma . 
The head of the Kremlin-appointed Chechen administration , Akhmad Kadyrov , is already discussing this with the president of the federal election commission . 
Kadyrov thinks that the referendum results put him squarely on the path to securing the Chechen presidency for himself . 
Perhaps . 
But it is also possible that this former Chechen mufti doesn &apos;t grasp the Byzantine nature of Kremlin politics . 
President Putin might easily replace him with someone deemed more reliable or better suited to challenge Maskhadov , should he run . 
In the months before the election , Russia &apos;s leaders must make a concerted effort to convince Chechnya &apos;s people that they were wise to risk voting in the referendum . 
They can do so by speeding up reconstruction efforts and increasing humanitarian assistance . 
The sooner this happens , the more difficult it will be for the separatists to claim that they alone are the legitimate authors of Chechnya &apos;s fate .
