Peril or Promise in North Korea ? 
MADRID - Two days after Kim Jong-il , North Korea &apos;s leader , died in a train in his country , South Korean authorities still knew nothing about it . 
Meanwhile , American officials seemed at a loss , with the State Department at first merely acknowledging that press reports had mentioned his death . 
The South Korean and US intelligence services &quot; inability to pick up any sign of what had happened attests to the North Korean regime &apos;s opaque character , but also to their own deficiencies . 
Nonetheless , we know very little of that country , because all vital information is restricted to a small group of leaders obsessed with secrecy . 
The leadership change is occurring at the worst possible time . 
All of the symbolic attributes of power have been transferred to Kim Jong-un - reflected in his official position in the funeral ceremonies , his presidency of the Military Commission , and his assumption of the ruling party &apos;s highest rank - with remarkable speed . 
The economic situation , which is still very precarious , with many people living close to starvation , constitutes another key challenge . 
Two examples suffice to illustrate the impact : the price of rice has tripled while consumption of electricity is down by two-thirds from two decades ago . 
My personal memories of North Korea , now almost ten years old , are of a poor and depressed country . 
Pyongyang , the capital , was dark and deserted , illuminated by the cavalcade taking us from the official housing to the opera house , only to return to darkness behind us . 
Kim Jong-il was greeted with the same fervor when he entered the opera house that today marks public mourning of his death . 
My trip took place in April 2002 , a somewhat optimistic time . 
The European Union had joined an agreement initiated by the two Koreas and the US within the Korean Energy Development Organization program , the objective being to persuade North Korea to freeze and later dismantle its nuclear program . 
In exchange , two light-water nuclear reactors would be built to generate electric energy , and 500,000 metric tons of oil would be supplied annually until the first reactor began operating . 
In turn , the EU initiated an extensive humanitarian aid project . 
The talks with Kim Jong-il and his collaborators seemed promising . 
Unfortunately , the agreement did not last long . 
In 2003 , North Korea abandoned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . 
From that moment , all optimism was lost , until contacts were subsequently reinitiated in a complex six-party format ( China , Russia , the US , Japan , and the two Koreas ) that continued , with ups and downs , until the end of 2007 . 
Since the maritime incidents of 2009 and 2010 , in which North Korean forces attacked South Korean assets , there has been virtually no contact at all between the two sides . 
Given North Korea &apos;s behavior over the last decade , the sudden change of leadership increases the threat of unexpected incidents . 
In order to limit the risk , it is essential to keep relations with China as transparent as possible . 
It is China that has the most direct contact with North Korea , and that could best catalyze resumption of the six-party talks . 
China recognizes that North Korea cannot continue in its present form , and would like to see its leaders transform the economy without undertaking substantial political change . 
Is that possible ? 
Could it be done quickly enough to boost other regional players &quot; confidence that the country &apos;s evolution will be predictable ? 
For China , problems are judged according to the country &apos;s own history and from the standpoint of domestic policy - all the more so the closer the problem is to its borders . 
For the West , especially the US , every problem should have a solution within a finite period of time . 
While the US breaks down problems and tries to find solutions for each part , China considers political problems unhurriedly , as an extended process that might have no resolution . 
Beyond the six-party talks , it is necessary to create a framework from which a cooperative dialogue between the US and China might emerge . 
In the case of Korea - as Christopher Hill , one of the most effective US negotiators on these matters , remembers - the US should make it clear that no possible solution for the divided peninsula would mean a strategic loss for China . 
After the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953 , the 38th parallel was established as the limit for US forces &quot; presence ; the importance of that war for China should not be forgotten . 
This approach could be one way to stabilize the region during this period of heightened uncertainty . 
There might be others . 
The ongoing opening in Myanmar ( Burma ) shows that potentially significant political change does not need to be accompanied by regional instability . 
In the case of North Korea , where nuclear arms are in play , it cannot afford to be .
