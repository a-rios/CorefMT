Nature , Inc . ? 
BERLIN - Today , few people retain any illusions that United Nations conventions like the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity can avert global warming , the loss of biodiversity , and the depletion of arable soil and water . 
Likewise , the pursuit of hard caps for CO2 emissions and stricter environmental and social standards to reduce natural-resource consumption and protect workers seems to have fallen out of vogue , with crisis-stricken economies concerned that such regulations would impede investment and trade . 
As old methods have lost credibility , some governments , economists , and international institutions like the UN Environment Program have adopted a new approach , based on the view that nature is an &quot; ecosystem service &quot; provider . 
In doing so , they have shifted the onus of addressing environmental risk onto the private sector and market-based mechanisms . 
In this new paradigm , ecological preservation is a commercial matter , with the natural environment amounting to nothing more than a set of tradable goods and services . 
The upshot of this logic is that ecosystem services will no longer be provided for free . 
Indeed , according to Pavan Sukhdev , the lead author of The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity study , which aims to highlight the economic impact of environmental degradation , &quot; We use nature because it &apos;s valuable , but we lose it because it &apos;s free . &quot; 
To be sure , assigning value to ecosystem services goes beyond simply putting a price tag on them . 
In fact , this approach can help to shape environmental policies that more efficiently capture the benefits of biodiversity and ecosystems . 
Unlike GDP , some new accounting-system models include mechanisms for quantifying either the advantages of ecosystem services or the costs of their destruction , thereby creating a basis for political and economic action . 
The danger lies in how easily the new paradigm could lead to the financialization of nature . 
Indeed , the process has already begun , with the UN &apos;s REDD program using market and financial incentives to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation . 
Similarly , &quot; habitat banking &quot; enables developers to trade habitat or biodiversity credits - earned through measures to protect , restore , or enhance habitats or species - to compensate for development &apos;s environmental costs . 
And carbon-trading schemes reduce the value of soil and forests to their carbon-storage capacity . 
All of this implies private ownership of ecosystem services . 
But , in many countries , the remaining intact ecosystems are in areas populated by indigenous peoples , making conflict with - and within - the affected communities all but inevitable . 
Local people will demand to know who is to own the services and profit from the associated credits . 
And whoever that is will have to assume responsibility for fulfilling complex accounting and compliance requirements , while mitigating exclusion risks . 
Moreover , the private sector &apos;s willingness to finance , say , forest conservation depends on the various credits &quot; integration into global emissions-trading schemes - a highly unlikely outcome , judging by the state of international climate negotiations . 
As it stands , emissions trading works only as a way to redress the industrialized countries &quot; business-as-usual approach . 
Market-based instruments &quot; growing role in conservation will merely enable businesses to manipulate their environmental obligations , while making it easier for governments to neglect their responsibility to devise effective environmental policy . 
For example , last year , Brazil &apos;s powerful agribusiness lobby managed to push the government to approve a new forest code , which uses market-based instruments to give agricultural producers more leeway on conservation . 
As a result , landowners who clear more vegetation than is legally permitted can now return to compliance by purchasing offset credits through the Rio de Janeiro Green Exchange ( Bolsa Verde ) from those with more than the mandated minimum amount of forest cover . 
Motivated by the new regime , those seeking to provide offset credits staged a land grab in areas where logging is not profitable - a market-based response that was accompanied by human-rights violations . 
Brazil &apos;s experience highlights the dangers of weak environmental policy - namely , that it offers those with money the option of buying their way out , at the expense of more vulnerable citizens , particularly indigenous peoples and poor small-scale farmers . 
The global economic crisis exposed the risks of relying exclusively on markets to regulate economic activity . 
Given that the consequences of a global environmental meltdown would be far more devastating , depending on market-based mechanisms to protect and enhance the natural environment is a recipe for disaster . 
In order to avert such an outcome , people worldwide should reject the conception of nature as a service provider and call on policymakers to work actively to protect and restore habitats and biodiversity . 
Mechanisms for &quot; offsetting &quot; damaging activities must not be allowed to continue to distract from the real imperatives , like preventing deforestation and phasing out fossil fuels . 
To this end , the financialization of nature using derivatives and other financial products must be forbidden . 
After all , while an intact rainforest &apos;s current monetary value cannot match that of the natural and mineral resources that it contains , its importance for human survival exceeds these terms . 
Furthermore , governments should phase out subsidies that damage the climate and biodiversity , such as cash incentives aimed at encouraging the clearing of forestland for &quot; productive &quot; activities like agriculture . 
Doing so would enable countries to meet their objectives for environment protection while saving fiscal resources . 
None of this is to say that market-based mechanisms cannot contribute to environmental protection and restoration . 
They can ( and they have ) , but only if they are part of a more comprehensive framework that accounts for the natural environment &apos;s true - and unquantifiable - value .
