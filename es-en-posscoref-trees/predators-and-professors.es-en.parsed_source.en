Predators and Professors 
WASHINGTON , DC - Are America &apos;s great universities still the stalwart custodians of knowledge , leading forces for technological progress , and providers of opportunity that they once were ? 
Or have they become , in part , unscrupulous accomplices to increasingly rapacious economic elites ? 
Towards the end of Charles Ferguson &apos;s Academy Award-winning documentary Inside Job , he interviews several leading economists regarding their role as paid cheerleaders for the financial sector &apos;s excessive risk-taking and sharp practices in the run-up to the crisis of 2008 . 
Some of these prominent academics received significant sums to promote the interests of large banks and other financial-sector firms . 
As Ferguson documents in the movie and in his recent sobering book , Predator Nation , many such payments are not fully disclosed even today . 
Predation is an entirely appropriate term for these banks &quot; activities . 
Because their failure would traumatize the rest of the economy , they receive unique protections - for example , special credit lines from central banks and relaxed regulations ( measures that have been anticipated or announced in recent days in the United States , the United Kingdom , and Switzerland ) . 
As a result , the people who run these banks are encouraged to assume a lot of risky bets , which include pure gambling-type activities . 
The bankers get the upside when things go well , while the downside risks are largely someone else &apos;s problem . 
This is a nontransparent , dangerous , government-run subsidy scheme , ultimately involving very large transfers from taxpayers to a few top people in the financial sector . 
To protect the scheme &apos;s continued existence , global megabanks contribute large amounts of money to politicians . 
For example , JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently testified to the US Senate Banking Committee about the apparent breakdown of risk management that caused an estimated $ 7 billion trading loss at his firm . 
OpenSecrets.org estimates that JPMorgan Chase , America &apos;s largest bank holding company , spent close to $ 8 million in political contributions in 2011 , and that Dimon and his company donated to most senators on the committee . 
Not surprisingly , the senators &quot; questions were overwhelmingly gentle , and JPMorgan Chase &apos;s broader lobbying strategy appears to be paying off ; &quot; investigations &quot; of irresponsible and system-threatening mismanagement will likely end up as whitewash . 
In support of their political strategy , global megabanks also run a highly sophisticated disinformation / propaganda operation , with the goal of creating at least a veneer of respectability for the subsidies that they receive . 
This is where universities come in . 
At a recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission roundtable , the banking-sector representative sitting next to me cited a paper by a prominent Stanford University finance professor to support his position against a particular regulation . 
The banker neglected to mention that the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , a lobby group , commissioned the paper and donated its $ 50,000 fee to a charity specified by the professor , Darrell Duffie ( who disclosed this donation in his paper ) . 
Why should we take such work seriously - or any more seriously than other paid consulting work , for example , by a law firm or someone else working for the industry ? 
The answer presumably is that Stanford University is very prestigious . 
As an institution , it has done great things . 
And its faculty is one of the best in the world . 
When a professor writes a paper on behalf of an industry group , the industry benefits from - and is , in a sense , renting - the university &apos;s name and reputation . 
Naturally , the banker at the CFTC roundtable stressed &quot; Stanford &quot; when he cited the paper . 
( I &apos;m not criticizing that particular university ; in fact , other Stanford faculty , including Anat Admati , are at the forefront of pushing for sensible reform . ) 
Ferguson believes that this form of academic &quot; consulting &quot; is generally out of control . 
I agree , but reining it in will be difficult as long as the universities and &quot; too big to fail &quot; banks remain so intertwined . 
In this context , I was recently disappointed to read in The Wall Street Journal an interview with Lee Bollinger , President of Columbia University . 
Bollinger is a &quot; class C &quot; director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York - appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal System to represent the public interest . 
In what was apparently his first-ever interview or public statement on banking-reform issues ( or even finance ) , Bollinger &apos;s main point was that Dimon should continue to serve on the board of the New York Fed . 
He used surprisingly nonacademic language - stating that &quot; foolish &quot; people who suggest that Dimon should resign or be replaced have a &quot; false understanding &quot; of how the system really works . 
I am currently petitioning the Board of Governors to remove Dimon from this position . 
Nearly 37,000 people have signed the on-line petition at change.org , and I am optimistic that I will have a meeting soon with senior Washington , DC-based Board staff to discuss the matter . 
Bollinger &apos;s intervention may prove helpful to Dimon ; after all , Columbia University is one of the world &apos;s best-regarded universities . 
On the other hand , it could also prove productive in advancing the public debate about how &quot; too big to fail &quot; bankers sustain their implicit subsidies . 
I have written a detailed rebuttal of Bollinger &apos;s position . 
We need a higher-profile conversation about how to reform the unhealthy relationship between universities and subsidized global financial institutions , such as JPMorgan Chase .
