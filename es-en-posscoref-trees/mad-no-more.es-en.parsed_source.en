MAD No More ? 
MOSCOW - Two years ago this month in Prague , US President Barack Obama put forward his visionary idea of the world free of nuclear weapons . 
A year ago , a new strategic arms treaty between Russia and the US was signed in the same city . 
Now the worldwide wave of support for a full ban on nuclear weapons , or &quot; nuclear zero , &quot; is being transformed into a debate about nuclear deterrence . 
Indeed , the four American strategists who first called for &quot; nuclear zero &quot; - Henry Kissinger , George Shultz , William Perry , and Sam Nunn - have partly backtracked , and are now calling for an end to the doctrine of &quot; mutual assured destruction . &quot; 
Unfortunately , their suggestions for accomplishing this are unclear . 
Their only concrete proposal is asymmetrical cuts of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia and the US . 
But tactical weapons are not a serious threat to anybody . 
Moreover , Russia is not interested in reducing this part of its nuclear arsenal significantly . 
It needs such weapons to compensate psychologically for NATO &apos;s preponderance - a reversal of the Cold War epoch - in conventional forces . 
More importantly , Russia considers these weapons insurance against the possibility of Chinese conventional superiority . 
I firmly doubt the need to dispense with deterrence . 
After all , it worked successfully for decades : the unprecedented geostrategic , military , and ideological confrontation of the Cold War never escalated into open , head-to-head warfare . 
The existence of nuclear weapons also curbed the conventional arms race . 
The most important function of nuclear weapons during the Cold War - though little spoken of at the time - proved to be &quot; self-deterrence . &quot; 
Of course , each side considered itself peaceful , and would not admit that it , too , had to be deterred . 
But the danger that any conflict could escalate into a nuclear confrontation prevented reckless and dangerous behavior on both sides on more than one occasion . 
With communism &apos;s collapse and Russia temporarily disabled , self-deterrence softened , and the US ran off the rails as the global hyperpower . 
It behaved in ways that would have been unthinkable before - for example , its attacks on Yugoslavia , Afghanistan , and Iraq . 
The latter two wars have been politically self-defeating for the US , in addition to costing it trillions of dollars . 
America is no less militarily powerful nowadays than previously , but it does not look so strong to the wider world . 
Nuclear deterrence and &quot; mutually assured destruction &quot; would be pass√© only if we assumed that we - people , countries , and humankind at large - had become so ideal and humane that we no longer needed self-deterrence . 
But , unfortunately , we are not such people , and nuclear weapons have played - and continue to play - a civilizing role in international relations : their use would be so horrible that we tailor our behavior accordingly . 
As a result , we have little fear of World War III nowadays , even though unprecedentedly rapid changes in the global balance of power are creating classic conditions for unleashing it . 
After all , the mere possession of nuclear weapons , even if aimed at each other , does not turn countries into enemies . 
Russian and Chinese strategists assume that part of their countries &quot; nuclear potential may be targeted at the other side . 
But this does not spoil their remarkable bilateral relations ; on the contrary , it improves them . 
Russia , with its formal nuclear superiority , has no serious fears regarding China &apos;s military buildup . 
In this sense , nuclear weapons facilitate normal international relations , just like a good fence helps build good neighborly relations . 
Russia and the US must seek to build relations such as now exist between Russia and China , Russia and France , or the US , France , and the United Kingdom . 
Limited arms reductions might be useful for improving relations . 
But arms-control talks are built upon the concept of the balance of forces , which is a sure recipe for reviving confrontational and militaristic thinking . 
The talks on pan-European missile-defense cooperation might come in handy . 
While missile defense is most likely unnecessary , given the absence of any serious threat , the Obama administration and other American realists - who are aware of the impossibility and uselessness of creating a multi-layered anti-ballistic missile ( ABM ) system - need such talks . 
They must at least pretend that they intend to build it , in order to appease America &apos;s powerful nuclear &quot; isolationists , &quot; who long for the past golden age of US strategic invulnerability . 
Talk about creating regional , cooperative ABM systems might be helpful in preventing the development of long-range missiles by Europe &apos;s neighbors . 
It might also help Russia and the US overcome their old habit of viewing each other as enemies . 
But what is really needed is effective cooperation where it counts the most : containing the increasing instability in the Greater Middle East , ensuring that Afghanistan does not turn into yet another regional cancer , and preventing a chain reaction of nuclear proliferation in the region . 
So far , only the US and Russia - with the assistance , one hopes , of China , India , and EU - can hope to address these problems more or less effectively . 
They can offer security guarantees to responsible countries in the region . 
Sooner or later , peace will have to be imposed upon the Israelis and the Palestinians , who have proven to be incapable of reaching a settlement on their own . 
Similarly , Russia and the US need cooperation , not farcical rivalry , in developing new sea routes and possible energy deposits in the Arctic , and in interacting with China and other Asia-Pacific countries in joint development of the resource potential of Siberia and Russia &apos;s Far East . 
Russia will not be able to develop the region on its own . 
And developing it with China alone could prove to be a dangerous strategy . 
But if the two countries fail to overcome their bad old habits of mutual suspicion , their remaining - quite powerful - nuclear arsenals will continue to serve deterrence and self-deterrence . 
As long as we remain unable to make ourselves think and act in a civilized way , we can - indeed , we must - ensure that we do not become barbaric .
