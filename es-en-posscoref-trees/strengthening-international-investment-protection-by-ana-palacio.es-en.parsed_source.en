How to Boost Foreign Investment 
MADRID - Economic globalization , together with a rebalancing of power between the world &apos;s north and south , has made developing countries , and many companies within them , key global economic actors . 
This provides a new rationale for strengthening the international framework to protect foreign investment . 
Once upon a time , global foreign direct investment flowed from only a few sources : the traditionally wealthy states of Europe , North America , and Japan . 
But cross-border investment from countries such as Brazil , India , and China is now flowing not just to other emerging and transitional economies , but also to the &quot; old &quot; FDI-exporting states . 
These changes have increased the complexity of the international investment regime , and should broaden interest in developing a more effective investment-protection framework . But just the opposite is happening : a progressive weakening of protection , with states increasingly flouting their treaty obligations and skirting or ignoring the outcomes of international dispute-resolution proceedings . 
But , institutionally , the ICSID has developed less successfully than other members of the World Bank Group - particularly the International Finance Corporation - owing to a deeply rooted organizational culture at the Bank that perceives the ICSID as an instrument serving Western companies &quot; efforts to prevail over developing states . 
This internal fissure was a non-issue during the World Bank &apos;s first decades , when the ICSID itself was a non-factor , with only 38 registered cases between 1966 and 1996 . 
This began to change with the rapid proliferation of bilateral investment treaties ( BITs ) , which typically granted private investors standing before the ICSID . 
The ICSID and its jurisprudence thus became a central part of international investment law and policy . 
Yet the World Bank &apos;s attitude toward the ICSID remained ambivalent . 
This was especially evident concerning compliance and enforcement , and matters came to a head with the deluge of cases brought against Argentina stemming from its 2001-2002 economic crisis . 
Faced with a large number of claims , Argentina chose to draw out the process by systematically using annulment proceedings against any unfavorable decision , and linked any payment to domestic judicial review - a procedure that violates the language and intent of the ICSID Convention and the BITs themselves . 
The strategy worked ; 
But Argentina &apos;s short-term gain came at a steep price . 
A perceived lack of enforceability weakens compliance with investment treaties and rewards repeat offenders , such as Argentina , which has appeared in more ICSID cases than any other state . 
Indeed , Argentina has developed a general attitude of impunity , the latest example being the expropriation of energy company YPF from Spain &apos;s Repsol one year ago . 
Moreover , the devaluation of the reputational benefit of being a party to the ICSID encourages countries to leave the system , as Bolivia , Ecuador , and Venezuela have recently done . 
These countries are being denied a useful tool for attracting FDI , with recent evidence suggesting that signing a BIT by itself does not lead to increased inflows . 
For the moment , the only country that has taken real action is the United States , which last year suspended its trade-preference scheme with Argentina , owing to the country &apos;s failure to pay ICSID-adjudicated awards to two US companies . 
As for Europe , the Lisbon Treaty gives the European Union exclusive competence in investment-related matters , but no mechanisms have been implemented to exercise this authority . 
The upcoming start of Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks offer a key opportunity to advance the cause of stronger investment protection . 
As the two largest sources and destinations for foreign investment , accounting for a combined 56 % of global FDI outflows and 42 % of inflows , the US and EU have a particular interest in ensuring a well-functioning international investment regime . An emphasis on investment protection could establish de facto international standards that ensure legal security for investors while providing sufficient scope for governments &quot; legitimate regulatory interests . 
The talks would have an even greater impact if the parties agreed on a unified approach to dealing with states that fail to meet their obligations . 
In thinking of ways to strengthen the ICSID , it would be helpful to consider the World Trade Organization &apos;s dispute settlement mechanism ( DSM ) , which enjoys a remarkably strong compliance record . 
Beyond the obvious availability of countervailing duties as an enforcement tool , several of the DSM &apos;s institutional characteristics , which are absent in the ICSID , help to create and sustain legitimacy . 
For example , the existence of a permanent Appellate Body has led to significantly more consistent and predictable jurisprudence . 
But , most important , the ICSID would greatly benefit from the level of institutional support that the DSM has at the WTO . 
Reinforcing the ICSID is one of the biggest current challenges facing the World Bank and the international community . 
Without FDI , there cannot be development ; and , without legal security , there will be no FDI . 
If we are to see truly global FDI flows , particularly to those countries that need them the most , we must begin to address the institutional deficiencies of the investment-protection regime .
