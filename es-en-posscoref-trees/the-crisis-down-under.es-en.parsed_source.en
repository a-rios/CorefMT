The Crisis Down Under 
CANBERRA - The Great Recession of 2008 reached the farthest corners of the earth . 
Here in Australia , they refer to it as the GFC - the global financial crisis . 
Kevin Rudd , who was prime minister when the crisis struck , put in place one of the best-designed Keynesian stimulus packages of any country in the world . 
He realized that it was important to act early , with money that would be spent quickly , but that there was a risk that the crisis would not be over soon . 
So the first part of the stimulus was cash grants , followed by investments , which would take longer to put into place . 
Rudd &apos;s stimulus worked : Australia had the shortest and shallowest of recessions of the advanced industrial countries . 
Of course , we should strive to ensure that money is spent as productively as possible , but humans , and human institutions , are fallible , and there are costs to ensuring that money is well spent . 
To put it in economics jargon , efficiency requires equating the marginal cost associated with allocation ( both in acquiring information about the relative benefits of different projects and in monitoring investments ) with the marginal benefits . 
In a nutshell : it is wasteful to spend too much money preventing waste . 
While the focus for the moment is on public-sector waste , that waste pales in comparison to the waste of resources resulting from a malfunctioning private financial sector , which in America already amounts to trillions of dollars . 
Likewise , the waste from not fully utilizing society &apos;s resources - the inevitable consequence of not having had such a quick and strong stimulus - exceeds that of the public sector by an order of magnitude . 
For an American , there is a certain amusement in Australian worries about the deficit and debt : their deficit as a percentage of GDP is less than half that of the US ; their gross national debt is less than a third . 
Deficit fetishism never makes sense - the national debt is only one side of a country &apos;s balance sheet . 
Cutting back on high-return investments ( like education , infrastructure , and technology ) just to reduce the deficit is truly foolish , but especially so in the case of a country like Australia , whose debt is so low . 
Indeed , if one is concerned with a country &apos;s long-run debt , as one should be , such deficit fetishism is particularly silly , since the higher growth resulting from these public investments will generate more tax revenues . 
There is another irony : some of the same Australians who have criticized the deficits have also criticized proposals to increase taxes on mines . 
Australia is lucky to have a rich endowment of natural resources , including iron ore . 
These resources are part of the country &apos;s patrimony . 
They belong to all the people . 
Yet in all countries , mining companies try to get these resources for free - or for as little as possible . 
Of course , mining companies need to get a fair return on their investments . 
The increased profits are not a result of their mining prowess , but of China &apos;s huge demand for steel . 
There is no reason that mining companies should reap this reward for themselves . 
They should share the bonanza of higher prices with Australia &apos;s citizens , and an appropriately designed mining tax is one way of ensuring that outcome . 
This money should be set aside in a special fund , to be used for investment . 
The country will inevitably become poorer as it depletes its natural resources , unless the value of its human and physical capital increases . 
Another issue playing out down under is global warming . 
If not a climate-change denier , the previous Australian government led by John Howard joined President George W. Bush in being a climate-change free rider : others would have to take responsibility for ensuring the planet &apos;s survival . 
This was especially strange , given that Australia has been one of the big beneficiaries of the Montreal convention , which banned ozone-destroying gases . 
Holes in the ozone layer exposed Australians to cancer-causing radiation . 
The international community banded together , banned the substances , and the holes are now closing . 
Nevertheless , the Howard government , like the Bush administration , was willing to expose the entire planet to the risks of global warming , which threaten the very existence of many island states . 
Rudd campaigned on a promise to reverse that stance , but the failure of the climate-change talks in Copenhagen last December , when President Barack Obama refused to make the kind of commitment on behalf of the United States that was required , left Rudd &apos;s government in an awkward position . 
The failure of US leadership has global consequences . 
Citizens should consider the legacy they leave to their children , part of which is the financial debts they will pass down . 
It is two-faced to claim to care about the future and then fail to ensure that the country is adequately compensated for the depletion of its resources , or ignore the degradation of the environment . 
It is even worse to leave our children without adequate infrastructure and the other public investments needed to be competitive in the twenty-first century . 
Every country faces these issues . 
Sometimes , one can see them with greater clarity by observing how others are confronting them . 
How Australians vote in their coming election may be a harbinger of things to come . 
Let &apos;s hope - for their sake and for the world &apos;s - that they see through the rhetorical flourishes and personal foibles to the larger issues at stake .
