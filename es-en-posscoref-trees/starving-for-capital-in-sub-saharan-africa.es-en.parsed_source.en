Starving for Capital in Sub-Saharan Africa 
Sub-Saharan Africa &apos;s appalling poverty and living conditions have been exposed repeatedly through television and the Internet . 
But these agonizing pictures represent only the symptoms of an underlying - and largely unreported - malady : capital flight . 
Capital flight stems from myriad causes : debt servicing , the awarding to foreign firms of almost all contracts financed by multilateral lenders ( and exemptions from taxes and duties on these goods and services ) , unfavorable terms of trade , speculation , free transfer of benefits , foreign exchange reserves held in foreign accounts , and domestic private capital funneled abroad . 
According to the UN Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , every dollar that flows into the region generates an outflow of $ 1.06 . 
Most of this hemorrhage is debt-fueled : approximately 80 cents on every dollar that flows into the region from foreign loans flows out again in the same year . 
This implies active complicity between creditors ( the OECD countries and their financial institutions , especially the IMF and the World Bank ) and borrowers ( African governments ) . 
Capital flight provides creditors with the resources they need to finance additional loans to the countries from which these resources originated in the first place - a scheme known as &quot; round-tipping &quot; or &quot; back-to-back &quot; loans . 
Borrowers , in turn , use these foreign loans to increase their accumulation of private assets held abroad , even as strict budget discipline and free capital movement - implemented in line with IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs - have led to skyrocketing interest rates . 
The lethal combination of these factors thwarts any prospect of economic growth while leading to an unsustainable level of debt . 
The pool of fleeing capital includes assets acquired legally at home and legally transferred abroad ; capital acquired legally at home and illegally transferred abroad ; and illegally acquired capital that is funneled abroad illegally . 
Using the latter two types to impose &quot; odious debts &quot; on Africans undermines western lenders &apos; credibility concerning money laundering , good governance , transparency , fiscal discipline , and macroeconomic policies conducive to economic growth . 
Repudiating unwarranted and unjustified debts would be consistent with economic logic and international law . 
Well-functioning credit markets require that lenders face the consequences of irresponsible or politically motivated lending . 
But two obstacles must be overcome . 
First , African leaders , who should repudiate these debts , are the ones who contracted them in the first place , with the obvious aim of enriching themselves . 
Second , creditors may retaliate by withdrawing subsequent lending . 
These obstacles are neither insurmountable nor unique to sub-Saharan Africa . 
Capital flight is most likely to be sparked by uncertainty regarding good governance , political stability , civil liberties , accountability , property rights , and corruption . 
Sound economic policies , sustainable economic growth , and adequate rates of return on investment tend to reverse capital flight . 
According to figures released by the American investment bank Salomon Brothers , the return of flight capital was estimated at around $ 40 billion for Latin America in 1991 , led by Mexico , Venezuela , Brazil , Argentina , and Chile . 
China recovered $ 56 billion between 1989 and 1991 . 
Equally revealing , several Middle East economies are booming . 
The Saudi stock market index is up by 78 % since the start of the year , hugely out-performing the main US and European indices - and this in a region plagued by conflict , nuclear tensions , terrorism , and acute political challenges . 
As for sub-Saharan Africa , the &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; - economic liberalization , deregulation of capital movements , suppression of subsidies , and privatization - runs against the very policies needed to promote political improvements , a stable macroeconomic environment , enlarged financial markets , and lower debt overhang . 
Private firms that have acquired public assets should be induced , through legislation , to recapitalize these companies . 
New shares should be earmarked for residents to encourage the repatriation of private capital . 
Capital controls and fiscal incentives will keep legitimate private capital at home and promote domestic investment . 
These are the essential conditions for launching sustainable economic growth in the region . 
Common sense points to the need for the OECD countries , the IMF , and the World Bank to sever their dubious complicity with sub-Saharan African leaders and support policies that are in the long-term interest of the West and the world . 
Ignoring the negative investment climate would be unwise . 
According to the New York Times , quoting US military personnel , the Sahara Desert is becoming a &quot; new Afghanistan . &quot; 
This threat , together with terrorist attacks in Kenya , Tanzania , Tunisia , and Morocco , has prompted the Bush administration to install military bases in the region . 
But only policies that privilege social justice and economic development can win the fight against terrorism definitively . 
Tony Blair is America &apos;s closest ally in their &quot; war on terror . &quot; 
He also believes that conditions in Africa are &quot; a scar on the conscience of the world , &quot; and has established a Commission for Africa that will report to the G8 . 
But , in addition to the trade distortions that Blair has promised to address , he and other Western leaders should put an end to scandalous &quot; round-tipping &quot; or &quot; back-to-back &quot; loans and return the funds embezzled by African leaders and their Western friends .
