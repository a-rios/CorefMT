Citizens for a Clean Economy 
SAN JOSÉ - Over the past 20 years , environmental , energy , and climate policies have been decided behind closed doors - with little input from the people who will be most affected by the outcome of the negotiations . 
Policy design has been driven by technocratic considerations that ignored or was simply uninterested in ordinary people &apos;s priorities . 
As a result , clean air , renewable energy , and green spaces have all too often been sacrificed to the notion that environmentally friendly legislation increases costs and red tape for businesses and ultimately hurts the economy . 
The good news is that a new pattern of citizen participation is emerging , especially in developing countries , with new voices and fresh ideas entering the debate . 
Around the world , citizens are demanding that their governments listen to them about environmental issues and put their needs and priorities first . 
For years , the debate around environmental action in the United States and Europe was characterized by a focus on abstract principles and by political infighting . 
To some extent , this was understandable . 
But the result was a discussion that was far removed from the issues that are most important to ordinary people . 
Instead of discussing how ineffective public transport and polluted air was making life worse for billions of people , the talk centered on carbon trading , emissions trajectories , and the industrialization of China . 
Fortunately , the discussion is now being brought back down to earth . 
In less than 35 years , some 66 % of the global population will live in cities . 
Much of this urban growth will occur in developing countries , especially in Africa . 
In Latin America , nearly 80 % of people already live in urban centers . 
For city dwellers , the environment can be an existential priority . 
If droughts continue to threaten the water supply of São Paolo , for example , Latin America &apos;s most populous city could be at risk of urban failure . 
This crisis - and others like it - provides an opportunity for citizens to take control and deploy innovative solutions that might inspire others . 
When national and municipal governments ask people about their priorities and needs , the answer is clear . 
Chile &apos;s government set a precedent in the region by meticulously mapping citizens &quot; priorities on the environment and climate . 
According to the government &apos;s poll , air pollution is Chileans &quot; top environmental priority ( 33 % ) , followed by waste ( 21 % ) and noise ( 11 % ) . 
Costa Ricans also see air pollution as an environmental priority ( 22 % ) , followed by waste ( 20 % ) and water ( 17 % ) , according to a poll conducted by the United Nations Development Programme . 
In China , environmental protection is increasingly becoming a top public concern , as evidenced by a journalist &apos;s recent self-financed film about air pollution , which attracted 200 million viewers in a single week . 
In today &apos;s world , people expect more from their countries and cities than growth and shopping centers . 
An IDB poll of 5,000 citizens in Bogotá , Buenos Aires , Lima , Mexico City , and São Paulo revealed that they want more transparency in city government , more participation in decision-making , and a better quality of life . 
This poll , along with those from Chile and Costa Rica , shows that citizens understand that climate change will affect them . 
As we develop a better understanding of ordinary people &apos;s needs and priorities , those negotiating a global agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year would be wise to take note . 
Opaque decisions and unexplained priorities are unlikely to receive public support . 
For that reason alone , it is crucial that governments make their citizens &quot; concerns the top priority . 
Chile has set a positive precedent in the developing world by carrying out extensive consultations on its national climate commitment for Paris . 
Mexico and Brazil have launched formal consultation processes , too . 
Other countries in the region might follow suit . 
National and local politicians are being held to increasingly higher standards of environmental protection . 
A new era of citizen involvement and public scrutiny has begun , creating opportunities for truly inclusive environmental action that promise to achieve more than elites negotiating behind closed doors ever could .
