Turkey &apos;s Nation of Faiths 
ANKARA - After decades of official neglect and mistrust , Turkey has taken several steps to ensure the rights of the country &apos;s non-Muslim religious minorities , and thus to guarantee that the rule of law is applied equally for all Turkish citizens , regardless of individuals &quot; religion , ethnicity , or language . 
Turkey &apos;s religious minorities include Greek Orthodox , Armenian , Assyrian , Kaldani , and other Christian denominations , as well as Jews , all of whom are integral parts of Turkish society . 
As part of the Turkish government &apos;s new initiative to end any sort of discrimination against these non-Muslim communities , President Abdullah Gül has emphasized that message by receiving Bartholemew , the Greek-Orthodox Patriarch of Istanbul , and by visiting a church and a synagogue in Hatay - a first by a Turkish president . 
In August 2009 , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with leaders of religious minorities on Büyükada , the largest of the Prince Islands in the Sea of Marmara , and listened to their problems and concerns , a clear signal of his government &apos;s intent to buttress their sense of civil inclusion . 
As Deputy Prime Minister , I met with representatives of religious minorities in March 2010 , and visited the Armenian and Greek Orthodox Patriarchies in 2010 and 2011 . 
Likewise , Turkey &apos;s minister for European Union affairs , Egemen Bağış , has met with these communities &quot; leaders on several occasions . 
Beyond establishing warm relations between the Turkish government and the country &apos;s religious minorities , official policy has been changing as well . 
In May 2010 , Prime Minister Erdoğan issued an official statement that warned public servants and citizens against any discrimination against religious minorities , and that emphasized the absolute equality of Turkey &apos;s non-Muslim citizens . 
But the groundwork for the initiative of recent years was laid long before . 
In August 2003 , the Erdoğan-led government introduced legal changes to resolve property-rights issues related to religious minority associations . 
For the first time in the Republic &apos;s history , 365 landholdings and buildings belonging to the minority communities were legally registered under their name . 
In 2008 , the government , despite fierce opposition from other political parties , changed the Law of Associations and allowed religious-minority associations to purchase real estate ( and to receive contributions , regardless of size , from abroad ) . 
Then , in August 2011 , an important amendment to the Associations law mandated the return of more than 350 properties to religious minorities . 
As part of these changes , the Greek-Orthodox Girls School in Beyoğlu , Istanbul , and the Jewish Community Center in Izmir have been granted legal status , ending a century-old dispute . 
Even before that , in November 2010 , the Greek-Orthodox Orphanage on Halki Island was returned to the Greek-Orthodox Patriarchy . 
In order to facilitate their religious duties , the Orthodox metropolitans were granted Turkish citizenship . 
Furthermore , the Associations Council , the country &apos;s highest authority on religious associations , now includes for the first time a non-Muslim member representing minority faiths . 
Moreover , the Directorate-General of Associations has been charged with the task of renovating houses of worship used by religious minorities , including the historic Aya Nikola Church in Gökçeada Çanakkale , and the Assyrian Catholic Church and Greek Catholic Church in Iskenderun . 
A number of other churches and synagogues are also under renovation . 
The authorities have taken many other historically and symbolically important steps as well . 
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism has renovated the Panagia Sümela Monastery , a 1,600-year-old church in Trabzon on the Black Sea coast . 
The first mass in decades was held in August 2010 , led by Bartholomew and attended by hundreds of worshippers from Greece , Russia , Georgia , Europe , the United States , and Turkey . 
Another milestone was the renovation and opening of the 1,100-year old Armenian Aghtamar Church in March 2007 . 
The first mass in 95 years was held in the church , led by the Armenian Archbishop Aram Ateşyan and attended by thousands of worshippers . 
These measures have been taken to address the long-standing problems of Turkey &apos;s non-Muslim religious minorities . 
Turkish Muslims have lived with Jewish and Christian communities for centuries and treated them with respect and compassion . 
We are determined to solve their remaining problems , and we believe that we can do so through mutual trust and cooperation . 
Turkey &apos;s Jews and Christians are full citizens with equal rights , and we will work to ensure that this reality is recognized in all areas of the country &apos;s life .
