Did US Drone Strikes Lose Yemen ? 
NEW YORK - Recent revelations that the US killed an innocent American in a drone strike in Pakistan confirm what a new study , &quot; Death by Drone , &quot; of civilian harm caused by US drone strikes in Yemen shows - that claims about the precision of drone strikes are overstated . 
The revelations also underscore the stark asymmetry between how the US treats drone strikes that kill its own citizens and those that kill others . 
In Yemen , the US has been conducting drone strikes since at least 2002 , with estimates of the total number of strikes ranging from 91 to 203 . 
While the American and Yemeni governments have lauded the drones &quot; precise targeting , they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes , including how many have been conducted , who has been targeted , or , crucially , the number and identities of civilians killed . 
In a May 2013 speech at the National Defense University , Obama offered assurances that , outside the Afghan war theater , no drone strike would be carried out unless there was &quot; near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured . &quot; 
Obama also claimed that the US targets only &quot; terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people , &quot; and that it does not launch drone strikes when it has &quot; the ability to capture individual terrorists . &quot; 
&quot; Death by Drone , &quot; which includes first-hand testimony from eyewitnesses and survivors of drone strikes in Yemen , tells a different story . 
The nine case studies documented in the report , four of which cover attacks that came after the 2013 speech , provide credible evidence that US drone strikes have killed and injured Yemeni civilians , suggesting that the &quot; near-certainty &quot; standard is not being effectively implemented . 
The report also casts doubt on Obama &apos;s other claims , with evidence indicating that targets of drone strikes , though perhaps posing a threat to Yemen , may not have posed a direct threat to the US , and that their capture may have been possible . 
In other words , Yemeni civilians have suffered and died from drone strikes that may not have been necessary . 
More generally , the report provides a window into the experiences of Yemeni civilians directly affected by US drone strikes . 
The testimonies of these individuals , vital for assessing the US drone program , are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence , and because the strikes are conducted in secret , far away from the US . 
As Yaslem Saeed bin Ishaq , whose son was killed in a US drone strike in Wadi Sir on August 1 , 2013 , observed , &quot; They just kill . 
They do not know what havoc their missiles have caused . 
They are unaware of the suffering they create for our families . &quot; 
Indeed , if the US never acknowledges the specific strikes , how can ordinary Americans possibly know that Rasilah al-Faqih , a pregnant Yemeni woman , was killed in Walad Rabei , &quot; along with her husband and ten-year-old daughter , as they headed home from a visit to the doctor ? 
Or that Abdoh Mohammed al-Jarraah &apos;s house in Silat al-Jarraah had 19 people , including women and children , inside when it was hit by a US drone strike ? 
The US &quot; refusal to acknowledge drone strikes that kill foreigners is sending a damaging message in Yemen and beyond . 
As Moqbel Abdullah Ali al-Jarraah , a villager from Silat al-Jarraah , put it : &quot; I believe that America is testing its lethal inventions in our poor villages , because &#91; it &#93; cannot afford to do so at any place where human life has value . 
Here , we are without value . &quot; 
In every incident recorded in this report , the families of Yemeni civilians killed in US strikes want to know why they were targeted . As the father of Nasser Mohammed Nasser , one of four innocent civilians killed in a US drone strike on April 19 , 2014 , lamented : &quot; My son and those who were with him had nothing to do with Al Qaeda . It has not even acknowledged that it killed his son . 
Later that month , he recognized that the US government &quot; should make public the overall numbers of civilian deaths resulting from US strikes targeting Al Qaeda . &quot; 
The US has done neither . 
It should come as no surprise , then , that civilians like Nasser , who have lost mothers , fathers , sons , and daughters in US strikes , are outraged not only at the US , but also at the Yemeni government , which consented to the attacks . 
They believe that instead of making Yemen and the US safer , drone strikes only strengthen support for Al Qaeda . 
Earlier this year , the US announced a new policy for drone exports , purportedly part of a broader effort to work with other countries to &quot; shape international standards &quot; on the use of drones and compel recipient states &quot; to use these systems in accordance with international law . &quot; 
But , as &quot; Death by Drone &quot; shows , the US drone program is fundamentally flawed and should not be perpetuated . 
The Obama administration &apos;s recent admissions that its drone strikes killed its own citizens only underscore this fact .
