The Two Faces of Globalization 
Why do popular and elite perceptions of globalization clash ? 
People in the rich world think globalization resembles an implacably malignant force that snatches away well paying jobs and sends them to faraway places ; people in developing countries think it ushers in a self-obsessed consumerist ethic on a train of corrupt privatization and environmental destruction . 
Elites dismiss their opponents as empty-headed populists , and are accused , in turn , of being out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people . 
Globalization has always been inherently Janus-like , showing to some the face of limitless progress and wealth , while others see only a soulless giant hurling their lives to and fro . 
Consider the previous wave of globalization : the period between the mid-19 th century and the outbreak of the First World War . 
Transportation costs plummeted with the advent of the steamship and the railroad . 
New telecommunications permitted information to be sent instantly around the world . 
Capital flowed to remote places like Argentina , Russia , Malaya , and South Africa . 
A Londoner , as Keynes put it , could send his servant to fetch any amount of foreign currency , and he could invest his sterling wherever he wished . 
But this was also the heyday of imperialism , colonialism , violent conquest , and slavery . 
Several million people are believed to have died in Congo alone under King Leopold &apos;s misrule - perhaps the worst imperial crime , but hardly unique . 
The slave trade continued until the 1850 &apos;s in most of the world , and in some places almost until the end of the 19 th century . 
Imperial diplomacy had little use for subtlety . 
A disobedient Sultan or tribal chief would be made to comprehend the error of his ways with a few gun ships moored offshore . 
Western powers often claimed extraterritorial rights . 
Western boats plied China &apos;s internal waterways . 
England , France , Holland , and other imperial powers controlled trade and resources throughout Southeast Asia . 
They used the constant threat and routine application of force and violence to impose slavery , low inward tariffs , and immunity for their colonists . 
Economists tend not to dwell on this too much . 
Indeed , a recent article on 19 th -century globalization by two well-known economic historians , Jeff Williamson and Peter Lindert , never uses the words imperialism , colonialism , or slavery . 
It is not that all economists are insensitive and dislike developing countries . 
The problem is that mainstream economics assumes that transactions are voluntary . 
The tools and methods of the discipline are not adequate to deal systematically with coercion as a way of acquiring and maximizing wealth . 
Gunboat diplomacy is officially pass√© , as are foreign administrators , extraterritoriality , colonial economic diktats , and slavery . 
But are today &apos;s bombings and UN sanctions 
For most ordinary people in places deemed unsuitable for self-government ( Bosnia , Kosovo , Afghanistan , Cambodia , soon Iraq ) , foreign administrators seem none too different from the rulers of the British Raj . 
They enjoy autonomy , full immunity , and , in the view of the governed , obscenely high salaries . 
The UN &apos;s intentions may be nobler , but 19 th -century European administrators also believed that they were bettering the lot of indigenous populations , making them &quot; fit &quot; for self-rule . 
Multilateral financial institutions influence much of macroeconomic policy in many countries . 
Poor countries have barely any voice in these institutions , because voting rights are apportioned according to countries &apos; wealth - not unlike the bygone practice of conditioning the franchise on property ownership . 
Slavery , too , is back , in the form of global trafficking in indentured women and unskilled workers from Eastern Europe , Africa , and Asia . 
Of course , abject poverty , poor sanitation , dangerous workplaces , and child labor existed long before the current wave of globalization . 
They may even have been more widespread . 
But as targets of popular wrath go , globalization is as logical a choice now as it was in the age of imperialism . 
For many people , including most economists , globalization implies greater opportunities , expanded trade , faster travel , better connectivity , and higher incomes . 
True , everyone may not benefit in the short term , but what critics regard as injustice is necessary , hence unavoidable . 
A coffee picker in Guatemala may get only a tiny share of what Starbucks charges for a cappuccino , but without Starbucks , he would have to look elsewhere for a job . 
But just as in the age of imperialism , the current wave of globalization is breeding its own resistance . 
Globalization , after all , forces people to recognize how similar they are in the most fundamental respects , and yet how vast are their differences in status , influence , and wealth . 
The rich tend to discount their wealth and power , because it seems deserved and natural . 
But for the poor , global disparities in wellbeing , seen against the background of human similarity , fuel anger and opposition . 
Economists and pundits can preach for all eternity about the many ways that multinational companies make coffee pickers in Guatemala happier . 
And yet , at the end of the day , it is the coffee picker &apos;s judgment that matters . 
Little wonder , then , that globalization continues to call forth old-fashioned non-economic concepts like dignity , justice , fair prices , and decent wages .
