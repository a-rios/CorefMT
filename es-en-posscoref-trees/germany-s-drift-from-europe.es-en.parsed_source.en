Germany &apos;s Drift from Europe 
BERLIN - &quot; What &apos;s the matter with Germany ? , &quot; people on both sides of the Atlantic are asking with increasing frequency . 
In Berlin , however , nobody seems to understand the question . 
Doubts about Germany &apos;s role have much to do with the current economic and financial crisis , and also with the weakness of the European Union and its institutions . 
Ever since the referendum failures of both the European constitution and the Lisbon treaty , the EU has been flying on autopilot , run by its bureaucrats . 
With 27 members and no reform of its institutions and procedures , EU processes have become harrowingly inefficient . 
Crises are also always moments of truth , because they relentlessly expose both the strengths and weaknesses of all the players involved . For that reason , Europe now requires leadership not from a weak EU Commission or from any other European institutions , but from the capitals of its major member countries . 
As always , when serious economic and financial matters are at stake , people look to Germany , the EU &apos;s largest economy . 
But what they see confounds them , because Germany is openly refusing to lead . 
But its economy is nonetheless stronger than ever after the challenges of reunification and the necessary reform of the country &apos;s labor market and welfare systems . 
What amazes our neighbors and partners - and increasingly causes distrust - is that ever since the beginning of the global meltdown last September , the German government has focused almost exclusively on national crisis management , rebuffing any and all attempts at a European approach . 
Add to this the palpable tensions in Franco-German relations , the blocking of a common EU gas market , close strategic cooperation with Vladimir Putin &apos;s Russia , etc . , and the worries about Germany multiply . 
It &apos;s not just that there is fear in Berlin that any European solution would be much more expensive for Germany and take a lot longer ; this new form of German euroskepticism also shows a fundamental change of attitude amongst the overwhelming majority of Germany &apos;s political and economic elite . 
The change is evident by asking a single question : would it still be possible today to give up the D-Mark and introduce the euro as a common currency ? 
The answer is a resounding no . 
Regardless of whether it &apos;s Chancellor Angela Merkel or Foreign Minister Frank Steinmeier , this answer reverberates across the political spectrum , and it is held irrespective of which parties or people form the government . 
Following the changing of the guard after the end of Germany &apos;s red / green coalition , a fundamental shift in attitude has gradually taken place . 
Europe today is no longer seen as the key project in German politics in which people are willing to invest an essential part of their political capital - and thus of their own future . 
Rather , 20 years after the fall of the Berlin wall , the reunited Germany is beginning to realize that it can also act alone . 
The problem , of course , is that this is a huge misapprehension . 
Germany &apos;s relationship with Europe is seen as a functional one by nearly all the democratic parties . 
The German perspective is thus shifting in the direction of that of France and the United Kingdom : the EU is increasingly seen as a framework and precondition for asserting national interests , rather than as an aim in itself . 
The reasons for this profound change are obvious : the reunification and the historical resolution of the hitherto open &quot; German question &quot; ; the failure of the EU constitution and thus of the European vision ; the institutional weakness of an expanded 27-member EU ; and the increasing inefficiency and slowness of EU institutions . 
So will Germany revert to nationalism ? 
All political players in Berlin reject this charge with great indignation . 
Indeed , there is no strategy or master plan whatsoever for a return to nationalism . 
The fundamental change in Germany &apos;s European policy is simply happening - the result of a process that could almost be termed &quot; organic . &quot; 
As such , this does not makes the drift in German policy - which manifests itself , for example , in a refusal to lead in the present crisis - any better . 
It is a strategic illusion of the large member states that they can defend their own status without this stolid entity called Europe . 
After all , can Germany really afford to let the EU &apos;s enlargement into Eastern Europe fail ? 
Can it afford a life-threatening crisis of the euro , a common market endangered by growing protectionism , or Russia pushing into the EU &apos;s Eastern neighborhood ? 
Can it really conduct an independent national policy in the Middle East and Africa , or play an effective role in resolving global issues , from addressing climate change to building a new financial order ? 
To ask these questions - and many more - is to answer them : only a strong , substantially more integrated EU can manage all this .
