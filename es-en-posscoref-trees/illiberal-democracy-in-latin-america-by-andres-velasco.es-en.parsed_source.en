Illiberal Democracy in Latin America 
SANTIAGO - In an influential 1997 essay , Fareed Zakaria coined the term &quot; illiberal democracy &quot; to describe those countries that hold elections ( of varying fairness ) to choose their leaders , yet restrict civil liberties and political freedom . 
At the time , such practices were common mostly in Asia and Africa , with a sizeable concentration of illiberal democracies among the ex-Soviet states . 
Zakaria described illiberal democracy as a &quot; growth industry , &quot; and he was right : in the past 15 years , it has come with full force to Latin America . 
This might seem surprising , because most countries south of the Río Bravo ( known to North Americans as the Rio Grande ) moved from right-wing dictatorship to democracy in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s . 
Some of these democracies were initially imperfect , to be sure , but optimists hoped that it was only a matter of time until all elections would be fair and restrictions on civil liberties fully lifted . 
That was not to be . 
On the contrary , the quality of democracy has deteriorated sharply in several countries in the region . 
Venezuela &apos;s late president , Hugo Chávez , was the chief exponent of this trend . 
According to the democracy watchdog Freedom House , in the 2012 election , &quot; the opposition candidate , Henrique Capriles , was able to hold rallies and engage in traditional forms of campaigning . &quot; 
But &quot; Chávez benefited from massive use of state resources that enabled him to dominate media time by a margin of 25-to-1 , distribute household goods to constituents , and convince many voters that the state could punish them for casting a ballot for the opposition . &quot; 
Much the same - along with accusations of widespread vote-counting irregularities - could be said about the recent election held after Chávez died , which installed his handpicked successor , Nicolás Maduro . 
Press freedom is also on the decline . 
In another report , Freedom House notes that the number of Latin American countries classified as &quot; not free &quot; when it comes to the media has risen to its highest level since 1989 . 
The report highlights deterioration in Paraguay ( where a &quot; parliamentary coup &quot; removed an elected president ) and Ecuador , where President Rafael Correa &apos;s government withdrew &quot; official advertising from privately-owned media that are critical of the government &quot; and &quot; placed limitations on media coverage of electoral campaigns . &quot; 
He has also engaged in &quot; legal and regulatory harassment , and physical intimidation of journalists . &quot; 
Argentina is another country where journalists are on the defensive . 
A 2009 law that aimed to diversify media ownership has been used to put pressure on media outlets that are critical of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner . 
Fernández &apos;s supporters in Congress recently attempted to limit the judiciary &apos;s independence and pack the upper echelons of the court system , but the country &apos;s Supreme Court struck down their law as unconstitutional . 
Illiberal democratic policies and practices are present almost everywhere in Latin America : a distortive electoral system in Chile , persistent violence in Mexico and Colombia , and endemic corruption among lawmakers in Brazil all limit citizens &quot; ability to express their views effectively and shape policy . 
But the left-wing populists influenced by Chávez - who ruled Venezuela for 14 years - have perfected a particularly illiberal practice : bending constitutional rules to allow themselves to be reelected again and again . 
In Bolivia , President Evo Morales &apos;s new 2009 constitution banned reelection to a third consecutive term , but now the Constitutional Court has allowed him to run , arguing that the Bolivian state has been &quot; refounded . &quot; 
Morales &apos;s previous terms , according to this reasoning , occurred in a different state and thus do not count toward current term limits . 
In Ecuador , Correa used the same trick right from the start : his 2008 constitution explicitly stated that the time Correa had served as President under the previous constitution did not bar him from seeking reelection , enabling him to remain in office until 2017 . 
Similarly , in Nicaragua - like Ecuador , also in Venezuela &apos;s sphere of influence - the Supreme Court decided that President Daniel Ortega can run again , even though many legal scholars believe otherwise . 
In Argentina , Fernández and her late husband Néstor Kirchner have held power for 12 years combined , and it remains unclear whether she will attempt to amend the constitution in order to seek yet another term in 2015 . 
The phenomenon of quasi-constitutional reelection has become so widespread in Latin America that Georgetown University professor Héctor Schamis has dubbed it &quot; the new authoritarianism &quot; in the region . 
Other elected leaders in Latin America have been curiously tolerant of these anti-democratic practices . 
Speeches at regional summits can go on for hours , but hardly a word is uttered about democracy &apos;s decay . 
Capriles , who claims that victory in the post-Chávez election was stolen from him , was recently in Chile , but President Sebastián Piñera agreed to meet with him only at a private dinner , not at an official meeting in La Moneda Palace . 
Former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet , the front-runner in the country &apos;s upcoming presidential election in November , did not meet with Capriles at all , citing &quot; agenda problems . &quot; 
Augusto Pinochet , Chile &apos;s former dictator , ruled for 16 years in the name of &quot; authoritarian democracy , &quot; and then attempted to leave behind what he called a &quot; protected democracy . &quot; 
Today &apos;s would-be strongmen speak of &quot; popular &quot; or &quot; Bolivarian &quot; democracy . 
Times have changed , but one thing remains the same : true democracy needs no qualifiers .
