Latin America \ u0027s Resilient Housing Market 
New York - As the consequences of the sub-prime mortgage meltdown in the United States spread through global markets , will one of the most positive trends in Latin America - the expansion of local credit markets , which has dramatically expanded access to homeownership throughout the region -be jeopardized ? 
Big multinational banks and mortgage lenders have moved into markets across Latin America , providing financial services that allow lenders to better manage risk . 
Banks are creatively tapping into migrant worker remittances , multiple-family households , and other previously overlooked sources of potential income and creditworthiness . 
Similarly , the spread of microfinance lending has made capital available to borrowers who until recently were not seen as creditworthy . 
So far , the sub-prime crisis has had a limited direct impact on Latin America &apos;s mortgage markets . 
In Mexico , the market for new low-and middle-income housing has grown rapidly , thanks to the creation of a market for residential mortgage securities in 2003 . 
In the last quarter of 2007 alone , Mexican issuers sold $ 1.5 billion in new mortgage-backed securities - a significant portion of $ 4.4 billion outstanding - with only a slight drop in prices to reflect globally induced risk , according to the publication Asset Securitization Report . 
Chilean markets also have stayed relatively calm . 
These markets have been insulated in part because most investment in real estate-backed securities has come from local investors who often need to invest in local-currency markets . 
Most important , Latin America &apos;s mortgage markets and homeowners are very different from those in the US . 
&quot; It &apos;s natural that the state of global markets will have some kind of ripple effect , &quot; says Greg Kabance , managing director for Latin American structured finance at Fitch Ratings , the international credit ratings agency . 
&quot; But Latin American countries , from a credit standpoint , are a lot better off than they have ever been to withstand turbulence and weather global market problems . &quot; 
To their benefit , Latin American governments have applied the lessons of the past . 
Mexico &apos;s &quot; tequila crisis &quot; of 1994-1995 forced many homeowners into default when the peso fell by 70 % and interest rates soared . 
In Mexico , all mortgages carry fixed interest rates , unlike the infamous &quot; exploding ARMs &quot; that left US homeowners ruing their choice of adjustable-rate mortgages when interest rates rose . 
Mexican mortgages are indexed to inflation , but the state mortgage agency links that index to the minimum wage and makes up the difference if mortgage interest adjustments for inflation outpace wage growth . 
This protects both borrowers and lenders . 
Thus , although delinquency rates have risen slightly in Mexico since the mortgage market was created in 2003 , only about 5 % of mortgages are between 31 and 60 days late . 
Only 2 % are between 61 and 90 days late . 
In the US , by contrast , 21 % of adjustable-rate sub-prime mortgages are 90 days late or in foreclosure . 
Standard 
Poor &apos;s analyst Juan Pablo de Mollein points out that Mexico does not have a liquid secondary market where mortgage securities can be traded to buyers who are far removed from the original issuer . 
That tends to make buyers more cautious . 
The silver lining of past financial crises in Latin America is that most individuals carry far less debt than do Americans . 
In Mexico , for example , mortgage debt represents less than 10 % of GDP , compared to about 50 % of GDP in Europe and 82 % of GDP in the US - a ratio that has increased more than fourfold in the last two decades . 
Latin America &apos;s low personal debt levels have created an opportunity to build a constructive culture of borrowing while expanding economic opportunity . 
There is no doubt that the expansion of access to financial services has enormous positive potential , when handled responsibly . 
In his 2000 book The Mystery of Capital , Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argued that access to credit is a powerful under-used force for development . 
He emphasized the crucial role of housing in allowing low-income individuals to raise capital that can be used for investment in small businesses , in education , or in other projects that can significantly improve standards of living over the medium to long term . 
But as the array of financial services available in Latin America expands , the danger of misuse rises . 
There is a clear lesson to be learned from the US , where easy credit created complacency on the part of authorities , opportunity for charlatans , and tragedy for those who lost or will lose their homes . 
Americans homeowners came to treat their houses as cash machines from which they withdrew equity lines of credit for consumption instead of investment . 
The dramatic run-up of home prices made it too easy to count on real estate values to continue to rise . 
Latin Americans have long regarded real estate as a long-term asset and as protection against inflation . 
With much lower inflation over the past two decades , other investment opportunities were better options , which helped to keep real estate values in check . 
At the same time , expanded access to credit has supported a building boom to meet vast untapped demand . 
Mexico alone is estimated to have a housing deficit of six million units . 
As the US and Europe lower interest rates to try to revive their economies and calm financial markets , the most significant impact of the sub-prime mortgage crisis for Latin America may turn out to be inflation . 
Ironically , then , the expanded access to mortgage lending that creates new homeowners in Latin America may end up protecting the region from the disaster that too-loose credit created in the US .
