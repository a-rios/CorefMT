A Nation Kidnapped 
The editorial published in the Colombian newspaper Diario del Sur on July 6 ( &quot; A Slap in the Face of Violence &quot; ) was ecstatic : &quot; Never before , in spite of the violence that has oppressed us during so many years , has Colombia lived a day like yesterday : historic and unforgettable in every aspect . &quot; 
At noon on July 5 , Colombians throughout the country poured into the streets to show their outrage at the news that 11 provincial politicians had been killed while being held by leftist rebels . 
A human chain was formed , with participants wearing white tops . 
My colleagues in the capital , Bogot√° , and in the south of the country , where we have humanitarian projects , say that everyone was waving white scarves . 
White balloons were launched everywhere . 
Press agencies estimate that , with more than one million participants , this was the largest public protest since October 1999 , which was also - sadly - a demonstration against violence and kidnappings . 
But , while the killing of the 11 congressmen from Cali region - attributed to &quot; crossfire &quot; &quot; during an attack by an &quot; unidentified military group &quot; the leftist rebels - provoked shock and anger , there was no agreement on how to solve the chronic problem of &quot; El Secuestro &quot; ( The Kidnapping ) . 
Some Colombians demand a &quot; humanitarian accord &quot; - an exchange of prisoners for hostages - and reject &quot; blood and fire &quot; rescue attempts . 
Others oppose &quot; ceding the territory &quot; ( setting up a demilitarized zone , where any such exchange could take place ) and demand of the government &quot; firmeza , siempre firmeza ! &quot; ( to be &quot; firm &quot; and go after the rebels ) . 
As is often the case in armed conflicts , civilians suffer the most . 
The July 5 protest reminded us of the 3,000 kidnappings since the start of this four-decade conflict , but Colombians could form human chains and release white balloons for many other reasons . 
Consider , for example , Colombia &apos;s grim ranking as global leader in the number of victims injured by landmines . 
According to &quot; Landmine Monitor 2006 , &quot; Colombia had 1,110 victims last year , followed by Cambodia with 875 and Afghanistan with 848 . 
This unnoticed drama is emblematic of the under-reported Colombian conflict . 
Indeed , if there were such a thing as a combined index of despair , Colombia would be an undisputed leader . 
Hostage-taking , and killing and maiming by landmines , are but the side effects of the oldest and longest-running civil war in Latin America , which has resulted in three million internally displaced persons - one of the world &apos;s highest levels , close to that of Sudan , Congo , and Iraq . 
Even if there were , by some miracle , a negotiated end to the fighting , the scars left by this conflict will remain . 
So , besides helping the country find a political solution , there is also a need to focus on long-term reconstruction and reconciliation , so that young lives distorted by the civil war can be righted and children can be rescued from the harmful influence of so much violence and bloodshed . 
In Colombia &apos;s south - where the heavy presence of illegal armed groups makes social peace a distant dream - I went to visit a secondary school , as part of a needs assessment . 
After four hours on a dirt road , I reached a highlands hamlet . 
The smart and friendly teenagers were eager to learn how to surf the Internet , just installed in their school . 
But when I asked five of them what they would like to become , I understood that this conflict has marked them forever . 
Their dream careers were : lawyer , criminal investigator , forensic physician , and soldier . 
The fifth one wanted to become a chemist , so that he could set up a cocaine laboratory . 
The teenagers &quot; plans simply reflect a sad reality : these pupils are the second generation that has not known anything but war . 
On the day of the march against violence , next to the editorial in 
It is perhaps a beginning .
