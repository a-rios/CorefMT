Containing Russia 
Sofia  -  The post-Cold War order in Europe is finished , with Vladimir Putin its executioner . Russia &apos;s withdrawal from the Treaty of Conventional Forces , its deliberate efforts to block the election monitoring of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) , and the Kremlin &apos;s refusal to ratify the reform of the European Court on Human Rights ( Protocol No 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights ) , all marked its passing . 
Today , Russia and the EU have sharply opposing views on the nature of the post-Cold War European order and on the sources of instability in Eurasia . 
For the EU to continue its Russia policies of the 1990 &quot; s in this new context would merely reintroduce sphere-of-influence politics rather than expand the borders of democracy . 
But breaking with the policies of the 1990 &quot; s also presents risks because the EU is not , and cannot be , a traditional great power . 
Any re-thinking of EU policy towards Russia should recognize that Russia will remain a global player during the next decade but that it is unlikely that Russia will become a liberal democracy . 
The EU should also recognize that Russia has legitimate concerns about the asymmetrical impact of the Cold War &apos;s end on its security . 
Russia felt betrayed in its expectations that the end of the Cold War would mean the demilitarization of Central and Eastern Europe . 
While NATO enlargement did not bring any real security threats toward Russia , it changed the military balance between Russia and the West , fueling the Kremlin &apos;s revisionism . 
The post-modern European order emerged out of the ruins of such Cold War institutions as the OSCE and the Treaty of Conventional Weapons . 
It was shaped by the EU &apos;s eastern enlargement and the understanding that enlargement reflected the reunification of Europe . 
If you behave like us , the EU said in essence , you will become one of us . 
The EU , which emphasizes human rights and openness , threatens the Kremlin &apos;s sovereign democracy project . 
In Moscow , the EU &apos;s policy of democracy promotion awakens the nightmare of ethnic and religious politics and the threat of the territorial disintegration of the Russian Federation . Faced with an invasion of Russian state-minded companies , EU member states are tempted to ring-fence certain sectors of their economies ( such as domestic energy markets ) , threatening the liberal economic order that is at the centre of the European project . 
Russia , on the other hand , feels threatened by the invasion of western-funded non-governmental organizations . 
The Kremlin is tempted to recreate a police state in order to prevent foreign interference in its domestic politics . 
It rejects all of Russia &apos;s attempts for a renegotiation of the Treaty on Conventional Weapons , as well as the mandate and the agenda of the OSCE . 
The conventional wisdom is that the result of such renegotiations would involve a retreat from the achievements of the 1990 &quot; s . 
But how correct is this judgment ? 
The EU cannot act as guardian of the post-Cold War status quo without risking a collapse of Europe &apos;s current institutional infrastructure . 
In reality , it is in the Union &apos;s interest to take the initiative and to engage Russia in a dialogue over the institutional foundations of what has become a shaken European order . 
The EU &apos;s main objective should be to preserve the distinctive character of this order - ie , the centrality of human rights and the rule of law . 
The EU &apos;s main objective in institutional terms , regarding its relations with Russia , should be to ground the institutions of the new European order around the EU as a principal policy actor and not on the individual member states . 
The dueling nature of Russia &apos;s regime - capitalist and non-democratic , European and anti-EU - demands such a strategy . 
The EU should make use of the ambiguity at the heart of Russia &apos;s sovereign democracy . 
It should use the fact that the legitimacy of Russia &apos;s current regime inside the country is based , to a large extent , on the perception that it is a regime that strives to bring Russia back into European civilization . 
It is true that Russia does not dream of being part of the EU , but Russia &apos;s stability depends on preserving the European nature of its regime . 
And it is not by accident that - unlike his central Asian fellow-presidents - Vladimir Putin decided to step down from office and let go of formal power after the end of his second term . 
The Kremlin , better than anybody , knows that the regime will be doomed the moment the Russian elite loses its European legitimacy . 
Creating institutional incentives for the EU &apos;s unity would help Europe overcome the structural contradiction of the European project . 
The transformation of the OSCE into a political forum where EU member states will be individually represented by the EU , for example , could be the type of institutional innovation that can block Russia &apos;s effort to split the union . 
If Russia &apos;s strategy aims to erode the Union by focusing on bilateral relations , the EU &apos;s priority should be to institutionalize the Union as Russia &apos;s negotiating partner . 
The EU and the US must stop pretending that they have the capacity to transform Russia into a liberal democracy . 
But despite this , the EU should not allow Russia to send it into a benevolent irrelevance .
