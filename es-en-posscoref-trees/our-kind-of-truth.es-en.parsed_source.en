Our Kind of Truth 
NEW YORK - Rick Santorum , a former United States senator seeking the Republican Party &apos;s nomination to challenge President Barack Obama this year , has been saying some very strange things about the Netherlands . 
Ten percent of all deaths in that country , he recently claimed , are from euthanasia , half of which are forced upon helpless patients . 
Old people are so frightened of being killed by homicidal doctors that they wear bracelets that read : &quot; Do not euthanize me . &quot; 
In a way , Santorum &apos;s canards must come as a relief to a country that has increasingly been in the news for outrageous statements by right-wing populists about Muslims and Greeks . 
Indeed , Santorum &apos;s view of the Netherlands as a kind of progressive dystopia has a slightly old-fashioned ring to it nowadays . 
The Dutch were nonetheless disturbed . 
Some in the country &apos;s parliament even asked whether the foreign minister should lodge a complaint in Washington . 
In fact , Santorum &apos;s fantasies were swiftly refuted in the US itself . 
The Washington Post concluded that &quot; there was not a shred of evidence to back up Santorum &apos;s claims , &quot; and found it &quot; telling &quot; that his campaign managers did not even bother to defend them . 
One US television station even apologized to a Dutch reporter in the name of the American people . 
As the Post pointed out , there is no such thing as involuntary euthanasia in the Netherlands . 
The patient &apos;s consent is essential , and at least two doctors must agree that the patient &apos;s suffering is unbearable and beyond cure . 
Besides , the share of assisted deaths in Dutch mortality is nowhere near 10 % . 
As for those bracelets , well ... 
But does any of this matter to Santorum &apos;s followers ? 
Probably not . 
Corrections from the &quot; elitist &quot; mainstream media are dismissed as enemy propaganda . 
As a blogger sympathetic to Santorum put it : &quot; The Washington Post , as one would expect , attempted to discredit Santorum . &quot; 
It is disturbing , to say the least , that the most cogent refutations of bald-faced lies no longer make any impression . 
After all , a democracy cannot function without a public that is properly informed . 
Informing the public used to be the role of serious newspapers and television networks . 
Of course , not everything in the mainstream media is always true . 
Mistakes are made . 
News organizations have political biases , sometimes reflecting the views and interests of their owners . 
But high-quality journalism has always relied on its reputation for probity . 
Editors , as well as reporters , at least tried to get the facts right . 
That is why people read Le Monde , The New York Times , or , indeed , the Washington Post . 
Filtering nonsense was one of their duties -amp # 160 ; and their main selling point . 
That has changed . 
Populist demagogues in politics and the mass media are doing everything they can to discredit the quality press as propaganda organs for left-wing elites who sneer at the views of ordinary Americans . 
Santorum pretends to speak for these people - that is , for a minority of Americans who are mostly white , provincial , highly religious , deeply conservative on cultural and social issues , and convinced that Obama and all Europeans are dangerous godless socialists . 
The point is not whether Santorum is right or wrong factually . 
What he says &quot; feels &quot; right to his followers , because it conforms to their prejudices . 
The public is increasingly segmented into groups of likeminded people who see their views echoed back to them in blogs , comments , and tweets . 
There is no need to be exposed to different opinions , which are , in any case , considered to be propaganda . 
Indeed , Santorum &apos;s new fame will afford him a rich career as a media demagogue , even if he fails as a politician . 
The first people to argue that all truth is relative , and that all information is a form of propaganda that reflects society &apos;s power relations , were far removed from the world inhabited by Santorum and his supporters . 
Several decades ago , a number of European and American intellectuals , often with a background in Marxism , developed a &quot; post-modern &quot; critique of the written word . 
We might think , they argued , that what we read in The New York Times or Le Monde is objectively true , but everything that appears there is , in fact , a disguised form of propaganda for bourgeois class interests . 
There is no such thing , the post-modern critic believes , as independence of thought . 
Objective truth is an illusion . 
Everyone is promoting class interests of one kind or another . 
The real lie , in this view , is the claim of objectivity . 
What is necessary to change the world is not the truth , but another form of propaganda , promoting different interests . 
Everything is political . 
That is the only truth that counts . 
It is unlikely that Rick Santorum , or many of his followers , have read any post-modern theorists . 
Santorum , after all , recently called Obama a &quot; snob &quot; for claiming that all Americans should be entitled to a college education . 
So he must surely loath writers who represent everything that the Tea Party and other radical right-wingers abhor : the highly educated , intellectual , urban , secular , and not always white . 
These writers are the left-wing elite , at least in academia . 
But , as so often happens , ideas have a way of migrating in unexpected ways . 
The blogger who dismissed The Washington Post &apos;s corrections of Santorum &apos;s fictional portrayal of the Netherlands expressed himself like a perfect post-modernist . 
The most faithful followers of obscure leftist thinkers in Paris , New York , or Berkeley are the most reactionary elements in the American heartland . 
Of course , if this were pointed out to them , they would no doubt dismiss it as elitist propaganda .
