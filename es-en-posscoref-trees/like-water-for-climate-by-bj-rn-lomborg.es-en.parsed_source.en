Like Water for Climate 
MALMÃ– - &quot; Everyone knows &quot; that you should drink eight glasses of water a day . 
After all , this is the advice of a multitude of health writers , not to mention authorities like Britain &apos;s National Health Service . 
Healthy living now means carrying water bottles with us , sipping at all times , trying to drink our daily quota to ensure that we stay hydrated and healthy . 
Indeed , often we drink without being thirsty , but that is how it should be : as the beverage maker Gatorade reminds us , &quot; your brain may know a lot , but it doesn &apos;t know when your body is thirsty . &quot; 
Sure , drinking this much does not feel comfortable , but Powerade offers this sage counsel : &quot; you may be able to train your gut to tolerate more fluid if you build your fluid intake gradually . &quot; 
Now the British Medical Journal reports that these claims are &quot; not only nonsense , but thoroughly debunked nonsense . &quot; 
This has been common knowledge in the medical profession at least since 2002 , when Heinz Valtin , a professor of physiology and neurobiology at Dartmouth Medical School , published the first critical review of the evidence for drinking lots of water . 
He concluded that &quot; not only is there no scientific evidence that we need to drink that much , but the recommendation could be harmful , both in precipitating potentially dangerous hyponatremia and exposure to pollutants and also in making many people feel guilty for not drinking enough . &quot; 
So why do we keep hearing ( and believing ) that more water is better ? 
Well , obviously Gatorade and Powerade would like us to drink more of their products , and getting us to gulp more than we would naturally like seems like a brilliant marketing move . 
Likewise , the latest Hydration for Health science gathering , which promotes drinking more water , has been sponsored by Danone , which sells bottled water under brand names like Volvic and Evian . 
The drink-more-water story is curiously similar to how &quot; everyone knows &quot; that global warming only makes climate more extreme . 
A hot , dry summer ( in some places ) has triggered another barrage of such claims . 
And , while many interests are at work , one of the players that benefits the most from this story are the media : the notion of &quot; extreme &quot; climate simply makes for more compelling news . 
Consider Paul Krugman , writing breathlessly in The New York Times about the &quot; rising incidence of extreme events &quot; and how &quot; large-scale damage from climate change is ... happening now . &quot; 
He claims that global warming caused the current drought in America &apos;s Midwest , and that supposedly record-high corn prices could cause a global food crisis . 
But the United Nations climate panel &apos;s latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite : for &quot; North America , there is medium confidence that there has been an overall slight tendency toward less dryness ( wetting trend with more soil moisture and runoff ) . &quot; 
Moreover , there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine : climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by 2048 , at the earliest . 
And , fortunately , this year &apos;s drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis . 
According to The Economist , &quot; price increases in corn and soybeans are not thought likely to trigger a food crisis , as they did in 2007-08 , as global rice and wheat supplies remain plentiful . &quot; 
Moreover , Krugman overlooks inflation : prices have increased six-fold since 1969 , so , while corn futures did set a record of about $ 8 per bushel in late July , the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970 &quot; s , reaching a whopping $ 16 in 1974 . 
Finally , Krugman conveniently forgets that concerns about global warming are the main reason that corn prices have skyrocketed since 2005 . 
Nowadays 40 % of corn grown in the United States is used to produce ethanol , which does absolutely nothing for the climate , but certainly distorts the price of corn - at the expense of many of the world &apos;s poorest people . 
Bill McKibben similarly frets in The Guardian and The Daily Beast about the Midwest drought and corn prices . 
Moreover , he confidently tells us that raging wildfires from New Mexico and Colorado to Siberia are &quot; exactly &quot; what the early stages of global warming look like . 
In fact , the latest overview of global wildfire incidence suggests that , because humans have suppressed fire and decreased vegetation density , fire intensity has declined over the past 70 years , and is now close to its preindustrial level . 
When well-meaning campaigners want us to pay attention to global warming , they often end up pitching beyond the facts . 
And , while this may seem justified by a noble goal , such &quot; policy by panic &quot; tactics rarely work , and often backfire . 
Remember how , in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Al Gore ( and many others ) claimed that we were in store for ever more devastating hurricanes ? 
Since then , hurricane incidence has dropped off the charts ; indeed , by one measure , global accumulated cyclone energy has decreased to its lowest levels since the late 1970 &quot; s . Exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement . 
That is unfortunate , because global warming is a real problem , and we do need to address it . 
Warming will increase some extremes ( it is likely that both droughts and fires will become worse toward the end of the century ) . 
But warming will also decrease other extremes , for example , leading to fewer deaths from cold and less water scarcity . 
Similarly , there are real health problems - and many of them . 
But focusing on the wrong ones - like drinking a lot of water - diverts our attention from more important issues . 
Telling tall tales may benefit those with a stake in the telling , but it leaves us all worse off .
