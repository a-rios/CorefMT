The End of Chinese Central Planning 
BEIJING - &quot; Isn &apos;t it now time for China to abandon the concept of a growth target ? &quot; 
That was the question I asked Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei this week at the 15th annual China Development Forum , which brings together top Chinese officials and an international delegation of academics , leaders of multilateral organizations , and business executives . 
Having attended the CDF since former Premier Zhu Rongji initiated it in 2000 , I can attest to its role as one of China &apos;s most important platforms for debate . 
Zhu welcomed the exchange of views at the Forum as a true intellectual test for China &apos;s reformers . 
It was in that spirit that I posed my question to Lou , whom I have known since the late 1990 &quot; s . 
In that period , he has been Deputy Minister of Finance , founding Chairman of China &apos;s sovereign wealth fund , China Investment Corporation , and now Minister of Finance . 
I have always found him to be direct , intellectually curious , a first-rate analytical thinker , and a forward-looking advocate of market-based reforms . 
He is cut from the same cloth as his mentor , Zhu . 
My question was set in the context of the new thrust of Chinese reforms announced at last November &apos;s Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party , which emphasized the &quot; decisive role &quot; of market forces in shaping the next phase of China &apos;s economic development . 
I prefaced my question by underscoring the inherent contradiction between a target and a forecast in framing China &apos;s major economic objectives . 
I argued that the former embodied the obsolete straitjacket of central planning , while the latter was far more consistent with market-based outcomes . 
A target perpetuates the image of the all-powerful state-directed Chinese growth machine - a government that will essentially stop at nothing to hit a predetermined number . 
While it may seem like splitting hairs , continuing to frame the economic goal as a target sends a message of determined and explicit guidance that now seems at odds with the government &apos;s market-oriented intentions . 
Wouldn &apos;t dropping the concept send a far more powerful message ? 
Isn &apos;t it time for China to let go of the last vestiges of its centrally planned past ? 
Lou &apos;s response : &quot; Good question . &quot; 
China , he went on , is in fact moving away from its once single-minded emphasis on growth targeting . 
The government now stresses three macroeconomic goals - job creation , price stability , and GDP growth . 
And , as evidenced by the annual &quot; work report &quot; that the premier recently submitted to China &apos;s National People &apos;s Congress , the current emphasis is in that order , with GDP growth at the bottom of the list . 
This gives China and its policymakers considerable room for maneuver in coping with the current growth slowdown . 
Unlike most Western observers , who are fixated on the slightest deviation from the official growth target , Chinese officials are actually far more open-minded . 
They care less about GDP growth per se and more about the labor content of the gains in output . 
This is particularly relevant in light of the important threshold that has now been reached by the structural transformation of the Chinese economy - the long-awaited shift to a services-led growth dynamic . 
Services , which now account for the largest share of the economy , require close to 30 % more jobs per unit of output than the manufacturing and construction sectors combined . 
In an increasingly services-led , labor-intensive economy , China &apos;s economic managers can afford to be more relaxed about a GDP slowdown . 
Last year was a case in point . 
At the start of 2013 , the government announced that it was targeting ten million new urban jobs . 
In fact , the economy added 13.1 million workers - even though GDP expanded by &quot; only &quot; 7.7 % . 
In other words , if China can hit its employment goal with 7.5 % GDP growth , there is no reason for its policymakers to panic and roll out the heavy counter-cyclical artillery . 
That , in fact , was pretty much the message conveyed by a broad cross-section of senior officials at this year &apos;s CDF : Slowdown , yes ; major policy response , no . 
Zhou Xiaochuan , the head of the People &apos;s Bank of China , was just as emphatic on this point . 
The PBOC , he argued , does not pursue a single target . 
The trick , Zhou stressed , is to assign weights to each of the four goals in the multi-objective policy function . 
He conceded that the weighting problem has now been seriously complicated by the new need to pay greater attention to financial stability . 
All of this paints China with a very different brush than was used during the first 30 years of its growth miracle . 
Since Deng Xiaoping &apos;s reforms of the early 1980 &quot; s , less and less attention has been paid to the numerical targets of central planning . 
The State Planning Commission evolved into the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) - though it is still housed in the same building on Yuetan Street in Beijing . 
Those days are now over . 
A new &quot; leading committee &quot; on reforms is marginalizing the NDRC , and China &apos;s most senior fiscal and monetary policymakers - Lou Jiwei and Zhou Xiaochuan - are close to taking the final step in the long journey to a market-based economy . 
Their shared interpretation of flexible growth targeting puts them basically in the same camp as policymakers in most of the developed world . 
The plan is now a goal-setting exercise . 
From now on , fluctuations in the Chinese economy , and the policy responses that those fluctuations imply , need to be considered in that vein .
