Kick-Starting Employment 
BERKELEY - Unemployment is currently rising like a rocket , because businesses that normally would be expanding and hiring are not , and those businesses that would normally be contracting and shedding workers are doing so very rapidly . 
Businesses that ought to be expanding and hiring cannot , because the depressed general level of financial asset prices prevents them from borrowing money or selling bonds on profitable terms . 
In response , central banks should purchase government bonds for cash in as large a quantity as needed to push their prices up as high as possible . 
Expensive government bonds will shift demand to mortgage or corporate bonds , pushing up their prices . 
Even after central banks have pushed government bond prices as high as they can go , they should keep buying government bonds for cash , in the hope that people whose pockets are full of cash will spend more of it , and that this will directly pull people out of joblessness and into employment . 
In addition , governments need to run extra-large deficits . 
Spending - whether by the United States government during World War II , following the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 , by Silicon Valley during the late 1990 &quot; s , or by home buyers in America &apos;s south and on its coasts in the 2000 &quot; s - boosts employment and reduces unemployment . 
Finally , governments should undertake additional measures to boost financial asset prices , and so make it easier for those firms that ought to be expanding and hiring to obtain finance on terms that allow them to expand and hire . 
It is this point that brings us to US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner &apos;s plan to take about $ 465 billion of government money , combine it with $ 35 billion of private-sector money , and use it to buy up risky financial assets . 
The US Treasury is asking the private sector to put $ 35 billion into this $ 500 billion fund so that the fund managers all have some &quot; skin in the game , &quot; and thus do not take excessive risks with the taxpayers &quot; money . 
Private-sector investors ought to be more than willing to kick in that $ 35 billion , for they stand to make a fortune when financial asset prices close some of the gap between their current and normal values . 
If the fund does well over the next five years - returns profits of 9 % per year -private investors get a market rate of return on their very risky equity investment and the equivalent of an &quot; annual management fee &quot; equal to 2 % of assets under management . 
If the portfolio does less well - profits of 4 % per year - the managers still get a healthy but sub-market return of 10 % per year on their equity . 
Those are attractive odds . 
Time alone will tell whether the financiers who invest in and run this program make a fortune . 
And 2 % of assets under management is an annual fee that many sophisticated investors have been willing to pay private hedge funds - topped off with an extra fee of 20 % of annual profits , which the Treasury is not paying . 
The fact that the Geithner Plan is likely to be profitable for the US government is , however , a sideshow . 
The aim is to reduce unemployment . 
The appearance of an extra $ 500 billion in demand for risky assets will reduce the quantity of risky assets that other private investors will have to hold . 
This sharing of information will reduce risk - somewhat . 
When assets are seen as less risky , their prices rise . 
With higher financial asset prices , those firms that ought to be expanding and hiring will be able to get money on more attractive terms . 
The problem is that the Geithner Plan appears to me to be too small - between one-eight and one-half of what it needs to be . 
Even though the US government is doing other things as well -fiscal stimulus , quantitative easing , and other uses of bailout funds - it is not doing everything it should . 
My guess is that the reason that the US government is not doing all it should can be stated in three words : Senator George Voinovich , who is the 60th vote in the Senate - the vote needed to close off debate and enact a bill . 
To do anything that requires legislative action , the Obama administration needs Voinovich and the 59 other senators who are more inclined to support it . 
The administration &apos;s tacticians appear to think that they are not on board - especially after the recent AIG bonus scandal - whereas the Geithner Plan relies on authority that the administration already has . 
Doing more would require a legislative coalition that is not there yet .
