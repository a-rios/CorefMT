Anatomy of the Party of Power 
More than anything else , Vladimir Putin understands power : how to get it ; how to consolidate it . 
His predecessor , Boris Yeltsin , knew how to seize power but not how to consolidate it , which partly explains why power seeped away throughout his presidency . 
President Putin &apos;s success , however , has bred its own problem : he consolidated power at the center so well that opposition is brewing in Russia &apos;s regions . 
Yeltsin &apos;s biggest failing was in not creating a viable , non-ideological party - a &quot; party of power &quot; - to buttress his regime . 
He tried to do so in 1995 , but the Chechen War drove Russia &apos;s democrats away from him . 
Moreover , his efforts here were amazingly clumsy . 
Yeltsin once spoke about his scheme to link two centrists . 
With &quot; Ivan Rybkin ( then Duma &apos;s speaker ) , &quot; Yelstin said on TV , &quot; leading the left flank , and Viktor Chernomyrdin ( then prime minister ) leading the right , we will encircle everyone . &quot; 
But by linking both parties to his very unpopular self , Yeltsin damaged both . 
Perhaps if both wings had united , that single party would have appeared as an unbeatable juggernaut . 
Such unity , however , was impossible , for an obvious Russian reason : the faction leaders hated each other too much to get together , even for their own good . 
Indeed , Rybkin was told to pretend to be opposed to Yeltsin &apos;s policies , but when he did object , Chernomyrdin summoned Rybkin to his office for &quot; clarifications . &quot; 
When businessmen learned about this &quot; dressing down , &quot; they became afraid to finance Rybkin &apos;s party . 
In the end , Rybkin went unelected and Chernomyrdin &apos;s &apos; Our Home Is Russia &apos; ( NDR ) came third . 
Yeltsin failed to consolidate political support for other reasons as well , the most important being his unwillingness ( or inability ) to forcefully manipulate the media . 
Of course , transformation of the presidential administration into a public relations machine began under Yeltsin when Anatoli Chubais directed the 1996 election campaign . 
Before that , the Kremlin had little idea about how to manipulate the new media outlets that Russia &apos;s infant democracy had produced . 
Today &apos;s Kremlin , however , is full of clever ideas about how to control and intimidate newspapers , radio , and television . 
In the 1995 election , Yeltsin would have been happy if the NDR secured 25 % to 30 % of the vote . 
Putin is far more ambitious . 
He will be displeased if &apos; United Russia &apos; - the &quot; party of power &quot; he has built - wins less than 50 % of the seats in the next Duma . 
But are the results of the parliamentary elections due this coming January truly a foregone conclusion ? 
Or are surprises in store for Putin ? 
Surprises seem likely because Russia &apos;s political dividing line has shifted , but the President &apos;s political strategy hasn &apos;t recognized that fact . 
Indeed , he appears set to be waging battles against the communists that are already won . 
Putin &apos;s re-consolidation of power within the Kremlin , after much of it escaped to the regions during the Yeltsin years , dramatically shifted Russia &apos;s political dividing line . 
In the past , that dividing line separated right and left , but the line at the forthcoming elections will run between the federal center and the regions . 
The loss of political power in the regions ( regional governors , for example , were evicted from the Duma &apos;s upper house ) has incited serious discontent that is spilling over into the public sphere . 
That discontent will likely gather momentum as elections near , which may be enough to stop the federal authorities from meeting their strategic goal of winning an unchallengeable majority of seats in the new Duma . 
Vast administrative resources are being used to secure the desired result . 
But Russia &apos;s bureaucracy is no disciplined machine , and the lower reaches of the state &apos;s &apos; vertical &apos; power structure may well ally themselves - quietly - with regional authorities to prevent the center from gaining too many votes . 
Regional administrations also possess their own instruments of obstruction , including propaganda outlets in the regional media , as well as the ability to manipulate ballot papers . 
Indeed , President Putin &apos;s failure to &quot; reconquer &quot; his home city of St. Petersburg , now controlled by a bitter political opponent of the President , Vladimir Yakovlev , demonstrates the bureaucratic powers that local leaders retain . 
So the real issue in the forthcoming Duma elections will be how powerfully regional elites confront Putin . 
Their ability to defy the president may be aided by the fact that the Kremlin is failing to recognize the potential of their challenge . 
So far , the main target of its campaign is the communists , whom Kremlin political operatives hope to destroy in the way they destroyed Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov , head of the Fatherland party , who were the leading non-communist challengers during Putin &apos;s first presidential campaign . 
That focus on the battle with the communists may allow other forces to sneak into the Duma by the back door . 
The Boris Nemtsov / Sergei Kiriyenko &apos; Union of Right Forces &apos; ( SPS ) is one party that seems certain to benefit in this way . 
Indeed , the SPS electorate is growing faster than that of other parties . 
In principle , all of Russia &apos;s political elites appear to have - or pretend to have - resigned themselves to a political landscape with Putin alone on the mountaintop and everyone else consigned to the valley below . 
The upcoming elections won &apos;t knock the president off that mountain , but his &apos; party of power &apos; is not omnipotent enough to silence the dissenting echoes rising from below .
