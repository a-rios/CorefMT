America &apos;s Ungovernable Budget 
NEW YORK - The heart of any government is found in its budget . 
Politicians can make endless promises , but if the budget doesn &apos;t add up , politics is little more than mere words . 
The United States is now caught in such a bind . 
In his recent State of the Union address , President Barack Obama painted a convincing picture of modern , twenty-first-century government . 
But the truth is that both parties are hiding from the reality : without more taxes , a modern , competitive US economy is not possible . 
Obama rightly emphasized that competitiveness in the world today depends on an educated workforce and modern infrastructure . 
That is true for any country , but it is especially relevant for rich countries . 
The US and Europe are in direct competition with Brazil , China , India , and other emerging economies , where wage levels are sometimes one-quarter those in high-income countries ( if not even lower ) . 
America and Europe will keep their high living standards only by basing their competitiveness on advanced skills , cutting-edge technologies , and modern infrastructure . 
That is why Obama called for an increase in US public investment in three areas : education , science and technology , and infrastructure ( including broadband Internet , fast rail , and clean energy ) . 
He spelled out a vision of future growth in which public and private investment would be complementary , mutually supportive pillars . 
Obama emphasized these themes for good reason . 
Unemployment in the US now stands at nearly 10 % of the labor force , in part because more new jobs are being created in the emerging economies , and many of the jobs now being created in the US pay less than in the past , owing to greater global competition . 
Unless the US steps up its investment in education , science , technology , and infrastructure , these adverse trends will continue . 
But Obama &apos;s message lost touch with reality when he turned his attention to the budget deficit . 
Acknowledging that recent fiscal policies had put the US on an unsustainable trajectory of rising public debt , Obama said that moving towards budget balance was now essential for fiscal stability . 
So he called for a five-year freeze on what the US government calls &quot; discretionary &quot; civilian spending . 
The problem is that more than half of such spending is on education , science and technology , and infrastructure - the areas that Obama had just argued should be strengthened . 
After telling Americans how important government investment is for modern growth , he promised to freeze that spending for the next five years ! 
Politicians often change their message from one speech to the next , but rarely contradict it so glaringly in the same speech . 
That contradiction highlights the sad and self-defeating nature of US budget policies over the past 25 years , and most likely in the years to come . 
On the one hand , the US government must invest more to promote economic competitiveness . 
On the other hand , US taxes are chronically too low to support the level of government investment that is needed . 
America &apos;s fiscal reality was made painfully clear two days after Obama &apos;s speech , in a new study from the Congressional Budget Office , which revealed that the budget deficit this year will reach nearly $ 1.5 trillion - a sum almost unimaginable even for an economy the size of the US . 
The CBO study also made clear that December &apos;s tax-cut agreement between Obama and the Republican opposition willfully and deliberately increased the budget deficit sharply . 
Various tax cuts initiated by George W. Bush were set to expire at the end of 2010 . 
Obama and the Republicans agreed to continue those tax cuts for at least two years ( they will now probably continue beyond that ) , thereby lowering tax revenue by $ 350 billion this year and again in 2012 . 
Tax cuts for the richest Americans were part of the package . 
The truth of US politics today is simple . 
The key policy for the leaders of both political parties is tax cuts , especially for the rich . 
Both political parties , and the White House , would rather cut taxes than spend more on education , science and technology , and infrastructure . 
Both parties therefore cater to their wishes . 
As a result , America &apos;s total tax revenues as a share of national income are among the lowest of all high-income countries , roughly 30 % , compared to around 40 % in Europe . But 30 % of GDP is not enough to cover the needs of health , education , science and technology , social security , infrastructure , and other vital government responsibilities . 
One budget area can and should be cut : military spending . 
But even if America &apos;s wildly excessive military budget is cut sharply ( and politicians in both parties are resisting that ) , there will still be a need for new taxes . 
The economic and social consequences of a generation of tax cutting are clear . 
America is losing its international competitiveness , neglecting its poor - one in five American children is trapped in poverty - and leaving a mountain of debt to its young . 
For all of the Obama administration &apos;s lofty rhetoric , his fiscal-policy proposals make no serious attempt to address these problems . 
To do so would require calling for higher taxes , and that - as George H. W. Bush learned in 1992 - is no way to get re-elected .
