Rio &apos;s Unsustainable Nonsense 
NEW YORK - If George Orwell were alive today , he would be irritated , and then shocked , by the cynical way in which every lobby with an axe to grind and money to burn has hitched its wagon to the alluring phrase &quot; sustainable development . &quot; 
In fact , the United Nations &quot; Rio + 20 Conference on Sustainable Development is about pet projects of all and sundry - many of them tangential to the major environmental issues , such as climate change , that were the principal legacy of the original Rio Earth Summit . 
Thus , the International Labor Organization and trade-union lobbies have managed to insert &quot; Decent Jobs &quot; into the seven priority areas at the Rio conference . 
I would love for everyone , everywhere , to have a decent job . 
No one should pretend that we can magically offer decent jobs to the huge numbers of impoverished but aspiring workers in the informal sector . 
Such jobs can only be created by adopting appropriate economic policies . 
Indeed , the really pressing task facing many developing economies is to pursue policies that promote economic opportunities by accelerating growth . 
The flavor of the week in Rio is &quot; sustainability indexing &quot; for corporations , by way of corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) . 
Such indexing is being compared to accounting standards . 
Corporations can , of course , be asked to conform to a &quot; don &apos;t &quot; list - don &apos;t dump mercury into rivers , don &apos;t employ children for hazardous tasks , etc . 
The notion that a self-appointed set of activists , in conjunction with some governments and international agencies , can determine what a corporation should do by way of CSR contradicts the liberal notion that we should ask for virtue to be pursued , but not in a particular way . 
At a time when the world is emphasizing the importance of diversity and tolerance , it is effrontery to suggest that corporations should standardize their notion of how they wish to promote good in the world . 
Even when the Rio + 20 agenda includes something more properly &quot; environmental &quot; - say , the supply of water - platitudes predominate . 
Thus , the availability of safe drinking water is now to be enshrined as a &quot; right . &quot; 
We have traditionally distinguished in human-rights conventions between ( mandatory ) civil and political rights , such as the right to habeas corpus , from ( aspirational ) economic rights , because the latter require resources . 
Blurring that distinction - thereby disregarding the problem of scarcity - is no solution . 
After all , &quot; availability &quot; can be interpreted according to many criteria and thus in myriad ways : How much water ? 
At what distance from different households ( or by pipe into each house ) ? 
At what cost ? 
These decisions have different implications for the availability of water , and they must compete , in any event , against other &quot; rights &quot; and resource uses . 
In the end , therefore , water availability cannot properly be called a &quot; right . &quot; 
Rather , it is a &quot; priority , &quot; and countries will inevitably differ in the sequence with which they pursue it relative to others . 
While these are &quot; sins of commission , &quot; the &quot; sins of omission &quot; at Rio + 20 are even more glaring . 
For a conference that is supposedly addressing &quot; sustainability , &quot; it is worth lamenting the absence of a heroic effort to agree on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Accord . 
If the cataclysmic scenarios implied by neglect of climate change are valid - and extreme estimates , it must be said , could backfire politically by looking implausible or , worse , by producing a &quot; Nero effect &quot; ( if Rome is burning , let &apos;s party ) - Rio + 20 &quot; s lack of action should be regarded as an historic failure . 
But a matching omission is that prompted by our societies &quot; increasing political unsustainability , not because of the immediate financial problems like those afflicting Europe and threatening the world , but because the modern media have made visible to all the disparities in the fortunes of the rich and the poor . 
The rich should be urged not to flaunt their wealth : extravagance amid much poverty arouses wrath . 
The poor , meanwhile , need a fair shot at raising their incomes . 
&quot; Less Excess and More Access &quot; : only a policy mix based on this credo will guarantee that our societies remain viable and achieve genuine &quot; sustainability . &quot;
