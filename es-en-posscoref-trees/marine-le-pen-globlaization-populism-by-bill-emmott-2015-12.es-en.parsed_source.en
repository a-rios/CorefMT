Patriotism in the Age of Globalization 
LONDON - The new fault line in politics , according to Marine Le Pen , leader of France &apos;s far-right National Front , is between globalists and patriots . 
It is an argument similar to those being made by euroskeptics in the United Kingdom and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the United States . 
It is , however , as false as it is dangerous . 
Judging by the results of the second and final round of France &apos;s regional elections on December 13 , it is also an argument that French voters , at least , roundly rejected . 
They cast 73 % of their ballots for the National Front &apos;s rivals , depriving the party of even a single victory . 
Le Pen accused the mainstream parties of ganging up on her , describing their cooperation as a denial of democracy . 
Her argument is , of course , a classic example of sour grapes ; the entire point of a two-round voting system is to force parties and their supporters to seek a consensus and form partnerships . 
Unless and until the National Front finds a way to win allies , it will not achieve an electoral breakthrough . 
( The same is likely to prove true about Trump . ) 
That is not to say that Le Pen &apos;s claim - that those who vote for her party are the only true patriots - should be casually dismissed . 
She has homed in on a powerful message , one with the potential to attract supporters from other parties . 
That &apos;s why it must be rebutted , both in France and elsewhere . 
The assumption underlying such nationalist bombast - that a country &apos;s interests are better served by being closed rather than open - is extremely dangerous . 
The belief that openness is treason and closure is patriotic is a rejection of the entire post-1945 framework of politics and policy in the developed world . 
It is an attempt to turn back the clock to the interwar period , when the focus was on closing off : imposing onerous trade restrictions and persecuting or expelling minority groups . 
This was true even in the United States , which enacted the most restrictive immigration laws since the country &apos;s founding . 
The postwar years marked a complete change of direction , as countries opened up , allowing freer flows of trade , capital , ideas , and people . 
This process became known as globalization only after China and India joined in during the 1980s , but it had started long before . 
It was globalization , after all , that created what in France became known as Les Trente Glorieuses - the 30 glorious years of rapidly rising living standards following the end of WWII . 
Le Pen and her fellow populists claim that globalization was either an act of foolish generosity that helped the rest of the world at the expense of the nation , or a phenomenon that benefited only the elites and not ordinary people . 
For them , patriotism means being harder-headed about protecting the national interest and adopting more democratic policies that help the working masses , not jet-setting fat cats . 
The second part of this argument - that the interests of ordinary people have been subordinated to those of the elite - must be heard and responded to . 
A democracy in which a majority feels neglected or exploited is not sustainable . 
Elected officials clearly need to find answers to high unemployment and declining living standards . 
What mainstream parties need to be make clear , however , is that the answers to those problems do not lie in closing borders or minds . 
There is no example , anywhere in history , of a society or an economy that has prospered over the long term by rejecting globalism . 
Moreover , though openness may not guarantee prosperity , it has always been a prerequisite for growth . 
To be sure , the optimal amount of openness is a matter of debate . 
But the bigger , more productive arguments are about how to shape education , labor markets , scientific research , and social-welfare policies in order to help societies adapt to the world around them . 
The patriotic choice - the national interest - has always consisted in crafting domestic policies that best take advantage of globalization . 
For mainstream parties in France , the Conservatives in the UK , and Trump &apos;s more internationally minded Republican rivals in the US , there is nothing to be gained from copying the arguments of their extremist counterparts . 
Doing so would yield crucial ground in the political battle over how best to serve the country and its people . 
Mainstream parties must reclaim the mantle of patriotism and redefine the national interest accordingly . 
In today &apos;s world , the national interest lies in managing openness - not in throwing it away .
