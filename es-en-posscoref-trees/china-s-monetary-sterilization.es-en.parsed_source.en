China &apos;s Monetary Sterilization 
BEIJING - Not long after the United States Federal Reserve Board announced its second round of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ( known as QE2 ) , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBC ) , China &apos;s central bank , announced two increases of 0.5 percentage points in the required reserve ratio ( RRR ) of bank deposits . 
The RRR now stands at 18.5 % , a historic high , even in global terms . 
While the Fed is planning to pump more money into the US economy , the PBC is trying to reduce the amount of money in circulation in China . 
Money used by commercial banks to satisfy the RRR , which is held in accounts at the PBC , can no longer be extended as loans . 
As a result , more money than ever is now frozen or inactive in China . 
It is understandable that the Fed wants to boost demand as long as the US economy remains depressed . 
But why has the PBC tightened monetary policy so much ? 
The Chinese economy is not over-heating . 
Growth is still high , at about 10 % per year , but has started to moderate . 
And , while inflation is a concern - having risen to 4.4 % year on year in October , from 3.6 % in September - this cannot explain why the PBC raised the RRR three times earlier this year , when inflation was lower . 
Instead , the PBC &apos;s policy is preemptive : sterilize over-liquidity and get the money supply under control in order to prevent inflation or over-heating . 
At the beginning of the year , the RRR increases could be regarded as part of efforts to correct the over-supply of money that arose from the anti-crisis stimulus package . 
But the most recent RRR increases serve mainly to sterilize the &quot; passive money supply &quot; caused by the increase in foreign-exchange reserves . 
Indeed , in September alone , China &apos;s foreign-currency reserves increased by almost $ 100 billion compared to August . 
With the global economy recovering , China &apos;s trade surplus began to grow . 
Moreover , capital inflows increased significantly , owing to real investment opportunities in the high-growth economy and the expectation of renminbi revaluation . 
But rapid growth in foreign-exchange reserves means an increase in the domestic money supply , because the PBC issues RMB6.64 ( down 3 % since June ) for every dollar it receives . 
That means that money supply increase by nearly RMB700 billion in September . 
The two 50-basis-point RRR increases just locked up the same amount of liquidity . 
A country with current-account and capital-account surpluses and increasing foreign-exchange reserves normally sees an excessive money supply and high inflation . 
But , while excessive money supply is a reality for China - the PBC now holds more than $ 2.6 trillion in foreign reserves - inflation has been quite moderate so far , thanks to the sterilization policy . 
The RRR is only one example of a textbook sterilization instrument . 
Another is to sell off government bonds held by the central bank in order to take money out of circulation - again , just the opposite of what the Fed is now doing . 
Because China &apos;s government does not owe much debt to the public , the PBC sold out its holdings of government bonds in 2005 . 
So it had to create something else to sell . 
It created so-called &quot; Central Bank Bills , &quot; which commercial banks are supposed to buy voluntarily . 
When they do , the money they pay is also locked up in the PBC &apos;s accounts . 
To date , up to 5-6 % of total liquidity has been returned to the central bank in this way . 
Furthermore , the PBC uses unconventional instruments from time to time , such as &quot; credit ceilings &quot; or &quot; credit quotas &quot; imposed on commercial banks . 
This may result in &quot; extra reserves , &quot; which commercial banks cannot use to extend their credit lines . 
Credit quotas imposed early this year have left Chinese commercial banks with 2-3 % of extra reserves . 
Adding up the impact of the PBC &apos;s sterilization efforts , roughly one-quarter of China &apos;s total monetary base is illiquid . 
Thus , although China &apos;s total money supply seems excessive , with the M2-to-GDP ratio now at about 190 % , the real monetary base is actually much smaller than it appears . 
As a result , China &apos;s inflation , as well as asset prices , remain under control . 
For how long will this sterilization continue , and how far will it go ? 
At what point will higher RRR levels cause Chinese commercial banks to begin running losses ? 
There may be room for further sterilization . 
First , unlike in some other countries , Chinese commercial banks are paid reasonable interest rates on required reserves , except for the &quot; extra reserves &quot; that they hold . 
So they do not lose much , if anything , from the PBC &apos;s sterilization policies . 
Second , China &apos;s central bank still controls interest rates by enforcing a roughly three-percentage-point spread between deposit rates and lending rates . 
As a result , Chinese commercial banks can operate longer with a higher RRR than their counterparts elsewhere . 
One key issue facing China is how to reduce the current- and capital-account surpluses in order to reduce foreign-exchange holdings . 
Yes , further revaluation of the exchange rate is needed , but this can play only a secondary role . 
The most important task for China is to reduce the saving rate , which equaled 52 % of GDP in 2009 . 
A number of fiscal , social-security , and tax reforms should be a priority for this purpose . 
But it seems that both revaluation and reform will take time . 
Meanwhile , the causes of global imbalance on the US side also seem unlikely to disappear any time soon . 
And now , with the Fed &apos;s QE2 on the table , conditions may worsen before they improve . 
The PBC may have to continue its sterilization for some time in the foreseeable future .
