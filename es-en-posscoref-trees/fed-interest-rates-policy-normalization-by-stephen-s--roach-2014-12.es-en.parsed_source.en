The Fed Sets Another Trap 
NEW HAVEN - America &apos;s Federal Reserve is headed down a familiar - and highly dangerous - path . 
Steeped in denial of its past mistakes , the Fed is pursuing the same incremental approach that helped set the stage for the financial crisis of 2008-2009 . 
The consequences could be similarly catastrophic . 
Consider the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , where discussions of raising the benchmark federal funds rate were couched in adjectives , rather than explicit actions . 
In line with prior forward guidance that the policy rate would be kept near zero for a &quot; considerable &quot; amount of time after the Fed stopped purchasing long-term assets in October , the FOMC declared that it can now afford to be &quot; patient &quot; in waiting for the right conditions to raise the rate . 
Add to that Fed Chair Janet Yellen &apos;s declaration that at least a couple more FOMC meetings would need to take place before any such &quot; lift-off &quot; occurs , and the Fed seems to be telegraphing a protracted journey on the road to policy normalization . 
This bears an eerie resemblance to the script of 2004-2006 , when the Fed &apos;s incremental approach led to the near-fatal mistake of condoning mounting excesses in financial markets and the real economy . 
After pushing the federal funds rate to a 45-year low of 1 % following the collapse of the equity bubble of the early 2000s , the Fed delayed policy normalization for an inordinately long period . 
In the 24 months from June 2004 , the FOMC raised the federal funds rate from 1 % to 5.25 % in 17 increments of 25 basis points each . 
Meanwhile , housing and credit bubbles were rapidly expanding , fueling excessive household consumption , a sharp drop in personal savings , and a record current-account deficit - imbalances that set the stage for the meltdown that was soon to follow . 
The Fed , of course , has absolved itself of any blame in setting up the US and the global economy for the Great Crisis . 
It was not monetary policy &apos;s fault , argued both former Fed Chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke ; if anything , they insisted , a lack of regulatory oversight was the culprit . 
This argument has proved convincing in policy and political circles , leading officials to focus on a new approach centered on so-called macro-prudential tools , including capital requirements and leverage ratios , to curb excessive risk-taking by banks . 
While this approach has some merit , it is incomplete , as it fails to address the egregious mispricing of risk brought about by an overly accommodative monetary policy and the historically low interest rates that it generated . 
In this sense , the Fed &apos;s incrementalism of 2004-2006 was a policy blunder of epic proportions . 
The Fed seems poised to make a similar - and possibly even more serious - misstep in the current environment . 
For starters , given ongoing concerns about post-crisis vulnerabilities and deflation risk , today &apos;s Fed seems likely to find any excuse to prolong its incremental normalization , taking a slower pace than it adopted a decade ago . 
More important , the Fed &apos;s $ 4.5 trillion balance sheet has since grown more than fivefold . 
Though the Fed has stopped purchasing new assets , it has shown no inclination to scale back its outsize holdings . 
Meanwhile it has passed the quantitative-easing baton to the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank , both of which will create even more liquidity at a time of record-low interest rates . 
In these days of froth , the persistence of extraordinary policy accommodation in a financial system flooded with liquidity poses a great danger . 
Indeed , that could well be the lesson of recent equity- and currency-market volatility and , of course , plummeting oil prices . 
With so much dry kindling , it will not take much to spark the next conflagration . 
Central banking has lost its way . 
Trapped in a post-crisis quagmire of zero interest rates and swollen balance sheets , the world &apos;s major central banks do not have an effective strategy for regaining control over financial markets or the real economies that they are supposed to manage . 
Policy levers - both benchmark interest rates and central banks &quot; balance sheets - remain at their emergency settings , even though the emergency ended long ago . 
While this approach has succeeded in boosting financial markets , it has failed to cure bruised and battered developed economies , which remain mired in subpar recoveries and plagued with deflationary risks . 
Moreover , the longer central banks promote financial-market froth , the more dependent their economies become on these precarious markets and the weaker the incentives for politicians and fiscal authorities to address the need for balance-sheet repair and structural reform . 
A new approach is needed . 
Central banks should normalize crisis-induced policies as soon as possible . 
Financial markets will , of course , object loudly . 
The unprecedented financial engineering by central banks over the last six years has been decisive in setting asset prices in major markets worldwide . 
With zero interest rates and outsize balance sheets , that is exactly what they are lacking .
