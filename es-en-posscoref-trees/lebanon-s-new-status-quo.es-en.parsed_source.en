Lebanon &apos;s New Status Quo 
BEIRUT - Hezbollah &apos;s armed insurrection in May , which overran Beirut and other parts of Lebanon , has dealt a further blow to hopes of true state sovereignty in the country , strengthening Hezbollah and weakening the Western-backed government . 
But it also brought about a new political accord , negotiated in Doha , Qatar , providing for election of a president after a long stalemate , formation of a national unity government , a new election law , and a return to a national dialogue over relations between the state and non-state actors , particularly Hezbollah . 
There is much speculation about the reasoning behind the government &apos;s decisions in May to dismiss the pro-Hezbollah chief of airport security and investigate Hezbollah &apos;s private telecommunications network , which sparked the confrontations . 
The government had been under longstanding international pressure to honor at least some of its international commitments to contain Hezbollah , and it wrongly calculated that the group would only respond in a limited way . 
Most importantly , the government mistakenly reckoned that Hezbollah would not risk Shia-Sunni clashes in Beirut . 
Similar questions surround Hezbollah &apos;s reasoning in unleashing large-scale action that risked sectarian warfare and jeopardized its moral high ground . 
But it has largely achieved its aims . 
Militarily , it has nipped in the bud any potential armed militia in West Beirut that could hinder its movement beyond the southern suburbs . 
It also secured key highways south and east of Beirut that Druze leader Walid Junblatt previously dominated and reasserted its access to the capital &apos;s airport and seaports . 
Politically , Hezbollah abandoned its policy of waiting out the government , in favor of pushing it to the breaking point and quickly fashioning a new status quo . 
Now it has strong influence with the new president whom it helped bring to power , a blocking veto in the next government , and it has drawn a clear line in the sand regarding the untouchability of its arms and its communication and operational infrastructure . 
Hezbollah and its main backer , Iran , were motivated by two concerns : fear of the next Israeli attack , which Hezbollah believes is inevitable , and concern over Syrian-Israeli peace talks that , if successful , could leave Hezbollah without its main bridge to Iran . Hezbollah has been rearming and redeploying since the 2006 war ; the actions of May further consolidate its position in and around Beirut . 
By reasserting its access to the airport and seaports , and by consolidating the political situation in the country , Hezbollah can better survive a shift in Syrian policy : the United States and Israel can no longer ask Syria to &quot; deliver &quot; Hezbollah as part of any peace deal over the Golan . 
Morever , by resuscitating the weak institutions of the Lebanese state , Hezbollah gains important political protection from external attack . 
It will be hard for Israel to launch a large-scale attack on Hezbollah if it is participating in a semi-stable Lebanese state headed by an internationally recognized president , with a pro-Western prime minister and a democratically elected parliament , teeming with tourists , and buffered by 10,000 UNIFIL troops in the south . 
In other words , Hezbollah &apos;s survival strategy partly depends on the protective shell of a rickety Lebanese state . 
Hezbollah &apos;s moves were clearly a defeat for the US and Saudi Arabia . 
However , when they saw that Hezbollah had limited demands and wanted Lebanon &apos;s Western-backed coalition to continue to lead the government , they chose to make advantage out of adversity . 
The US and Saudi Arabia welcomed the Doha Agreement and the election of the new president , and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice flew to Beirut to express US support for the president and the Lebanese state . 
Qatar &apos;s role in bringing about a resolution , alongside that of Turkey in mediating Syrian-Israeli talks , signals a return to pragmatism in Middle East relations . 
It also indicates the dead-end to which the ideological politics of the US , Iran , and Saudi Arabia has led . Although the Doha agreement papers over serious political and institutional contradictions , it reinforces the emergence of a pragmatic approach toward managing the region &apos;s crises . 
Lebanon now limps forward carrying the contradictions of internal and regional politics with it . 
The Doha agreement might allow a number of months , or years , of relative calm . 
But until the Lebanese state is able to integrate or dominate non-state militias , and until some of the raging confrontations in Lebanon &apos;s immediate environment are calmed , Lebanon is not likely to know real stability .
