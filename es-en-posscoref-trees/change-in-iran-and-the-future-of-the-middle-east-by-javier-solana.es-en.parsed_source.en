Waking from the Middle East Nightmare 
MADRID - The Middle East is caught in a seemingly endless spiral of instability . 
The possibility of military intervention in Syria , together with the deteriorating situation in Egypt since the army &apos;s coup , has placed the region on a razor &apos;s edge . 
Moreover , despite the changes in Iran since its presidential election in June , international negotiations over its nuclear ambitions remain a dead letter . 
Paradoxes abound , as the United States &apos;s traditional Middle East allies ( Saudi Arabia , Israel , Turkey , Egypt , and the Gulf states ) have taken opposing - and sometimes seemingly contradictory - positions on the region &apos;s key conflicts . 
And , in all of today &apos;s hotspots , the assertion of interests by neighboring or nearby countries has complicated matters further . 
Saudi Arabia , fearing severe domestic consequences from the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s empowerment in Egypt , does not want to see an Islamist movement legitimized democratically . 
So it has taken a consistently harsh position against the Brotherhood , despite the latter being more moderate than the Saudis &quot; own brand of Islam . 
Israel , for its part , is exerting pressure in two ways . 
First , it is supporting the Egyptian coup and international recognition of the military regime , thereby ensuring - it hopes - greater stability along the Sinai border . 
Second , it is making progress in its negotiations with the Palestinians dependent on events in Egypt and elsewhere in the region , such as Iran . 
US Secretary of State John Kerry has invested considerable political capital in the revival of peace negotiations , and Israel can use that to its advantage as well . 
The civil war in Syria , meanwhile , has inflamed the Sunni-Shia fault line that traverses the entire region , and that defines , for example , the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran . 
In fact , while Saudi Arabia opposes elected Islamists in Egypt , it supports insurgent Islamists in Syria , owing entirely to Iran &apos;s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
The Egyptian coup has already proved to have been a mistake . 
The military seems to be reverting to the governing methods - and even the feared security institutions - of former President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s 30-year rule . 
Even Mubarak himself has now been released from prison . The army &apos;s repression of the Muslim Brotherhood is more a question of competition for power than of religion . 
As the only organized force in the country that could seriously challenge the military , the Brotherhood is the greatest threat that the Army faces , as demonstrated by Mohamed Morsi &apos;s victory in the election that made him president a year before he was overthrown . 
And , on top of it all , the problem posed by Iran &apos;s nuclear program remains unresolved . 
That may not be surprising , given the violence and turmoil elsewhere in the region . 
But , since Iran &apos;s new president , Hassan Rouhani , took office at the beginning of August , the West , to put it bluntly , has not demonstrated sufficient will to explore possible openings . 
That is a grave mistake , because progress in the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would create a more propitious climate for resolving the region &apos;s other problems . 
Moreover , the negotiations will now be under the jurisdiction of Iran &apos;s presidential administration , which gives Rouhani greater room for maneuver . 
The new foreign minister , Mohammad Javad Zarif , is well known and respected by the leaders of all of the countries participating in the negotiations , and he will assume important responsibilities in any talks that take place . 
While caution is certainly in order , the importance of Rouhani &apos;s election must be recognized . 
If a window of opportunity has opened , the West should do everything possible to take advantage of it . 
Rouhani , it should be remembered , won a surprising victory in an election with roughly 75 % voter turnout , despite expectations of widespread apathy . 
Rouhani mobilized Iranians by offering a clear program for economic renewal , which hinges on Iran &apos;s engagement with the international community - and thus on progress in nuclear negotiations . 
Since taking office , Rouhani has responded quickly to the Iranian public &apos;s demands . 
His cabinet , in terms of its members &quot; positions on economic reform and international relations , is one that few observers believed he would be capable of assembling . 
Thus , two important steps have been taken : one by the people of Iran , who have shown that they understand the challenges they face , and the other by their new president , who has assembled the best team available to undertake an enormously difficult program . 
There is an expression in Iran that applies to the international community : &quot; You can wake only someone who is sleeping , not someone who is pretending to be asleep . &quot; 
Whether Iran &apos;s international interlocutors act on the importance of Rouhani &apos;s election is a matter of choice , not of ignorance . 
In a Middle East so full of uncertainty , a more predictable Iran - one that behaves like a regionally important state , not a destabilizing Shia movement whose ambitions exceed what international law permits - would be in everyone &apos;s interest . 
There can be no path from the Middle East &apos;s agony without the participation , commitment , and determination of all parties .
