Ethics and Agriculture 
MELBOURNE - Should rich countries - or investors based there - be buying agricultural land in developing countries ? 
That question is raised in Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South , a report issued last year by the Land Matrix Partnership , a consortium of European research institutes and nongovernmental organizations . 
The report shows that since 2000 , investors or state bodies in rich or emerging countries have bought more than 83 million hectares ( more than 200 million acres ) of agricultural land in poorer developing countries . 
This amounts to 1.7 % of the world &apos;s agricultural land . 
Most of these purchases have been made in Africa , with two-thirds taking place in countries where hunger is widespread and institutions for establishing formal land ownership are often weak . 
The purchases in Africa alone amount to an area of agricultural land the size of Kenya . 
It has been claimed that foreign investors are purchasing land that has been left idle ; thus , by bringing it into production , the purchases are increasing the availability of food overall . 
But the Land Matrix Partnership report found that this is not the case : roughly 45 % of the purchases involved existing croplands , and almost a third of the purchased land was forested , indicating that its development may pose risks for biodiversity . 
The investments are both private and public ( for example , by state-owned entities ) and come from three different groups of countries : emerging economies like China , India , Brazil , South Africa , Malaysia , and South Korea ; oil-rich Gulf states ; and wealthy developed economies like the United States and several European countries . 
On average , per capita income in the countries that are the source of these investments is four times higher than in the target countries . 
Most of the investments are aimed at producing food or other crops for export from the countries in which the land is acquired , for the obvious reason that richer countries can pay more for the output . 
More than 40 % of such projects aim to export food to the source country - suggesting that food security is a major reason for buying the land . 
Oxfam International calls some of these deals &quot; land grabs . &quot; 
Its own report , Our Land , Our Lives , indicates that , since 2008 , communities affected by World Bank projects have brought 21 formal complaints alleging violations of their land rights . 
Oxfam , drawing attention to large-scale land acquisitions that have entailed direct rights violations , has called on the Bank to freeze investments in land purchases until it can set standards ensuring that local communities are informed of them in advance , with the option of refusing them . 
Oxfam also wants the Bank to ensure that these land deals do not undermine either local or national food security . 
In response , the World Bank agreed that there are instances of abuse in land acquisition , particularly in developing countries in which governance is weak , and said that it supported more transparent and inclusive participation . 
At the same time , it pointed to the need to increase food production to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive in 2050 , and suggested that more investment in agriculture in developing countries is required to improve productivity . 
The Bank rejected the idea of a moratorium on its own work with investors in agriculture , arguing that this would target precisely those who are most likely to do the right thing . 
One may ask whether transparency and the requirement that local landholders consent to a sale is enough to protect people living in poverty . 
Supporters of free markets will argue that if local landowners wish to sell their land , that is their choice to make . 
But , given the pressures of poverty and the lure of cash , what does it take for people to be able to make a genuinely free and informed choice about selling something as significant as a right to land ? 
After all , we do not allow poor people to sell their kidneys to the highest bidder . 
Of course , hardline supporters of free markets will say that we should . 
But , at the very least , it needs to be explained why people should be prohibited from selling kidneys , but not from selling the land that grows their food . 
Most people can live without one kidney . 
Why does the purchase of body parts give rise to international condemnation , while the purchase of agricultural land does not - even when it involves evicting local landholders and producing food for export to rich countries instead of for local consumption ? 
The World Bank may indeed be more concerned about local landholders &quot; rights than other foreign investors are . 
If so , the 21 complaints made against Bank projects are most likely the visible tip of a vast iceberg of violations of land rights by foreign investors in agricultural projects in developing countries - with the others remaining invisible because victims have no access to any complaint procedure . 
One such case belatedly came to the attention of the United Nations Human Rights Committee . 
In November , the Committee concluded that Germany had failed to police the Neumann Kaffee Gruppe regarding its complicity in the forced eviction of several villages in Uganda to make way for a large coffee plantation . 
But the evictions took place in 2001 , and the villagers are still living in extreme poverty . 
They found no remedy , in either Uganda or Germany , for the violation of rights that , according to the Committee , they possess under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which Germany is a signatory . 
Are we to believe that landholders fare better with Chinese or Saudi investors ?
