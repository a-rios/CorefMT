Preempting Home-Grown Terrorists 
BERLIN - Islamist terrorism has in recent years become central to security policy in Germany and many other Western countries . 
The terrorists &quot; intention is to sow mistrust and stoke fears ; their aim is to weaken the democratic rule of law and to shatter citizens &quot; confidence in public institutions . 
Governments are determined to prevent this , but the reality is that frequent terror alerts tend to increase rather than reduce insecurity among our people . 
The debates across Europe on new security laws to fight terrorism have sometimes created the false image that states threaten rather than protect their citizens &quot; freedom . 
In fact , the often-assumed conflict between freedom and public security does not exist . 
Freedom and public security are not irreconcilable opposites . 
They complement and even depend on each other . 
Public security is a pre-requisite for freedom , and protecting freedom is at the core of a democratic state &apos;s responsibility for public security . 
A state &apos;s monopoly on the use of force is justified if citizens can rely on it to ensure their security . 
The prevention of threats , along with law enforcement that involves prosecuting offenders , are crucial responsibilities , but they do not require , as a matter of principle , ever-newer security laws . 
Of course , security authorities need suitable tools to fight terrorism . 
As terrorists take advantage of new technologies , the legal and technical means used by security authorities must adapt accordingly . 
Prevention is better than repression . 
We should do everything in our power to avoid radicalization , to interrupt radicalization processes early , and to guide radicalized individuals back into our society and to acceptance of our values . 
Yet , in facing a worsening problem of home-grown terrorism , Western countries are often unaware of this radicalization process . 
To intervene effectively , we need to find answers to three questions : Where and how do people radicalize ? 
Why are they attracted to radical ideas ? 
What can we do to counteract it ? 
In Germany , radicalization takes place largely through radical mosque communities or private prayer rooms , as well as through the Internet . 
State surveillance is used as a counter-measure , but it is just as important to work closely with the Muslim population . 
Parents , friends , and imams can spot signs of radicalization earlier than security officials can , and they act responsibly by contacting the relevant state agencies in such cases . 
Security authorities are responsible for monitoring the more visible signs of radicalization , and other state agencies can help potential terrorism recruits to leave extremist environments and become reintegrated into society . 
Nothing , though , can replace support and help within these young peoples &quot; immediate environment . 
The second question - why are some people attracted to radical ideas ? - has been explored by researchers and security practitioners , who generally agree that people are more inclined to accept radical ideologies if they feel alienated . 
This is especially true of young people who have experienced real or even imagined discrimination . 
Lacking attractive social or professional prospects , such young people often seek a new and more welcoming home within a radical group . 
Society &apos;s task is to give them a feeling of belonging . 
Our societies need to engender greater respect and acknowledgement of others , and to acquire more knowledge about different cultures and religions . 
We need to create tightly knit networks of personal relations between the members of different social and religious groups . 
It is equally important that citizens should consider it their duty to commit themselves to the principles of liberal democracy . 
It is everyone &apos;s task to counter extremism actively and speak out about radical statements , in public and in private . 
Muslims have a particular responsibility here . 
Within their communities , or in social frameworks , they have an opportunity that others do not . 
Non-Muslims rarely have much contact with Muslims who are in the process of becoming radicalized , and in any case their arguments would not be well received . 
The United Kingdom and the Netherlands , in particular , have notched up a number of positive civic-engagement projects involving Muslims . 
In Germany , we intend to facilitate and support similar contacts with Muslim groups . 
But Europe and the Western world must also cooperate more closely with key Muslim countries . 
We need Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and the Maghreb countries as partners in the fight against Islamist terrorism , and that means improved operational cooperation between security authorities . 
These countries have a clear interest in maintaining their stability . 
They should be anxious to allow terrorist groups as little room for development as possible . 
At the same time , it is in our interest to obtain from them as much important information about terrorist structures and activities as we can . 
Improved cooperation should not stop there . 
We need to establish an extended dialogue with Muslim countries , particularly those from which immigrants come , and convince them to accept that their own Islamic authorities have a special responsibility in fighting radicalization . 
We need each other , and in many areas we can make a difference only if we act together .
