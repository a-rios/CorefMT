Another European Failure 
JERUSALEM : The European Union has failed once again . 
Its total impotence to prevent war near the heart of Europe was amply proved in Bosnia and Kosovo over the last decade . 
Now the European Union has once again failed to respond to the challenge posed by the Haider phenomenon in Austria . 
By lifting the half-hearted sanctions imposed by the 14 members of the EU on Austria in February , any talk about Europe standing for a community of values sounds even more hollow than ever before . 
In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo , Brussels proved itself to be totally irrelevant and impotent when the use of force - or the threat of the use of force - was concerned . 
Fine words and mellifluous phrases filled many documents - but when Vukovar was destroyed , Dubrovnik shelled , Sarajevo besieged for years and then the horrible mass murders in Srebrenica occurred - all that the European Union was able to muster were more words and self-righteous indignation . 
But then one could argue that the European Union was not a military alliance . 
In the end , it proved that - of all people - Machiavelli was right when he argued that even prophets need to be armed in order to be effective : the moral imperative not to allow another genocide-like development in Europe needed the NATO &apos;s armaments to be effective . 
The European Union continued to produce words . 
When it came to Austria , however , there was a feeling that since this was not a military , but a purely political and moral situation , Brussels - and the Continent-wide political clout signified by it - would be able to prove efficient . 
Alas , it failed as dismally as the League of Nations failed in the l930 &apos;s . 
Let us revisit what the issue was and still is : in the heart of Europe - and in a country burdened by the political ideologies which gave rise to Hitler , himself an Austrian - JÃ¶rg Haider and his party revived the political discourse of xenophobia , racism and visceral anti-foreign sentiment . 
It is true that democracies always find it difficult to balance their commitment to human rights with their commitment to free speech : it is a delicate path to tread , and there is no easy answer on a legal and constitutional level . 
Yet the issue is not legal or constitutional - it is political . 
To preserve democracy and human rights , democratic parties have realized that the most effective ways to confront racist and xenophobic parties is to marginalize and exclude them - to treat them as beyond the pale as potential partners for government . 
The Austrians are right that Haider-like parties exist in many European countries - in Britain , France , even in some Scandinavian countries . 
But in all these countries , the political discourse of all democratic parties ostracized these racist groups and parties : British Conservatives have never entered into an alliance with the British National Front ; the same goes for France , where French conservatives have expelled from their own party local leaders who fashioned municipal alliances with Le Pen &apos;s representatives . 
This is exactly what the Austrian conservative People &apos;s Party under Wolfgang Schuessel did not do . 
Confronted with an election outcome of whether to rejoin the Social Democrats or Haider &apos;s Freedom Party , they made a Faustian pact with Haider . 
There may be good political reasons why another alliance with the Social Democrats was not appealing to Schuessel &apos;s party ( for one , he would not be Chancellor in such a coalition ) . 
But there are basic values which should have overruled such purely tactical considerations and have prevented Schuessel &apos;s party from joining with Haider . 
It is the moral blindness of Schuessel and his party that triggered the response of the 14 members of the EU . 
One could argue that the bilateral sanctions imposed by the 14 on Austria were inadequate and even ineffective . 
This is besides the point : the point is , what is the European Union , committed to democracy and human rights , going to do now ? 
Let us put it bluntly : the continued participation of Haider &apos;s party in a governing coalition in a European country is totally unacceptable . 
The language Haider and many leaders of his party have used over the years is informed by the same racist and anti-Semitic discourse that gave birth to Nazism : in the specific Austrian context , it is violently anti-Slav as well as anti-Turkish . 
While Haider is careful not to say anything which can be construed as anti-Semitic , his praise for the valor and honor of Waffen-SS veterans as well as comments on Nazi concentration camps clearly suggest where his ideological home is . 
Haider and his party deserve to be politically isolated and ostracized . 
The EU countries have failed twice in their attempt to respond to this challenge - once by half-hearted sanctions ; now by lifting them . 
What is Brussels to do ? 
Continue with business-as-usual , churning out document upon document of bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo , perhaps even continue to give free advice to Israelis and Palestinians about how to work out their differences ? 
One wonders what a good European word for chutzpa would be . 
Charity begins at home . 
At a time when the EU is on the verge of an ambitious project of enlargement to include many Slav and other Eastern European nations , to allow a racist and xenophobic party to be in power in Austria - or anywhere else within the EU - is a continued reminder of the moral bankruptcy of the idea of European unification . 
After the l930 &apos;s and l940 &apos;s one would have hoped that European countries would take threats emanating from a kind of language and sentiment expressed by Haider and his party more seriously . 
This is the challenge for European leaders now , and one would hope that under the French Presidency , and with the traditions of the Enlightenment being so central to French and European discourse , a vigorous , efficient response will be found .
