Mourning Becomes Connected 
PALO ALTO - My close friend Kris Olson died last week . 
It wasn &apos;t after a long illness , or even after a car crash . 
She just went to bed at home one night , and was dead when her son tried to wake her in the morning . 
No drama , no long goodbyes , just ... nothing . 
I heard about it two days later from my brother , by e-mail , who heard from a friend of his . 
Then I got a couple of e-mails from other friends , forwarding messages from people I didn &apos;t even know , with a few cc &apos;s to some familiar names . 
I called a friend and got a few sparse details : Kris &apos;s husband was away but had hurried back . 
And no , there was absolutely no warning . 
No health issues , except that a few years back she broke her arm catching a football . 
Until I had these conversations , I didn &apos;t really believe that Kris had died . 
And then there were those confirming e-mails . 
I had seen her just last month : alive and vivid as usual . 
We went to her hairdresser , where she chatted while I had my hair cut . 
We went shopping at the Stanford shopping center , and had soup for lunch , sitting outside in unusually chilly weather because the eateries were crowded . 
She was her usual self : cheerful , full of plans for her children , her bird watching , her consulting work . 
Kris was smart but unpretentious . 
She loved gossip , but she could always forgive a sinner . 
She had worked at Apple in marketing in the early days and had probably told Steve Jobs off a few times . 
It wasn &apos;t until later in the day that I went to her Flickr account to see her photos : http : / / www.flickr.com / photos / kristenolson / . I was struck by the next to last : http : / / www.flickr.com / photos / kristenolson / 4241087527 / - a bird flying free , in sharp focus against a fuzzy backdrop of sea and sky . 
But that wasn &apos;t Kris , fleeing some kind of sad life . 
There was a better one : http : / / www.flickr.com / photos / kristenolson / 4241806180 - a sharp-eyed red-shouldered hawk , solid and sturdy , gazing balefully at the camera . 
Sensible , kind , but no pushover . 
Then I went to Kris &apos;s Facebook page , and started crying . 
Her Flickr feed is her art , a sort of memorial , but her Facebook page is her life . 
People have come to pay tribute . 
Our friendship had existed since 1982 and continued outside of Facebook ; 
I don &apos;t think I saw her page more than once or twice since we &quot; befriended &quot; one another a few years ago . 
We communicated by e-mail , but mostly face-to-face a few times a year , ever since we met . You wouldn &apos;t have guessed from Facebook that , while she knew a lot of industry people , she wasn &apos;t overly impressed with the &quot; important &quot; ones . 
She wasn &apos;t unkind ; she was just observant . 
So what does Facebook mean in the face of death ? 
Genes are one way for a person to live on : You can see shadows or glimpses of anyone in their children and other relatives . 
Their creations - whether diaries or Flickr photos , a hand-crafted cabinet or cheesecake recipes - are another way . 
But perhaps our most meaningful creations are the thoughts and changes that we leave in other people . 
These traces used to disperse and disappear over time after someone &apos;s death . 
Kris knew lots of people , in many different contexts , and now they are sharing memories on her page . 
Now memories of Kris remain alive and accessible from anywhere . 
Indeed , Kris will live on much more effectively - and more accessibly to all her friends . 
Through her , they may meet one another , or they may simply be able to recall her for themselves , even as they find out new things about her that they neglected to discover while she was alive . 
Yes , it does sharpen the memories , even as it eases the pain .
