China Adjusts 
BAHRAIN - China watchers are waiting to see whether the country has engineered a soft landing , cooling down an overheating economy and achieving a more sustainable rate of growth , or whether Asia &apos;s dragon will crash to earth , as others in the neighborhood have before it . 
But some , particularly American politicians in this presidential election year , focus on only one thing : China &apos;s trade balance . 
True , not long ago the renminbi was substantially undervalued , and China &apos;s trade surpluses were very large . 
That situation is changing . 
Forces of adjustment are at work in the Chinese economy , so foreign perceptions need to adjust as well . 
China &apos;s trade surplus peaked at $ 300 billion in 2008 , and has been declining ever since . 
( Indeed , official data showed a $ 31 billion deficit in February , the largest since 1998 . ) 
It is clear what has happened . 
Ever since China rejoined the global economy three decades ago , its trading partners have been snapping up its manufacturing exports , because low Chinese wages made them super-competitive . 
But , in recent years , relative prices have adjusted . 
The change can be measured by real exchange-rate appreciation , which consists partly in nominal renminbi appreciation against the dollar , and partly in Chinese inflation . 
China &apos;s government should have let more of the real appreciation take the form of nominal appreciation ( dollars per renminbi ) . 
But , because it did not , it has shown up as inflation instead . 
The natural price-adjustment process was delayed . 
First , the authorities intervened in 1995-2005 , and again in 2008-2010 , to keep the dollar exchange rate virtually fixed . 
Second , workers in China &apos;s increasingly productive coastal factories were not paid their full value ( the economy has not completed its transition from Mao to market , after all ) . 
As a result , China continued to undersell the world . 
But then the renminbi was finally allowed to appreciate against the dollar - by about 25 % cumulatively during 2005-2008 and 2010-2011 . 
Moreover labor shortages began to appear , and Chinese workers began to win rapid wage increases . 
Beijing , Shenzhen , and Shanghai raised their minimum wages sharply in the last three years - by 22 % on average in 2010 and 2011 . 
Meanwhile another cost of business , land prices , rose even more rapidly . 
As costs rise in China &apos;s coastal provinces , several types of adjustment are taking place . 
Some manufacturing is migrating inland , where wages and land prices are still relatively low , and some export operations are shifting to countries like Vietnam , where they are lower still . 
Moreover , Chinese companies are beginning to automate , substituting capital for labor , and are producing more sophisticated goods , following the path blazed by Japan , Korea , and other Asian countries in the &quot; flying geese &quot; formation . 
Finally , multinational companies that had moved some operations to China from the United States or other high-wage countries are now moving back . 
Productivity is still higher in the US , after all . 
None of this is news to most international observers of China . 
But many Western politicians ( and , to be fair , their constituents ) are unable to let go of the syllogism that seemed so unassailable just a decade ago : ( 1 ) The Chinese have joined the world economy ; ( 2 ) their wages are $ 0.50 an hour ; ( 3 ) there are a billion of them ; and ( 4 ) Chinese wages will never be bid up in line with the usual textbook laws of economics , so their exports will rise without limit . 
But it turns out that the basic laws of economics eventually apply after all - even in China . 
Like certain other aspects of the US-China economic relationship , China &apos;s adjustment is reminiscent of Japan with a 30-year lag . 
Japan &apos;s trade balance fell into deficit in 2011 , for the first time since 1980 . 
Special factors have played a role in the last year , including high oil prices and the effects of the March 2011 tsunami . 
But the downward trend in the trade balance is clear . 
Even the current account showed a deficit in January . 
This development has received relatively little attention in the US and other trading partners , which is curious , given that , two decades ago , Japan &apos;s big trade surplus was the subject of intense focus and worry - just like China &apos;s now . 
At the time , some influential commentators warned that the Japanese had discovered a superior economic model , featuring strategic trade policy ( among other attractions ) , and that the rest of us had better emulate them . 
Either that , or the Japanese were &quot; cheating , &quot; in which case we needed to stop them . 
Most economists rejected these &quot; revisionist &quot; views , and argued that Japan &apos;s current-account surplus was large because its national saving rate was high , which reflected demographics , not cultural differences or government policies . 
The Japanese population was relatively young , compared to other advanced economies , but was rapidly aging , owing to a declining birth rate since the 1940 &quot; s and rising longevity . 
That view has been vindicated . 
In 1980 , 9 % of Japan &apos;s population was 65 or older ; now the ratio is more than 23 % , one of the highest in the world . 
As a consequence , Japanese citizens who 30 years ago were saving for their retirement are now dissaving , precisely as economic theory predicted . 
As the national saving rate has come down , so has the current-account surplus . 
China faces a similar demographic trend , and also a push to unleash household consumption in order to sustain GDP growth . 
As in Japan , the downward trend in China &apos;s saving rate will show up in its current account . 
The laws of international economics still apply .
