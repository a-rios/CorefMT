Governments &quot; Self-Disruption Challenge 
LAGUNA BEACH - One of the most difficult challenges facing Western governments today is to enable and channel the transformative - and , for individuals and companies , self-empowering - forces of technological innovation . 
They will not succeed unless they become more open to creative destruction , allowing not only tools and procedures , but also mindsets , to be revamped and upgraded . 
The longer it takes them to meet this challenge , the bigger the lost opportunities for current and future generations . 
Self-empowering technological innovation is all around us , affecting a growing number of people , sectors , and activities worldwide . 
Through an ever-increasing number of platforms , it is now easier than ever for households and corporations to access and engage in an expanding range of activities - from urban transportation to accommodation , entertainment , and media . 
Even the regulation-reinforced , fortress-like walls that have traditionally surrounded finance and medicine are being eroded . 
This historic transformation will continue to gain momentum as it expands in both scale and scope . 
But its benefits will not be fully realized unless governments take steps to empower the forces of change , ensure that the massive positive externalities are internalized , and minimize the negative impacts . 
Unfortunately , this is proving extremely difficult for many advanced-country governments , partly because the failure to recover fully from the recent crisis and recession has undermined their credibility and functioning . 
The emergence of anti-establishment and non-traditional political parties and candidates on both sides of the Atlantic is complicating even the most basic elements of economic governance , such as enactment of an active budget in the United States . 
In this context , taking the steps needed to upgrade economic systems , including infrastructure in the US and the incomplete union in Europe , or to meet historical challenges like the refugee crisis , seems all but impossible . 
In fact , Western political and economic structures are , in some ways , specifically designed to resist deep and rapid change , if only to prevent temporary and reversible fluctuations from having an undue influence on underlying systems . 
This works well when politics and economies are operating in cyclical mode , as they usually have been in the West . 
But when major structural and secular challenges arise , as is the case today , the advanced countries &quot; institutional architecture acts as a major obstacle to effective action . 
The political influence of financial donors and lobby groups add to the challenge . 
Rather than promoting actions aimed at improving the long-term wellbeing of the system as a whole , these actors tend to push micro objectives , some of which help the traditional , often wealthy elements of the establishment maintain their grip on the system . 
In doing so , they block the small and emerging players that are so vital to upgrading and transformation . 
All of this serves to complicate an imperative that is relevant not just to governments , but also to companies and individuals that must adapt to changing circumstances by upgrading their structures , procedures , skills , and mindsets . 
Few are eager to self-disrupt , a process that takes us out of our comfort zone , forcing us to confront our long-standing blind spots and unconscious biases and adopt a new mindset . 
But those who wait until the disruptions are unavoidable - easy to do when governments do not mount a timely response - will miss out on the huge advantages that technology offers . 
Even when governments decide to implement policies that enable economic upgrading and adaptation , they cannot do so in isolation . 
With technology enabling unprecedented mobility and connectivity , the jurisdictional power of nation-states is being eroded , meaning that a truly effective response - one that unleashes the full benefits of disruptive technologies - is impossible without multilateral cooperation and coordination . 
But multilateralism is undergoing a transformation of its own , driven by doubts about the legitimacy of existing structures . 
With reforms of the traditionally Western-dominated institutions having stalled , there have been moves to create alternatives ; 
All of this makes global-level responses more difficult . 
Against this background , a rapid and comprehensive transformation is clearly not feasible . 
( In fact , it may not even be desirable , given the possibility of collateral damage and unintended consequences . ) 
The best option for Western governments is thus to pursue gradual change , propelled by a variety of adaptive instruments , which would reach a critical mass over time . 
Such tools include well-designed public-private partnerships , especially when it comes to modernizing infrastructure ; disruptive outside advisers - selected not for what they think , but for how they think - in the government decision-making process ; mechanisms to strengthen inter-agency coordination so that it enhances , rather than retards , policy responsiveness ; and broader cross-border private-sector linkages to enhance multilateral coordination . 
How economies function is changing , as relative power shifts from established , centralized forces toward those that respond to the unprecedented empowerment of individuals . 
If governments are to overcome the challenges they face and maximize the benefits of this shift for their societies , they need to be a lot more open to self-disruption . 
Otherwise , the transformative forces will leave them and their citizens behind .
