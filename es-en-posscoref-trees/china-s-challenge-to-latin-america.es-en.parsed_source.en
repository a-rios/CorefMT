China \ u0027s Challenge to Latin America 
Relations between China and Latin America and the Caribbean are paradoxical . 
While bilateral trade has increased and diplomatic relations have strengthened in the past few years , a lack of knowledge persists between the two regions , and in some cases tensions are growing . 
Hardly any major projects between China and Latin America have been initiated by the private , public , or academic sectors , and bilateral institutions do not yet reflect the weight of economic dynamics . 
There are two aspects to this paradox . 
First , many Chinese enterprises - particularly in basic-goods sectors such as soy , meat , iron , steel , copper , and oil - have initiated activities in Latin America , either through direct investment or by buying products and / or businesses . 
To a lesser degree , Latin American enterprises - such as Gruma , Modelo , Embraer , Marco Polo , and Embraco - have successfully introduced themselves in China . 
Even so , Latin America remains a secondary economic and commercial partner for China . 
In 2006 , Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for 3.7 % of China &apos;s exports and 4.3 % of its imports . 
But bilateral trade has been growing at impressive rates , with Chinese exports and imports up by 24.8 % and 23.9 % , respectively , from 1995 to 2006 . 
Indeed , for practically all of Latin America &apos;s countries , China is one of the ten main trade partners - and already in second place in several - with rates of growth well above total trade . 
Even in the Caribbean and Central American countries - several of which do not have diplomatic relations with China - commerce has been prolific . 
Second , China &apos;s large-scale penetration of the United States and European Union markets has , in many cases , displaced Asian and Latin American competitors . 
In the case of the US , for example , Latin America &apos;s share of total imports , at roughly 17 % , has not grown since 2000 . 
In fact , major producers like Argentina , Brazil , and Mexico have seen their participation in US imports decrease , whereas China &apos;s increased to 16 % 2006 , from 3 % in 1990 . 
China represents a strong ideological challenge for the region , particularly for the status quo of economic policy promoted by the majority of multilateral institutions since the 1980 &quot; s . 
China would seem to fit the profile of &quot; the worst student who got the best job , &quot; with its GDP per capita growing - under &quot; ideologically erroneous &quot; conditions - 17.3 times faster than in Latin America from 1980 to 2005 . 
Contrary to most of Latin America , China &apos;s public sector is omnipresent , exercised through direct ownership or control of incentives in the private sectors . 
Nor has it liberalized labor and product markets , and it maintains strict control over the exchange rate and capital account . 
Likewise , it develops five-year plans -and in many cases , such as in science and technology , plans that exceed 15 years . 
Even so , with its cheaper labor force and faster technological growth , China has attained higher export competitiveness than Latin America , several of which it has displaced in key sectors , such as thread and dry goods manufacturing , electronics , and furniture , since 2000 . 
Whereas China exports manufactured products with an increasing level of technological inputs , Latin America continues to export basic goods with a minimum of added value . 
China represents a massive challenge even for countries , such as Brazil , that have achieved a significant trade surplus up to now . 
So dividing Latin American countries into &quot; winners &quot; and &quot; losers &quot; makes no sense . 
Aside from importing basic goods , China exports manufactured goods throughout the region . 
According to the Brazil-China Business Council , Brazil will have its first trade deficit with China in 2007 , despite growth exports of minerals and agricultural products . 
Central America and Mexico have been running bilateral deficits for years , with Mexico &apos;s import / export ratio in 2006 at 16 : 1 . 
Latin American countries would thus benefit from an open , non-ideological , and critical analysis of development experiences in the past few decades . 
They also need an effective rapprochement - going beyond diplomacy - that implies greater investment in bilateral institutions . 
Otherwise , relations between China and Latin America will be far from harmonious , even as their significance continues to grow .
