Veiled Sexuality 
NEW YORK -A woman swathed in black to her ankles , wearing a headscarf or a full chador , walks down a European or North American street , surrounded by other women in halter tops , miniskirts and short shorts . 
She passes under immense billboards on which other women swoon in sexual ecstasy , cavort in lingerie or simply stretch out languorously , almost fully naked . 
Could this image be any more iconic of the discomfort the West has with the social mores of Islam , and vice versa ? 
Ideological battles are often waged with women &apos;s bodies as their emblems , and Western Islamophobia is no exception . 
When France banned headscarves in schools , it used the hijab as a proxy for Western values in general , including the appropriate status of women . 
When Americans were being prepared for the invasion of Afghanistan , the Taliban were demonized for denying cosmetics and hair color to women ; when the Taliban were overthrown , Western writers often noted that women had taken off their scarves . 
But are we in the West radically misinterpreting Muslim sexual mores , particularly the meaning to many Muslim women of being veiled or wearing the chador ? 
And are we blind to our own markers of the oppression and control of women ? 
The West interprets veiling as repression of women and suppression of their sexuality . 
It is not that Islam suppresses sexuality , but that it embodies a strongly developed sense of its appropriate channeling - toward marriage , the bonds that sustain family life , and the attachment that secures a home . 
But inside , women were as interested in allure , seduction , and pleasure as women anywhere in the world . 
At home , in the context of marital intimacy , Victoria &apos;s Secret , elegant fashion , and skin care lotions abounded . 
The bridal videos that I was shown , with the sensuous dancing that the bride learns as part of what makes her a wonderful wife , and which she proudly displays for her bridegroom , suggested that sensuality was not alien to Muslim women . 
Indeed , many Muslim women I spoke with did not feel at all subjugated by the chador or the headscarf . 
On the contrary , they felt liberated from what they experienced as the intrusive , commodifying , basely sexualizing Western gaze . 
Many women said something like this : &quot; When I wear Western clothes , men stare at me , objectify me , or I am always measuring myself against the standards of models in magazines , which are hard to live up to - and even harder as you get older , not to mention how tiring it can be to be on display all the time . 
When I wear my headscarf or chador , people relate to me as an individual , not an object ; 
I feel respected . &quot; 
I experienced it myself . 
I put on a shalwar kameez and a headscarf in Morocco for a trip to the bazaar . 
Yes , some of the warmth I encountered was probably from the novelty of seeing a Westerner so clothed ; but , as I moved about the market - the curve of my breasts covered , the shape of my legs obscured , my long hair not flying about me - I felt a novel sense of calm and serenity . 
I felt , yes , in certain ways , free . 
Nor are Muslim women alone . 
The Western Christian tradition portrays all sexuality , even married sexuality , as sinful . 
Islam and Judaism never had that same kind of mind-body split . 
So , in both cultures , sexuality channeled into marriage and family life is seen as a source of great blessing , sanctioned by God . 
This may explain why both Muslim and orthodox Jewish women not only describe a sense of being liberated by their modest clothing and covered hair , but also express much higher levels of sensual joy in their married lives than is common in the West . 
When sexuality is kept private and directed in ways seen as sacred - and when one &apos;s husband isn &apos;t seeing his wife ( or other women ) half-naked all day long - one can feel great power and intensity when the headscarf or the chador comes off in the sanctity of the home . 
Among healthy young men in the West , who grow up on pornography and sexual imagery on every street corner , reduced libido is a growing epidemic , so it is easy to imagine the power that sexuality can still carry in a more modest culture . 
I do not mean to dismiss the many women leaders in the Muslim world who regard veiling as a means of controlling women . 
But Westerners should recognize that when a woman in France or Britain chooses a veil , it is not necessarily a sign of her repression .
