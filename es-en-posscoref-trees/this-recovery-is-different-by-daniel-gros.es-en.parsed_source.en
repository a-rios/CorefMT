This Recovery is Different 
BRUSSELS - The misguided belief that &quot; this time is different &quot; led policymakers to permit the credit boom of the early 2000 &quot; s to continue for too long , thus preparing the ground for the biggest financial crisis in living memory . 
But now , when it comes to recovery , the belief that this time should not be different might be equally dangerous . 
Many policymakers and economists have observed that the recovery from the 2007-2008 financial crisis has been much slower than most recoveries of the post-war era , which needed only a little more than a year , on average , to restore output and employment to their previous levels . 
By this standard , the current recovery is unacceptably slow , with both output and employment still below the previous peak . 
Policymakers thus feel justified in using all available macroeconomic levers to achieve a recovery that resembles those of the past . 
In doing so , officials are reluctant to take into account that the recent crisis resulted from an unprecedented credit boom gone bust . 
To some extent , it should have been logical to expect an unprecedented upturn as well . 
When the crisis erupted , many hoped for a V-shaped recovery , notwithstanding a substantial body of research showing that recoveries from recessions caused by a financial crisis tend to be weaker and slower than recoveries from &quot; normal &quot; recessions . 
The observation that recoveries following a financial crisis are different suggests that standard macroeconomic policies might not work as one would usually expect . 
And a transatlantic comparison suggests that this may indeed be the case . 
One would expect that the shock from the financial crisis should be comparable for the United States and the eurozone , given that they are of similar size , exhibit a similar degree of internal diversity , and experienced a similar increase in house prices ( on average ) in the years preceding the bust . 
Moreover , the relative increase in debt ( leverage ) in the financial system was similar on both sides of the Atlantic . 
And , indeed , US economic performance has been very similar to that of the eurozone since the start of the crisis : GDP per capita today is still about 2 % below the 2007 level on both sides of the Atlantic . 
The unemployment rate in the US and the eurozone has increased by about the same amount as well - three percentage points . 
Of course , one can point to particular countries in Europe that are mired in recession . 
But the US also has depressed areas . 
For Ireland and Spain , read Nevada and California ( and , for Greece , read Puerto Rico ) . 
The proper comparison is thus between the average of two continental-sized economies , both of which are characterized by considerable internal diversity . 
These similarities in economic performance are striking , given that macroeconomic policy in the US and the eurozone has been so different . 
The US let its fiscal deficit rise above 10 % of GDP , compared to less than 6 % of GDP in the eurozone . 
Measured over a five-year period ( 2007-2012 ) , the US has thus not done any better than the eurozone , although it has relied on a much larger dose of fiscal expansion . 
In the US ( and the United Kingdom ) , the general government deficit today is still around 8 % of GDP , compared to a little more than 3 % of GDP in the eurozone , and the US debt / GDP ratio has increased by more than 41 percentage points , compared to &quot; only &quot; 25 points in the eurozone . 
In fact , the economy that has imbibed the strongest dose of expansionary policy has recovered less : GDP per capita in the UK today is still 6 % below the 2007 level . 
Of course , one could argue that the UK was particularly exposed to the bust , because financial services make up a large part of its GDP . 
But the fact remains that its economy , supposedly the most flexible in Europe , has not recovered from the shock five years later , despite massive fiscal and monetary stimulus , coupled with a substantial devaluation . 
On balance , it thus seems that this time - or , rather , this post-crisis environment - really is different , and that macroeconomic policies have done little to improve matters . 
Countries like the US and the UK , which are accumulating debt at a record pace , are betting that deficit spending will eventually pay off in a stronger economy . 
But they risk ending up with debt / GDP ratios north of 100 % , which would leave them at the mercy of financial markets should sentiment turn against them . 
History suggests that interest rates will not remain at record-low levels indefinitely , and that when change comes , it might be abrupt . 
Why should we expect this time to be different ?
