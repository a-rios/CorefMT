Anti-Americanism and Europe \ u0027s Identity 
The question of how the international community should deal with Saddam Hussein , Iraq &apos;s ruthless dictator , is rightly the year &apos;s dominant theme . 
In one sense it has been answered : the United Nations is and will continue to be involved , and the United States has and will continue to play the leading role . 
Containment of Iraq by intervention is the method that now seems most likely . 
In the process of reaching this decision , however , several long simmering issues have come to the fore . 
One , of course , concerns the supposed &quot; clash of civilisations &quot; : how do we keep a focused and limited conflict between the UN and Iraq distinct from the need to maintain a relationship of dialogue between world religions ? 
Another question may seem more parochial to some but is of equal significance globally : what are we to make of the differences between Europe and America that have become so manifest in the Iraq debate ? 
Is this its own form of &quot; clashing civilizations . &quot; 
No doubt , the differences that now exist between America and Europe are profound , and are not confined to a temporary cooling of German-American relations or to a half-serious exchange of invectives about &quot; gun-slinging America &quot; and &quot; old Europe . &quot; 
Indeed , even intellectuals are caught up in the emotional undertones . 
When the British historian Timothy Garton Ash , writing in the New York Review of Books , distinguished the US and Europe by paraphrasing the title of a bestselling book , saying that &quot; Americans are from Mars , Europeans are from Venus , &quot; some American readers objected to the sexual portrayal of an effiminate Europe and a macho America . 
Yet Garton Ash is among the most pro-American Europeans , whose views of a united Europe are closer to those of his many friends in the &quot; new , &quot; postcommunist Europe than to those of France or Germany . 
But views about what Europe is and should be are actually at the heart of today &apos;s anti-Americanism . 
The countries of Europe are moving inexorably towards the &quot; ever closer union &quot; that the founding Treaty of Rome demands . 
There is a single market , crowned - at least for most EU members - by a single currency ; there is a constitutional convention that will propose a new basic treaty , perhaps by mid-June ; there are ambitious plans for a common foreign and security policy and other common policies . 
So what is the problem ? 
One problem - probably the most fundamental - is that European integration no longer fires the imagination of Europeans . 
There are still Euro-enthusiasts , but among the peoples of Europe indifference and , in some places , mild hostility , prevails . 
Even the common currency has so far not really caught on ; it is useful , but somehow &quot; foreign . &quot; 
Underneath all this is the niggling question : why are we doing all this ? 
What is the compelling reason that provides the driving force behind &quot; ever closer union &quot; ? 
In the 1950s , the answer was simple : Europeans should never go to war against each other again . 
On the contrary , they need to stand together against the Communist threat . 
Fifty years later , these goals are no longer relevant . 
Economic union has benefited many ; but it is not the type of driving force that inspires . 
More recently , the idea of a &quot; European identity &quot; has been in vogue . 
The EU supposedly expresses it . 
But how is this identity to be defined ? 
This is the point at which many begin to use language that defines Europe by distinction , indeed by contrast , to the US - Europe as the anti-America . 
Throughout the Cold War , what was then the Soviet Union provided a 
Comparing and contrasting the two sides of the Atlantic has a long pedigree , of course . 
European culture and American commerce , European profundity and American materialism - these are ancient and tired themes . 
Most would today use more subtle language . 
They point to what they regard as America &apos;s unfettered capitalism and hold up Europe &apos;s social market economies against it . 
Internationally , Europe likes multilateral arrangements , whereas America prefers to go it alone . 
From the other stereotypical point-of-view , Europe wallows in the complexity of issues whereas America likes simple lines of conflict - you are either for us or against us . 
It is easy to see how the belief in such differences affects the Iraq debate . 
The result is that many leading Europeans begin to define their intentions for the Union by contrasting it to the USA . 
The euro must hold its own against the dollar - and hurrah !  - it is now above parity . 
European foreign policy must provide a counterweight to that of the hyperpower across the Atlantic . 
On closer scrutiny , such facile phrases are deeply disturbing . 
The eight ( and now nine or more ) governments that signed the Aznar / Berlusconi / Blair statement supporting the US realized this . 
They insisted on undivided Western values , the values of enlightenment and liberty . 
These values are shared between Europe and America - and some others - and they are worth defending in an alliance . 
When it comes to values , any attempt to divide the American and the European traditions is misguided . 
It may be that these shared values make it more difficult to find the much-desired European identity . 
But feeding anti-American sentiment , however unintentionally , into the European construction would be intellectually dishonest , morally suspect , and politically dangerous for all freedom-loving Europeans .
