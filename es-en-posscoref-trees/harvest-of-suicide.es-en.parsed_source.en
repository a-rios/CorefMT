Harvest of Suicide 
NEW DELHI - An epidemic of farmers &quot; suicides has spread across four Indian states - Maharashtra , Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , and Punjab - over the last decade . 
According to official data , more than 160,000 farmers have committed suicide in India since 1997 . 
These suicides are most frequent where farmers grow cotton , and appear directly linked to the presence of seed monopolies . 
For the supply of cotton seeds in India has increasingly slipped out of the hands of farmers and into the hands of global seed producers like Monsanto . 
These giant corporations have begun to control local seed companies through buyouts , joint ventures , and licensing arrangements , leading to seed monopolies . 
When this happens , seed is transformed from being a common good into being the &quot; intellectual property &quot; of companies such as Monsanto , for which the corporation can claim limitless profits through royalty payments . 
For farmers , this means deeper debt . 
Seed is also transformed in this way from being a renewable regenerative resource into a non-renewable resource and commodity . 
Seed scarcity is directly caused by seed monopolies , which have as their ultimate weapon a &quot; terminator &quot; seed that is engineered for sterility . 
This means that farmers can &apos;t renew their own supply but must return to the monopolist for new seed each planting season . 
For farmers , this means higher costs ; for seed corporations , higher profits . 
The creation of seed monopolies is based on the deregulation of seed corporations , including giving them oversight over bio-safety . 
With the coming of globalization , seed companies were allowed to sell seeds for which the companies had certified their safety . In the case of genetically engineered seed , these companies are again seeking self-regulation for bio-safety . 
State regulation does continue to exist where seeds are concerned , but nowadays it is aimed at farmers , who are being pushed into dependency on patented , corporate seed . 
Such compulsory licensing is a big cause of the global destruction of biodiversity . 
The creation of seed monopolies , and with them crushing debts to a new species of moneylender - the agents of the seed and chemical companies - has taken a high human toll as well . 
The farm suicides first started in the district of Warangal in Andhra Pradesh . 
Peasants in Warangal used to grow millets , pulses , and oilseeds . 
Overnight , Warangal was converted to a cotton-growing district based on non-renewable hybrids that require irrigation and are prone to pest attacks . 
Small peasants without capital were trapped in a vicious cycle of debt . 
Some saw only one way out . 
This was a period when Monsanto and its Indian partner , Mahyco , were also carrying out illegal field experiments with genetically engineered Bt cotton . 
All imports and field trials of genetically engineered organisms in India are governed by a provision of the Environment Protection Act called the &quot; Rules for the Manufacture Use , Import , Export , and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms , Genetically Engineered Organisms , or Cells . &quot; 
We at the Research Foundation for Science , Technology , and Ecology used the law to stop Monsanto &apos;s commercialization of Bt cotton in 1999 , which is why approval was not granted for commercial sales until 2002 . 
Rising production costs and falling prices for their products is a recipe for indebtedness , and debt is the main cause of farmers &quot; suicides . 
This is why the suicides are most prevalent in the cotton belt on which the seed industries &quot; claim is rapidly becoming a stranglehold . 
At the start , the technology for engineering Bt genes into cotton was aimed primarily at controlling pests . 
However , new pests have emerged in Bt cotton , leading to higher use of pesticides . 
In the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra , which has the highest number of suicides , the area under Bt cotton has increased from 0.2 million hectares in 2004 to 2.88 million hectares in 2007 . 
The cost of pesticides for farmers has increased 13-fold in the same period . 
A pest control technology that fails to control pests might be good for seed corporations that are also agrichemical corporations . 
For farmers , it translates into suicide . 
Technologies are tools . 
When the tool fails , it needs to be replaced . 
Bt cotton technology has failed to control pests or secure farmers lives and livelihoods . 
It is time to replace GM technology with ecological farming . 
It is time to stop the killing .
