Latin America &apos;s Tale of Two Crises 
MEXICO CITY - If one were an irredeemable optimist , upcoming events in Venezuela and Colombia could be viewed as a harbinger of good things to come . 
In Venezuela , the October 7 presidential election may put an end to Hugo Chávez &apos;s 14 years in power , along with his systematic destruction of the economy , media clampdowns , and endless meddling in other countries &quot; affairs . 
In Colombia , peace talks scheduled for October 8 in Norway between President Juan Manuel Santos &apos;s government and the FARC guerrillas may bring an end to 40 years of war and bloodshed . 
Unfortunately , neither of these outcomes is likely . 
In both cases , what seems desirable appears highly improbable . 
Chávez has participated directly in four Venezuelan elections : in 1998 , when he was elected for the first time ; in 2004 , when the opposition forced a recall vote ; in 2006 , when he was re-elected ; and now , as he recovers from cancer and the country is in the midst of a huge public-safety crisis that has made Caracas one of the most dangerous cities in the world . 
Chávez won the first three , and , for several reasons , seems poised to win again . 
For starters , Chávez is a formidable campaigner , and he has at his disposal every available lever of state power , from the Electoral Council to PDVSA , the national oil company . 
As skillful as Henrique Capriles Radonski , the opposition candidate , may be , the playing field is so uneven that he appears to stand little chance . 
One example : Venezuela &apos;s overall population has grown 14 % over the past 13 years , but electoral rolls have jumped 53 % ; the new voters can be ghosts , Colombians , or several generations of chavista supporters already registered to vote , even before they are born . 
Most polls give Chávez a significant advantage ( of up to 15 percentage points ) , but nonetheless offer a glimmer of hope to the opposition . 
Many of the more impartial polling firms , such as Luis Christiansen &apos;s Consultores 21 , Varianzas , and Keller , all show a surprisingly large proportion of undecided voters - those who do not answer or do not know for whom they will vote . 
In highly polarized and politicized Venezuela , it is unlikely that upward of 20 % of voters have yet to decide what they will do . 
Consequently , some analysts suspect a &quot; hidden opposition vote , &quot; such as occurred in Nicaragua in 1990 , when Violeta Chamorrro won the presidency , or in Mexico in 2000 , when Vicente Fox emerged victorious . 
According to this logic , the &quot; undecided &quot; are actually leaning toward Capriles , and if their number is larger than Chávez &apos;s margin in the polls , the caudillo will lose . 
That is not impossible , but it is unlikely , especially if Chávez can count on several percentage points of tampered votes before and after the polling booths close . 
Despite the president &apos;s illness , the enormous problems facing Venezuela , and fatigue after 13 years of chavismo , it is still Chávez &apos;s election to lose . 
The status quo will also likely persist in Colombia . 
No one knows exactly when Santos decided to seek new negotiations with Latin America &apos;s oldest - and one of its most vicious - guerrilla groups ; nor do any but his closest aides know how many meetings have already taken place , where and when , or what happened . 
But much evidence suggests that most of the process began some time ago , and was meant to be kept secret until broad agreement had been reached on most of the outstanding issues . 
Santos probably wanted to have the talks viewed as a relatively unconditional surrender and disarmament by the &quot; narco-guerrillas . &quot; 
He would have wanted to avoid the grandstanding and propaganda generally associated with public negotiations . 
So the talks may have been revealed not because they had advanced sufficiently , but because someone wanted to sabotage them . 
Who could that be ? 
The predictable suspect is former Colombian president Álvaro Uribe . 
Although Santos was both Uribe &apos;s defense minister and preferred successor , relations between the two have soured . 
The bottom line is that Uribe thought Santos would do his bidding as president , and Santos is convinced that his ( high but declining ) popularity is of his own making , not borrowed from Uribe . 
These strains express themselves on policy issues . 
Uribe criticizes Santos - through up to 40 tweets per day to his more than one million followers - for repudiating his &quot; democratic security &quot; stance , for the growth of the &quot; Bacrim &quot; ( petty-crime gangs ) , for appeasing Colombia &apos;s two hostile neighbors , Venezuela and Ecuador , and for prosecuting some of his aides on corruption charges . 
Santos says nothing , but replies in kind : making peace with Chávez and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa , prosecuting human rights violations under Uribe , and arresting several of his allegedly corrupt officials . 
And now , seemingly out of the blue , he has defied and even offended Uribe by undertaking negotiations with the despised FARC , after having delivered such devastating military blows to them that perhaps , this time around , the peace process will prosper . 
One can see why Uribe would threaten to leak news about the negotiations , as well as why Santos would try to preempt the leaks by going public and having them take place in the open ( the talks will begin in Oslo , but will be pursued in Havana ) . 
The problem is that , although there are good examples of publicized - if not public - peace talks that have succeeded , there are more instances of failure or indefinite stalemate , owing to the pressure of working under the glare of the international spotlight . 
As a fervent supporter of Santos &apos;s human-rights efforts , of his call for a major debate on drug legalization , and of his attempt to end Colombia &apos;s &quot; Forty Years &quot; War , &quot; I fear that Uribe has fatally wounded the peace process , and will prolong the country &apos;s bloody and fruitless status quo indefinitely . 
That is a great pity . 
So , in this tale of two South American neighbors , unfortunately , little will change - unless , as so often happens , the unexpected suddenly becomes inevitable , in which case all bets are off .
