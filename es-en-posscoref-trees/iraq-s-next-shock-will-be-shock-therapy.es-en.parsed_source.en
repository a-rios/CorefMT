Iraq \ u0027s Next Shock Will be Shock Therapy 
With one exception - the actual military &quot; victory , &quot; which looks increasingly Pyrrhic - President Bush &apos;s Iraqi adventure has been marked by repeated failures . 
Scant signs of weapons of mass destruction have been found , and , according to David Kay , America &apos;s chief arms inspector , the stockpiles either never existed or were destroyed years ago . 
So Bush simply ignored the data , gathered by Hans Blix &apos;s UN inspectors , and the evidence on which he based his case for war seems to have been largely fabricated . 
Worse still , it is now clear that Bush never had a plan for when the war ended . 
Instead of moving towards peace and democracy , the situation in Iraq remains so dangerous that Paul Bremer , the American occupation leader , is using instability as his rationale for avoiding democratic elections this year . 
Of course , America tried to keep real order in some places , revealing a lot about what it truly valued in Iraq . 
When Baghdad fell , the oil ministry was quickly protected , while museums and hospitals were allowed to be looted . 
If there was not outright corruption in the $ 7 billion in contracts awarded to Halliburton , whose former chairman was Vice President Dick Cheney , there was undoubtedly a strong whiff of crony capitalism . 
Halliburton and its subsidiaries have been ensnared in charges of war profiteering ever since , and have had to pay back millions of dollars to the US government . 
Now , everyone agrees , the most important task - beyond creating a democratic state and restoring security - is reconstructing the economy . 
Blinded by ideology , however , the Bush administration seems determined to continue its record of dismal failures by ignoring past experience . 
When the Berlin Wall fell , the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union began transitions to a market economy , with heated debates over how this should be accomplished . 
One choice was shock therapy - quick privatization of state-owned assets and abrupt liberalization of trade , prices , and capital flows - while the other was gradual market liberalization to allow for the rule of law to be established at the same time . 
Today , there is a broad consensus that shock therapy , at least at the level of microeconomic reforms , failed , and that countries ( Hungary , Poland , and Slovenia ) that took the gradualist approach to privatization and the reconstruction of institutional infrastructure managed their transitions far better than those that tried to leapfrog into a laissez-faire economy . 
Shock-therapy countries saw incomes plunge and poverty soar . 
Social indicators , such as life expectancy , mirrored the dismal GDP numbers . 
More than a decade after the beginning of the transition , many postcommunist countries have not even returned to pre-transition income levels . 
Worse , the prognosis for establishing a stable democracy and the rule of law in most shock-therapy countries looks bleak . 
This record suggests that one should think twice before trying shock therapy again . 
Indeed , shock therapy &apos;s advocates argue that its failures were due not to excessive speed - too much shock and not enough therapy - but to insufficient shock . 
There are , of course , similarities and differences between the former communist countries and Iraq . 
In both cases , economies were pervasively weakened before they collapsed . 
Moreover , while both Russia and Iraq are heavily dependent on natural resources , Russia at least possessed demonstrated abilities in some other areas . 
Russia had a highly educated labor force , with advanced technological capabilities ; 
To be sure , Russians went decades without opportunities to exercise entrepreneurship , while Ba &apos;athist rule did not suppress Iraq &apos;s merchant class and entrepreneurial spirit in any comparable way . 
But Iraq &apos;s location puts it at a distinct disadvantage compared to Russia and many postcommunist states : none of Iraq &apos;s neighbors is doing particularly well economically , while many postcommunist countries sat next door to the European Union during the 1990 &apos;s boom . 
Most importantly , ongoing instability in the Middle East will deter foreign investment ( other than in the oil sector ) . 
These factors , together with the ongoing occupation , make quick privatization particularly problematic . 
The low prices that the privatized assets are likely to fetch will create the sense of an illegitimate sell-off foisted on the country by the occupiers and their collaborators . 
Without legitimacy , any purchaser will worry about the security of his property rights , which will contribute to even lower prices . 
Furthermore , those buying privatized assets may then be reluctant to invest in them ; instead , as happened elsewhere , their efforts may be directed more at asset stripping than at wealth creation . 
If Iraq &apos;s prospects are as dismal as my analysis suggests , any international contribution to the US-driven reconstruction effort is likely to be little more than money flushed down the drain . 
This does not mean that the world should abandon Iraq . 
But the international community should direct its money to humanitarian causes , such as hospitals and schools , rather than backing American designs . 
The World Bank and other institutions considering assistance through loans face even greater difficulties . 
Piling more debt onto Iraq &apos;s already huge obligations will only make matters worse . 
If Iraq &apos;s economy falters as a result of a misguided economic reconstruction program based on shock therapy , the country will be further indebted with little to show for it . 
The dream of Iraq &apos;s American invaders was to create a stable , prosperous , and democratic Middle East .
