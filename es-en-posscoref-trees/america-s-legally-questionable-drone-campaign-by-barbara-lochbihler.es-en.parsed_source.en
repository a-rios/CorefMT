Drone Wars 
BRUSSELS - &quot; Sometime they &apos;ll give a war and nobody will come , &quot; the American poet Carl Sandburg wrote hopefully in 1936 . 
His sentiment seems more apt than ever nowadays , but not because humanity has turned pacifistic . 
Under President Barack Obama , the number of drone strikes carried out by the United States has soared , with more than 300 UAV attacks reported in Pakistan alone . 
In March 2011 , the US Air Force for the first time trained more pilots for drones than for any other purpose . 
This raises serious ethical questions . 
With no military personnel risking their lives , UAVs make it easier to kill , and to justify war operations to the public at home . 
Moreover , a human being &apos;s reticence to kill is inversely related to the distance between attacker and target . 
In the case of a pilot flying drones over Yemen by operating a joystick in Nevada , the threshold to pulling the trigger is dangerously low . 
Killing is just a part of the job , to be followed by bowling , perhaps , or a quiet evening at home . 
Meanwhile , the mere sound of drones terrorizes whole populations , indicating to enemies and civilians alike that they are being watched and might be attacked at any moment - which could well play into the hands of terrorist recruiters . 
From a legal and human-rights point of view , the US drone program is even more alarming . 
After all , countries such as Pakistan , Yemen , and Somalia do not belong to declared war zones . 
Outside the context of war , in turn , state killings are legal only if they prove absolutely necessary to save lives . 
More than a decade after September 11 , America &apos;s drone program does not fall into the first category of reactive self-defense . 
Likewise , there is no evidence that any presumed terrorist who was killed outside of official war zones in the last few years represented a threat so immediate to US citizens &quot; lives that preventive and premeditated killing was the only option . 
Unless US leaders prove otherwise in every case , American UAV attacks in countries like Pakistan or Yemen should be called what they are : extrajudicial killings . 
US State Department legal adviser Harold Koh disagrees , arguing that America is involved in a worldwide &quot; armed conflict with Al Qaeda , as well as the Taliban and associated forces . &quot; 
So , Koh claims , drone attacks are part of a global war , fought both in declared war zones and non-war countries ; therefore , they are legal . 
But , even under this adventurous assumption , human-rights issues arise . 
The laws of war condone targeted killings only of &quot; combatants &quot; who &quot; directly participate in hostilities . &quot; 
The killings must be proportionate , strategically necessary , and publicly justified . 
At the slightest sign of illegality , an investigation must be conducted , offenders prosecuted , and victims compensated . 
The US drone program &apos;s legal basis is entirely unclear , however . 
Given that most information about UAV activity is classified , it is impossible to know whether all drone targets directly participated in hostilities . 
And , while the Obama administration &apos;s claim of zero or single-digit civilian fatalities may be true according to the official definition , it rests on the premise that any military-age male killed in a drone strike is a militant , unless intelligence posthumously proves otherwise . 
A recent report by the law schools at Stanford University and New York University concludes that , in reality , civilian casualties in Pakistan may have accounted for up to 75 % of all UAV victims between 2008 and 2011 . 
Others estimate a lower , but still alarming , rate of 30 % . 
The legal obligation of proportionality is clearly being violated . 
Accountability is also being flouted . 
Drone operations are carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency , an organization whose activities are shrouded in secrecy . 
And , unlike military personnel , CIA agents enjoy extensive immunity , undermining international legal standards . 
Without increased transparency , to declare America &apos;s UAV campaign legal is impossible , both in the context of war and outside of armed conflict . 
As long as the US keeps the rest of the world in the dark , illegal acts - including possible war crimes - may be committed with impunity . 
Just as citizens worldwide are demanding increased economic and financial accountability , more pressure must be placed on the US to either prove that its drone activities are necessary and legal , or to stop them immediately . 
Victims of UAV attacks , their families , and civil-society groups have begun to speak out against America &apos;s questionable drone campaign , and to pursue legal action . 
In the meantime , every drone strike will not only undermine human rights and international humanitarian law , but will also further widen a legal loophole that other governments and armed groups will not hesitate to exploit . 
The US drone program does not make the world a safer place ; it creates an environment in which unlawful killings can happen virtually anywhere , at any time , violating the fundamental human right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one &apos;s life .
