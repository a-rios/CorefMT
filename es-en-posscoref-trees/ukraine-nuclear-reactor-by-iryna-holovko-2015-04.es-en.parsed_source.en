Ukraine &apos;s Other Chernobyls 
KYIV - In 1983 , the Soviet Union inaugurated two nuclear reactors in what is now Ukraine . 
One of them , unit four at Chernobyl , experienced an explosion and fire three years later that released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere - a catastrophic accident whose effects are still being felt far beyond Ukraine &apos;s borders . 
The other reactor , unit one at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Station , remains in operation , though all indications suggest that it should be retired . 
The prolonged operation of unit one and the country &apos;s aging nuclear power plants probably would not have been possible without financial support from European taxpayers , delivered through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Atomic Energy Community ( Euratom ) as part of a â‚¬ 600 million ( $ 650 million ) &quot; safety upgrade &quot; program . 
In defiance of both the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context ( the Espoo convention ) and the EBRD loan agreement , the program was undertaken in the absence of any consultation with Ukraine &apos;s European neighbors . 
Thanks to these efforts , the South Ukraine plant was granted a ten-year lifetime extension permit in 2013 by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate ( SNRIU ) . 
But , according to a comprehensive study released last month by the National Ecological Centre of Ukraine ( NECU ) , the assessment on which this decision was based was deeply flawed . 
In fact , the unit one reactor suffers dangerous vulnerabilities , with observed wear in some areas already exceeding tolerable levels by a factor of ten . 
Such vulnerabilities , the study warns , could result in a nuclear emergency , including a release of radioactive particles inside the unit - or even into the environment . 
This is hardly an isolated case . 
Three of Ukraine &apos;s nuclear power units are currently operating beyond their design lifetime , with nine others set to reach the end of their intended lifetime within the next five years . 
Most immediately , unit two in South Ukraine will reach that point in less than three weeks , meaning that the SNRIU must now decide whether to grant that unit a 20-year lifetime extension . 
The SNRIU will make this critical decision without key information about the health and environmental risks that the reactor poses to Ukraine and its neighbors . 
Though this contravenes Ukraine &apos;s responsibility , as a signatory to the Espoo convention , to carry out a cross-border environmental-impact assessment ( not to mention missing the opportunity to consider potential alternatives to continuing the reactor &apos;s operation ) , no such analysis is expected to take place . 
Last month , campaign groups in neighboring countries wrote to their representatives at the EBRD , requesting that the bank suspend its support for revitalizing Ukraine &apos;s nuclear power plants until a cross-border assessment is carried out . 
A similar letter , signed by CEE Bankwatch Network and 45 other environmental NGOs from across the region , had already been sent to the European Commission &apos;s Directorate-General for the Environment and the European Union &apos;s director at the EBRD . 
But , even with such an analysis , Ukraine &apos;s nuclear regulator would be in no position to guarantee the safe operation of aging nuclear units . 
Not only is its professional capacity dubious , as the NECU study highlighted ; its independence has been dramatically curtailed by the government &apos;s recent decision to reduce significantly regulatory obligations for businesses and state-owned companies ( except with regard to taxation ) . 
As the EBRD acknowledged in February , the SNRIU is now prohibited from taking the lead in conducting safety inspections , which is in breach of the EBRD loan agreement conditionality . 
This is to say nothing of the immediate threat posed by the ongoing military conflict with Russia-backed rebels in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine . 
Beyond the obvious risks associated with instability , there is the fact that Ukraine depends on Russia not only for most of the fuel to run its aging reactors , but also for the treatment and storage of most of its spent fuel . 
In other words , Ukraine &apos;s dependence on nuclear energy , which accounts for about half of its electricity generation , has increased its strategic vulnerability to Russia . 
That alone should be enough to convince Ukraine &apos;s government not to perpetuate their country &apos;s reliance on this insecure and dangerous energy source . 
If it is not , the 29th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster , commemorated this month , should serve as a stark reminder of how much damage a nuclear accident can cause . 
Ukraine should take its reactors &quot; expiration dates as an opportunity to pursue a safer , more sustainable energy future . 
Given that this would also be in Europe &apos;s interest , EU governments and citizens must do whatever it takes to support this effort . 
It is a long-term commitment , but one for which there may not be a lifetime extension .
