Where Are the Global Leaders ? 
The G-8 Summit in Japan earlier this month was a painful demonstration of the pitiful state of global cooperation . 
The world is in deepening crisis . 
Food prices are soaring . 
Oil prices are at historic highs . 
The leading economies are entering a recession . 
Climate change negotiations are going around in circles . 
Aid to the poorest countries is stagnant , despite years of promised increases . 
And yet in this gathering storm it was hard to find a single real accomplishment by the world &apos;s leaders . 
The world needs global solutions for global problems , but the G-8 leaders clearly cannot provide them . 
Because virtually all of the political leaders that went to the summit are deeply unpopular at home , few offer any global leadership . 
They are weak individually , and even weaker when they get together and display to the world their inability to mobilize real action . 
There are four deep problems . 
The first is the incoherence of American leadership . 
While we are well past the time when the United States alone could solve any global problems , it does not even try to find shared global solutions . 
The will to global cooperation was weak even in the Clinton administration , but it has disappeared entirely during the Bush administration . 
The second problem is the lack of global financing . 
The hunger crisis can be overcome in poor countries if they get help to grow more food . 
The global energy and climate crises can be overcome if the world invests together to develop new energy technologies . 
Diseases such as malaria can be overcome through globally coordinated investments in disease control . 
The oceans , rainforests , and air can be kept safe through pooled investments in environmental protection . 
Global solutions are not expensive , but they are not free , either . 
Global solutions to poverty , food production , and development of new clean energy technology will require annual investments of roughly $ 350 billion , or 1 % of GNP of the rich world . 
This is obviously affordable , and is modest compared to military spending , but is far above the pittance that the G-8 actually brings to the table to solve these urgent challenges . 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has made a valiant effort to get the rest of Europe to honor the modest aid pledges made at the G-8 Summit in 2005 , but it has been a tough fight , and one that hasn &apos;t been won . 
The third problem is the disconnection between global scientific expertise and politicians . 
Scientists and engineers have developed many powerful ways to address today &apos;s challenges , whether growing food , controlling diseases , or protecting the environment . 
And these methods have become even more powerful in recent years with advances in information and communications technology , which make global solutions easier to identify and implement than ever before . 
The fourth problem is that the G-8 ignores the very international institutions - notably the United Nations and the World Bank - that offer the best hope to implement global solutions . 
These institutions are often deprived of political backing , underfinanced , and then blamed by the G-8 when global problems aren &apos;t solved . 
Instead , they should be given clear authority and responsibilities , and then held accountable for their performance . 
President Bush may be too unaware to recognize that his historically high 70 % disapproval rating among US voters is related to the fact that his government turned its back on the international community - and thereby got trapped in war and economic crisis . 
The other G-8 leaders presumably can see that their own unpopularity at home is strongly related to high food and energy prices , and an increasingly unstable global climate and global economy , none of which they can address on their own . 
Starting in January 2009 with the new US president , politicians should take the best chance for their own political survival , and of course for their countries &quot; well-being , by reinvigorating global cooperation . 
They should agree to address shared global goals , including the fight against poverty , hunger , and disease ( the Millennium Development Goals ) , as well as climate change and environmental destruction . 
To achieve these goals , the G-8 should set clear timetables for action , and transparent agreements on how to fund it . 
The smartest move would be to agree that each country tax its CO2 emissions in order to reduce climate change , and then devote a fixed amount of the proceeds to global problem solving . 
With the funding assured , the G-8 would suddenly move from empty promises to real policies . 
Backed by adequate funding , the world &apos;s political leaders should turn to the expert scientific community and international organizations to help implement a truly global effort . 
Rather than regarding the UN and its agencies as competitors or threats to national sovereignty , they should recognize that working with the UN agencies is in fact the only way to solve global problems , and therefore is the key to their own political survival . 
These basic steps - agreeing on global goals , mobilizing the financing needed to meet them , and identifying the scientific expertise and organizations needed to implement solutions - is basic management logic . 
Some may scoff that this approach is impossible at the global level , because all politics are local . 
Yet today , all politicians depend on global solutions for their own political survival . 
That by itself could make solutions that now seem out of reach commonplace in the future . 
Time is short , since global problems are mounting rapidly . 
The world is passing through the greatest economic crisis in decades . 
It &apos;s time to say to the G-8 leaders , &quot; Get your act together , or don &apos;t even bother to meet next year . &quot; 
It &apos;s too embarrassing to watch grown men and women gather for empty photo opportunities .
