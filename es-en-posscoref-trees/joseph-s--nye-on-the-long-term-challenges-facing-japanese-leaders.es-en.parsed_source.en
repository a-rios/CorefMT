The Return of Japan 
TOKYO - &quot; Japan is back ! &quot; 
But , while Japan may be on the right track after two decades of economic stagnation , there is still much to be done to secure the country &apos;s long-term future . 
In July , Abe &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) won control of both houses of parliament - a resounding electoral victory that amounts to the strongest political mandate any Japanese leader has received in many years . 
As a result , Abe seems likely to remain in power longer than his ineffectual predecessors , most of whom did not last more than a year . 
Meanwhile , Japan &apos;s economy seems to be recovering from a generation of malaise , with this year &apos;s annualized growth rate exceeding 3 % . 
Moreover , following the triple shock of the earthquake , tsunami , and nuclear catastrophe in 2011 , Japan has managed ( at considerable cost ) to replace the 25 % of its energy supply that the disabled reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant provided . 
The announcement that Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympic Games has also boosted public confidence . 
Skeptics worry that the economic progress may not last , arguing that the high growth rate is simply a reflection of loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus - a strategy that inflation will render unsustainable . 
Abe &apos;s supporters reply that the third &quot; arrow &quot; of &quot; Abenomics &quot; - productivity-enhancing structural reforms - has only now been removed from its quiver . 
They point to Abe &apos;s ability to overcome resistance from small rice farmers , part of the LDP &apos;s electoral base , to Japan &apos;s participation in negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which would open Japan &apos;s economy to increased global competition . 
Nevertheless , Japan faces serious long-term challenges . 
First , with its birth rate well below replacement level , Japan &apos;s population is aging and shrinking . 
Offsetting this trend will require increased immigration and greater female labor-force participation - neither of which will be easy to bring about . 
Japan has not traditionally been a country of immigration , and the World Economic Forum &apos;s Global Gender Gap Report , which ranks 136 countries , has Japan in 105th place . 
But , of course , this can change - and Japan does have a history of successfully reinventing itself . 
Perhaps the most critical question about Japan &apos;s future concerns its relationship with its neighbors - North Korea , South Korea , and China . 
While recent polls suggest that Japan retains substantial soft power globally , this is not the case in its immediate neighborhood . 
Unlike Europe , where Germany overcame World War II &apos;s legacy through its integration into the European Union , Northeast Asia remains burdened by history . 
According to its neighbors , Japan &apos;s apologies for is past aggression are inadequate . 
It does not help that some Korean and Chinese leaders have used anti-Japanese rhetoric to win domestic support . 
In Japan , the relentless criticism has triggered a nationalist backlash , spurring politicians to respond in kind during last year &apos;s election campaign . 
For example , Abe threatened to rescind the official apologies issued by former leaders or officials for abuses and atrocities committed by Japan &apos;s army during WWII , and stated his intention to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine , which honors not only Japan &apos;s war dead , but also many of its war criminals . 
While Abe has not acted on these campaign statements , some observers remain convinced that he will visit Yasukuni at some point , further straining Japan &apos;s relations with South Korea and China . 
Territorial disputes have exacerbated these tensions significantly . 
China challenges Japanese control over more than seven square kilometers of islets - called the Senkaku Islands in Japan , and the Diaoyu Islands in China - in the East China Sea . 
While the rival claims date back to the late nineteenth century , the latest flare-up - which has included widespread anti-Japanese demonstrations in China - was triggered in September 2012 , when Japan &apos;s government purchased three of the tiny islets from their private Japanese owner . 
Then-Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said that he decided to purchase the islands for the Japanese central government to prevent Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara from purchasing them with municipal funds . 
Noda feared that Ishihara , who was well known for nationalist grandstanding , would try to occupy the islands or find other ways to use them to provoke China . 
But Chinese officials viewed the move as proof that Japan was trying to disrupt the status quo . 
Some even claimed that Japan was trying to reverse the territorial outcome of WWII . 
The May 1972 transfer back to Japan of Okinawa , which the United States had administered , included the Senkaku Islands . 
A few months later , when China and Japan were working to normalize relations , Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka asked Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai about the islets ; 
Zhou responded that the dispute should be left to later generations , in order to avoid any delay of normalization . 
As a result , both countries maintained their sovereignty claims . 
So , though Japan has administrative control , Chinese ships and planes frequently enter Japanese waters to assert China &apos;s claim . 
While Japan &apos;s security treaty with the US serves as a deterrent , there is always a danger of miscalculation . 
A quick resolution of the Senkaku Islands dispute ( or of Japan &apos;s lower-profile conflict with South Korea over the Korean-controlled Liancourt Rocks ) is improbable , but Japan could be more proactive . 
For example , by stating their willingness to take any territorial disputes to the International Court of Justice , Japanese authorities could help to dispel perceptions of militarism . 
Furthermore , Japan should take the sovereign act of designating the Senkaku Islands as an international maritime preserve free of habitation or military use . 
China might not agree , but such a move might at least return the issue to the back burner , while reinforcing Japan &apos;s image as a peaceful power . 
Japan and Northeast Asia need bold initiatives that focus on the future . 
It is time to give history a rest .
