Rewarding Hope 
PARIS - By awarding its Peace Prize for 2009 to Barack Obama , the Nobel Committee took a big risk . 
Even if Obama is obviously something of a pacifist , the president of the United States leads the world &apos;s most powerful military , one that is still waging war in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
So , on its face , the choice does not appear to be an obvious one . 
Some observers around the world criticized the Nobel Committee for rewarding only lofty rhetoric by anointing Obama as this year &apos;s peace laureate . 
I believe that this criticism is perverse and inappropriate - and thus dangerous . 
For it consists in condemning hope as nothing more than ephemeral words . 
Yet , in politics , words can be actions . 
Obama &apos;s speech in Cairo earlier this year contributed , at the very least , to a change in the climate of the relationship between the Muslim world and America . 
The words that Obama has said to Iran may not yet have borne fruit , but talks with Iran have resumed and the International Atomic Energy Agency will send inspectors to the nuclear plants near Qom that had been secret until last month . 
It is also thanks to words - two statements followed by a conversation - exchanged between 
The outcome of this effort is to be submitted to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in the spring of 2010 . 
Almost everyone knows that the dangers of nuclear proliferation can be reduced , and eventually resolved , only through concerted action by the international community . 
No country can manage the process on its own . 
So the step taken by Presidents Obama and Medvedev is essential , and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , seeking big cuts in Britain &apos;s nuclear arsenal , has publicly endorsed it . 
Despite its silence , there are hints that China views this process with approval . 
And , of course , the French must reveal their stance on nuclear disarmament . 
For , in this crucial case , actions need to follow words . 
But if the diplomatic future of nuclear disarmament looks promising , such is not the case with the other issues . 
For example , the dialogue with Iran , and with Muslims in general , remains dependent on resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict , the persistence of which pollutes dialogue and prevents progress . 
Both protagonists in that conflict remain starkly divided . 
In both Israel and Palestine , political leadership is very weak . 
The fact that in Israel a parliamentary majority still permits the expansion of settlements - the construction of 200 new housing units was recently authorized , despite a warning from Obama - means that those who would undermine peace remain in action . 
In continuing to expand settlements , Israel leaves gradually less and less room for the creation of a viable Palestinian state , which requires a contiguous and unified territory . 
There is something criminal in the determination of some Israeli forces to destroy this opportunity , and something tragic in the helplessness of the rest of Israeli society to prevent it . 
Elie Barnavi , former Israel ambassador in France , has just published a prominent book entitled 
At the moment , the problem is even more serious , since the suspension of settlement expansion , which is key to any peace talks , is not supported in Israel . 
As a result , we are in a difficult period , because realizing the hopes expressed by Obama will require increased American pressure on Israel , a stance that is unpopular at home . 
But if nothing happens , we will inevitably face another failure . 
Following that reasoning , Obama &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize came too early , because nothing has , in fact , happened yet . 
On the other hand , this award strengthens the visibility , authority , and international legitimacy of the American initiative . 
All is not yet said and done , and success remains possible . 
The Nobel Committee has taken a large risk by not rewarding an acknowledged contribution . 
But that risk may have been worth it , because peace , being hard to achieve , must be nurtured with hope .
