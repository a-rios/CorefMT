The Secret History of the Financial Crisis 
PRINCETON - Balzac &apos;s great novel Lost Illusions ends with an exposition of the difference between &quot; official history , &quot; which is &quot; all lies , &quot; and &quot; secret history &quot; - that is , the real story . 
It used to be possible to obscure history &apos;s scandalous truths for a long time - even forever . 
Not anymore . 
Nowhere is this more apparent than in accounts of the global financial crisis . 
The official history portrayed the US Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and other major central banks as embracing coordinated action to rescue the global financial system from disaster . 
But recently published transcripts of 2008 meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee , the Fed &apos;s main decision-making body , reveal that the Fed has effectively emerged from the crisis as the world &apos;s central bank , while continuing to serve primarily American interests . 
The most significant meetings took place on September 16 and October 28 - in the aftermath of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers - and focused on the creation of bilateral currency-swap agreements aimed at ensuring adequate liquidity . 
The Fed would extend dollar credits to a foreign bank in exchange for its currency , which the foreign bank agreed to buy back after a specified period at the same exchange rate , plus interest . 
This gave central banks - especially those in Europe , which faced a dollar shortage as US investors fled - the dollars they needed to lend to struggling domestic financial institutions . 
Indeed , the ECB was among the first banks to reach an agreement with the Fed , followed by other major advanced-country central banks , including the Swiss National Bank , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of Canada . 
At the October meeting , four &quot; diplomatically and economically &quot; important emerging economies - Mexico , Brazil , Singapore , and South Korea - got in on the action , with the Fed agreeing to establish $ 30 billion swap lines with each of their central banks . 
Though the Fed acted as a kind of global central bank , its decisions were shaped , first and foremost , by US interests . 
For starters , the Fed rejected applications from some countries - whose names are redacted in the published transcript - to join the currency-swap scheme . 
More important , limits were placed on the swaps . 
The essence of a central bank &apos;s lender-of-last-resort function has traditionally been the provision of unlimited funds . 
Because there is no limit on the amount of dollars that the Fed can create , no market participant can take a speculative position against it . 
By contrast , the International Monetary Fund has finite resources provided by member countries . 
The Fed &apos;s growing international role since 2008 reflects a fundamental shift in global monetary governance . 
The IMF emerged at a time when countries were routinely victimized by New York bankers &quot; casual assumptions , such as J.P. Morgan &apos;s assessment in the 1920 &quot; s that Germans were &quot; fundamentally a second-rate people . &quot; 
The IMF was a critical feature of the post-WWII international order , intended to serve as a universal insurance mechanism - not one that could be harnessed to advance contemporary diplomatic interests . 
Today , as the Fed documents clearly demonstrate , the IMF has become marginalized - not least because of its ineffective policy process . 
Indeed , at the outset of the crisis , the IMF , assuming that demand for its resources would remain low permanently , had already begun to downsize . 
In 2010 , the IMF made a play for resurrection , presenting itself as central to solving the euro crisis - beginning with its role in financing the Greek bailout . 
But here , too , a secret history has been revealed - one that highlights just how skewed global monetary governance has become . 
The fact is that only the US and the massively over-represented countries of the European Union supported the Greek bailout . 
Indeed , the major emerging economies all strongly opposed it , with the Brazilian representative calling it &quot; a bailout of Greece &apos;s private debt holders , mainly European financial institutions . &quot; 
Even the Swiss representative condemned the measure . 
As fears of a sudden collapse of the eurozone have given way to a prolonged debate about how the costs will be met through bail-ins and write-offs , the IMF &apos;s position will become increasingly convoluted . 
Though the IMF is supposed to have seniority over other creditors , there will be demands to write down a share of the loans that it has issued . 
Poorer emerging-market countries would resist such a move , arguing that their citizens should not have to foot the bill for fiscal profligacy in much wealthier countries . 
Even the original advocates of IMF involvement are turning against the Fund . 
EU officials are outraged by the IMF &apos;s apparent effort to gain support in Europe &apos;s debtor countries by urging write-offs of all debt that it did not issue . 
And the US Congress has refused to endorse the expansion of IMF resources - part of an international agreement brokered at the 2010 G-20 summit . 
While the outrage that followed the appointment of another European as IMF Managing Director in 2011 is likely to ensure that the Fund &apos;s next head will not hail from Europe , the IMF &apos;s fast-diminishing role means that it will not matter much . 
As 2008 &quot; s secret history shows , what matters is who has access to the Fed .
