Bubble Trouble 
The future of the housing boom , and the possible financial repercussions of a substantial price decline in coming years , is a matter of mounting concern among governments around the world . 
I learned this first-hand while attending this year &apos;s Jackson Hole Symposium in the remote wilderness of Wyoming , where , ironically , there are almost no homes to buy . 
The howls of coyotes and bugling of elk rang out at night . 
But , by day , everyone was talking about real estate . 
This conference has grown to be a major international event for government monetary policymakers , with governors or deputy governors of 34 central banks attending this year . 
Roughly two-thirds of these countries have had dramatic housing booms since 2000 , most of which appear to be continuing , at least for the time being . 
But there was no consensus on the longer-run outlook for home prices . 
Of all these countries , the United States appears to be the most likely to have reached the end of the cycle . 
According to the Standard 
That looks like the beginning of the end of the boom , though , of course , one can never be sure . 
I presented a bearish long-run view , which many challenged , but no one obviously won the argument . 
Nevertheless , an outside observer might have been struck by the weight given to the possibility that the decade-long boom might well suffer a real reversal , followed by serious declines . 
There seems to be a general recognition of substantial downside risk , as the current credit crisis seems to be related to the decline in US home prices that we have already seen . 
The boom , and the widespread conviction that home prices could only go higher , led to a weakening of lending standards . 
Mortgage lenders seem to have believed that home buyers would not default , because rising prices would make keeping up with their payments very attractive . 
Moreover , the boom resulted in a number of financial innovations , which may have been good ideas intrinsically , but which were sometimes applied too aggressively , given the risk of falling prices . 
Mortgage-backed securities were urged onto investors for whom they were too risky . 
As with homebuyers , all would be well , the reasoning went , on the premise that home prices continue to rise at a healthy pace . 
At the Jackson Hole conference , Paul McCulley of PIMCO , the world &apos;s largest bond fund , argued that in the past month or two we have been witnessing a run on what he calls the &quot; shadow banking system , &quot; which consists of all the levered investment conduits , vehicles and structures that have sprung up along with the housing boom . 
The shadow banking system , which is beyond the reach of bank regulators and deposit insurance , fed the boom in home prices by helping provide more credit to buyers . 
Bank runs occur when people , worried that their deposits will not be honored , hastily withdraw their money , thereby creating the very bankruptcy that they feared . 
It is no coincidence that this new kind of bank run originated in the US , which is the clearest example of falling home prices in the world today . 
When home prices stop rising , recent homebuyers may lose the enthusiasm to continue paying their mortgages - and investors lose faith in mortgage-backed securities . 
The US Federal Reserve is sometimes blamed for the current mortgage crisis , because excessively loose monetary policy allegedly fueled the price boom that preceded it . 
Indeed , the real ( inflation-corrected ) federal funds rate was negative for 31 months , from October 2002 to April 2005 . 
The only precedent for this since 1950 was the 37-month period from September 1974 to September 1977 , which launched the worst inflation the US has seen in the last century . 
What then helped produce a boom in consumer prices now contributed to a boom in home prices . 
But loose monetary policy is not the whole story . 
The unusually low real funds rate came after the US housing boom was already well underway . 
Poor &apos;s / Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index , home prices were already rising at almost 10 % a year in 2000 - a time when the Fed was raising the federal funds rate , which peaked at 6.5 % . 
The rapid increase thus appears to be mostly the result of speculative momentum that occurred before the interest-rate cuts . 
Alan Greenspan , the former Fed chairman , recently said that he now believes that speculative bubbles are important driving forces in our economy , but that , at the same time , the world &apos;s monetary authorities cannot control bubbles . 
He is mostly right : the best thing that monetary authorities could have done , given their other priorities and concerns , is to lean against the real estate bubble , not stop it from inflating . 
The current decline in home prices is associated just as clearly with waning speculative enthusiasm among investors , which is likewise largely unrelated to monetary policy . 
The world &apos;s monetary authorities will have trouble stopping this decline , and much of the attendant problems , just as they would have had trouble stopping the ascent that preceded it .
