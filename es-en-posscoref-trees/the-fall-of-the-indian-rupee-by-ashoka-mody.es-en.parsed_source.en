The Rupee &apos;s Wake-Up Call 
PRINCETON - The Indian rupee has weakened rapidly in recent months , with the exchange rate against the US dollar dropping by 11 % , to around 60 rupees , since early May . 
As a symbol of India &apos;s economic strength , the rupee &apos;s fall has provoked more than the usual hand-wringing and angst at home and abroad . 
There is indeed reason to be worried , but not because the rupee &apos;s value has declined . 
In fact , the slide has been long in coming , and recent market uncertainty has merely been a wake-up call . 
The real reason to worry is that India has lost international competitiveness and has been buying time by borrowing from fickle lenders . 
Growth momentum has fizzled and , with inflation persistently high , Indian producers are struggling to compete in world markets . 
The current-account deficit is increasing relentlessly , owing to a widening trade deficit ( now at 13 % of GDP ) , raising the danger of a balance-of-payments crisis . 
Indian GDP grew at heady rates of 8-10 % per year between 2004 and 2007 , a period that seemed to herald a decisive break from the anemic &quot; Hindu rate of growth . &quot; 
Reforms had unleashed new entrepreneurial energies and the prospect of a brighter future lifted people &apos;s aspirations . 
With foreign manufacturers piling in to satisfy a new hunger for consumer durables , India turned its gaze outward . 
The global economy - in a phase of buoyant expansion - welcomed India &apos;s information technology services . 
Bangalore ( the information-technology hub ) , Bollywood , and yoga became symbols of India &apos;s soft power . 
That was the moment to invest in the future . 
But the opportunity was wasted . 
Infrastructure did not keep pace with the economy &apos;s needs . 
And , more deplorably , educational standards lagged . 
For a country positioning itself as a leader in the global knowledge economy , neglecting investment in education was a grave error , with other countries now staking a claim to the role to which India aspired . 
And , even when times were good , India never gained a foothold in the global manufactured-goods trade . 
Today , domestic investment has plummeted , exports are languishing , and GDP growth is down to around 4.5 % per year . 
Moreover , India has developed a tendency for chronic inflation , owing to an unhappy combination of supply bottlenecks ( caused by poor infrastructure ) and excessive demand ( thanks to persistent public deficits ) . 
Budget deficits offered what appeared to be a free lunch , as the resulting inflation eroded the real value of public debt , while the government had privileged access to private savings at near-zero real interest rates . 
With so much largesse to spread around , the government became a source of contracts with annuity-like earnings , which offered robust returns for those with political access . 
That weakened the incentives for entrepreneurship . 
And , as India &apos;s external position deteriorated , the rupee became significantly overvalued between early 2009 and late 2012 , trading in a narrow range while domestic inflation galloped ahead in a global environment of relative price stability . 
Amid weakening competitiveness , the rupee was propped up by increasingly unstable foreign sources of funds . 
Traditionally , nearly half of India &apos;s trade deficit has been financed by remittances from Indian expatriates . 
Part of this flow is steady , because it supports families at home ; but much of it is opportunistic investment seeking real returns . 
According to recent data , remittances have slowed or even fallen slightly . 
Similarly , long-term foreign investors have had reason to pause . 
This is not surprising , given the slowdown in consumption growth ( car sales , for example , are suffering a prolonged decline ) . 
India has been left to finance its external deficit increasingly through short-term borrowing , the most capricious form of international capital . 
As Rudi Dornbusch , the late MIT economics professor , once warned , a crisis takes longer than expected to arrive but moves faster than anticipated when it does . 
India may be particularly vulnerable , because all players there have been complicit in a silent conspiracy of denial . 
An overvalued exchange rate strengthens repayment capacity , so international bankers cheer it on - until they cut and run . 
And the Indian government played a large part in fueling rupee appreciation by easing companies &quot; ability to borrow abroad . 
Indeed , at a time when restricting access to short-term international funds has acquired intellectual respectability , the government &apos;s reluctance to enforce curbs has been puzzling . 
The International Monetary Fund , which now supports selective imposition of capital controls , seems unconcerned : the rupee , its annual review concludes , is fairly valued . 
This benign assessment is consistent with the IMF &apos;s record of overlooking gathering crises . 
With an overvalued rupee , there are no good policy choices . 
To avert a disorderly fall , short-term macroeconomic management requires officially engineered depreciation through administrative methods and restraints on external borrowing . 
A depreciated rupee should help revive Indian exports and lift growth . 
But , in the absence of complementary action , depreciation - whether engineered or market-driven - will make matters worse . 
To dampen the additional inflationary pressures implied by a weaker rupee , more aggressive fiscal retrenchment is needed . 
Even so , a depreciated rupee will increase the burden of repaying foreign debt , and deepen the woes of domestic companies and banks . 
To reclaim its promise , India must foster a new generation of productivity growth . 
The time for action is now . 
Unfortunately , a serious crisis may be required to initiate that response .
