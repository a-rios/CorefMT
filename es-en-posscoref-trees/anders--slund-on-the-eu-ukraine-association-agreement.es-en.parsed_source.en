Ukraine &apos;s Prisoner &apos;s Dilemma 
WASHINGTON - The European Union &apos;s most important decision this fall will be whether to sign an Association Agreement with Ukraine at the EU summit in Vilnius on November 28-29 . 
The issue will turn on whether Ukraine &apos;s President , Viktor Yanukovych , fulfills one vital condition : a full pardon for political prisoner and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko . 
The Association Agreement , which runs to some 1,200 pages , would remove almost all EU tariffs on Ukrainian goods , boosting the country &apos;s long-term GDP by an estimated 12 % . 
It would also establish a political , economic , and legal reform plan for the country , supported by roughly 60 state agencies in EU member countries . 
Although the Association Agreement does not lead automatically to EU membership , it is an important step in that direction . 
Under the Treaty of Rome , Ukraine , as a European country , qualifies as a potential EU member . 
But it would have to fulfill the EU &apos;s &quot; Copenhagen criteria , &quot; established in 1993 , which sets out the basic entry standards . 
The Copenhagen criteria are met when the candidate country has achieved &quot; stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy , the rule of law , human rights , and respect for , and protection of , minorities &quot; ; can ensure the existence of &quot; a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces &quot; ; and has sufficient &quot; administrative and institutional capacity &quot; to adopt and enforce EU law and &quot; take on the obligations of membership . &quot; 
Ukraine is a long way from achieving this , but signing an Association Agreement would pave the way toward entry talks , while also creating tremendous economic opportunities . 
Ukraine &apos;s alternative would be to join a Russian-dominated Customs Union that includes Belarus and Kazakhstan . 
Membership would require Ukraine to double import tariffs on EU goods , at an annual cost equivalent to 4 % of GDP ; and it would not even guarantee free trade among its members ( Russia already applies trade sanctions against Belarus and Kazakhstan ) . 
The Customs Union thus appears to be little more than a Russian neo-imperialist venture . 
Unsurprisingly , Yanukovych has consistently stated his preference for an Association Agreement . 
His political future may depend on it . 
The electoral math is stark . 
While 40 % of Ukrainians , based mainly in Yanukovych &apos;s electoral heartland in the east and south of the country , would prefer to join the Customs Union , 60 % of voters see their future with or in the EU . 
Even allowing for widespread electoral fraud ( which would hardly endear him to Brussels ) , Yanukovych would still struggle to win a majority . 
It is not just the swing vote that Yanukovych needs to attract . 
Ukraine &apos;s powerful oligarchs are also looking West rather than East for business . 
Many are fed up with the arbitrary imposition of trade barriers - affecting goods ranging from chocolate to steel pipes - in their former Soviet markets . 
EU markets , by contrast , are viewed as being not only bigger , but safer as well . 
Meddling from Moscow has certainly focused minds in Kiev . 
Russia &apos;s brief trade war in August frightened Yanukovych into pledging to fulfill all 11 of the EU &apos;s legal and political conditions . 
The parliament currently is considering 15 bills along these lines , all of which have the full support of the main opposition parties . 
But the EU &apos;s demand that Yanukovych pardon Tymoshenko , who narrowly lost the 2010 presidential election , may prove harder to satisfy . 
Tymoshenko was arrested in August 2011 and , after what was widely seen as a show trial , received a seven-year prison sentence for &quot; abuse of power &quot; ( though she was not accused of benefiting personally ) over a 2009 natural-gas deal with Russia . 
An EU-appointed mediation commission that includes former Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski and former European Parliament President Pat Cox has proposed a solution . 
At the commission &apos;s request , Yanukovych would pardon Tymoshenko , who would be allowed to travel to Germany for medical reasons . 
Tymoshenko has accepted the deal ; 
The EU says that those terms are unacceptable . 
Acquiescing in Tymoshenko &apos;s political imprisonment would negate the very foundations of the legal and democratic standards that the EU purports to represent . 
Any subsequent legal reform in Ukraine would appear hollow . 
Some argue that the EU should ease its conditions : the case of a single , albeit important , individual should not stand in the way of Ukraine &apos;s future . 
But , far from this being a one-off case , the Tymoshenko affair exposes a deeper malaise . 
Even now , Yanukovych is attempting to amend tax rules in order to disqualify the popular Vitali Klitschko , a champion boxer and former German resident , from standing for President . 
The corruption and lawlessness that characterizes Yanukovych &apos;s Ukraine should spur the EU to hold fast both to the letter and the spirit of its conditions . 
Time is not on Yanukovych &apos;s side . 
The European Council of Ministers will make its final decision on November 18 . 
If Yanukovych has not amnestied Tymoshenko by then , the EU can , as the Polish MEP Jacek Saryusz-Wolski suggests , wait for a Ukrainian president that will uphold EU values . 
Yanukovych will be the one blocking Ukraine &apos;s path to the future .
