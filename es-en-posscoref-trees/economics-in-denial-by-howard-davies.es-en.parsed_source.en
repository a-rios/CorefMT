Economics in Denial 
PARIS - In an exasperated outburst , just before he left the presidency of the European Central Bank , Jean-Claude Trichet complained that , &quot; as a policymaker during the crisis , I found the available &#91; economic and financial &#93; models of limited help . 
In fact , I would go further : in the face of the crisis , we felt abandoned by conventional tools . &quot; 
Trichet went on to appeal for inspiration from other disciplines - physics , engineering , psychology , and biology - to help explain the phenomena he had experienced . 
It was a remarkable cry for help , and a serious indictment of the economics profession , not to mention all those extravagantly rewarded finance professors in business schools from Harvard to Hyderabad . 
So far , relatively little help has been forthcoming from the engineers and physicists in whom Trichet placed his faith , though there has been some response . 
Robert May , an eminent climate change expert , has argued that techniques from his discipline may help explain financial-market developments . 
Epidemiologists have suggested that the study of how infectious diseases are propagated may illuminate the unusual patterns of financial contagion that we have seen in the last five years . 
These are fertile fields for future study , but what of the core disciplines of economics and finance themselves ? 
Can nothing be done to make them more useful in explaining the world as it is , rather than as it is assumed to be in their stylized models ? 
George Soros has put generous funding behind the Institute for New Economic Thinking ( INET ) . 
The Bank of England has also tried to stimulate fresh ideas . 
The proceedings of a conference that it organized earlier this year have now been edited under the provocative title What &apos;s the Use of Economics ? 
Some of the recommendations that emerged from that conference are straightforward and concrete . 
For example , there should be more teaching of economic history . 
We all have good reason to be grateful that US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is an expert on the Great Depression and the authorities &quot; flawed policy responses then , rather than in the finer points of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory . 
As a result , he was ready to adopt unconventional measures when the crisis erupted , and was persuasive in influencing his colleagues . 
Many conference participants agreed that the study of economics should be set in a broader political context , with greater emphasis on the role of institutions . 
Students should also be taught some humility . 
The models to which they are still exposed have some explanatory value , but within constrained parameters . 
And painful experience tells us that economic agents may not behave as the models suppose they will . 
But it is not clear that a majority of the profession yet accepts even these modest proposals . 
The so-called &quot; Chicago School &quot; has mounted a robust defense of its rational expectations-based approach , rejecting the notion that a rethink is required . 
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas has argued that the crisis was not predicted because economic theory predicts that such events cannot be predicted . 
So all is well . 
And there is disturbing evidence that news of the crisis has not yet reached some economics departments . 
Stephen King , Group Chief Economist of HSBC , notes that when he asks recent university graduates ( and HSBC recruits a large number of them ) how much time they spent in lectures and seminars on the financial crisis , &quot; most admitted that the subject had not even been raised . &quot; 
Indeed , according to King , &quot; Young economists arrive in the financial world with little or no knowledge of how the financial system operates . &quot; 
I am sure they learn fast at HSBC . 
( In the future , one assumes , they will learn quickly about money laundering regulations as well . ) 
But it is depressing to hear that many university departments are still in denial . 
That is not because students lack interest : I teach a course at Sciences Po in Paris on the consequences of the crisis for financial markets , and the demand is overwhelming . 
We should not focus attention exclusively on economists , however . 
Arguably the elements of the conventional intellectual toolkit found most wanting are the capital asset pricing model and its close cousin , the efficient-market hypothesis . 
Yet their protagonists see no problems to address . 
On the contrary , the University of Chicago &apos;s Eugene Fama has described the notion that finance theory was at fault as &quot; a fantasy , &quot; and argues that &quot; financial markets and financial institutions were casualties rather than causes of the recession . &quot; 
And the efficient-market hypothesis that he championed cannot be blamed , because &quot; most investing is done by active managers who don &apos;t believe that markets are efficient . &quot; 
This amounts to what we might call an &quot; irrelevance &quot; defense : Finance theorists cannot be held responsible , since no one in the real world pays attention to them ! 
Fortunately , others in the profession do aspire to relevance , and they have been chastened by the events of the last five years , when price movements that the models predicted should occur once in a million years were observed several times a week . 
They are working hard to understand why , and to develop new approaches to measuring and monitoring risk , which is the main current concern of many banks . 
These efforts are arguably as important as the specific and detailed regulatory changes about which we hear much more . 
Our approach to regulation in the past was based on the assumption that financial markets could to a large extent be left to themselves , and that financial institutions and their boards were best placed to control risk and defend their firms . 
These assumptions took a hard hit in the crisis , causing an abrupt shift to far more intrusive regulation . 
Finding a new and stable relationship between the financial authorities and private firms will depend crucially on a reworking of our intellectual models . 
So the Bank of England is right to issue a call to arms . 
Economists would be right to heed it .
