Sweden &apos;s Shame 
VIENNA - Last month , firecrackers were thrown at the only synagogue in the Swedish city of Malmö , breaking three windows . 
The day before , a bomb threat had been left at the building , warning of what was about to happen . 
Two weeks previously , another attack was launched against the same synagogue . 
For months , local Jews have testified to an increasingly hostile atmosphere , with many saying they are frightened to go out on the streets wearing anything that might identify them as Jews . 
Earlier this year , Daniel Schwammenthal , writing in The Wall Street Journal , explained why in the starkest possible terms : &quot; Screaming &quot; Sieg Heil &quot; and &quot; Hitler , Hitler , &quot; a mostly Muslim mob threw bottles and stones at a small group of Jews peacefully demonstrating for Israel at this town &apos;s central square last year . 
Worshippers on their way to synagogue and Jewish kids in schools are routinely accosted as &quot; Dirty Jews . &quot; &quot; 
Malmö police say that , of the 115 hate crimes recorded in the city in 2009 , 52 were aimed at Jews or Jewish institutions . 
Anti-Semitism is back , and what is taking place in Malmö is merely an extreme manifestation of what is happening across the whole of Sweden . 
Let us recall that it was Sweden &apos;s top-selling newspaper , Aftonbladet , that last year published an anti-Semitic blood libel by alleging that Israeli soldiers routinely murdered Palestinian children and harvested their bodily organs for sale on the international black market . 
The Swedish government responded with indifference , and worse : when the country &apos;s ambassador to Israel put up a note on the embassy &apos;s Web site distancing Sweden from such appalling calumnies , her enraged superiors in Stockholm ordered her to take it down . 
It is not just the media and the government that is fanning the flames of this hatred . 
In January 2009 , church officials in the town of Luleå cancelled a planned torch-light procession for Holocaust Memorial Day , with a spokesman saying that they were &quot; preoccupied &quot; and &quot; grief-stricken &quot; by Israel &apos;s Operation Cast Lead in Gaza . 
Canceling Holocaust Memorial Day ? 
Spreading blood libels , and acquiescing in them ? 
Allowing a state of affairs in which Jews are frightened to leave their homes ? 
This does not sound like the tolerant , fair , and just society for which Sweden would like to be known . 
How has such a state of affairs arisen , and what can be done to address it ? 
The first problem is that Swedish mainstream hostility to the State of Israel has clearly begun to cross the line into outright anti-Semitism . 
Of course , attempts to draw a distinction between hatred of Jews and hatred of Israel were never particularly convincing . 
Israel is a specifically Jewish project , and to join the campaign of de-legitimization against the Jewish state is to join a campaign of de-legitimization against much of world Jewry , the vast majority of which either lives in Israel or regards it as a central component of Jewish identity . 
Which brings us to the second major issue at play here : Sweden &apos;s Muslim population . 
While all manifestations of intolerance against Muslims must be firmly resisted , it is also vital to recognize the danger that some Muslim immigrants have brought with them from their home cultures : extreme forms of bigotry against Jews and Israel . 
When mainstream politicians , newspapers , and churches rail against Israel , many Swedish Muslims inevitably see this is a green light for them to unleash their own hostility toward ordinary Jews . 
They feel that their anti-Semitism is acceptable . 
A third layer of this problem is the increasingly symbiotic alliance between radical Islamist groups in Sweden and a left that has departed from the honorable social-democratic traditions for which the country is famous around the world . 
When the Israeli Davis Cup tennis team came to Malmö in 2009 , it was forced to play against its hosts behind closed doors while a crowd of 6,000 far-leftists and Muslims rioted outside . 
With anti-Israeli hate serving as the primary unifying factor , this alliance has grown into a new and dangerous force for intolerance within Swedish society . 
Ultimately , change will not come unless and until Sweden &apos;s leaders address these problems . 
Officials and opinion shapers must understand that this perilous state of affairs will worsen if they fail to take their responsibilities more seriously , tone down their rhetoric , and adopt a balanced approach to Israel . 
Above all , Swedish politicians must speak out when minorities become the target of hate crimes . 
Even a tolerant country such as Sweden must not tolerate those who preach intolerance .
