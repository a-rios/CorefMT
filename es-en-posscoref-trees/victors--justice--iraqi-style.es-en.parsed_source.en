Victors &quot; Justice , Iraqi-Style 
Saddam Hussein is dead , but not all Iraqis are celebrating . 
On the contrary , the way in which the various religious and ethnic groups in Iraq responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of holding Iraq together as a coherent entity . 
To the Shiite majority , long brutally oppressed by Saddam and all previous Sunni-dominated Iraqi regimes , Saddam &apos;s death symbolizes their attainment of political hegemony . 
Moreover , their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated , they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves . 
To the Sunni minority , pushed from power by the American invasion and giving vent to their frustration with daily attacks on the Shi &apos;a population and their holy sites , Saddam will remain a hero for a long time to come . 
The Kurds - who , like the Shi &apos;a , were victimized by Saddam for decades - quietly cling to their de facto independence in the north , making sure that they will never again come under Arab rule . 
Iraq &apos;s prime minister , Nuri el-Maliki , representing the ruling Shi &apos;a-Kurdish coalition , expressed the hope that the dictator &apos;s end would help to heal the sectarian divides . 
But , however sincere his words may sound , reality is moving in the opposite direction , and the ugly verbal exchanges surrounding the act of execution itself will certainly do little to dispel the notion that this was &quot; victors &quot; justice &quot; - the victors being not the United States , but the Shi &apos;a . 
None of this augurs well for the future of what we should get used to calling &quot; the former Iraq . &quot; 
Indeed , the Washington debate surrounding how to &quot; fix Iraq &quot; is irrelevant , because something that does not exist any longer - namely , Iraq as a functioning state - cannot be fixed . 
Under the guise of US-inspired constitutional arrangements , the Shia majority has succeeded in arrogating near-absolute power to itself . 
Thus , what only a few months ago had looked from Washington like a successful transition to some sort of representative government is obviously a travesty : just as under Saddam , power today grows out of the barrel of the gun - only now the state does not hold a monopoly on the means of violence . 
Every militia , every ministry , every Shia political faction , has its own guns , goons , and death squads - while the Sunnis continue to use the stockpiles of weapons they accumulated under Saddam to fight a rear-guard action against the new order , apparently legitimized by elections . 
There is no power - save a new violent dictatorship - that can bring Shi &apos;a , Sunnis , and Kurds to live once again in one body politic . 
America &apos;s chimerical dream of democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed only to violence and coercion has unleashed a terrifying array of political demons . 
In these circumstances , the post-Baker-Hamilton debate in Washington is largely irrelevant to the future of Iraq - though it continues to be crucial to the future of US power , prestige , and standing in the world . 
The future of Iraq will be decided by the people of Iraq , but with bullets , not ballots . 
The US and the entire international community are utterly unequipped to deal with this Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences . 
And , unlike Yugoslavia &apos;s successor states , which could look to Europe , the lack of a legitimate Arab democratic role model makes crafting a democratic order even more difficult . 
Some Europeans and others may gloat over America &apos;s failure in Iraq , and the ineptness - or worse - of US post-occupation policy cries to heaven . 
Yet the root causes of that failure go deeper , to Iraq &apos;s creation as an artificial entity in the 1920 &quot; s by British imperialist planners , who stitched together three disparate provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire into a state that never had a coherent identity . 
Indeed , the very foundation of Iraq was based on victors &quot; justice : the British Empire , having vanquished the Ottomans , made the Sunni Arabs overlords in a country in which they were a minority . 
That arrangement has now come unglued following another cycle of victors &quot; justice . 
The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear . 
But a coherent Iraqi state - whether unitary , federal , or confederal - will not grow out of a society in which one part of the population views Saddam , rightly , as a gruesome oppressor , while another part reveres him as a hero and martyr . 
Wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies . 
In Iraq , only now is it becoming evident that some states cannot be saved without being destroyed .
