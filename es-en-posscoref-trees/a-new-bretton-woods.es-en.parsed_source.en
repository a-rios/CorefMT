A New Bretton Woods ? 
PRINCETON - The chaotic and costly international response to the world &apos;s current financial disorder has prompted French President Nicolas Sarkozy , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , and German President Horst KÃ¶hler , a former head of the International Monetary Fund , to call for a new Bretton Woods Conference in order to design a new global financial system . 
But such a demand depends on a clear understanding of what a new agreement might provide . 
It is easy to see the appeal of scrapping today &apos;s global financial architecture , because there is obviously much that is broken . 
The existing institutions were looking increasingly irrelevant in normal times , and ineffective in times of crisis . 
Although the IMF delivered some gloomily accurate figures about the likely cost of the US housing fiasco , it played almost no role in addressing the current crisis . 
This was the first international financial crisis since the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 in which the Fund stood on the sidelines . 
The major international actor , instead , has been the G-7 , a grouping dominated by medium-sized European states in which Asia &apos;s dynamic emerging economies - the current source of global savings - have no representation . 
The Bretton Woods conference succeeded not because it assembled every state , or because the participants engaged in an extensive powwow . 
John Maynard Keynes , an architect of Bretton Woods , believed that the true lesson of the failures of the Depression-era 1930 &quot; s lay precisely in the character of the large and chaotic 1933 London World Economic Conference . 
Keynes concluded that a really workable plan could be devised only at the insistence of &quot; a single power or like-minded group of powers . &quot; 
Keynes was basically right , but he should have added that it helps when one power can negotiate with one other power . 
In the past , the most effective financial diplomacy occurred bilaterally , between two powerful states that stood for different approaches to the international economy . 
This was true of the preparations for the Bretton Woods meeting . 
Although there were 44 participating countries , only two really mattered , the United Kingdom and , above all , the United States . 
The agreement was shaped by Anglo-American dialogue , with occasional mediation from France and Canada . 
Bilateral talks subsequently remained the key to every major success of large-scale financial diplomacy . 
In the early 1970 &quot; s , when the fixed exchange-rate regime came to an end , the IMF seemed to have outlived its function . 
Its Articles of Agreement were renegotiated by the US , which was looking for more flexibility , and France , which wanted something of the solidity and predictability of the old gold standard . 
Later in the 1970 &quot; s , European monetary relations were hopeless when France , Germany , and Britain tried to talk about them , but were straightened out when only France and Germany took part . 
In the mid-1980 &quot; s , when wild exchange-rate swings produced calls for new trade protection measures , the US and Japan found a solution that involved exchange-rate stabilization . 
So , what form should such bilateralism take today ? 
In terms of countries , the obvious new pair comprises the US , the world &apos;s largest debtor , and China , its greatest saver . 
In terms of themes , the conference would have to solve a new type of problem : how states should deal with the large flows of capital that over the past four decades have been mediated by the private sector . 
Two alternative models seemed to work until 2008 . 
On one side was the American model , with a variety of regulated banks , lightly regulated investment banks , and largely unregulated hedge funds managing the capital flows . 
On the other side was the Chinese solution , with increasingly costly reserve management giving way to activist sovereign wealth funds looking for strategic participation in investments abroad . 
Both approaches were flawed - and liable to produce political controversy . 
The American model failed because banks proved to be highly vulnerable to panic once it became clear that sophisticated new financial instruments had formed a haystack spiked with sharp , dangerous , and indigestible losses . 
And , inevitably , today &apos;s big bailouts have been followed by a politically fraught discussion of which banks were rescued , and whose political interests were served . 
Already , there is a ferocious debate about the influence of Goldman Sachs on the US Treasury . 
Likewise , the very large European bailouts ( totaling as much as 20 % of GDP in Germany ) have produced controversies about the distribution of costs . 
Meanwhile , the Chinese solution gave rise to nationalist fears that sovereign wealth funds might be abused to seize strategically vital businesses or whole sectors of an economy . 
The original inspiration behind the creation of the IMF was that a largely automatic and rule-governed body would be a less politicized way of stabilizing markets and expectations . 
That remains true today : managing temporary stakes in banks in need of recapitalization , on behalf of large providers of capital ( such as the Asian surplus countries ) , would put a neutral , depoliticized buffer between states and private-sector institutions . 
The IMF was originally conceived in 1944 in a world without major private capital flows , one in which states undertook almost all international transactions . 
Extending its mission to include some private-sector rescues would recognize the preponderant role that markets now play . 
At the same time , the involvement of a rule-bound international agency would minimize the political poison associated with bank recapitalizations and currency interventions .
