Europe &apos;s Act in Ukraine &apos;s Tragedy 
BERLIN - Grand political strategy and everyday experience often have a lot in common . 
Try , for example , to swallow a salami whole , and you will probably choke to death . 
In the world of high politics , people behave no differently : they slice their salami before consuming it . 
If they cannot achieve an objective immediately , they approach it patiently , step by step . 
Today , the Kremlin is employing such &quot; salami tactics &quot; vis-Ã -vis Ukraine . 
Before our eyes , a tragedy in several acts is unfolding , in which the players and their aims are clear . 
What is not known is how many more acts this sad political spectacle will have , and thus when - and how - it will end . 
The first act began in the fall of 2013 , when then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych duped the European Union and its leaders by refusing to sign a long-planned association agreement . 
Instead , he chose to have Ukraine enter a customs union with Russia , in exchange for a pile of cash and cheap oil and natural gas . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to have achieved his political aim , namely to bring Ukraine , which had been drifting toward Europe throughout the post-Soviet period , firmly back into the Kremlin &apos;s sphere of influence . 
The second act was staged by the Ukrainian people , who , in the west of the country and on the Maidan in Kyiv , rebelled against Yanukovych &apos;s effort to align their country more closely with Russia . 
After three months of protests , the uprising led to Yanukovych &apos;s ouster , temporarily derailing Putin &apos;s plan to vassalize Ukraine peacefully . 
It was not NATO , the EU , or the United States that acted to block Ukraine &apos;s shift eastwards . 
Yanukovych was chased from power by a significant majority of Ukrainians themselves . 
The third act was born of Putin &apos;s domestic political situation , and resulted in a stopgap solution that led to Russia &apos;s poorly disguised armed invasion , and then annexation , of Crimea . 
Without Crimea &apos;s annexation , Putin faced domestic political disaster and a premature end to his dream of reenacting Ivan the Great &apos;s &quot; gathering of the Russian lands &quot; and restoring Russia &apos;s global power . 
But Putin &apos;s aim has never been Russian control only of Crimea ; he has always wanted all of Ukraine , because he fears nothing more than a successful , democratic , modern neighbor that undermines by example the authority of his own &quot; managed democracy . &quot; 
So now we have reached the tragedy &apos;s fourth act , in which Russia attempts to grab eastern Ukraine , and the West responds . 
Annexing eastern Ukraine - and thus splitting the country in two - by force has much less support , even among Russian-speakers , than the operation in Crimea . 
The aim of Russia &apos;s covert military intervention there is to destabilize Ukraine in the long term by using stage-managed &quot; unrest &quot; to delegitimize the May 25 presidential election in the short term , thereby preventing consolidation of the post-Yanukovych political order . 
The task for the West is to stabilize Ukraine by economic and political means and contain Russian expansionism . 
The Kremlin , not surprisingly , is seeking to make any Western response as expensive and uncomfortable as possible , by implementing its destabilization strategy before our eyes , step by step , hoping that a frustrated Europe and America will one day throw in the towel . 
It would therefore be sensible for both sides to try , together with the Ukrainians , to reconcile their interests . 
But that would require Putin to abandon his strategic ambitions , which he will never do so long as he can continue to slice the salami . 
Dulling Putin &apos;s knife and ending the Ukraine crisis peacefully depends largely on the EU . 
Sanctions will not impress Putin ( he and his cronies are isolating Russia economically and financially more effectively than most sanctions could ) ; peaceful yet tangible political steps within Europe will . 
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has made the right suggestion here : prompt establishment of a European energy union , starting with the market for natural gas and including joint external representation and a common pricing policy . 
This step , combined with further differentiation among supplier countries and progress toward implementing renewable-energy technologies , would invert the balance of power between the EU ( Russia &apos;s most important customer for oil and natural gas ) and the Kremlin . 
If , at the same time , Poland resolved to join the euro at the earliest possible opportunity , Putin &apos;s challenge to Eastern Europe would receive a powerful and completely peaceful answer . 
It has largely been Germany that has opposed integrating Europe &apos;s energy and natural gas markets . 
After the tragedy in Ukraine , no one in Berlin will be able to defend this stance , particularly given that Germany &apos;s leaders do not want to confront Russia through sanctions . 
There will no longer be any room for excuses about why an energy union should be rejected . 
Everyone knows now what this communality called Europe is about . 
To borrow from Aesop &apos;s &quot; The Braggart &quot; : Hic Rhodus , hic salta ! 
Enough said , Europe . 
Now show us !
