The Long Mystery of Low Interest Rates 
CAMBRIDGE - As policymakers and investors continue to fret over the risks posed by today &apos;s ultra-low global interest rates , academic economists continue to debate the underlying causes . 
By now , everyone accepts some version of US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s statement in 2005 that a &quot; global savings glut &quot; is at the root of the problem . 
But economists disagree on why we have the glut , how long it will last , and , most fundamentally , on whether it is a good thing . 
Bernanke &apos;s original speech emphasized several factors - some that decreased the demand for global savings , and some that increased supply . 
Either way , interest rates would have to fall in order for world bond markets to clear . 
He pointed to how the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990 &quot; s caused the region &apos;s voracious investment demand to collapse , while simultaneously inducing Asian governments to stockpile liquid assets as a hedge against another crisis . 
Bernanke also pointed to increased retirement saving by aging populations in Germany and Japan , as well as to saving by oil-exporting countries , with their rapidly growing populations and concerns about oil revenues in the long term . 
Monetary policy , incidentally , did not feature prominently in Bernanke &apos;s diagnosis . 
Like most economists , he believes that if policymakers try to keep interest rates at artificially low levels for too long , eventually demand will soar and inflation will jump . 
So , if inflation is low and stable , central banks cannot be blamed for low long-term rates . 
In fact , I strongly suspect that if one polled investors , monetary policy would be at the top of the list , not absent from it , as an explanation of low global long-term interest rates . 
The fact that so many investors hold this view ought to make one think twice before absolving monetary policy of all responsibility . 
Nevertheless , I share Bernanke &apos;s instinct that , while central banks do set very short-term interest rates , they have virtually no influence over long-term real ( inflation-adjusted ) rates , other than a modest effect through portfolio management policies ( for example , &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ) . 
A lot has changed since 2005 . 
We had the financial crisis , and some of the factors cited by Bernanke have substantially reversed . 
For example , Asian investment is booming again , led by China . 
And yet global interest rates are even lower now than they were then . 
Why ? 
There are several competing theories , most of them quite elegant , but none of them entirely satisfactory . 
One view holds that long-term growth risks have been on the rise , raising the premium on assets that are perceived to be relatively safe , and raising precautionary saving in general . 
( Of course , no one should think that any government bonds are completely safe , particularly from inflation and financial repression . ) 
Certainly , the 2008 financial crisis should have been a wakeup call to proponents of the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; view that long-term volatility has fallen . 
Many studies suggest that it is becoming more difficult than ever to anchor expectations about long-term growth trends . 
Witness , for example , the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or decelerating . 
Shifting geopolitical power also breeds uncertainty . 
Another class of academic theories follows Bernanke ( and , even earlier , Michael Dooley , David Folkerts-Landau , and Peter Garber ) in attributing low long-term interest rates to the growing importance of emerging economies , but with the major emphasis on private savings rather than public savings . 
Because emerging economies have relatively weak asset markets , their citizens seek safe haven in advanced-country government bonds . 
A related theory is that emerging economies &quot; citizens find it difficult to diversify the huge risk inherent in their fast-growing but volatile environments , and feel particularly vulnerable as a result of weak social safety nets . 
So they save massively . 
These explanations have some merit , but one should recognize that central banks and sovereign wealth funds , not private citizens , are the players most directly responsible for the big savings surpluses . 
It is a strain to think that governments have the same motivations as private citizens . 
Besides , on closer inspection , the emerging-market explanation , though convenient , is not quite as compelling as it might seem . 
Emerging economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries , which neoclassical growth models suggest should push global interest rates up , not down . 
Similarly , the integration of emerging-market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor . 
According to standard trade theory , a global labor glut ought to imply an increased rate of return on capital , which again pushes interest rates up , not down . 
Surely , any explanation must include the global constriction of credit , especially for small and medium-size businesses . 
Tighter regulation of lending standards has shut out an important source of global investment demand , putting downward pressure on interest rates . 
My best guess is that when global uncertainty fades and global growth picks up , global interest rates will start to rise , too . 
But predicting the timing of this transition is difficult . 
The puzzle of the global savings glut may live on for several years to come .
