Where are Europe \ u0027s Optimists ? 
The European Union has been so successful that you would have thought there would be dancing in the streets at its 50th anniversary . 
Alas , there has been only persistent talk of failure - to achieve political union , to adopt a constitution , to exercise global leadership and vision , to implement economic reforms , and the list of laments goes on . 
&quot; The EU is on autopilot , in stalemate , in deep crisis , &quot; claims Joschka Fischer , the former German foreign minister and an important voice in Europe . 
But this angst and hand-wringing simply is not convincing . 
Consider Germany . 
After World War II , it was a beaten and devastated nation with a history of dysfunctional nationalism . 
Today , a totally rehabilitated Germany is as thoroughly European and democratic as any other EU nation - indeed , under the leadership of Angela Merkel , Germany has earned its place as Europe &apos;s most important country . 
The EU deserves great credit for this transformation . 
After the War , it was a prime EU objective to moderate nationalism and promote regionalism in Germany , a feat that was accomplished to the benefit of all Europeans . 
Shouldn &apos;t they - and others - be celebrating this major success instead of becoming bogged down in defeatist talk of crisis and stalemate ? 
Besides , where is the alleged crisis and stalemate ? 
On the economic front , the euro-zone economy performed extremely well in 2006 , and most experts predict that economic growth in 2007 will be faster in Europe than in the United States , notwithstanding Germany &apos;s hefty increase in value-added tax . 
Even more impressive , the lack of full political union in Europe has not stalemated the EU &apos;s adoption of the euro and the common monetary policy . 
On the contrary , the quick international acceptance of the euro as one of the world &apos;s premier currencies , aided by the European Central Bank &apos;s determination to keep inflation under control , indicates that the monetary project is going full steam ahead . 
Currently , the euro is strengthening against the US dollar , because central banks in Asia and the Middle East are increasing the euro component of their foreign exchange reserves - a clear vote of confidence in the new currency and the ECB . 
Both the success of the euro and the smooth functioning of the common monetary policy show that important &quot; European &quot; projects can be accomplished even without the benefit of full political union . 
While the EU &apos;s member states have proved themselves capable of putting aside their differences when forging a common monetary policy , a common foreign policy has proved more elusive . 
On issues like the Iraq war and American plans to install missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic , Europeans appear to find it difficult to speak with a single voice . 
The reason is clear : Europe remains too dependent on the US for its defense needs . 
Some EU members ( Germany and Italy ) are more dependent on the US than others ( France ) , and thus more likely to support US strategic initiatives . 
So long as these differences remain , so will Europe &apos;s political divisions . 
But defense independence vis-à-vis US implies a vast re-allocation of resources from social welfare programs to the military , which so far has not interested the Europeans . 
Rather than reflecting a lack of political will to come together and speak with a single voice on strategic issues - the conventional interpretation - diverse voices are the result of an implicit choice that Europeans make . 
Many Europeans have decided that it is better to keep their robust social welfare programs and forgo a common foreign and defense policy , which would require massive changes in the European way of life . 
Moreover , with the disappearance of the Soviet Union as a common threat , Europe &apos;s left-wing parties are increasingly defining themselves as anti-American . 
Thus , when José Zapatero and the Socialists took control of Spain &apos;s government from the conservatives , the country &apos;s foreign policy changed from supporting the Americans in Iraq to opposing them . 
( But , interestingly , the switch from Silvio Berlusconi to Romano Prodi in Italy is having a less dramatic effect on Italy &apos;s foreign policy because of the country &apos;s greater defense dependence on the US . ) 
Naturally , with socialists and social democrats in power in some EU countries , and conservatives in power in others , it is difficult for Europeans to find a single voice . 
This may change if a new common threat to Europe emerges , or if conservative parties follow the left and become anti-American . 
Given US President George W. Bush &apos;s extreme unpopularity in Europe , the emergence of an anti-American right should no longer be considered a remote possibility . 
But with Europe enjoying an unprecedented level of economic prosperity as a result of the EU &apos;s dramatic accomplishments during its first 50 years , further political unification clearly can wait . 
Congratulations , not hand-wringing , should be the order of the day .
