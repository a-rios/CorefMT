Making or Breaking Europe 
Sweden &apos;s thumbs down to the Euro strips bare the fundamental choice now facing Europe . 
Slowly , very slowly , the European Union is approaching the moment of truth when its members must decide what kind of a Union they want . 
Do they want a politically integrated Union , perhaps developing eventually into a true federation ? 
Or do they want a loose economic club , based essentially on a single economic market , with a few optional add-ons of a political nature ? 
This question has faced the EU from its beginning , and until now member governments answered it by proceeding at the pace of the most reluctant . 
But that may be changing . 
This year , or next year , it may at last become clear that the gulf between federalists and nationalists is too deep to be bridged . 
At that point , the federalists will see whether they can find a way to go ahead on their own . 
If they do , there will be a two-speed Europe , with a politically integrated inner core and others more loosely associated on the outside . 
The idea of a two-speed or variable-geometry Union , has long been debated , mainly as a way of finessing the Euro-skeptical foot-dragging of successive British governments . 
Mostly , these debates tended to reach the morose conclusion that a two-speed Europe would be hopelessly difficult to negotiate . 
Then , thank goodness , the idea of a variable-geometry Union seemed to lose urgency when Tony Blair came to power . 
What is now reviving the idea of variable geometry is the prospect of the EU &apos;s massive enlargement with the admission of ten new members from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean , multiplied by the political crisis within Europe over the American war against Iraq . 
Everyone knows that a much larger EU must be more integrated politically if it is not to grind to a halt through sheer weight of numbers . 
This is a question of simple arithmetic , not ideology . 
To deal with this problem , a draft EU constitution was submitted to member governments earlier this year , which would ( among other things ) expand the role of majority voting . 
Formal negotiations on that draft start next month . 
Unfortunately , it is increasingly clear that some peripheral EU members and many of the new members intend to revise the draft treaty , which they fear goes too far toward political integration . 
Some small countries do not like the idea of a permanent President of the Council of Ministers , which they fear will strengthen the influence of big countries at their expense . 
Some middle-sized countries , like Spain and Poland , do not like the proposed majority voting rules , which would operate according to population weights . 
Some small countries do not like streamlining the Commission , and the proposed cutback in the number of Commissioners from member states . 
Neutrals , like Finland and Austria , are opposed to plans for closer defense cooperation . 
And so on . 
These concerns are understandable ; and it is particularly understandable that the new member states from Eastern Europe , who have no experience of voluntary integration - and far too much experience of involuntary integration - are apprehensive about some aspects of the draft constitution . 
The problem is that if governments start to amend the draft constitution , the whole thing is liable to unravel . 
It is hard to guess in advance the consequences of such a failure . 
This will depend on how failure plays out in the conference room . 
But if the negotiations break down because new members , or small countries , or middle-sized countries , or the neutrals , resist the reforms necessary to make the enlarged EU viable , it is a certainty that those member states in favor of closer integration , essentially the six original founding members ( France , Germany , the three Benelux countries , and perhaps Italy ) will start to work seriously on ways of building an alternative structure . 
This is the real significance of last Sunday &apos;s ballot , when the Swedish people voted , by a surprisingly large margin , against joining the Euro . 
They were not voting against the Euro , they were voting against more Europe . 
Sweden &apos;s government wanted the country to join , because it was afraid of the consequences of staying outside . 
But the government balked at arguing for it on political grounds . 
The Swedes have always been half-hearted about the political aspects of EU membership . 
But they could hardly be expected to vote for Euro membership on purely economic grounds at a time when the Swedish economy was doing better than the Euro economy . 
The same is true of Britain . 
Tony Blair wants Britain to join the Euro , because he does not want to be excluded from the European core . 
But he pretends that this is an economic question , because he dare not argue , and does not believe in , the case for more political integration . 
Some observers argue that Britain &apos;s prospects for joining the Euro have been damaged by the Swedish No vote or by the domestic fall-out after the war against Iraq . 
But this is simplistic and wrong . 
Tony Blair will not take Britain into the Euro because he cannot articulate the only real case for membership , which is political . 
Even if he did articulate this case , he would not persuade the British people , who have been conditioned by 50 years of Euro-skepticism from their political leaders . 
If the negotiation of a new EU Constitution is to have any chance of success , it may be decided on Saturday , at a meeting between Tony Blair of Britain , Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der of Germany , and President Jacques Chirac of France . 
Britain &apos;s relations with the other two states were seriously damaged by Blair &apos;s unconditional support for America &apos;s illegal war against Iraq . 
One point of Saturday &apos;s meeting will be to mend fences on the next steps in Iraq . 
But Blair &apos;s deeper purpose will be to try to ensure that if negotiations on the EU Constitution break down , Britain is not stranded permanently in the outer ring of a two-speed Europe .
