Geneva on the Rhine 
PARIS - Twenty years ago , in the immediate aftermath of Germany &apos;s reunification , French magazines were full of caricatures of Chancellor Helmut Kohl wearing the traditional pointed Prussian helmet . 
The new Germany was perceived as a threat to the European balance . 
Germany was simply &quot; too much &quot; again . 
German geopolitical ambitions , it was believed , would invariably seek greater proportionality with the size of the country &apos;s population and the dynamism of its economy . 
It was only a matter of time , people thought , before the &quot; German Question &quot; would return to haunt Europe , as it did between 1871 and 1945 . 
To a large extent , Helmut Kohl held up the same picture , which he used to persuade his European counterparts that they should rush to bind Germany to a more integrated Europe . 
Indeed , this reasoning led to the creation of the euro . 
For the sake of its European vocation , Germany proclaimed itself ready to abandon its cherished deutschmark , the currency that had accompanied and symbolized its spectacular economic rebirth and post-war social stability . 
Today , it is not an excess of German ambition , but rather a lack of it , that is threatening Europe . 
Germany may remain &quot; too big &quot; for other Europeans , but the &quot; new German problem &quot; is that the country wants too little . 
Its dream is neither to dominate Europe , nor even to lead it by the exemplary quality of its policies . 
Germany &apos;s not-so-secret ambition is to become a Magna Helvetia , a Big Switzerland - prosperous , stable , neutral , and ultimately irrelevant . 
Such a dream is obviously flawed . 
Switzerland can be Switzerland because it is surrounded by the peaceful environment of the European Union . 
It is one thing for smaller European countries to dream of being Swiss ; it is quite another when such an aspiration comes from the heart of Europe , from the country that was once seen as the EU &apos;s keenest pupil . 
So , what went wrong ? 
The rise of euro-skepticism in Germany is a new twist in the country &apos;s ongoing &quot; normalization . &quot; 
With the rise of political leaders who had not witnessed the terrifying consequences of WWII , it was inevitable that Germany &apos;s emotional bond with its European mission - born of guilt and the quest for redemption - should gradually disappear . 
Before dreaming of Magna Helvetia , Germany briefly passed through a phase in which it saw itself as a &quot; second France &quot; - a country dominated by the pursuit of national interest , with Europe the continuation of that pursuit by other means . 
But soon Switzerland became a reference point for German leaders , and then an explicit and dangerous model . 
Referenda are not for Germany what they are in Switzerland , a normal mode of governance . 
But , on all major issues , and not only because of their political weakness , Germany &apos;s leaders now make public opinion the polestar of policy . 
This drift towards populism exists everywhere in Europe nowadays , but it is particularly damaging when it affects Europe &apos;s leading country . 
German public opinion is not necessarily wrong when it denounces the irresponsible behavior that led Greece into its present crisis . 
Nor , after Japan &apos;s Fukushima disaster , are Germans irresponsible to reject nuclear power - which is unlike all other energy sources and represents a risk of a far mightier magnitude - with renewed vigor . 
And it is not necessarily unwise to express doubts about the rationality of engaging wholeheartedly in Libya without being fully aware of the strength of either Muammar Qaddafi &apos;s loyalists or the rebels , even if Germany &apos;s resulting policy was formulated in a rather na√Øve and unprofessional manner . 
The problem is that policies that reflect a quasi-automatic response to the momentary Diktat of German public opinion do not represent a coherent whole . 
The famous saying in Renaissance France , &quot; What woman desires , God wants , &quot; has become , &quot; What the people desire , politicians will deliver . &quot; 
Nowhere is this trend from pedagogical responsibility towards demagogic populism more worrisome than in Germany . 
Europe &apos;s most populous country and largest economy cannot base its policies solely on its public opinion without causing further damage to the performance of the EU as a whole . 
Germany has never been more powerful in Europe than it is today - and it has never been less ambitious for Europe . 
And yet Europe cannot succeed without Germany remaining deeply European . 
The problem goes beyond Germany &apos;s current leadership , though its increasing weakness certainly does not help . 
Germany &apos;s path largely reflects a structural evolution that marks the way Germans now look at Europe . 
Yesterday , Europe was the solution for Germany ; today , it is the problem . 
Yesterday , Europe guaranteed that Germany would never again go astray ; today , it is the impediment that threatens the country &apos;s hard-won financial and economic stability . 
Europe &apos;s main challenge today is to keep the European flame alive in Germany . 
The more distant and neutral to the European project Germany becomes , the more its partners , especially France , must behave like engaged and responsible Europeans . 
It may not be enough , but without this nothing can be achieved . 
Or , following the German lead , will a Europe-wide Magna Helvetia become the last European ambition ?
