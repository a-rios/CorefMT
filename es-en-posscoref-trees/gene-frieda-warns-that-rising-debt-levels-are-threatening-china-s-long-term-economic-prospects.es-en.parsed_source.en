China &apos;s Bad Dream 
LONDON - Since his first address as China &apos;s president last year , Xi Jinping has been espousing the so-called &quot; Chinese Dream &quot; of national rejuvenation and individual self-improvement . 
But the imperative of addressing the unprecedented amount of debt that China has accumulated in recent years is testing Xi &apos;s resolve - and his government is blinking . 
The Chinese government &apos;s uncertain ability - or willingness - to rein in debt is apparent in its contradictory commitment to implement major structural reforms while maintaining 7.5 % annual GDP growth . 
Given that China owes much of its recent growth to debt-financed investment - often in projects like infrastructure and housing , meant to support the Chinese Dream - any effort to get credit growth under control is likely to cause a hard landing . 
To be sure , China &apos;s debt / GDP ratio , reaching 250 % this month , remains significantly lower than that of most developed economies . 
The problem is that China &apos;s stock of private credit would normally be associated with a per capita GDP of around $ 25,000 - almost four times the country &apos;s current level . 
There are strong parallels between China &apos;s current predicament and the investment boom that Japan experienced in the 1980s . 
Like China today , Japan had a high personal savings rate , which enabled investors to rely heavily on traditional , domestically financed bank loans . 
Moreover , deep financial linkages among sectors amplified the potential fallout of financial risk . 
And Japan &apos;s external position was strong , just as China &apos;s is now . 
Another similarity is the accumulation of debt within the corporate sector . 
Nearly half of this debt matures within one year , even though much of it is being used to finance multi-year infrastructure projects . 
Making matters worse , much of the new credit has originated in the shadow-banking sector at high interest rates , causing borrowers &quot; repayment capacity to become overstretched . 
To be sure , China &apos;s situation is more extreme than Japan &apos;s . 
At its peak , Japanese investment stood at 33 % of GDP , compared to 47 % in China . 
Moreover , the accumulation of debt in China - 71 percentage points of GDP over the last five years - has been far sharper than in Japan , where the debt level grew by only 16 percentage points over the five-year period before its bust . 
That is all the more reason to believe that Japan &apos;s experience can provide important insight into the risks that China faces . 
After Japan &apos;s bubble burst , annual GDP growth , which averaged 5.8 % in the four years preceding the bust , plummeted to 0.9 % for the next four years . 
With bad debt left to fester on banks &quot; balance sheets , growth vanished and deflation set in . 
While private debt as a share of GDP stabilized , public debt increased by 50 % in the five years after the bust . 
The collapse of China &apos;s credit bubble would likely cause annual GDP growth to drop to 1-2 % , on average , for the subsequent four years , assuming a 2 % annual decline in capital expenditure and a still-respectable consumption-growth rate of 3-5 % . 
Consolidated public-sector debt would rise to 100 % of GDP . 
This is a relatively modest prediction . 
Without automatic stabilizers or a strong financial-stability framework underpinned by deposit insurance , coping with the downside risks of the potentially destabilizing financial reforms that the government is pursuing will be difficult enough ; a credit shock could prove disastrous . 
China &apos;s debt tipping point is to be found in its massive real-estate bubble . 
According to the investment bank UBS , new urban housing supply has far exceeded marginal underlying demand from urban population growth . 
Indeed , almost half of the formal increase is not an increase at all , but merely recognition of rural workers who have been living and working in cities for some time . 
The impact of a sharp decline in real-estate prices would be far-reaching . 
After all , property collateral is the bedrock of the Chinese financial system , with estimates of banks &quot; direct and indirect exposure to real estate ranging from 66 % to 89 % of GDP . 
Complicating matters further is the government &apos;s lack of options for stabilizing property markets . 
In fact , a key part of the problem is that China &apos;s response to cyclical weakness always entails more housing construction . 
China &apos;s lack of automatic stabilizers places the tension between reform objectives and growth imperatives in sharp relief . 
The only way for the government to shore up growth in the short run is to pursue more debt-driven stimulus , as it did earlier this year . 
But this will also cause China &apos;s debt burden to continue to grow , with bad debt increasingly crowding out good credit . 
If China &apos;s leaders continue to choose debt-fueled growth over reform , they will only delay , and possibly prolong , the inevitable slowdown .
