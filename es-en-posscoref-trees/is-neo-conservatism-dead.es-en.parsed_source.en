Is Neo-Conservatism Dead ? 
Neo-conservatism has served as a badge of unity for those in the Bush administration advocating an aggressive foreign policy , massive military spending , disdain for international law and institutions , an assault on the welfare state , and a return to &quot; traditional values . &quot; 
So , with the Bush era winding down in a tailspin of plummeting popularity and high-level resignations , has the neo-conservative movement , too , run its course ? 
Neo-conservatism began with different premises from traditional forms of conservatism . 
Because reforms can become part of &quot; our &quot; heritage , traditional conservatives can adapt to change , even taking credit for negotiating the connection between past and future . 
By contrast , neo-conservatism &apos;s adherents are unconcerned with what Edmund Burke called the ties that bind &quot; the dead , the living , and the yet unborn . &quot; 
On the contrary , they are revolutionaries or , rather , &quot; counter-revolutionaries &quot; intent upon remaking America and the world . 
Indeed , in a certain sense , Irving Kristol , Norman Podhoretz , and other neo-conservative elder statesmen remain defined by the communist dogmatism they sought to oppose when they were youthful Trotskyists . 
The virtue of their &quot; party &quot; or clique needs no complex justification : it stands for &quot; American values , &quot; while critics merely provide an &quot; objective apology &quot; for the &quot; enemies of freedom . &quot; 
Until the 1960 &quot; s , future neo-conservatives shared the Democratic Party &apos;s vehement anti-communism , acceptance of the Civil Rights Movement , and support for President Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal welfare-state policies . 
Tellingly , the influential neo-conservative Richard Perle said in 2003 that he was still a registered Democrat , out of &quot; nostalgia &quot; for Henry &quot; Scoop &quot; Jackson , the powerful former Senator who embodied these commitments . 
For future neo-conservatives , however , the 1960 &quot; s produced a &quot; trauma &quot; that transcended the humiliation of a lost war and the disgrace of Richard Nixon . 
What in the 1950 &quot; s had seemingly been a culture of contentment was transformed into what Podhoretz called an &quot; adversary culture . &quot; 
New social movements , seeking to de-mythologize history , rejecting platitudes justifying the policies of elite interests , and demanding greater institutional accountability , seemingly threatened the entire &quot; establishment . &quot; 
Nevertheless , it was not until Ronald Reagan forged an alliance between conservatism &apos;s two traditionally warring factions that the political foundations of neo-conservatism &apos;s triumph were secured . 
One faction primarily comprised elites opposed to state intervention in the market . 
Its members cared little about the verities associated with &quot; community &quot; or &quot; family values . &quot; 
Their best intellectual arguments derived from Milton Friedman , Friedrich von Hayek , and Robert Nozick , who sought to challenge collectivist theories of society in general and &quot; socialism &quot; in particular . 
The other faction was rooted in nineteenth-century &quot; know nothing &quot; populism , with its flights of nationalist hysteria , defense of traditional prejudices , and resentment of intellectual and economic elites . 
However , its members do not necessarily oppose social legislation that benefits working people - especially when white workers are privileged - and some even retain a positive image of the New Deal . 
Neo-conservatism thus cannot be reduced to advocacy of the free market or right-wing populism , since its ideological specificity consists in the fusion of these contradictory outlooks . 
The question was how to package elites &quot; interest in free-market capitalism with the provincial temperament of a parochial constituency . 
What sold best was an image of oppressive &quot; big government , &quot; reflected in a tax system that was increasingly burdensome to ordinary people , combined with anti-communist nationalism and barely veiled racism . 
After all , everyone understood who the &quot; welfare cheat &quot; was , and who Kristol had in mind when he famously quipped that a neo-conservative is &quot; a liberal who has been mugged by reality . &quot; 
But , with the demise of communism , neo-conservatism &apos;s two factions once again seemed fated to clash . 
Economic globalization risked provoking a backlash by provincial populists , while the external enemy - the glue that held the neo-conservative movement together - had disappeared . 
Then came the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
From the beginning , senior Reagan era officials were wary of pursuing a unilateral response . 
It was clear to many that Islamic fundamentalism was not comparable to communism , and , particularly in Iraq , military leaders saw the dangers in stretching American forces too thin . 
But their arguments did not carry the day . 
For the neo-conservative enterprise , 9 / 11 helped create a new context for linking the quest for American hegemony abroad with intense nationalism - and an even more intense assault on the welfare state - at home . 
Employing a crude form of &quot; realism , &quot; which has traditionally viewed the state as the basic unit of political analysis , neo-conservatives portrayed al-Qaeda in terms of familiar enemies , namely fascism and communism , with backing from &quot; rogue &quot; states that must not be &quot; appeased . &quot; 
Thus , the &quot; axis of evil &quot; and the &quot; pre-emptive strike . &quot; 
This new &quot; hyper-realism &quot; has little in common with old-style realism . 
Churchill and Roosevelt did not lie to the international community about the threat of fascism , construct an artificial &quot; coalition of the willing , &quot; or employ violence without accountability : these were the tactics of their totalitarian enemies . 
Today , a meaningful realism calls for recognizing the constraints on building democracy : suspicion of western values generated by imperialism , the power of pre-modern institutions and customs , and the still-fragile character of the state system in most of the world . 
But genuine realism , unfortunately , is beside the point . 
Given the inherent tension implied by neo-conservatism &apos;s simultaneous embrace of secular free-market capitalism and &quot; traditional &quot; values , its strategy , perfected since the Reagan era , has been to re-draw the lines of division : then , as now , the West is &quot; at risk , &quot; which requires nurturing a strongly emotional distinction between &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot; 
That strategy &apos;s popular appeal will not end with the Bush administration , because neo-conservatism feeds on a set of public fears that are deeply rooted in American history . 
Changing that will require not merely confronting a new ideological outlook , but also deciding which policies reflect what is best about the American political tradition .
