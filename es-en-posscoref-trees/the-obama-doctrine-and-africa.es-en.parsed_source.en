The Obama Doctrine and Africa 
MADRID - President Barack Obama &apos;s much discussed Cairo speech represented not only the demise of George W. Bush &apos;s ideological drive to reconstruct the Muslim world through a democratic revolution ; it marked the end of American liberalism &apos;s quest to remake the world in its own image . 
Instead , Obama &apos;s administration is guided by a relativist political realism that assumes respect for cultural and religious distinctions . 
His secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , underscored this tendency during her first visit to China , where her unmistakeable message was that order and stability take priority over liberty and human rights . 
But what about Africa , the forgotten continent that has been conspicuously absent from Obama &apos;s hectic agenda ? 
There , both the resilience of the local political culture and strategic imperatives are converging to define the limits of the West &apos;s capacity to impose its values . 
A fortnight before Obama &apos;s Cairo speech , a delegation of the United Nations Security Council visited four African countries to express concern about the resurgence of unconstitutional change on the continent . 
Africa does indeed present a gloomy picture , with countries virtually crumbling to dust as a result of autocracy and stagnation . 
But the emerging Obama doctrine suggests that &quot; elections alone do not make true democracy , &quot; and that , as has been the case in the Arab world , any abrupt move to democracy is bound to produce chaos . 
Moreover , in Africa post-authoritarian rulers are not necessarily respectful of human rights and decent governance . 
The West &apos;s attitude toward democracy in the Third World has always been erratic . 
It applauded the military takeover in Algeria in the early 1990 &quot; s aimed at curtailing the democratic emergence of an Islamist regime , and is happy to conduct business with authoritarian regimes throughout the Arab world . 
Yet , public infatuation with the external trappings of democracy is usually the norm . 
Take Guinea Conakry . 
After years of turmoil , lower-ranking officers headed by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara took power in December 2008 in what was a widely supported and peaceful takeover . 
Both the European Union and the United States immediately reacted by threatening the ruling junta with a total cut-off of aid unless constitutional rule and elections were restored . 
Though President Camara eventually succumbed to pressure and declared elections for the coming fall , he has a valid point in insisting that he first must secure stability so that elections do not become a mere prelude to civil strife . 
The case of neighbouring Guinea-Bissau , where a blood-bath has just taken place ahead of general elections , should serve as a warning . 
Why should the West insist on elections in a country that since 1984 was ruled by a Western-backed dictator , Lansana Cont√© , who himself came to power in a military coup ? 
He maintained a constitution , and held elections , but this did not make him a democratic ruler , nor was he able to extricate his country from appalling backwardness despite its tremendous potential for economic development . 
The problem in Africa is one of effective government , not of elections and high-minded constitutions . 
Rulers should be encouraged instead to engage in bottom-up democracy building , create an honest police force and judicial system , and allow civic organizations to flourish . 
Training police forces to secure law and order without resorting to bloodshed is no less important than elections . 
Elections and constitutions in Africa - Zimbabwe and Gabon &apos;s dictatorship have both - have never been a safeguard against tyranny and human rights violations . 
Camara &apos;s test - indeed , the test for most African rulers - consists in protecting civilians and their property , in establishing law and order without oppressive measures , and in fighting corruption . 
Highly responsive to international pressure , he was recently praised by Human Rights Watch for his &quot; very important effort &quot; in recognizing the destructive role of corruption and drug trafficking , and for launching an official crackdown on both . 
Order and stability , even in the absence of constitutional rights , is what makes countries like Libya and Tunisia legitimate in the eyes of the international community . 
To recover the confidence of the international business community and the world &apos;s mining giants , who were enraged in recent years by forced renegotiations of existing deals by governments in Congo , Mongolia and Guinea , Camara was also wise to retreat from his threat to renegotiate existing mining concessions . 
The West is right to insist on norms of decent government , but it risks losing its capacity to influence events in Africa when it automatically links aid to elections . 
China &apos;s drive to retain a significant say in the pricing of iron and bauxite , of which Guinea is the world &apos;s major producer , means that it can always receive a warm welcome from officials tired of being lectured to by Westerners . 
It is not good news for Western human rights champions if China ends up training policemen in countries like Guinea . 
Not much imagination is required to discern what norms the Chinese might inculcate into the 1,000 Central Asian policemen and judicial officials they are currently training . 
As Obama understands , such authoritarian aid is a serious challenge to the West &apos;s geo-strategic interests , including the fight against drug traffic ( Guinea has become a transit point on the route from South America to Europe ) . 
It is also undermining the opportunity to lay the basis for true democratic reform throughout the continent .
