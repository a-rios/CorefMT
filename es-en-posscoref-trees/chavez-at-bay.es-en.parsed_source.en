Chávez at Bay . 
Hugo Chávez &apos;s defeat in a plebiscite designed to prolong his rule and increase his power will inspire important changes not only in Venezuela , but across Latin America . 
Until the vote last Sunday , South America was divided into three blocs : · populist , powered by oil and gas ( Venezuela , Bolivia , and Ecuador ) , with their Marxist model societies , Nicaragua and Cuba , propped up by Chavez &apos;s &quot; petrodollars ; &quot; 
· social democratic ( Brazil , Uruguay , Chile , and Peru ) ; and 
· moderate , with Colombia and Paraguay pro-American and Argentina cautiously pro-Chávez . 
After the victory of the &quot; No &quot; forces in Venezuela , Chávez &apos;s momentum in Latin America , and thus his ability to impose his political agenda , is bound to dissipate . 
Defeat , however , is unlikely to change Chávez . 
Instead , he will try to regain his power , both in Venezuela and the region , and most likely by upping the ante - that is , hardening his rhetoric and policies so that his followers &quot; unity is not splintered by his defeat . 
But his usual rhetoric of class struggle is unlikely to suffice : there simply aren &apos;t enough rich people to hate , while the vote shows that many poor people support democracy . 
Indeed , votes from Venezuela &apos;s poor proved decisive in turning back Chávez &apos;s bid for perpetual rule . 
Many poor didn &apos;t vote , and their abstention was effectively a vote against Chávez . 
The Venezuelan opposition will need to recognize this , and create a plural , inclusive , and democratic front that addresses social issues , the rule of law , and the balance of power within society , if they are to keep Chávez at bay . 
After Chávez , Bolivian President Evo Morales is probably the biggest loser of the Venezuelan referendum . 
Chávez &apos;s defeat undermines Morales &apos;s effort to impose a similar Constitutional reform that could allow him to be re-elected for an unlimited number of terms . 
Moreover , Bolivia is currently isolated in a globalized world , stranded because of gas disputes from its big neighbor , Brazil , the traditional buyer of Bolivian gas . 
Morales had expected to exploit Bolivia &apos;s natural resources with the help of Chávez &apos;s absolute control of Venezuelan state funds , which the referendum would have given him by abolishing the autonomy of Venezuela &apos;s central bank . 
Venezuelans and Cubans provide Morales with the levers of his power : communications , bodyguards , military assistance , transportation , and intelligence networks . 
But if Morales continues on his authoritarian path , he risks fracturing Bolivia not only socially , but also geographically , with secession by the rich provinces and civil war already a possibility . 
In Ecuador , President Rafael Correa also seeks to constitutional changes to enhance his personal power . Correa has voiced his support for Chávez &apos;s notion of &quot; Twenty-first century socialism , &quot; but he is more pragmatic and articulate than Morales - and thus unlikely to risk his future on backing Chávez &apos;s agenda uncritically . 
Correa is , however , in a better position than Morales . 
Unlike landlocked Bolivia , Ecuador is able to export its oil through its own ports . 
Moreover , it has a strong private sector , and it lacks the angry indigenous peoples and the &quot; Jurassic left &quot; that populates Bolivia . 
As a result , Correa might gradually pull away from the Chávez axis . 
Cuba and Nicaragua , however , are of a different stripe altogether . 
Their highly ideological regimes are seeking a transition from Marxism to national populism . 
Nicaragua &apos;s President Daniel Ortega has returned to power through democratic elections with a slight majority in Parliament . 
In Cuba , transition is dependent on Fidel Castro &apos;s retirement and his substitution by his brother , who relies on a military backing , not political support . 
For both regimes , Chávez &apos;s support is essential : Venezuelan &quot; petrodollars &quot; have replaced the financing that Havana and Managua received from Moscow during the Cold War.And , in both cases , the alliance with Venezuela is framed by a wider world alliance against US that includes Iran . 
Latin America &apos;s social-democratic bloc feels the most relief from Chávez &apos;s defeat . 
Chávez has clashed publicly with Peruvian President Alan Garcia and Chilean President Michele Bachelet . 
He has meddled in sensitive territorial disputes between Bolivia and Chile , and Ecuador and Peru , and supported a rival to Garcia in Peru &apos;s presidential elections . 
As for Brazil , it will no longer be necessary for President Luiz Inácio &quot; Lula &quot; da Silva to &quot; contain &quot; Chávez by keeping him close , which justified admitting Venezuela into MERCOSUR , the Brazil-led regional trade pact . 
The economic alliance that Lula built with Chávez will now need to be managed with intelligence and pragmatism . 
But Lula , as too Argentine President Cristina Kirchner , is clever enough to understand that &quot; Chávismo &quot; will no longer determine Latin America &apos;s future . 
Venezuela &apos;s voters have seen to that .
