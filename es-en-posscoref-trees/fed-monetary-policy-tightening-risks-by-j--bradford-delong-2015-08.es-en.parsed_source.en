A Cautionary History of US Monetary Tightening 
BERKELEY - The US Federal Reserve has embarked on an effort to tighten monetary policy four times in the past four decades . 
On every one of these occasions , the effort triggered processes that reduced employment and output far more than the Fed &apos;s staff had anticipated . 
As the Fed prepares to tighten monetary policy once again , an examination of this history - and of the current state of the economy - suggests that the United States is about to enter dangerous territory . 
Between 1979 and 1982 , then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker changed the authorities &quot; approach to monetary policy . 
His expectation was that by controlling the amount of money in circulation , the Fed could bring about larger reductions in inflation with smaller increases in idle capacity and unemployment than what traditional Keynesian models predicted . 
Unfortunately for the Fed - and for the American economy - the Keynesian models turned out to be accurate ; their forecasts of the costs of disinflation were dead on . 
Furthermore , this period of monetary tightening had unexpected consequences ; financial institutions like Citicorp found that only regulatory forbearance saved them from having to declare bankruptcy , and much of Latin America was plunged into a depression that lasted more than five years . 
Then , between 1988 and 1990 , another round of monetary tightening under Alan Greenspan ravaged the balance sheets of the country &apos;s savings and loan associations , which were overleveraged , undercapitalized , and already struggling to survive . 
To prevent the subsequent recession from worsening , the federal government was forced to bail out insolvent institutions . 
State governments were on the hook , too : Texas spent the equivalent of three months of total state income to rescue its S &amp; Ls and their depositors . 
Between 1993 and 1994 , Greenspan once again reined in monetary policy , only to be surprised by the impact that small amounts of tightening could have on the prices of long-term assets and companies &quot; borrowing costs . 
Fortunately , he was willing to reverse his decision and cut the tightening cycle short ( over the protests of many on the policy-setting Federal Open Markets Committee ) - a move that prevented the US economy from slipping back into recession . 
The most recent episode - between 2004 and 2007 - was the most devastating of the four . 
Neither Greenspan nor his successor , Ben Bernanke , understood how fragile the housing market and the financial system had become after a long period of under-regulation . 
These twin mistakes - deregulation , followed by misguided monetary-policy tightening - continue to gnaw at the US economy today . 
The tightening cycle upon which the Fed now seems set to embark comes at a delicate time for the economy . 
The US unemployment rate may seem to hint at the risk of rising inflation , but the employment-to-population ratio continues to signal an economy in deep distress . 
Indeed , wage patterns suggest that this ratio , not the unemployment rate , is the better indicator of slack in the economy - and nobody ten years ago would have interpreted today &apos;s employment-to-population ratio as a justification for monetary tightening . 
Indeed , not even the Fed seems convinced that the economy faces imminent danger of overheating . 
Inflation in the US is not just lower than the Fed &apos;s long-term target ; it is expected to stay that way for at least the next three years . 
And the Fed &apos;s change in policy comes at a time when its own economists believe that US fiscal policy is inappropriately restrictive . 
Meanwhile , given the fragility - and interconnectedness - of the global economy , tightening monetary policy in the US could have negative impacts abroad ( with consequent blowback at home ) , especially given the instability in China and economic malaise in Europe . 
It is tempting to conclude that the Fed &apos;s eagerness to tighten monetary policy - despite unfavorable historical precedents and ongoing economic uncertainty - is driven by commercial banks with excessive influence in official policymaking . 
After all , commercial banks &quot; business model works only when the banks can earn ( via passive and relatively safe long-term investments ) at least 3 % a year more than they pay depositors . 
And that is possible only if US Treasury rates are higher than they are now . 
If this is true , it would reflect a failure by bankers to understand their industry &apos;s material interests . 
What would most benefit commercial banks is not an immediate increase in interest rates , but a monetary policy that contributes to ensuring that the economy is capable of supporting higher interest rates in the future . 
If history is any guide , tightening monetary policy in the near term will only lead to further economic turbulence , followed by a rapid retreat to low interest rates . 
Embarking on that path should be a cause of concern for everyone .
