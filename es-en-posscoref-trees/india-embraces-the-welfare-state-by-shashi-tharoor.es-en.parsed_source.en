India Embraces the Welfare State 
NEW DELHI - In recent weeks , India &apos;s parliament , often justifiably derided for the frequent disruptions that mar its work , has surprised its detractors by passing two crucial pieces of legislation that could transform the lives of hundreds of millions of people . 
The first , the Food Security Act , grants 67 % of India &apos;s population a right to 35 kilograms of rice or wheat for three rupees ( less than five US cents ) per kilo . 
Together with related provisions that would provide meals to infants and expectant mothers , and subsidized pulses to supplement cheaply available food grains , the law will add $ 6 billion to India &apos;s annual fiscal deficit . 
But it would also abolish the risk of starvation and malnutrition in a land where too many have gone hungry for too long . 
The second law assures fair - indeed generous - compensation to people , often small-scale farmers , whose land is acquired by the state for development purposes . 
In a country where two-thirds of the population is still dependent on agriculture and small holdings are all that a majority of Indians live on , the new law helps those who have often felt exploited and deprived of their livelihoods by the state &apos;s power of eminent domain . 
The new law requires the consent of 80 % of a major tract &apos;s landowners before the state can acquire it , and includes exacting provisions for the rehabilitation and resettlement of those affected . 
It will even compensate tenant farmers for their loss of livelihoods and require that those displaced by land acquisition be offered employment in the institutions that displace them . 
Taken together , the new food-security and land-acquisition laws underscore the Indian government &apos;s gradual but firm move toward making the world &apos;s largest democracy a society in which citizens &quot; welfare is based on rights and entitlements rather than ephemeral charity . 
Detractors on the right insist that the new laws will break the budget and undermine economic growth , while opponents on the left argue that they do not go far enough in covering all of India &apos;s poor and vulnerable . 
The government believes that criticism from both sides suggests that the laws strike an appropriate balance . 
At a time when democracies are struggling with various models of welfarism , seeking to balance the imperative of fiscal retrenchment with alleviating the insecurity of vulnerable populations , India has moved in a direction that few thought possible for a developing country . 
From the Right to Information Act , which has empowered citizens and boosted government accountability and transparency , to the Right to Education Act , which has led to record-high school enrollment and pumped resources into moribund classrooms , the current government &apos;s reforms have changed the face of Indian society . 
One in five rural households benefit from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act , which provides employment mostly to the Scheduled Castes , the Scheduled Tribes , and women in villages ( in my own state , Kerala , 92 % of the beneficiaries are women , whose lives have been transformed by their new income ) . 
By raising the bargaining power of agricultural labor , the act &apos;s passage has led to higher farm wages , greater purchasing power for the rural poor , and lower distress migration . 
And sustained government investment in public health is reflected in steady improvement in India &apos;s infant mortality rate , maternal mortality rate , and life expectancy . 
These measures cost money , but they also enable the poor to break free of poverty . 
When government policies keep India &apos;s telecom rates among the lowest in the world , it ensures that the poor can have access to a technology that increases their autonomy . 
When the government promotes food security , it is part of a bold effort to strengthen agriculture , which has led to record-high production of food grains . 
At the same time , economic reform has not been abandoned . 
Controversial budget provisions that had earlier deterred investors are being reviewed . 
The decision to permit foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail and civil aviation has been pursued , even at the cost of losing a recalcitrant coalition ally . 
Subsidies on diesel and cooking gas have been reduced in the face of vociferous opposition . 
Pension reforms have been passed , and insurance reforms are on the anvil . 
India has suffered , like most developing countries , from declining foreign investment , poor export performance , and a depreciating currency . 
But even pessimistic estimates project 5 % growth in the coming fiscal year , and a good monsoon should ensure a bumper harvest . 
The measures that India should take to get its economic narrative back on track are the stuff of heated debate among economists and pundits . 
But for the aam aadmi - the common man in whose name every party claims to speak - these debates pale in significance beside the major steps taken to build a social safety net in a country where everyone had been expected to fend for himself . 
Cynics say the new measures are motivated by political considerations alone : the next general election is due by May 2014 . 
Before it was passed , one wit joked that the Food Security Bill meant &quot; food for the poor , security for the ruling party , and the bill for the taxpayer . &quot; 
But it should be no surprise in a democracy that the government should pursue policies that are popular with a majority of voters . 
The fiscal costs of such measures are high , but the average Indian is better off now than he or she was nine years ago . 
Any government would feel vindicated by that record .
