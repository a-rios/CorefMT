Violence and Innovation 
ABU DHABI - In the 1949 British film The Third Man , the character Harry Lime observes that , during the Borgia family &apos;s rule in Renaissance Italy , the country &quot; had warfare , terror , murder , and bloodshed . 
But &#91; it &#93; produced Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci , and the Renaissance . &quot; 
By contrast , he contends , Switzerland &apos;s 500 years of democracy and peace produced little more than the cuckoo clock . 
While the implication that innovation and creativity are born only of conflict is extreme - in fact , Switzerland is a world leader in innovation - Lime makes a crucial point . 
Although peace , order , and political stability are widely perceived as essential prerequisites for invention , entrepreneurship , and economic development , there have been many exceptions to this rule - especially when it comes to creativity and innovation . 
The United States is consistently ranked among the world &apos;s top ten countries for innovation , including by INSEAD &apos;s Global Innovation Index . 
But , on the Global Peace Index , it is ranked 88th of 153 countries . 
Likewise , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands rank , respectively , fifth and sixth on the Innovation Index , but only 28th and 29th on the Peace Index . 
Conversely , Bhutan is among the top 20 most peaceful nations , but does not even make it onto innovation indices . 
Of course , crime , terrorism , conflict , and political instability severe enough to cause a total breakdown of law and order significantly impede creativity and innovation . 
But some countries show strong resilience in the face of pervasive violence and volatility . 
For example , despite widespread violent crime , Mexico and South Africa have high levels of innovation ( measured by patent filing and trademark registration ) . 
When terrorism indicators are taken into account , Lebanon , Turkey , Jordan , and Israel emerge as resilient innovators . 
Just as peace and stability do not always lead to creativity and innovation , fighting and uncertainty do not necessarily deter it . 
Although peace , political stability , and civil order are important factors to consider when selecting a location for a large-scale foreign production or service operation , they are far less important when it comes to sourcing creativity and making the related investments . 
In particular , creative industries , such as animation , arts , design , and software - which are mostly based on individual skills and talent - tend to be more resilient to conflict than others . 
Given this , officials , investors , and business leaders in search of revolutionary ideas , cutting-edge solutions , and untapped talent should not allow turbulence in some societies , or tranquility in others , to influence their decisions excessively . 
In fact , stepping out of one &apos;s comfort zone may offer significant benefits . 
Some evidence suggests that the prevalence of uncertainty may boost competition , thereby sparking innovation . 
Furthermore , social environments that are characterized by lower levels of consensus and higher levels of violence may be more likely than their more harmonious counterparts to catalyze radical innovation . 
Lebanon &apos;s experience supports this assessment . 
Despite its long history of political violence , its creative industries are expanding . 
According to a 2007 study of Lebanon &apos;s copyright-based industries , conducted by the World Intellectual Property Organization , the main challenges facing the country &apos;s software sector - an important part of its economy - include restricted markets , intense competition , a brain drain ( loss of human capital ) , inadequate technology policy , a lack of government incentives , and rampant piracy . 
Violence is conspicuously absent from the list . 
To be sure , violence is always a problem . 
But countries like Lebanon have become resistant to its effects - for example , by developing creative industries - diminishing its negative impact on economic , social , and intellectual development . 
In 2005 , 10 % of all new businesses in Lebanon were in the creative sector , and the copyright-based industries contributed 4.75 % of GDP . 
Similarly , despite high levels of political violence , Nigeria produces more than 1,000 films annually . 
Indeed , Nigeria &apos;s film industry is the world &apos;s third largest , after the US and India , and is second only to oil production in terms of its economic significance to the country . 
According to a 2010 United Nations report on the creative economy , global trade in creative goods grew at an annual rate of 14 % from 2002 to 2008 . 
Meanwhile , exports of such goods from developing countries , which tend to experience more violence , grew at a rate of 13.5 % , reaching $ 176 billion ( 43 % of total world trade in creative industries ) in 2008 . 
Although overall global trade declined by 12 % that year , trade in creative goods and services continued to expand . 
This has significant implications for political and business leaders - especially in turbulent regions like the Middle East . 
In order to bolster economic growth and innovation amid conflict and volatility , policymakers and investors should focus on building the creative industries . 
The resilience and adaptability that they provide are crucial to supporting long-term economic growth and job creation - no matter what the future brings .
