The New Pharmaceutical Frontier 
SINGAPORE - It has been a challenging decade for the pharmaceutical industry . 
With patents expiring in high numbers , new-product pipelines drying up , and intensifying competition from generics , branded pharmaceuticals have been haemorrhaging value . 
At the same time , traditional markets are becoming saturated . 
Stark realities in industrialized countries - such as the impact of aging populations on tax-based and employer-funded health-care models - are leading governments to adopt regulatory regimes that demand more economical , value-based , and transparent drug pricing . 
Under these circumstances , emerging markets present a new frontier . 
Originally attractive for offering low-cost production , developing countries now present a viable market for multinational corporations . 
The pharmaceutical industry has been eyeing this trend for a while . 
A recent study predicts that sales in 17 &quot; pharmerging &quot; countries - including India , Indonesia , Pakistan , Thailand , and Vietnam - will &quot; in aggregate expand by $ 90 billion during 2009-2013 . &quot; 
But in many emerging economies , a large proportion of the population is poor , and those who are not remain vulnerable to falling into poverty in times of crisis . 
Healthcare is financed largely out-of pocket - up to 60 % in Asia - and many countries shoulder a &quot; triple disease burden &quot; of &quot; old &quot; diseases like tuberculosis and malaria , new infectious diseases like Influenza A ( H1N1 ) , and a &quot; silent pandemic &quot; in the form of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer . 
The challenges surrounding access to medicines remain critical , and , indeed , relevant to the industry &apos;s business model . 
Philanthropic approaches to the problem have achieved little systemic change . 
Drug donations by companies have been criticized for being mostly unsustainable . 
Often , the medicines are unsuitable for patients , unfamiliar to local prescribers , do not match national clinical guidelines , or are near expiry . 
Because supplies of donated medicines can be unpredictable , they can create chaos in the market by preventing accurate quantification of needs and thus affecting planning . 
Donated supplies also have the overarching negative effect of undermining market competition - even generics cannot compete with free medicines . 
Price discounts have been more effective , though their effect is limited by their focus on specific high-profile diseases and least developed countries ( LDCs ) . 
Advocates of improved access to medicines have posed three demands of the pharmaceutical industry : 
· amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; Transparent pricing schemes that systematically address the challenge of affordability ; · amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; amp # 160 ; 
A flexible approach to intellectual property ( IP ) rights , in recognition of the role that generics play in vastly reducing medicine prices . 
Leading companies are starting to understand how integrating these concerns into core business practices may hold the answer to sustainable long-term profitability in emerging markets . 
Reliance on the traditional &quot; blockbuster &quot; model , which targets the elite , is proving unfeasible and short-sighted . 
For starters , it limits the size of the consumer base . 
Many argue that the perverse incentives created by the blockbuster model discourage innovation . 
Finally , developing-country governments are beginning to prioritize health care and are seeking cost-efficient outcomes , as well as the means to effectively manage disease burdens . 
In these countries , building access to medicine into companies &quot; core business models has become vital to securing a license to operate . 
At the end of 2008 , one company attempted to beat a new path . 
The chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) unveiled a four-point plan that included a commitment to cap prices for patented medicines in LDCs at 25 % of the price in the developed world . 
In middle-income countries , prices would more closely reflect a country &apos;s ability to pay ( for example , GSK cut the price of its cervical cancer vaccine , Cervarix , by 60 % in the Philippines and gained a 14-fold increase in volume sales ) . 
Further , it proposed the establishment of an LDC patent pool for neglected tropical diseases and donated to it 13,500 compounds for malaria vaccines . 
Slowly , other companies are following suit . 
Sanofi-Aventis recently announced that it would halve the price of its diabetes drug , Lantus , and cancer treatment , Taxotere , in Indonesia and the Philippines . 
The Japanese firm Eisai dropped its price for Aricept , an Alzheimer &apos;s treatment in six Asian countries . 
Other companies are experimenting with base-of-pyramid models that seek to boost sales . 
Novartis &apos;s Arogya Parivar model sells medicines in smaller , more affordable package sizes . 
The jury is still out on whether or not these new approaches deliver systemic change , and whether companies are adopting a &quot; serve &quot; rather than &quot; capture &quot; market strategy , but at least the issue of access to medicines is no longer being viewed at arm &apos;s length . 
More needs to be done on the issue of IP rights - the sacred cow of the pharmaceutical industry . 
Developing-country governments continue to go head-to-head with Big Pharma in battles over compulsory licensing and patent legislation . 
There is serious questioning of whether IP rights are actually an effective incentive for drug development , especially with respect to medicines that are relevant to diseases in developing countries , given the current dearth of Rampamp ; D into these diseases . 
New models are being tested . 
UNITAID &apos;s patent pool for AIDS medicines , for example , allows generics producers to make cheaper versions of patented medicines by enabling patent holders to license their technology in exchange for royalties . 
Ultimately , generics remain the current front-runner in terms of delivering affordable medicines . 
Formulating policies that enable generic competition with the branded pharmaceutical industry will require creative measures that emphasise the imperative of maximizing public health .
