A Brain &apos;s View of Economics 
CAMBRIDGE - In his pathbreaking 2005 book On Intelligence , Jeff Hawkins proposed an alternative paradigm of how the human brain works . 
In his view , the brain is not a Turing machine that manipulates symbols according to a table of rules , which is the model on which computers and artificial intelligence have been based . 
The brain makes predictions by finding similarities between patterns in recent sensory inputs and previous experiences stored in its vast memory . 
It matches current fragmentary sounds in a sea of noise with a known song , or the face of a person in disguise with that of your child . 
The idea is similar to the auto-complete function in , say , the Google search box - constantly guessing what you will enter next based on what you have already typed in . 
To see the hierarchy in this mechanism , consider that by perceiving just a few letters , you can predict the word ; by looking at a few words , you can predict what the sentence means , or even the paragraph . 
In fact , right now you must be guessing where it is that I am going with this entire commentary . 
The hierarchy allows you to understand meaning , whether the input got to your brain by reading or listening . 
The brain is thus an inductive machine that predicts the future based on finding similarities , at many different levels , between the present and the past . 
Hawkins &quot; alternative model of how the brain works has important implications for many fields , including the one that I spend most of my time thinking about : economic-development strategy . 
By definition , development is not just more of the same , just as an adult is not just a big baby . 
The process involves adding and combining new and existing capabilities to support more diverse and complex activities . 
But finding new things that can be done successfully is tricky , because it requires knowing what you will need and whether you will be able to procure it . 
This is why Jeffrey Sachs &apos;s Millennium Villages project has faltered , as the journalist Nina Munk &apos;s recent book shows . 
In trying to move farmers from subsistence to commercial agriculture , Munk argues , there are just too many missing pieces . 
Traditional thinking in economic development has followed a Turing-like approach , trying to specify a general model of the world - based on first principles - and then use that model to think about a country &apos;s predicament or a policy &apos;s potential impact . 
But the world is often too complex and nuanced for such an approach . 
Would it not be a great improvement if , when looking at a particular place , we could have in mind all of the world &apos;s previous experiences and automatically identify the most relevant ones , in order to infer what to do next ? 
Would it not be useful to see the development possibilities just as our brain , according to Hawkins , sees the world ? 
An alternative , Hawkins-like approach to economic development would take massive amounts of data about the world and ask what is likely to succeed next in a country or a city at a given point in time , given what is already present and in light of the experience there and everywhere else . 
It would be like Amazon &apos;s recommendation system , proposing books you may like based on your and everybody else &apos;s experience . 
In a recent paper , my colleagues and I showed that such an approach to economic development actually works . 
In a particular city or country , you can predict , even a decade in advance , which industries will appear or disappear or grow or wane just by knowing the history of what has been there and everywhere else . 
Countries tend to move into industries that are related to the ones they already have or that are present in locations that are similar to them . 
We have made the approach user-friendly for countries in our recent Atlas of Economic Complexity . 
The idea of looking at previous experiences to inform future action is as old as civilization . 
Following this intuition , Justin Yifu Lin , the former chief economist of the World Bank , has suggested that when countries choose what to do next , they should look at a successful country that was similar to them two decades ago . 
But we should be able to do much better than that by looking at many more experiences in much more detail , using a much bigger memory that can find many more patterns across much more of the relevant human experience . 
Imagine that Sachs &apos;s Millennium Villages project had known the sequence of all previous successful moves out of subsistence agriculture , rather than relying only on guesswork or deduction . 
Would it not be useful to understand the paths to industrial development - and the dead ends - that are most relevant to a particular country today ? 
This alternative approach can empower many more people to seek successful routes to prosperity by lowering the perils and risks involved in the search - in the same way that maps empower people to get to where they want to go with much more information than they would otherwise have . 
Just as augmented-reality technologies make our experience of the world richer ( imagine a sports match today without instant replay ) , putting the development experience of the world at the fingertips of those engaged in promoting development is now perfectly feasible . 
We should seize this opportunity .
