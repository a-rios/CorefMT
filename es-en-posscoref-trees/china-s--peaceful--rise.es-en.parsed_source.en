China &apos;s &quot; Peaceful &quot; Rise ? 
In recent weeks , China announced a 12.6 % increase in its defense spending ; 
Yet Chinese leaders have spoken of China &apos;s &quot; peaceful rise &quot; or , more recently , its &quot; peaceful development . &quot; 
Analysts such as John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago have flatly proclaimed that China cannot rise peacefully , and predict that &quot; the United States and China are likely to engage in an intense security competition with considerable potential for war . &quot; 
Optimists point out that China has engaged in good neighbor policies since the 1990 &quot; s , settled border disputes , played a greater role in international institutions , and recognized the benefits of using soft power . 
But skeptics reply that China is merely waiting for its economy to lay the basis for future hegemony . 
Who is right ? 
We will not know for some time , but the debaters should recall Thucydides &quot; warning more than two millennia ago that belief in the inevitability of conflict can become one of its main causes . 
Each side , believing it will end up at war with the other , makes reasonable military preparations that are read by the other side as confirmation of its worst fears . 
In fact , the &quot; rise of China &quot; is a misnomer . 
&quot; Re-emergence &quot; would be more accurate , since by size and history the Middle Kingdom has long been a major power in East Asia . 
Technically and economically , China was the world &apos;s leader ( though without global reach ) from 500 to 1500 . 
Only in the last half-millennium was it overtaken by Europe and America . 
The Asian Development Bank has estimated that in 1820 , at the beginning of the industrial age , Asia accounted for three-fifths of world output . 
By 1940 , this fell to one-fifth , even though Asia was home to three-fifths of the world &apos;s population . 
Rapid economic growth has brought output back to two-fifths of the world total today , and the Bank speculates that Asia could return to its historical levels by 2025 . 
Asia , of course , includes Japan , India , Korea , and others , but China will eventually play the largest role . 
Its high annual growth rates of 8-9 % led to a tripling of its GNP in the last two decades of the twentieth century . 
Nonetheless , China still has a long way to go and faces many obstacles . 
The US economy is about twice the size of China &apos;s ; if it grows by only 2 % annually , and China &apos;s economy grows by 6 % , they could reach parity sometime after 2025 . 
Even so , they would not be equal in composition or sophistication . 
China would still have a vast , underdeveloped countryside , and would not equal the US in per capita income until sometime after 2075 ( depending on the measures of comparison . ) 
China is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to American preponderance that the Kaiser &apos;s Germany posed when it surpassed Britain in the years leading up to World War I. 
Moreover , simple projections of economic growth trends can mislead . 
Countries tend to pick the low-hanging fruit as they benefit from imported technologies in the early stages of economic take-off , and growth rates generally slow as economies reach higher levels of development . 
In addition , China &apos;s economy suffers from inefficient state-owned enterprises , a shaky financial system , and inadequate infrastructure . 
At the same time , politics has a way of confounding economic projections . 
Creating a rule of law and institutions for political participation has lagged behind economic growth , and growing inequality , massive internal migration , an inadequate social safety net , and corruption could foster political instability . 
Indeed , some observers fear instability caused by a weak , rather than a rising , China . 
As long as China &apos;s economy does grow , its military power will likely increase , thus making China appear more dangerous to its neighbors and complicating America &apos;s commitments in Asia . 
A RAND study projects that by 2015 , China &apos;s military expenditure will be more than six times higher than Japan &apos;s , and its accumulated military capital stock will be roughly five times higher ( measured at purchasing power parity ) . 
Whatever the accuracy of such assessments of China &apos;s military growth , the outcome will also depend on what the US and other countries do . 
The key to military power in the information age depends on the ability to collect , process , disseminate , and integrate complex systems of space-based surveillance , high speed computers , and &quot; smart &quot; weapons . 
China and others will develop some of these capabilities , but , according to many military analysts , China is not likely to close the gap with the US soon . 
China &apos;s inability to compete with the US on a global basis does not mean that it could not challenge the US in East Asia , or that war over Taiwan is impossible . 
Weaker countries sometimes attack when they feel backed into a corner , such as Japan did at Pearl Harbor or China did when it entered the Korean War in 1950 . 
If , for example , Taiwan were to declare independence , China would likely intervene with armed force , regardless of the perceived economic or military costs . 
But it would be unlikely to win such a war , and prudent policy on both sides can make such a war unlikely . 
There is no need for the US and China to go to war . 
Not every rising power leads to war - witness America &apos;s overtaking of Britain at the end of the nineteenth century . 
If China &apos;s rise remains peaceful , it promises great benefits to its own people and to its neighbors - and to Americans . 
But , remembering Thucydides &quot; advice , it will be important not to mistake analysts &quot; theories for reality , and to continue pointing this out to political leaders and publics .
