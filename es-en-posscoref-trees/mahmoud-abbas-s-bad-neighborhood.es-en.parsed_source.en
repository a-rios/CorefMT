Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s Bad Neighborhood 
With Gaza poised on the brink of civil war , pity poor Mahmoud Abbas , who took over as president of the Palestinian Authority two and a half years ago , after the death of Yasser Arafat . 
An academic by profession , Abbas has tried mightily to lead the Palestinian people with civility , adherence to democratic principles , and public disdain for violence . 
He never had a chance . 
Palestinian rivals , both from his own Fatah party and from the Islamists of Hamas , as well as the Israelis , perceived Abbas &apos;s civility as weakness . 
Abbas introduced a totally different style of management from that of Arafat . 
Dressed in his military suit until his last day , Abu Ammar ( Arafat &apos;s revolutionary nom de guerre ) did not believe that it was time to become a civilian president while the Israeli occupation continued . 
Dressed in a suit and tie , Abbas introduced professional Western-style management to the presidency , but had no idea what to do with grass-roots militants . 
One of the first comments I heard from journalists was that Abbas , a family man , went home at lunchtime and worked regular business hours . 
His other name , Abu Mazen , is not a revolutionary name but reflects the practice of naming a person as the father of his eldest son . 
Abbas &apos;s son , Mazen , runs a local advertising agency . 
In his attempt to counter Arafat &apos;s political corruption and micromanagement , Abbas lost whatever chance he had to maintain the loyalty of the Fatah leadership , newly appointed PA officials , security personnel , and , most importantly , local militants . 
Calling for national elections , while politically correct , was political suicide , for he lacked any idea of the possible outcome and did very little to ensure the discipline of Fatah . 
An attempt at a primary to choose Fatah candidates backfired , owing to fraud and the losers &quot; refusal to honor the results . 
Rival Fatah candidates then split the party &apos;s vote , allowing Hamas an easy victory . 
Negotiations with the Israelis was one area where Abbas , who led the Oslo process that saw the creation of the Palestinian Authority , thought he could do well . 
But , unlike Oslo , when Abbas was working under Arafat and able to project power from that base , as Palestinian president he was both negotiator and supposedly the center of power . 
The Israelis discerned Abbas &apos;s weakness early on , and once Hamas was elected in a landslide , had little incentive to help him despite the prodding of the United States . 
Not only was Abbas politically weak , with few friends among Fatah militants , but he also didn &apos;t show much interest in what was happening in Gaza . 
He spent as little time as he could there , preferring his Ramallah office on the West Bank and spending time with visiting politicians and meeting world leaders there or abroad . 
And , while he was technically the commander-in-chief of the Palestinian forces , these forces lacked the will to stand up to Hamas &apos;s growing power . 
The economic siege on Palestine after the Hamas victory further weakened Abbas . 
With no salaries to pay teachers ( or even the security services ) , his ability to influence even his own presidential guard was severely limited . 
During a meeting , which I attended , with a delegation from the International Press Institute to obtain the release of the BBC journalist Alan Johnston , abducted in Gaza in March , Abbas explained the PA &apos;s inability and weakness . 
Soldiers march on their stomachs , he said , and complained that his own forces have not been able to renew their equipment or obtain badly needed ammunition for seven years . 
Ironically , the Israelis and the world community , which had basically frozen Palestinian finances , wanted Abbas to continue to control the security forces , despite Fatah &apos;s loss in the parliamentary elections . 
Israel and the US led a virtual blockade on Palestine , with Israel refusing to return collected taxes and the US pressing world banks not to recognize the signature of the Palestinian finance minister . 
The nominal reason is Hamas &apos;s refusal to recognize Israel . 
But most Arab countries also don &apos;t recognize Israel , and yet the banking world deals with them normally . 
A compromise power-sharing agreement brokered by the Saudis initially seemed to be a solution . 
According to the Mecca agreement signed last February , Hamas would give up important ministries such as finance , interior , and foreign affairs , while Abbas would ensure the end of the economic siege . 
Four months later , however , the siege has not been lifted , and the Hamas ministers ( such as former Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahhar and Interior Minster Said Siyam ) who were forced out now feel betrayed and are demanding their jobs back . 
If the Israelis and the international community want Abbas to remain in power , they must change their approach dramatically , by lifting the economic siege and providing his presidency with military and political support . 
And , if the Israelis are convinced that Abbas is too weak to do anything , they can help the Palestinians by releasing the Fatah strongman , Marwan Barghouti , from an Israeli jail . 
Otherwise , Abbas will be left with no alternative but to follow the advice of a leading Palestinian professor , Ali Jirbawi , who suggested simply that Abbas should dissolve the Palestinian Authority and return power to the Israelis , who remain legally and practically responsible for the areas they occupied in 1967 .
