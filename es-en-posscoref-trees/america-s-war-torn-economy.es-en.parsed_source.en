America &apos;s War-Torn Economy 
NEW YORK - Some say there are two issues in the coming American elections : the Iraq war and the economy . 
On days when the war seems to be going better than expected , and the economy worse , the economy eclipses the war ; but neither is faring well . 
In some sense , there is only one issue , and that is the war , which has exacerbated America &apos;s economic problems . 
And when the world &apos;s largest economy is sick - and it is now very sick - the entire world suffers . 
It used to be thought that wars were good for the economy . 
After all , World War II is widely thought to have helped lift the global economy out of the Great Depression . 
But , at least since Keynes , we know how to stimulate the economy more effectively , and in ways that increase long-term productivity and enhance living standards . 
This war , in particular , has not been good for the economy , for three reasons . 
First , it has contributed to rising oil prices . 
When the United States went to war , oil cost less than $ 25 a barrel , and futures markets expected it to remain there for a decade . 
Futures traders knew about the growth of China and other emerging markets ; but they expected supply - mainly from low-cost Middle East providers - to increase in tandem with demand . 
The war changed that equation . 
Higher oil prices mean that Americans ( and Europeans and Japanese ) are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to Middle East oil dictators and oil exporters elsewhere in the world rather than spending it at home . 
Moreover , money spent on the Iraq war does not stimulate the economy today as much as money spent at home on roads , hospitals , or schools , and it doesn &apos;t contribute as much to long-term growth . 
Economists talk about &quot; bang for the buck &quot; - how much economic stimulus is provided by each dollar of spending . 
It &apos;s hard to imagine less bang than from bucks spent on a Nepalese contractor working in Iraq . 
With so many dollars going abroad , the American economy should have been in a much weaker shape than it appeared . 
But , much as the Bush administration tried to hide the true costs of the war by incomplete and misleading accounting , the economy &apos;s flaws were covered up by a flood of liquidity from the Federal Reserve and by lax financial regulation . 
So much money was pumped into the economy and so lax were regulators that one leading American bank advertised its loans with the slogan &quot; qualified at birth &quot; - a clear indication that there were , in effect , no credit standards . 
In a sense , the strategy worked : a housing bubble fed a consumption boom , as savings rates plummeted to zero . The economic weaknesses were simply being postponed to some future date ; the Bush administration hoped that the day of reckoning would come after November 2008 . Instead , things began to unravel in August 2007 . 
Now it has responded , with a stimulus package that is too little , too late , and badly designed . 
To see the inadequacy of that package , compare it with the more than $ 1.5 trillion that was borrowed in home equity loans in recent years , most of it spent on consumption . 
That game - based on a belief in ever-spiraling home prices - is over . 
With home prices falling ( and set to continue to fall ) , and with banks uncertain of their financial position , lenders will not lend and households will not borrow . 
So , while the additional liquidity injected into the financial system by the Fed may have prevented a meltdown , it won &apos;t stimulate much consumption or investment . 
Instead , much of it will find its way abroad . 
China , for example , is worried that the Fed &apos;s stimulus will increase its domestic inflation . 
There is a third reason that this war is economically bad for America . 
Not only has America already spent a great deal on this war - $ 12 billion a month , and counting - but much of the bill remains to be paid , such as compensation and health care for the 40 % of veterans who are returning with disabilities , many of which are very serious . 
Moreover , this war has been funded differently from any other war in America &apos;s history -perhaps in any country &apos;s recent history . 
Normally , countries ask for shared sacrifice , as they ask their young men and women to risk their lives . 
Taxes are raised . 
There is a discussion of how much of the burden to pass on to future generations . In this war , there was no such discussion . 
When America went to war , there was a deficit . 
Yet remarkably , Bush asked for , and got , a reckless tax cut for the rich . 
That means that every dollar of war spending has in effect been borrowed . 
For the first time since the Revolutionary War , two centuries ago , America has had to turn to foreigners for financing , because US households have been saving nothing . 
The numbers are hard to believe . 
The national debt has increased by 50 % in eight years , with almost $ 1 trillion of this increase due to the war - an amount likely to more than double within ten years . 
Who would have believed that one administration could do so much damage so quickly ? 
America , and the world , will be paying to repair it for decades to come .
