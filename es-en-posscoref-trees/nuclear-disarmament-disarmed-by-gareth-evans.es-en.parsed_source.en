Nuclear Disarmament Disarmed 
SINGAPORE - US President Barack Obama &apos;s foreign-policy landscape is littered with deflated balloons . 
Soaring speeches , high hopes , and great expectations have yielded minimal returns . 
Across the Islamic world - from North Africa to Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan - we see fragile relationships , unhappy transitions , unresolved conflicts , and outright attacks on the United States , despite Obama &apos;s case for a new beginning , movingly articulated in his June 2009 speech in Cairo . 
Israel , deaf to Obama &apos;s urging , is further from reconciliation with Palestine , and closer to war with Iran , than it has ever been . 
Likewise , for all the effort put into improving America &apos;s most important bilateral relationships - those with China and Russia - ties with both countries have become increasingly tense , owing most recently to the Kremlin &apos;s intransigence over Syria and official Chinese behavior in the South China Sea . 
But the balloon that has deflated the most may be the one that Obama sent aloft in Prague in April 2009 , when he made the case for rapid and serious movement toward a world free of nuclear weapons . 
A good start was made with the US-Russia New START treaty to limit significantly strategic-weapon deployments , the largely successful Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) Review Conference , and the productive , US-hosted Nuclear Security Summit . 
This month , a group of former prime ministers , foreign and defense ministers , and military , diplomatic , and scientific leaders from 14 countries met in Singapore as the Asia Pacific Leadership Network for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament ( APLN ) . 
They expressed their profound disappointment at what they described as the &quot; evaporation of political will &quot; evident in global and regional efforts toward nuclear disarmament . 
Apart from another reasonably productive Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul in March 2012 , the news on the disarmament front over the last year has certainly been bleak . 
Further US-Russia arms-reduction negotiations ground to a halt long before the American presidential election season began . 
Meanwhile , no other nuclear-armed state has expressed the slightest interest in bilateral or multilateral reduction negotiations until the two major powers , which currently hold 95 % of the world &apos;s stockpile , make further major cuts . 
Cautious initial moves by the US to modify its nuclear doctrine - toward accepting that nuclear weapons &quot; &quot; sole purpose &quot; is to respond to nuclear threats , and not any other kind - have gone nowhere . 
Negotiations to &quot; de-alert &quot; the 2,000 nuclear weapons that remain at absurdly dangerous , Cold War-era launch readiness have never really started . 
There are also no signs of movement on bringing into force the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) . 
So who is to blame ? 
Some charge the Obama administration itself with sending mixed signals or worse : The US , they note , has modernized its own nuclear arsenal , developed new ballistic-missile defense and conventional weapons systems , and been too willing to accommodate its European and Northeast Asian allies &quot; nervousness about limiting the nuclear dimension of the extended deterrence umbrella under which they shelter . 
But it is hard to ignore the huge constraint that an intensely partisan and negative political environment in the US has imposed . 
Nor is there any sign that any of these positions would be modified should Mitt Romney , the Republican challenger , become president . 
International concerns have been compounded - certainly for the APLN leaders - by the shrillness of Romney &apos;s statements on China and Taiwan , as well as his extraordinary identification of Russia as America &apos;s &quot; number one geopolitical foe . &quot; 
But it is not na誰ve to be concerned about the most indiscriminately inhumane weapons of destruction ever invented - 23,000 of which still exist - with a combined destructive capability of 150,000 Hiroshima bombs . 
The genuinely na誰ve - or ignorant - position is to believe that statesmanship and foolproof controls , rather than sheer dumb luck , have enabled the world to go almost seven decades without a nuclear-weapons catastrophe . 
It is not na誰ve to believe that nuclear deterrence is both fragile operationally , and of thoroughly dubious utility in sustaining the peace . 
Nor is it na誰ve to believe that even if nuclear weapons cannot be un-invented , they can ultimately be outlawed . 
Obama cannot be faulted for trying . 
Even deflated balloons are better than a devastated planet .
