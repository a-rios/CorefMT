Rumors of War 
War is widely thought to be linked to economic good times . 
World War II is often said to have brought the world out of the Great Depression , and war has since enhanced its reputation as a spur to economic growth . 
Some even suggest that capitalism needs wars , that without them , recession would always lurk on the horizon . 
Today , we know that these propositions are nonsense . 
The 1990s boom showed that peace is economically far better than war . 
The Gulf War of 1991 demonstrated that wars can actually be bad for an economy . 
That conflict contributed mightily to the onset of the recession of 1991 ( which , it should be remembered , was probably the key factor in denying the first President Bush re-election in 1992 ) . 
The current situation is far more akin to the Gulf War than to wars that may have contributed to economic growth . 
Indeed , the economic effects of a second war against Iraq would probably be far more adverse . 
WWII called for total mobilization , and it was that total mobilization , requiring a country &apos;s total resources , that wiped out unemployment . 
Total war means total employment . 
By contrast , the direct costs of a military attack on Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime will be minuscule in terms of total US government spending . 
Most analysts put the total costs of the war at less than 0.1 % of GDP , the highest at 0.2 % of GDP . 
Much of that , moreover , includes the usage of munitions that already exist , implying that little or no stimulus will be provided to today &apos;s economy . 
The Bush administration &apos;s ( admittedly wavering ) commitment to fiscal prudence means that much , perhaps most , of the war costs will be offset by expenditure cuts elsewhere . 
Investments in education , health , research , and the environment will almost inevitably be crowded out . 
Accordingly , war will be unambiguously bad in terms of what really counts : the standard of living of ordinary people . 
America will thus be poorer , both now and the future . 
Obviously , if this military adventure were in fact necessary to maintain security or to preserve freedom , as its advocates and promoters proclaim - and if it were to prove as successful as its boosters hope - then the cost might still be worth it . 
But that is another matter . 
I want to debunk the idea that it is possible both to achieve the war &apos;s ends and benefit the economy . 
There is also the uncertainty factor . 
Of course , resolving uncertainty is no reason to invade Iraq prematurely , for the costs of any war are high , and are not to be measured only , or primarily , in economic terms . 
Innocent lives will be lost - possibly far more than were lost on September 11 , 2001 . 
But the wait for war adds to uncertainties that already weigh on the American , and the global , economy : 
uncertainties arising from America &apos;s looming fiscal deficit , due to macroeconomic mismanagement and a tax cut that the country cannot afford ; 
uncertainties arising from the unfinished &quot; war on terrorism &quot; ; 
uncertainties associated with the massive corporate accounting and banking scandals , and the Bush Administration &apos;s half-hearted efforts at reform , as a result of which no one knows what America &apos;s corporations are worth ; 
uncertainties connected to America &apos;s massive trade deficit , which has reached all- time records . 
Will foreigners be willing to continue to lend to the US , with all of its problems , at a rate in excess of a billion dollars a day ? 
Uncertainties associated with Europe &apos;s stability pact . 
Will it survive , and will it be good for Europe if it does ? 
Finally , the uncertainties associated with Japan : will it at long last fix its banking system , and if it does , how negative will be the short-term impact ? 
Some suggest that the US may be going to war to maintain steady oil supplies , or to advance its oil interests . 
Few can doubt the influence that oil interests have on President Bush - witness the administration &apos;s energy policy , with its emphasis on expanding oil production rather than conservation . 
But even from the perspective of oil interests , war against Iraq is a risky venture : not only is the impact on price , and therefore on oil company prices , highly uncertain , but other oil producers , including Russian and European interests , will not easily be ignored . 
Indeed , should the US go to war , no one can predict the effect on oil supplies . 
A peaceful , democratic Iraqi regime could be established . 
Desperate for funds for reconstruction , that new regime could sell large amounts of oil , lowering global oil prices . 
Domestic US oil producers , as well as those in allied countries , such as Mexico and Russia , would be devastated , though users of oil around the world would benefit enormously . 
Or the turmoil throughout the Muslim world could lead to disruptions of oil supplies , with high prices the result . 
This will please oil producers in other parts of the world , but will have enormously adverse consequences for the global economy , akin to those resulting from the oil price hikes in 1973 . 
Whichever way one looks at it , the economic effects of war with Iraq will not be good . 
Markets loathe uncertainty and volatility . 
War , and anticipation of war , bring both . 
We should be prepared for them .
