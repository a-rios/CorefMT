India &apos;s Agony 
MUMBAI - In most cities of South Asia , hidden beneath the grime and neglect of extreme poverty , there exists a little Somalia waiting to burst out and infect the body politic . 
This netherworld , patrolled and nourished by criminals who operate a vast black-market economy , has bred , in Mumbai , a community that has utter contempt for the state , because it knows that its survival depends on corrupting the police . Like underground magma , that underworld has now burst into the streets of Mumbai . 
Because the denizens of this netherworld know neither patriotism nor morality , they are easily lured into partnership with terrorists , particularly when they have reason to feel aggrieved . 
In Mumbai , a large proportion of them are Muslims who were denied space in the formal economy and have developed strong vested interests over the past 50 years . 
Details about the Mumbai outrage , where terrorists killed over 100 people , are still unfolding . 
It is likely that this operation was propelled from Pakistan through the Lashkar e Tauba , a terrorist organization sustained by hatred of secular India and backed by shadowy Pakistani agencies and street support . 
In the blood and drama of the events , however , we might miss a significant element of the story . 
The attacks were an operation that must have required months of planning : serious weapons were deployed , a small army was mobilized , targets were studied , transport was organized , and weak points identified . 
A plan of attack that involved hundreds of people was put in motion , and yet the massive infrastructure of India &apos;s government discovered nothing . 
The chief of India &apos;s Anti-Terrorist Squad , Hemant Karkare ( who lost his life in the battles that raged through the night ) received a death threat from the nearby city of Pune , but his own unit did not bother to investigate it , since it was busy playing games on behalf of its political masters . 
Complacency and politics gave the terrorists more protection than silence or camouflage ever could . 
Indeed , the attacks represent more than a failure of police work . 
They represent a collapse of governance ; these are the wages of the sins of administrative incompetence and political malfeasance . 
India is a tough nation . 
No one should have illusions about that . 
It has fought off Muslim terrorists in Kashmir , Sikh terrorists in Punjab , Christian terrorists in Nagaland , and Hindu terrorists in Assam and across the country . 
It understands that you cannot blame the whole community for the sins of a few . 
But under ineffectual governance , particularly during the last three years , India is in danger of degenerating into a soft state . 
Instead of being an international leader in the worldwide war against terrorism , it is sinking into the despair of a perpetual victim . 
Indeed , India stands only behind Iraq in the number of people killed each year in terrorist attacks . 
Three years ago , Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh rather smugly told President George W. Bush in Delhi that Indian Muslims were not involved in any act of terrorism . 
The implication was that the integration of Muslims in Indian society constituted a success story . Muslims , Singh implied , also benefit from the virtues of democracy , a conclusion that Bush happily repeated . 
But Singh certainly did not fool any of the terrorists , some of whom may have read his self-congratulation as a challenge for them to act . 
I am an Indian and a Muslim and proud to be both . 
Like any Indian , today I am angry , frustrated , and depressed . 
I am angry at the manic dogs of war who have invaded Mumbai . 
I am frustrated by the impotence of my government in Mumbai and Delhi , tone-deaf to the anguish of my fellow citizens . 
And I am depressed at the damage being done to the idea of India .
