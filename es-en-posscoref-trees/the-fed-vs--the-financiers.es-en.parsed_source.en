The Fed vs. the Financiers 
In his August 31 address to the world &apos;s most influential annual monetary policy conference in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , United States Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke coolly explained why the Fed is determined to resist pressure to stabilize swooning equity and housing prices . 
Bernanke &apos;s principled position - echoed by European Central Bank head Jean Claude Trichet and Bank of England head Mervyn King - has set off a storm in markets , accustomed to the attentive pampering lavished on them by Bernanke &apos;s predecessor , Alan Greenspan . 
This is certainly high-stakes poker , with huge sums hanging in the balance in the $ 170 trillion global financial market . 
Investors , who viewed Greenspan as a warm security blanket , now lavish him with fat six-figure speaking fees . 
But who is right , Bernanke or Greenspan ? 
Central bankers or markets ? 
A bit of intellectual history is helpful in putting today &apos;s debate in context . 
Bernanke , who took over at the Fed in 2006 , launched his policy career in 1999 with a brilliant paper presented to the same Jackson Hole conference . 
As an academic , Bernanke argued that central banks should be wary of second-guessing massive global securities markets . 
They should ignore fluctuations in equity and housing prices , unless there is clear and compelling evidence of dangerous feedback into output and inflation . 
Greenspan listened patiently and quietly to Bernanke &apos;s logic . 
On the surface , Bernanke &apos;s view seems intellectually unassailable . 
Central bankers cannot explain equity or housing prices and their movements any better than investors can . 
In short , no central banker can be the Oracle of Delphi . 
Indeed , many academic economists believe that central bankers could perfectly well be replaced with a computer programmed to implement a simple rule that adjusts interest rates mechanically in response to output and inflation . 
But , while Bernanke &apos;s view is theoretically rigorous , reality is not . 
One problem is that academic models assume that central banks actually know what output and inflation are in real time . 
In fact , central banks typically only have very fuzzy measures . 
Just a month ago , for example , the US statistical authorities significantly downgraded their estimate of national output for 2004 ! 
The problem is worse in most other countries . 
Brazil , for example , uses visits to doctors to measure health-sector output , regardless of what happens to the patient . 
China &apos;s statistical agency is still mired in communist input-output accounting . 
Even inflation can be very hard to measure precisely . 
What can price stability possibly mean in an era when new goods and services are constantly being introduced , and at a faster rate than ever before ? 
US statisticians have tried to &quot; fix &quot; the consumer price index to account for new products , but many experts believe that measured US inflation is still at least one percentage point too high , and the margin of error can be more volatile than conventional CPI inflation itself . 
So , while monetary policy can in theory be automated , as computer programmers say , &quot; garbage in , garbage out . &quot; 
Stock and housing prices may be volatile , but the data are much cleaner and timelier than anything available for output and inflation . 
This is why central bankers must think about the information embedded in asset prices . 
In fact , this summer &apos;s asset price correction reinforced a view many of us already had that the US economy was slowing , led by sagging productivity and a deteriorating housing market . 
I foresee a series of interest rate cuts by the Fed , which should not be viewed as a concession to asset markets , but rather as recognition that the real economy needs help . 
In a sense , a central bank &apos;s relationship with asset markets is like that of a man who claims he is going to the ballet to make himself happy , not to make his wife happy . 
Perhaps Bernanke will soon come to feel the same way , now that his honeymoon as Fed chairman is over .
