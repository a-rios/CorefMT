China &apos;s and the WTO : Unfinished Business 
China &apos;s tortuous road toward membership in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) is winding toward its end . 
Before China joins , however , the final terms on which it enters the WTO must be negotiated with a group of WTO members acting on behalf of the organization and expressed in a formal agreement , the Protocol of Accession . 
Big legal issues that have been put to the side must now be tackled . 
When China joins the WTO , it will become committed ( like all other members ) to policies and practices that have been agreed on by the international community of trading nations and are expressed in the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) and other multilateral treaties . 
China &apos;s lengthy negotiations with the US and the European Union over WTO membership largely focused on vexatious economic issues , such as lowering tariffs , ending quotas on exports to China , opening its market to key imports where access has hitherto been excluded or limited , and permitting foreign investment in industries such as telecommunications . 
Those bilateral negotiations will benefit other members of the WTO as well , because membership in the WTO obligates China to treat all other members equally . 
Too little attention has been paid , however , to other matters that will also affect all WTO members , namely the measures that China must take to raise its level of legality to meet standards set down in the GATT . 
A draft of the Protocol of Accession - under negotiation for years but not yet final - contains provisions that could change Chinese law and accelerate the construction of a legal system , a process that only began twenty years ago when Deng Xiaoping launched China &apos;s economic reforms . 
China has already agreed to move toward meeting relevant WTO standards , such as Article X of the GATT , which obligates members to apply trade laws in a &quot; uniform , fair and reasonable manner . &quot; 
In China , however , such uniformity is unattainable today because the actions of local governments frequently diverge from central government policy . 
China &apos;s courts and the salaries of its judges are funded , not by the Beijing , but by local governments , which makes judges and the courts beholden to them . 
Fairness and reasonableness are also distant goals , because there is vast disorder among Chinese law-making institutions , central and local alike . 
The draft Protocol contains language in which China agrees to establish independent &quot; tribunals ... and procedures for the prompt review of all disputes relating to the implementation of laws , regulations , judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application . &quot; 
China cannot meet this standard , either . 
Chinese law limits the types of bureaucratic actions that can be challenged by lawsuit , such as abuses of discretion . 
Also , Chinese law limits the questioning of administrative rules before they are put into practice . 
Although much activity is under way to draft legislation to reform administrative law , these drafts are unlikely to be adopted for years . 
These issues are of enormous practical importance for companies doing business with China . 
For unless these changes are made , how can businessmen know how to ascertain the lawfulness of the actions of Chinese officials , such as imposing fees or penalties , refusing to award contracts , or imposing conditions on contract approvals ? 
The draft Protocol does not yet require China to adopt rules to govern administrative procedure or the standards of evidence to be used by administrative agencies . 
Nor does it address deficiencies in existing legislation that prevent challenges to the rules on which agencies base their decisions or to the exercise of discretion by bureaucrats . 
The Protocol &apos;s current draft , indeed , falls well short of the necessary specificity . 
Even if the language of the Protocol is sharpened before China joins the WTO , China &apos;s trading partners should hold realistic expectations about the limited results China can attain even if its reforms are energetic and sincere . 
A legal tradition vastly different from the West , and decades of Maoist rule before the Deng era , make rapid change in Chinese legal institutions impossible . 
The consequences of this may be severe . 
China &apos;s failure to meet GATT standards may catalyze any number of disputes , enough to overload the WTO dispute settlement process , and the processes of obtaining decisions and implementing them could be very time-consuming . 
What is to be done ? 
China &apos;s trading partners and foreign NGO &apos;s can provide needed assistance to China by supporting programs that foster improvements in Chinese legality . 
The EU , Canada and the Asian Development Bank are already engaged in such efforts . 
Despite past refusal by America &apos;s Congress to fund programs to further the rule of law in China , recent US legislation authorizes modest efforts to provide assistance to increase China &apos;s capacity to meet its obligations as a WTO member . 
China &apos;s admission to the WTO will mark another stage of its membership in the international community . 
None of this should be greeted with euphoria , for China &apos;s markets will not open magically and China &apos;s governance will not change quickly . 
Successful change will require clear expectations and much effort on all sides .
