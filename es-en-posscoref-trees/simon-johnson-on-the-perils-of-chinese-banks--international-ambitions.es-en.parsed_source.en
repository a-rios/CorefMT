Are China &apos;s Banks Next ? 
WASHINGTON , DC - America &apos;s recent bout of dysfunctional politics and the eurozone &apos;s on-again , off-again crisis should , on the face of it , present a golden opportunity to China . 
To be sure , the malaise in the United States and Europe is likely to hurt Chinese exports ; but , over the long term , China wants to reorient its economy toward domestic consumption . 
With the Tea Party wing of America &apos;s Republican Party scaring investors out of the dollar , interest in the Chinese renminbi &apos;s potential as an international reserve currency can only increase . 
This will help China to attract more investors seeking to diversify their portfolios . 
Chinese government debt will become an important global benchmark asset , which should help its private sector to attract funding on reasonable terms , while the predominance of the US Federal Reserve in determining worldwide monetary conditions would presumably diminish . 
The decades-old shift to a multipolar world for manufacturing could thus lead to a more multipolar currency world , with the renminbi as an important player . 
But , despite its unique history and current advantages , China harbors a weakness that is quite similar to what has caused so much trouble in the US and Europe : big banks that have an incentive not to be careful . 
China &apos;s latest moves suggest that while it may now enjoy some years of greater prominence , its encouragement of its financial institutions to go global is likely to lead to serious trouble . 
Ironically , the British government , while no doubt just trying to be hospitable to foreign investors by laying out a red carpet , is helping to set a trap for Chinese financial institutions - and the broader Chinese economy . 
By encouraging China to build global financial institutions with light regulation , the United Kingdom is not just inviting irresponsible behavior ; it could help to pull an entire economy toward ultimately unproductive and even self-destructive activities . 
China has long kept tight control over its main banks . 
Credit policies have helped to juice the economy from time to time , but the authorities have also retained the ability to slow things down when warranted . 
Banking has become an instrument of economic policy to ensure GDP growth and employment creation , while keeping inflation at an acceptable level . 
But the Chinese policy elite are also very taken with the idea that a first-rank country needs a prominent banking system that is active internationally . 
There is nothing wrong with this ambition , as long as it is handled with great caution . 
Unfortunately , it is now becoming clear that the hard lessons of recent financial crises have been lost on China . 
Bankers never like tight regulation - and they particularly do not appreciate being required to fund their operations with more equity relative to debt . 
In both good times and bad , their refrain is , &quot; We need lower capital requirements , &quot; meaning they should be allowed to borrow more . 
Iceland , Switzerland , and the UK have all learned the hard way that allowing banks to become big relative to their economies brings with it great risks . 
Bailouts become more expensive and - as in the case of Iceland - may actually be unaffordable . 
Even when , as in the UK , the cost of losses is not completely ruinous , the direct damage to domestic credit and to broader confidence can be enough to hold back the economy for a half-decade or more . 
Mervyn King , the former governor of the Bank of England ( BoE ) , is reported to have said , &quot; Banks live globally and die locally . &quot; 
In other words , when everything is going well , you may be willing to believe that it does not matter where a particular international bank gets its equity funding and in which jurisdiction its debts are issued . 
But when bad things happen and there is pressure on financial markets , with fear of insolvency in the air , it matters a great deal if you have a claim on an insured bank in the United States or on an essentially unregulated offshore subsidiary . 
China wants to build up its banks &quot; international operations . 
And the British are welcoming an expansion of these activities in London - offering to treat Chinese banks operating there as branches ( subject to Chinese regulation ) rather than as subsidiaries ( subject to British regulation ) . 
Mark Carney , King &apos;s successor at the BoE , said , &quot; We are open for business , &quot; in terms of providing liquidity loans to backstop big banks . 
But UK banks &quot; assets amounted to eight times the country &apos;s GDP before the crisis and will presumably approach that level again with Carney &apos;s encouragement . 
Can the BoE - and the UK Treasury - really provide downside insurance for this full amount , or are the UK authorities set on the path to becoming another Iceland ( where the value of bank assets peaked at more than 11 times the country &apos;s GDP ) ? 
The Chinese authorities should take another look at their policies . 
China is like Cinderella - finally allowed to attend the ball and given a chance to become a prominent player . 
But midnight could come very quickly , and financial crises do not have fairytale endings .
