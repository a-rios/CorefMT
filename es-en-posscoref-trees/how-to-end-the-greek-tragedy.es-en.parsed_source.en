How to End the Greek Tragedy 
SANTIAGO - European leaders , faced with the reality of an insolvent Greece , are reportedly now considering a &quot; Plan B &quot; that would involve reducing the burden of its future debt payments . 
This is a welcome contrast to the options considered so far , all of which involved - under different guises - foisting more debt onto a country that has too much of it already . 
Greek public debt today stands at nearly 160 % of the country &apos;s official GDP . 
Suppose Greece took 25 years to bring it down to the Maastricht ceiling of 60 % . 
If the real interest rate on Greek debt were 4 % ( more or less what Greece is paying now for the emergency loans from the European Union ) and annual GDP grew by 2 % on average , the required primary fiscal surplus each year for the next quarter-century would be 5.7 % of GDP . 
That is an unimaginably large burden , and it risks condemning Greece to permanent recession and social unrest . 
A possible counterargument is that Greece has a large informal economy , so its actual GDP is larger than the official figure . 
As a result , the debt ratios commonly applied to Greece could be overstated . 
But informal output is of little use for debt service if it cannot be taxed . 
In any case , the scope for tax increases is severely limited in an economy that is shrinking quickly . 
The conclusion is clear : Greece &apos;s debt-service burden is too large , and it must be reduced . 
This can be accomplished in two ways : sharply cutting the interest rate paid by Greece , or reducing the face value of the debt . 
Some analysts - most prominently Jeffrey Sachs - have argued that the best way forward is to cut the yield on Greek debt to that of German public debt . 
Germany currently pays a little over 3 % nominal interest on 10-year debt , half of what Greece is being charged for emergency loans - and far less than Greece would pay if it attempted to raise money in private markets . 
This approach has several advantages : by leaving the face value of the debt unaltered , EU officials could argue that restructuring Greece &apos;s debt did not amount to a default , thereby limiting contagion . 
European banks holding Greek government debt could keep pretending that it is worth its full value . 
And the European Central Bank would have fewer excuses to refuse Greek bonds as collateral . 
The question is whether the change in coupons - possibly coupled with an extension of maturities - would be enough to stabilize the Greek economy and restore growth . 
Even with German-level interest rates , Greece would have to run a primary surplus of at least 2 % of GDP - still quite large , and far from today &apos;s deficit . 
And , with the face value of the debt unchanged , the psychological drag on expectations and investment might linger . 
The alternative is to cut the face value of Greece &apos;s debt . 
European leaders seem to be moving in this direction . 
The required cut is large : eliminating half of Greece &apos;s public debt obligation would leave it at nearly 80 % of GDP , a ratio higher than Spain &apos;s . 
Talk of &quot; haircuts &quot; for private investors immediately triggers concerns about contagion . 
But markets are already assigning a high probability to a Greek default . 
The rating agencies have long placed Greek debt deep in junk territory , and are now giving Portuguese and Irish debt the same status . 
Rising spreads in Spain and Italy show that contagion is already occurring , even in the absence of an official decision to write down Greek debt . 
The EU is pinning its hopes on one mechanism to reduce Greek debt : loans from the European Financial Stability Facility that would allow Greece to buy its own debt at a discount in the secondary market . 
But , while allowing the EFSF to finance buybacks is a step forward , a slew of theoretical and empirical research , generated by developing countries &quot; efforts to buy back their debt in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , has shown that it is far from a cure-all . 
The main reason is simple : as debt is reduced , its price rises in the secondary market , sharply curtailing the benefits to the borrower . 
So far , policymakers are talking only about exchanging old Greek bonds for cash ( in buybacks ) or new Greek bonds . 
It would be far preferable to exchange them for Eurobonds , backed by the full faith and credit of all eurozone countries . 
Nor are European ministers , still struggling to catch up with reality , yet considering involuntary debt exchanges . 
But , if the past 18 months are any guide , they soon will be .
