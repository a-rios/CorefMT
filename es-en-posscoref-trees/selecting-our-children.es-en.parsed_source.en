Selecting Our Children 
MELBOURNE - In April , Germany &apos;s parliament placed limits on the use of genetic diagnosis . 
Is the new German law a model for other countries to follow as we grapple with the ethical issues posed by our growing knowledge of human genetics ? 
Some provisions of the German law draw on the widely shared ethical principles of respect for individual autonomy and privacy . 
No one can be tested without his or her consent . 
Neither employers , nor insurance companies , may require genetic testing . 
Individuals are granted both the right to know - to be informed of the results of any genetic test about themselves - and the right to choose to live in ignorance of what a genetic test may predict about their future . 
To discriminate against or stigmatize anyone on account of their genetic characteristics is prohibited . 
Desirable as these provisions seem , they could impose a heavy cost on German companies . If insurance companies outside Germany are permitted to require genetic tests while German companies are prohibited from doing so , then people who know they have life-shortening genetic diagnoses will get their life insurance from German insurance companies . 
These companies will then find themselves making more payments for premature deaths relative to their competitors . 
To cover the increased costs , they will have to raise premiums , making themselves uncompetitive . 
In an attempt to mitigate this problem , the law specifies that anyone taking out an insurance policy valued at more than â‚¬ 300,000 may be required to disclose the results of prior genetic tests . 
But if people lie about whether they have previously been tested , that provision will be moot . 
As genetic testing becomes increasingly able to predict not only health , but also some cognitive and personality traits , the prohibition on employer testing may also put German employers at a disadvantage in the international marketplace . 
They will invest resources in training employees whom their competitors will exclude from the initial pool of recruits . 
This may be a humane thing to do , for it gives every individual a chance , irrespective of the genetic odds against their paying their way for the company . 
But , in the long term , if we are serious about prohibiting such tests , we need an international agreement - on both insurance and employment - to ensure a level playing field for all countries . 
That will not be easy to achieve in a globally competitive economy in which some nations have demonstrably less respect for individual human rights than others . 
The German law &apos;s most controversial feature is a prohibition on prenatal genetic testing for diseases that will manifest themselves only in adulthood . 
Consider , for example , a woman who knows that her partner has the gene for Huntington &apos;s disease . 
Any child of his has a 50 % chance of inheriting the condition . 
If the child does inherit it , he or she will , at around 40 , begin to suffer uncontrollable movements , personality changes , and a slow deterioration of cognitive capacities . 
People with Huntington &apos;s disease usually die about 15 years after the onset of the symptoms . 
There is no cure . 
No parents could want this future for their children . 
Prenatal testing of fetuses ( or of in vitro embryos before transfer to the uterus ) is now well established throughout the developed world . 
If the test is positive , the pregnancy can be terminated , or , in the case of pre-implantation diagnosis , the embryo will be discarded . 
The new German law makes such tests a crime . 
The same is true of tests for the genes that strongly predispose women to breast cancer . 
As genetics advances , more such late-onset conditions will become detectable prenatally . 
What could be the thinking behind such a law ? 
One might take the view that 40 years of life before the onset of Huntington &apos;s disease or breast cancer is better than no life at all . 
But if we take that into account , should we not also take into consideration the life of the child who the parents would have had , if they had been able to use prenatal diagnosis and be sure of having a child who does not carry the gene for the disease ? 
Surely that child has better life prospects . 
When we have a choice between lives with such different prospects - and can make the choice before the embryo or fetus has any awareness at all - shouldn &apos;t we be able to choose the child with the better prospects ? 
It is not surprising that questions about genetic tests should receive special attention in Germany , given the national imperative of avoiding any repetition of the crimes of the Nazi era . 
But , in their laudable desire to distance themselves as much as possible from those atrocities , Germany &apos;s legislators have enacted a law that makes it a crime to use modern science to avoid undoubted human tragedies . 
That is an absurd outcome . 
The pendulum has swung too far .
