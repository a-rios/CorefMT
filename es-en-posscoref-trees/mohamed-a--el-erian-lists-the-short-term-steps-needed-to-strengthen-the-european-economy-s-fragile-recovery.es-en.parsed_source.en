Cementing Europe &apos;s Recovery 
BRUSSELS - During my current trip to Europe , I have been encouraged by the hope and deeper sense of economic and financial calm that has arrived this spring . 
With risk spreads compressing markedly , the region &apos;s financial crisis has been relegated to the history books , and the region is again attracting the interest of foreign investors . 
Consumer confidence is recovering as well , and businesses are again looking to expand , albeit cautiously . 
Economic growth has picked up and unemployment , while still alarmingly high , has stopped increasing in most countries . 
Remarkably , all of this is occurring in the context of a major geopolitical crisis to the east , following what the Financial Times rightly pointed out constitutes &quot; the first annexation of another European country &apos;s territory since the Second World War . &quot; 
Equally disturbing , Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea has occurred with stunning ease - indeed , simply &quot; with the stroke of a pen , &quot; as the FT put it . 
Yet , rather than disrupt its growing confidence and composure , the Ukrainian crisis has been a catalyst for renewed political cooperation and solidarity within Western Europe . 
It has also fostered closer relations with the US at a time when political leaders face inevitable headwinds in completing historic negotiations on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) , aimed at boosting economic ties in a manner consistent with a strengthened multilateral system . 
Europe badly needs all of this good economic and financial news . 
The region has only just exited a recession that has devastated many livelihoods . 
Far too many citizens are still trapped in long-term unemployment , while a distressing number of young people struggle to secure a job - any job . 
The region &apos;s ongoing recovery is also good news for a global economy that has yet to rebalance properly and fire on all available growth cylinders . 
US growth , while edging up , is still below its potential , let alone high enough to offset prior shortfalls . 
And several systemically important emerging economies ( including Brazil , China , and Turkey ) have slowed , while their transitions to new growth models remain incomplete . 
But Europe &apos;s renewed sense of hope and confidence , however encouraging , is not sufficient - at least not yet - to produce appreciable welfare gains for current and future generations . 
A few things need to happen rather quickly - specifically , over the next several weeks and months - if the continent is to minimize the risk of slipping into another prolonged period of under-performance and additional asymmetrical downside financial risk . 
Let us start with the immediate geopolitical threat . 
To put it bluntly , Europe &apos;s economy , and even more so the economies of Russia and Ukraine , is not particularly well positioned to weather a further disorderly escalation of tensions . 
Enlightened diplomacy needs to replace the Cold War-style posturing and rhetoric that have re-emerged . 
Further escalation would mostly likely cause the West to impose deeper economic and ( critically ) financial sanctions on Russia , followed by Russian counter-sanctions that would disrupt the energy flow to Europe . 
All of this would tip Europe as a whole into recession and renewed financial turmoil . 
Second , the European Central Bank needs to pivot from financial-crisis prevention - an area where it has performed impressively - to striking the delicate balance of supporting growth ( and countering currency over-appreciation ) without fueling excessive risk taking . 
This may well involve renewed experimentation , which would again take many policymakers outside their comfort zone . 
Third , with European institutions acting as catalysts , political leaders will need to reinforce efforts to place the eurozone as a whole on a firm footing . 
This requires complimenting monetary union with deeper political integration , better fiscal coordination ( where progress has been painfully slow ) , and a proper banking union ( last month &apos;s agreement should be treated as a stepping stone , not the ultimate destination ) . 
Fourth , at the national level , individual countries need to continue to rebalance their policies with a view to achieving the trifecta of structural reforms , solid aggregate demand , and fewer debt overhangs . 
Finally , anti-establishment parties must not dominate the European Parliament election in May . 
Most of these parties are committed to greater national isolation and , at least initially , would work hard to halt and reverse recent gains made on regional economic and financial integration . 
That is quite a to-do list , to be sure , especially given that it only covers the next few weeks and months . 
Yet every item on it is achievable , and progress on each would help to ensure that Europe &apos;s encouraging spring leads to a bountiful harvest of economic opportunity , growth , and jobs , while reducing the risk of a hot political summer and a more frigid economic winter .
