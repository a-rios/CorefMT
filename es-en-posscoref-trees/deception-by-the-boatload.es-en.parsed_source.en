Deception by the Boatload 
NEW DELHI - China &apos;s announcement that its first aircraft carrier is ready to set sail as early as the end of this month has refocused attention on the country &apos;s naval ambitions . 
So , too , has the Pakistani defense minister &apos;s disclosure that his country recently asked China to start building a naval base at its strategically positioned port of Gwadar , on the Arabian Sea . 
Both revelations underscore China &apos;s preference for strategic subterfuge . 
After it bought the 67,500-ton , Soviet-era Varyag carrier - still little more than a hull when the Soviet Union collapsed - China repeatedly denied that it had any intention to refit it for naval deployment . 
For example , Zhang Guangqin , Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Science , Technology , and Industry for National Defense , said in 2005 that the Varyag was not being modified for military use . 
However , work to refit the carrier had already begun in Dalian , China &apos;s main shipyard . 
In order to deflect attention from the real plan , the state-run media reported plans to turn the Varyag into a &quot; floating casino &quot; near Macau . 
And , to lend credence to that claim , the two smaller Soviet-era aircraft carriers that were purchased with the Varyag in 1998-2000 were developed into floating museums . 
The first official acknowledgement that China was turning the Varyag into a fully refurbished , deployable aircraft carrier came this month , just when it was almost ready to set sail . 
And the acknowledgement came from General Chen Bingde , the chief of the People &apos;s Liberation Army , in an interview with Global Times , the Communist Party &apos;s hawkish mouthpiece . 
Subterfuge is also apparent in China &apos;s plans at Gwadar , where a Chinese-built but still-underused commercial port opened in 2007 . 
From the time construction of the port began , Gwadar was widely seen as representing China &apos;s first strategic foothold in the Arabian Sea , as part of its strategy to assemble a &quot; string of pearls &quot; along the Indian Ocean rim . 
It was known that Gwadar , which overlooks Gulf shipping lanes and is near the Iran border , would eventually double as a naval base . 
Yet , all along , China continued to insist that Gwadar &apos;s only role was commercial . 
Not surprisingly , then , Pakistani Defense Minister Ahmed Mukhtar &apos;s public comments about a naval base at Gwadar deeply embarrassed China &apos;s government . 
At the end of a recent visit to Beijing with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani , Mukhtar reported that the Chinese government was more than happy to oblige whatever requests for assistance the Pakistani side made , including reaching an agreement to take over operation of the Gwadar port after the existing contract with a Singaporean government company expires . 
China also made a gift to Pakistan of 50 JF-17 fighter jets . 
More importantly , Mukhtar disclosed that Pakistan had asked China to begin building the naval base . 
&quot; We would be ... grateful to the Chinese government if a naval base is ... constructed at the site of Gwadar for Pakistan , &quot; he announced in a statement . 
He later told a British newspaper in an interview : &quot; We have asked our Chinese brothers to please build a naval base at Gwadar . &quot; 
After Pakistan revealed the plans for a naval base , China responded with equivocation , saying that &quot; this issue was not touched upon &quot; during the visit . 
Given China &apos;s proclivity for strategic stealth , even its work on the Gwadar port was launched quietly . 
Moreover , China does not wish to deepen the concerns that it aroused in Asia last year by openly discarding Deng Xiaoping &apos;s dictum , tao guang yang hui ( &quot; conceal ambitions and hide claws &quot; ) . 
On a host of issues , including its territorial claims in the South China Sea and against Japan and India , China spent 2010 staking out a more muscular position . 
On these issues , too , the gap between Chinese officials &quot; words and actions is revealing . 
For example , China persisted with its unannounced rare-earth embargo against Japan for seven weeks while continuing to claim in public that no export restrictions had been imposed . 
Like its denials last year about deploying Chinese troops in Pakistani-held Kashmir to build strategic projects , China has demonstrated a troubling propensity to obscure the truth . 
The Global Times , however , has not been shy about advertising China &apos;s interest in establishing naval bases overseas . 
In a recent editorial , &quot; China Needs Overseas Bases for Global Role , &quot; the newspaper urged the outside world to &quot; understand China &apos;s need to set up overseas military bases . &quot; 
The insurrection against Pakistani rule in the mineral-rich southern province of Baluchistan may impede China &apos;s plan to turn Gwadar into an energy transshipment hub to transport Gulf and African oil to western China by pipeline . 
But the insurgency is no barrier to China &apos;s use of Gwadar to project power in the Middle East and East Africa , and against peninsula India . 
Indeed , to get into the Great Power maritime game , China needs Gwadar to redress its main weakness - the absence of a naval anchor in the Indian Ocean region , where it plans to have an important military presence . 
What was touted as a floating casino is now being launched as the floating centerpiece of China &apos;s growing naval prowess . 
In fact , with a second and larger aircraft carrier currently under construction , it may not be long before China displays its naval capabilities by dispatching a carrier battle group to the Indian Ocean - if not basing one at Gwadar .
