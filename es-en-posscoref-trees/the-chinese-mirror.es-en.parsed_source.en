The Chinese Mirror 
TOKYO - The closing decade of the twentieth century offered a crystal ball for anyone peering into the future of the Asia-Pacific region . 
Japan &apos;s economy , once the region &apos;s leader , was &quot; lost &quot; after its asset bubble burst , whereas China overcame the economic stagnation that followed the Tiananmen Square crisis of 1989 to achieve its current path of strong growth . 
The debate raging 10 years ago about China &apos;s rapid growth - whether it represents a danger or an opportunity - has now settled into broad agreement that wider regional development would be impossible without it . 
Further geo-political implications for the region and the world follow from three key changes in China . 
The first concerns the pattern of Chinese economic growth , which so far has been achieved mainly by rapid increases in factor inputs - labor , capital , and energy . 
But recent research suggests that about one-third of China &apos;s economic growth comes from technological progress , or from the increase in total factor productivity . 
In other words , China &apos;s growth pattern is becoming similar to that of industrialized economies , suggesting that growth will be increasingly balanced . 
The second transformation is the substantial appreciation of the renminbi that seems inevitable in the coming years . 
Today , given the importance of exports to China &apos;s economy , its government is reluctant to permit a major revaluation , despite strong pressure by foreign governments to allow the renminbi to appreciate in line with the country &apos;s huge trade surplus . 
But Chinese officials know that renminbi appreciation is also in China &apos;s interest , as they seek to dampen inflationary pressures . 
China &apos;s government therefore appears ready to allow the renminbi to appreciate , the question being how fast . 
From 2003-2005 , long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers , the renminbi appreciated by 20 % . 
In light of China &apos;s rapid economic growth and the renminbi &apos;s growing strength , Chinese GDP ( based on the market dollar rate ) will likely exceed that of the US much earlier than expected , possibly in 10-15 years . 
And , when measured in terms of purchasing power parity , China &apos;s GDP will reach that of the US around 2015 , thus changing the world &apos;s balance of economic power . 
The third transformation is demographic : the fallout from China &apos;s official one-child policy , which will cause the working-age population to start declining in the mid-2010 &quot; s . 
This will cause economic growth to slacken , complicating effective management of China &apos;s domestic problems , which range from deep income disparities to the lack of political institutions capable of channeling popular grievances and demands . 
In these circumstances , the role of the country &apos;s political leadership will become much more important . 
Although the current president , Hu Jintao , is due to step down in 2012 , he will continue to hold a degree of power through the military , so the succession of power to the next generation will not be completed until around 2015 . 
Although Chinese GDP is large and growing , its per capita income is still low , and its economic policies differ sharply from those prevailing in the region &apos;s OECD countries . 
The geopolitical landscape that emerges around the middle of this decade will thus reflect significant changes elsewhere in Asia as well . 
Even so , Chinese policy choices significantly influence other Asian countries , with China &apos;s &quot; state capitalist &quot; economic model now being mimicked elsewhere in the region . 
Of course , Japan , Korea , and Singapore had similar policy models in the past ( though they later adapted them in line with their GDP growth ) . 
Now , however , these countries are once again espousing forms of state capitalism and a return to industrial policy ( encouraged as well by the 2008 global financial meltdown , which gave a new rationale for a return to government intervention ) . 
In Japan , postal services that had been privatized are to be re-nationalized , and the role of government finance is being strengthened . 
Japan Air Lines , which was almost bankrupt , was rescued by a government bailout , a device that seems to be increasingly common . 
Similarly , while many Asian countries already have sovereign wealth funds , now South Korea &apos;s government is establishing a new type of fund to support the construction sector &apos;s export activities . 
In short , closer business-government relationships are being re-established throughout the Asian-Pacific region . 
Countries are especially seeking to strengthen their infrastructure exports through a combination of public- and private-sector activity . 
But that means that international regulations will be needed to limit government intervention , or at least to define the circumstances in which it will be deemed acceptable . 
To achieve this , the United States and China must reconcile their very different views of how a market economy should operate . 
As the world begins to grapple with the creation of a new economic order , the moderating role of a third party in conflicts between the US and China will be extremely important . 
It is a role that will fall to Japan for Asian-Pacific issues , but to European countries on global issues . 
If Europe can successfully manage this role , US-China tensions can be overcome , offering the entire world the opportunity to harness and benefit from the strength of its two largest economies .
