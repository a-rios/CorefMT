The World After November 
MADRID - On November 6 , either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will emerge victorious after an exhausting electoral race , setting the wheels in motion for the coming four years . 
An ocean away , on November 8 , more than 2,000 members of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) will gather in Beijing . 
Approximately a week later , the members of the Politburo Standing Committee will walk out in hierarchical order , preparing to take charge of a growing country of 1.3 billion people . 
The leaders of the world &apos;s two largest economies are changing . 
The Middle East , in particular , is experiencing a moment of intense transformation . 
While reconstruction - both literal and figurative - is commencing in some parts of the region , countries like Syria are aflame . 
Others , such as Iran , with its moribund revolution , have never ceased rumbling . 
Amidst a crumbling economy , the country remains belligerent , using its Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah , to launch at least one successful drone flight above Israel and reportedly initiating recent cyber attacks . 
As a result , relations among regional actors remain tense . 
After his speech at the United Nations appealing for a &quot; red line &quot; on the Iranian nuclear program in the spring or summer of 2013 , Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called an early general election , which could potentially give him a strong mandate for action against Iran . 
Egypt , meanwhile , is finding its own equilibrium , both domestically , drafting a new constitution , and in terms of foreign policy . 
Then there is Turkey , straddling Europe and the Middle East . 
This is part of the changing panorama that new world leaders will inherit in the Middle East - a region in which the United States has been deeply involved . 
After nearly a decade of draining military engagement , the US combat mission in Iraq concluded in 2010 , and the combat mission in Afghanistan is set to end in 2014 . 
The next American president will also inherit a country with a markedly changed geopolitical perspective . 
Technological advances and innovation have begun to turn the longstanding dream of energy independence into a reality . 
Whereas extraction of America &apos;s extensive reserves of natural gas was previously thought to be unfeasible , technologies such as hydraulic fracturing ( &quot; fracking &quot; ) have ushered in a shale-gas revolution . 
Indeed , the US is on the cusp of energy self-sufficiency . 
Last year , for the first time in 15 years , less than one-half of the oil consumed in the US was imported . 
Annual growth in shale-gas production has increased from 17 % between 2000 and 2006 to 48 % between 2006 and 2010 . 
By 2035 , shale gas is projected to account for roughly one-half of total US energy production . 
The repercussions of this revolution will not be only economic . 
But it is not just the new US leader who will inherit a changed world . 
Across the Pacific , the days of record-breaking economic growth in Asia - a key component of social and political stability - may be coming to an end . 
Indeed , events in China in recent months have revealed internal unease . 
Though nationalist sentiment directed against external foes tends to divert attention temporarily from internal turmoil , the country &apos;s serious domestic problems need to be addressed . 
China &apos;s economy and politics , ideologically transformed in all but name , will soon need to be adapted to address rising social inequality . 
Despite global economic headwinds , China &apos;s leaders will surely remain focused on maintaining and boosting growth , in order to lift more Chinese out of poverty and avert social unrest ; they are also certain to continue monitoring the oil-rich Middle East . 
After years of relying on America &apos;s presence in the region , playing an advantageous waiting game , China &apos;s next leaders may embrace a more active role . 
Meanwhile , the European Union is struggling with its own demons . 
Despite the EU &apos;s need to focus inward while weathering the global economic crisis , the Union must not abandon its neighbors to the south . 
It is crucial to engage with the southern Mediterranean region as a critical meeting point - a place of political , economic , and energy cooperation . 
In this respect , the EU &apos;s most valuable tools are its signature , Nobel Prize-winning model of multilateral dialogue and soft power . 
Next door , Russia , too , must respond to new vulnerabilities stemming from changing global conditions . 
The Kremlin continues to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , maintaining a strict aversion to military intervention and seeking to defend its strategic interests , including its naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus . 
That stance has translated , most obviously , into repeated vetoes of UN Security Council resolutions aimed at ending a conflict that has already produced tens of thousands of victims . 
International inaction on Syria is bad news not only for the country &apos;s people ; it is also eroding the legitimacy of one of the world &apos;s most important multilateral institutions . 
Given that the issues of Iran and Syria are closely connected , internal division among the Security Council &apos;s five permanent members ( the US , China , Britain , France , and Russia ) could be extremely damaging to the search for a solution to Iran &apos;s nuclear-enrichment drive . 
Too much is at stake , which is why all possible tracks for a negotiated outcome must be pursued . 
Whether or not recent rumors of bilateral US-Iran talks prove true , such initiatives should be welcomed . 
While the big players remain preoccupied with their internal changes , the region continues to smolder . 
The main question now is whether the leaders who emerge in November will be firefighters or fire starters .
