Debt-Friendly Stimulus 
NEW HAVEN - With much of the global economy apparently trapped in a long and painful austerity-induced slump , it is time to admit that the trap is entirely of our own making . 
We have constructed it from unfortunate habits of thought about how to handle spiraling public debt . 
People developed these habits on the basis of the experiences of their families and friends : when in debt trouble , one must cut spending and pass through a period of austerity until the burden ( debt relative to income ) is reduced . 
It seems like common sense - even moral virtue - to respond this way . 
But , while that approach to debt works well for a single household in trouble , it does not work well for an entire economy , for the spending cuts only worsen the problem . 
This is the paradox of thrift : belt-tightening causes people to lose their jobs , because other people are not buying what they produce , so their debt burden rises rather than falls . 
There is a way out of this trap , but only if we tilt the discussion about how to lower the debt / GDP ratio away from austerity - higher taxes and lower spending - toward debt-friendly stimulus : increasing taxes even more and raising government expenditure in the same proportion . 
That way , the debt / GDP ratio declines because the denominator ( economic output ) increases , not because the numerator ( the total the government has borrowed ) declines . 
This kind of enlightened stimulus runs into strong prejudices . 
For starters , people tend to think of taxes as a loathsome infringement on their freedom , as if petty bureaucrats will inevitably squander the increased revenue on useless and ineffective government employees and programs . 
People also believe that tax increases cannot realistically be purely temporary expedients in an economic crisis , and that they must be regarded as an opening wedge that should be avoided at all costs . 
History shows , however , that tax increases , if expressly designated as temporary , are indeed reversed later . 
That is what happens after major wars , for example . 
We need to consider such issues in trying to understand why , for example , Italian voters last month rejected the sober economist Mario Monti , who forced austerity on them , notably by raising property taxes . 
Italians are in the habit of thinking that tax increases necessarily go only to paying off rich investors , rather than to paying for government services like better roads and schools . 
Keynesian stimulus policy is habitually described as deficit spending , not tax-financed spending . 
Stimulus by tax cuts might almost seem to be built on deception , for its effect on consumption and investment expenditure seems to require individuals to forget that they will be taxed later for public spending today , when the government repays the debt with interest . 
If individuals were rational and well informed , they might conclude that they should not spend more , despite tax cuts , since the cuts are not real . 
We do not need to rely on such tricks to stimulate the economy and reduce the ratio of debt to income . 
The fundamental economic problem that currently troubles much of the world is insufficient demand . 
Businesses are not investing enough in new plants and equipment , or adding jobs , largely because people are not spending enough - or are not expected to spend enough in the future - to keep the economy going at full tilt . 
Debt-friendly stimulus might be regarded as nothing more than a collective decision by all of us to spend more to jump-start the economy . 
It has nothing to do with taking on debt or tricking people about future taxes . 
If left to individual decisions , people would not spend more on consumption , but maybe we can vote for a government that will compel us all to do that collectively , thereby creating enough demand to put the economy on an even keel in short order . 
Simply put , Keynesian stimulus does not necessarily entail more government debt , as popular discourse seems continually to assume . 
Because it is a collective decision , the spending naturally involves different kinds of consumption than we would make individually - say , better highways , rather than more dinners out . 
Balanced-budget stimulus was first advocated in the early 1940 &quot; s by William Salant , an economist in President Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s administration , and by Paul Samuelson , then a young economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
They argued that , because any government stimulus implies higher taxes sooner or later , the increase might as well come immediately . 
For the average person , the higher taxes do not mean lower after-tax income , because the stimulus will have the immediate effect of raising incomes . 
Many believe that balanced-budget stimulus - tax increases at a time of economic distress - is politically impossible . 
After all , French President Fran√ßois Hollande retreated under immense political pressure from his campaign promises to implement debt-friendly stimulus . 
Some form of debt-friendly stimulus might ultimately appeal to voters if they could be convinced that raising taxes does not necessarily mean hardship or increased centralization of decision-making . 
If and when people understand that it means the same average level of take-home pay after taxes , plus the benefits of more jobs and of the products of additional government expenditure ( such as new highways ) , they may well wonder why they ever tried stimulus any other way .
