Middle East Peace by Any Means Available 
RAMALLAH - Something is happening with the Middle East conflict , but it is hard to say what . 
A breakthrough appears to be at hand , though all the parties still seem to be clinging to their traditional positions . 
The Arab League gave the go-ahead to indirect Palestinian-Israeli talks , and the various Palestinian leadership forums have approved the resumption of talks . 
Even the usually boisterous Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat has toned down his rhetoric , and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas gave an optimistic interview to Israel TV . 
But Israel has not publicly agreed to the American and Palestinian request to rescind the settlement construction in Jerusalem approved during US Vice President Joe Biden &apos;s recent visit to Israel . 
On the contrary , Israeli officials , denying the Palestinians &quot; assertion that a secret US-Israel agreement exists , clearly intend to continue building Jewish homes in occupied East Jerusalem . 
So what is going on ? 
For starters , we are again moving into what Henry Kissinger called the realm of &quot; constructive ambiguity . &quot; 
Palestinians have been assured via a message from President Barack Obama , delivered by his special envoy George Mitchell , that the Israelis will not carry out any &quot; provocations &quot; during the coming four months of indirect negotiations . 
Pressed to clarify , the Palestinians admitted that there is no written promise to this effect . 
But , on a recent trip to Israel , White House adviser Dan Shapiro is said to have been reassured that the Israelis will not embarrass their American friends . 
In exchange , Shapiro handed the ultra-orthodox leader of Israel &apos;s Shas party an invitation to the White House . 
Mitchell gave a similar invitation to Abbas . 
Palestinians understand that without pressure little change will take place . 
They have also clearly understood the folly of violent resistance , and have made a dramatic shift to nonviolent action - with the acceptance ( and possibly encouragement ) of the international community - in order to maintain pressure on the occupiers . 
The PLO &apos;s main faction , Fatah , made this shift at their sixth congress , held in Bethlehem last winter after a 20-year hiatus . 
Senior PLO officials have participated in demonstrations and protest activities , with some being injured and Executive Committee member Abbas Zaki imprisoned for a couple of days . 
Other senior Fatah officials have been banned from travel outside the West Bank , owing largely to their involvement in nonviolent protests . 
In addition to nonviolent activities , Palestinian state-building efforts have been put in high gear . 
Salam Fayyad , the energetic Western-trained Palestinian prime minister , has implemented a detailed blueprint for declaring a de facto Palestinian state by August 2011 . 
While state-building is handled by the civilian Palestinian Authority , political efforts are handled by the PLO , whose chairman , Abbas , is the head of Fatah as well as the Palestinian Authority &apos;s president . 
Abbas and his negotiating team , headed by Erekat , have been successful in securing the support of all members of the Arab League . 
The PLO has succeeded in obtaining European support for a unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood . 
The only obstacle remaining to Palestinian leaders are the Americans . 
When Palestinians asked Mitchell for assurances that the US would support such a statehood declaration if talks failed , Mitchell responded that such a commitment would make negotiations pointless . 
Instead , the Americans have their own ideas about how to achieve a breakthrough , especially with Israel , which the Obama administration believes is now the major obstacle . 
To effect change in Israel , the Americans are launching various trial balloons . 
One is that , if the current process fails , Obama might issue his own plan , which many expect would be a near-carbon copy of the proposal made by Bill Clinton &apos;s administration in its last days ten years ago . 
At the time , Palestinian and Israeli negotiators were quoted as saying that the two sides had never been closer to an agreement . 
A US peace plan that is fair and reasonable would certainly have many ordinary Israelis and Palestinians cheering . 
It could cause some major damage to right-wing Israeli political forces that came to power as a result of eight years of former US president George Bush &apos;s so-called war on terror . 
Hiding behind that anti-Islamic fa√ßade , the Israelis have found it easy to stonewall all reasonable peace efforts , including the 2002 Arab peace plan , according to which Arab states and Muslim-majority countries agreed to normalize relations with Israel if it withdrew from areas occupied in 1967 . 
The plan also gave Israel a role equal to that of the Palestinians in resolving the refugee issue . 
It called for the &quot; achievement of a just solution to the Palestinian refugee problem to be agreed upon in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 194 . &quot; 
Yet another US trial balloon has been the suggestion that if all of the above fails , the Americans might suggest that the Arab-Israeli conflict be resolved through the convening of an international conference . 
Such a conference is in fact listed in the &quot; road map &quot; as part of phase III in the talks . 
Until now , Israelis and Palestinians have insisted on various &quot; red lines &quot; that they proclaimed they would never cross . 
The coming months will show whether these public postures are negotiable , with obvious consequences for both parties and their relationship with the international community , especially the US .
