Europe &apos;s Regional Revolts 
MADRID - In both Catalonia and Scotland , calls for independence are growing once again - an indication of conditions not only in Spain and the United Kingdom , but in the European Union as a whole . 
Indeed , the EU &apos;s weakness in confronting its financial crisis both reflects and reinforces the erosion of its raison d &apos;être - political integration . 
Whatever its roots in old grievances , secessionism , it seems , is a painful symptom of this degenerative process . 
The perverse irony here is that Europe &apos;s shrewdest secession-minded parties are dressing up their programs in European garb , promising that the new states will have automatic EU membership . 
The Scottish Nationalist Party ( SNP ) and Convergència i Unió ( CiU ) in Catalonia are both exploiting the concept of European cosmopolitanism to revive narrow nationalist ends and , ultimately , to break up the countries of which they are now a part . 
No provisions of EU law address the disintegration of a member state , as secession contradicts the core principle of &quot; ever closer Union . &quot; 
That is why there are increasing calls to send a message to electorates in would-be secessionist regions that EU membership would not be guaranteed in the event of independence . 
Alex Salmond , Scotland &apos;s first minister and the SNP &apos;s leader , proclaimed that the guarantee of EU membership was a matter of law ; because it is not , he and his party now face their biggest crisis since coming to power in 2007 . 
This legal void explains why , in the run-up to Catalonia &apos;s elections on November 25 , the CiU &apos;s leaders are so eager to convert an informal referendum on independence into a plebiscite on Catalans &quot; desire for EU membership ( which is neither at issue nor up to the electorate in Catalonia to decide ) . 
Rationally , if not legally , the only coherent question that the CiU government could pose is whether Catalans wish to be part of Spain . 
The United Nations framework governing secession establishes a clear distinction between &quot; internal self-determination &quot; and &quot; external self-determination . &quot; 
The former sanctions a people &apos;s pursuit of its political , economic , social , and cultural development within the framework of an existing state ; the latter could potentially take the form of unilateral secession , but only under an extreme set of circumstances . 
Neither definition applies in the case of Catalonia or Scotland . 
No one in Catalonia or Scotland can legitimately claim the suppression of cultural identity , which enjoys strong protection in Spain - where one of the main goals of the Spanish Constitution , after Francisco Franco &apos;s death , was to protect the Catalan and Basque languages and cultures - and the UK . 
Perhaps this helps to explain why the formalScottish claim to independence does not rest on a distinct heritage , but on the shaky notion of distinct political and social values - an argument so vague that it could be used to justify dismantling every European country . 
As is often the case with nationalism - irrespective of its dress - the emotional discourse that surrounds calls for independence is merely a mask for naked political ambition and economic self-interest . 
In Catalonia , victimization has become a campaign strategy , with CiU leaders openly citing imaginary threats from the central government in Madrid , including &quot; Spanish &quot; tanks and &quot; hostile &quot; airplanes above &quot; Catalan airspace . &quot; 
Rhetoric aside , the looming Catalan referendum emerged as a result of the political bargaining surrounding bailout discussions between Spain &apos;s regions and the central government . 
The crisis has stoked demands for independence by adding fervor to many Catalans &quot; anger at financial transfers to Spain &apos;s poorer regions through the much-maligned Territorial Solidarity Fund . 
The question of independence has turned into a powerful bargaining tool vis-à-vis the central government . 
Conditions could become much worse with independence . 
Conservative estimates suggest that exiting from Spain , the euro , and the EU would cause a 20-25 % drop in Catalonia &apos;s GDP , as 68 % of Catalonia &apos;s international exports go to the EU ( according to official 2010 data ) and 50 % of its total output goes to the rest of Spain . 
But criticizing the opportunists who are stoking the fires of secession in Barcelona and Edinburgh is not enough . 
A demonstration in Barcelona in September that brought close to 8 % of Catalonia &apos;s 7.5 million people onto the street showed that there are real issues to be addressed , both at the European and national level . 
The core principle of democracy is the ability of citizens to guide the direction of public policy . 
But today , across Europe , citizens feel impotent . 
With the economic crisis , this phenomenon is particularly pronounced in Europe &apos;s south , where voters sense uneasily that they have little influence in Berlin , where the real decisions are being made . 
In Catalonia , CiU has channeled this frustration into a rejection of Spain &apos;s central government . 
In Scotland , the austerity policies pursued by David Cameron &apos;s government have provided similar force to the SNP &apos;s independence bid . 
Spain was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the end of the twentieth century , managing its EU accession and democratic transition while moving from under-development to the eurozone &apos;s fourth-largest economy - and 13th in the world . 
But the trade-offs that were part of that transition led to consequences - particularly the country &apos;s territorial distribution of power - that must now be confronted openly . 
Whatever its cause , unrest in Catalonia should spur a thorough revision of Spain &apos;s 1978 Constitution and the adoption of a true federal structure . 
If successful , Spanish federalists could then advise others - starting with political leaders in the UK .
