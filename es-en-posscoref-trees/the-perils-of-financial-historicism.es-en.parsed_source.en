The Perils of Financial Historicism 
Every financial crisis is inherently unknowable - before it occurs , and as it occurs . 
Accountants go over the books , the participants tell their tales to the newspapers ( or sometimes before a judge ) , politicians explain why they are sorting out a mess , and in the end historians put together a story . 
Because the past is knowable , the best way of understanding a current crisis is to search for a model in past experiences , even those that are long past . 
But which is the right template ? 
Often the choice depends less on a rational assessment of similarities and differences than on gut feelings , proclivities to optimism or pessimism , or political orientation . 
Currently , two dates are circulating widely , 1907 and 1931 . 
At the beginning of the current credit crunch , many historically minded people picked 1907 as the key precedent . 
Not only is it an arithmetically neat 100 years in the past , but it also looked like an attractive parallel . 
The crisis of 1907 was both immediately devastating , provoking a massive but short economic downturn , and , as it turned out , easily resolved . 
The 1907 panic started in the United States , owing to a rise in interest rates as farmers in the West were paid for their crops and financial scandals in New York that seemed to implicate a large financial institution , the Knickerbocker trust . 
Suddenly , as today , even big banks did not trust each other . 
The breakdown was fundamentally a liquidity crisis , and liquidity was easily restored in several ways : the New York banks issued their own liquidity through a clearing house ; one massively powerful financial institution , J.P. Morgan , bought up collapsing shares , and thus reversed a market panic and a scramble for liquidity ; and European central banks supplied gold to the American market . 
The obvious lesson of 1907 that Americans learned was that central banks were the best placed institutions to restore liquidity in a financial panic , and , in the longer run , monetary reform gave the US its own central bank , the Federal Reserve , by 1914 . 
So 1907 became a comforting mantra in times of financial stress : a crisis cannot happen as long as the central bank understands the problem of liquidity . 
There are modern parallels . 
The Fed and the European Central Bank have recently pumped massive amounts of liquidity into the global financial system . 
Strategically placed private institutions have done their part to shore up confidence . 
Goldman Sachs , for example , has made a point of publicly buying endangered assets in its Global Equities Opportunity Fund . 
The darker parallel is to the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s , when no amount of liquidity helped . 
This is the historical analogy drawn by those who want governments to do more , particularly banks that feel vulnerable and desperately need a public bailout . 
In August 2007 , some German banks , at the earliest signs of difficulty because of their exposure to US sub-prime mortgages , started to talk only of 1931 . 
In the Great Depression , bank collapses made the downturn far worse . 
They were contagious across national frontiers . 
Governments not only needed to help by providing a combination of public assistance and new legislation guaranteeing deposits , but also were called on to shield their constituencies from destabilizing international influences . 
This nationalist-minded rhetoric has returned in the financial crisis of 2007 . 
Germans do not see why they should be vulnerable because of poor quality mortgage lending in American inner cities . 
Neither of these apparent historical parallels is convincing . 
We are not living in 1907 , when the gold standard limited the ability of central banks to supply additional liquidity . 
Nor , following the fastest five-year period of economic growth in human history , are collapsing prices endangering the financial system , as they did during the Great Depression . 
Today , the responses to the 1907 and 1931 crises would only make matters worse . 
The continuous injection of liquidity would imply a greater likelihood of renewed asset bubbles in housing , equities , or modern art . 
Government stabilization of the banking system can either be international , provoking complaints by outraged taxpayers about subsidizing others , or national , but only at the cost of greatly extended regulation of capital movements . 
Both courses are unnecessary . 
If today &apos;s credit crunch has historical parallels , they are closer to nineteenth-century &quot; normal crises &quot; like 1837 , 1847 , or 1857 . 
In those panics , financial innovation caused uncertainty and nervousness , but also induced an important and beneficial learning process . 
The financial institutions that survived the crises went on to play a crucial role in pushing further development , and they had enhanced reputations because they withstood a crisis . 
Sometimes monetary and fiscal authorities have an obligation to ignore the wilder historical parallels and look at a broader picture . 
Sometimes , too , the best response to a crisis is this : don &apos;t just do something ; stand there and do nothing .
