Partnerless in Pakistan 
New York  -  
Bush is playing a dangerous game , risking the collapse of Pakistan &apos;s political process for the sake of his own legacy . 
Millions of Pakistanis delivered a clear message at the polls . 
Collectively , they voted against Musharraf and religious extremists , and in favor of democracy , the rule of law , and good governance . 
Nationally , no single party received a majority , but the centrist , democratic opposition won more than 70 % of the National Assembly seats . 
The Musharraf-allied faction of the Muslim League party ( PML-Q ) came in third , polling only 15 % , despite the assistance of surgical vote-rigging . 
Most of its senior leaders were defeated in their constituencies - including one who hadn &apos;t lost an election in 26 years . 
The PML-Q , created in 1999 by Pakistan &apos;s intelligence agencies , is now political deadwood . 
An alliance between the two largest parties , the late Benazir Bhutto &apos;s Pakistan People &apos;s Party ( PPP ) and Nawaz Sharif &apos;s Muslim League faction ( PML-N ) is what the country needs and what most Pakistanis want . 
The PPP and PML-N have the numbers to form a unity government . 
They also realize that this is perhaps their last chance to &quot; save &quot; Pakistan . 
Together with the pro-democracy army chief , Gen. Ashfaq Kayani , this coalition can address Pakistan &apos;s most pressing challenges , including terrorism . 
With the addition of smaller parties and independents to the coalition , they can also impeach Musharraf and restore the judiciary , which he had deposed . 
This is unpalatable to the Bush administration , which has helped keep Musharraf in power , despite the fact that 75 % of Pakistanis want him to resign . 
The Bush administration finds the PML-N &apos;s nationalism and antagonism to Musharraf particularly troublesome . 
Sharif has called for Pakistan &apos;s foreign policy to be debated in parliament , but supports continued cooperation with the United States . 
His party also wants the sacked Supreme Court justices to be restored . 
The US government , however , endorsed the justice &apos;s illegal removal , seeing the court &apos;s insistence on constitutional accountability for Musharraf as complicating its regional objectives . 
The court , for example , required Musharraf to present alleged terror suspects - some of whome were likely &quot; rendered &quot; to Pakistan by the CIA - detained for years without government acknowledgment . 
Of course , a popular , democratically elected government and an independent judiciary in Islamabad complicate relations with the US . 
The Bush administration , however , has become used to dealing with one man and is increasingly impatient . 
In its final year , it would like to increase the odds of a Republican victory in November &apos;s US presidential election . 
As a result , the Bush administration is aggressively interfering in coalition talks between Pakistan &apos;s political parties . 
It wants to pair the PPP with the discredited PML-Q and isolate the PML-N . 
US Ambassador to Pakistan Anne Patterson , for example , has held a joint meeting with senior Musharraf advisor Tariq Aziz and PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari , Bhutto &apos;s widower . 
Zardari , in a joint press conference with Sharif , refused to answer a question about whether there is pressure from the US to ally with Musharraf . 
But he and Sharif did agree &quot; in principle &quot; to form a government . 
Its favored arrangement could divide the opposition , keep Musharraf ascendant , and provide continuity in the Pakistan army &apos;s campaign against militants . 
The US needs to take a step back and let Pakistan &apos;s political process proceed naturally . 
The end result might not be optimal , but if the Bush administration overplays its hand , it could find itself partnerless in Pakistan .
