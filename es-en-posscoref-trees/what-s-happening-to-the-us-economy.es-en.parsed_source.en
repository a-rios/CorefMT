What &apos;s Happening to the US Economy ? 
CAMBRIDGE - The American economy has recently slowed dramatically , and the probability of another economic downturn increases with each new round of data . 
This is a sharp change from the economic situation at the end of last year - and represents a return to the very weak pace of expansion since the recovery began in the summer of 2009 . 
Economic growth in the United States during the first three quarters of 2010 was not only slow , but was also dominated by inventory accumulation rather than sales to consumers or other forms of final sales . 
The last quarter of 2010 brought a welcome change , with consumer spending rising at a 4 % annual rate , enough to increase total real GDP by 3.1 % from the third quarter to the fourth . 
The economy seemed to have escaped its dependence on inventory accumulation . 
This favorable performance led private forecasters and government officials to predict continued strong growth in 2011 , with higher production , employment , and incomes leading to further increases in consumer spending and a self-sustaining recovery . 
A one-year cut of the payroll tax rate by two percentage points was enacted in order to lock in this favorable outlook . 
Unfortunately , the projected recovery in consumer spending didn &apos;t occur . 
The rise in food and energy prices outpaced the gain in nominal wages , causing real average weekly earnings to decline in January , while the continued fall in home prices reduced wealth for the majority of households . 
As a result , real personal consumer expenditures rose at an annual rate of just about 1 % in January , down from the previous quarter &apos;s 4 % increase . 
That pattern of rising prices and declining real earnings repeated itself in February and March , with a sharp rise in the consumer price index causing real average weekly earnings to decline at an annual rate of more than 5 % . 
Not surprisingly , survey measures of consumer sentiment fell sharply and consumer spending remained almost flat from month to month . 
The fall in house prices pushed down sales of both new and existing homes . 
That , in turn , caused a dramatic decline in the volume of housing starts and housing construction . 
That decline is likely to continue , because nearly 30 % of homes with mortgages are worth less than the value of the mortgage . 
This creates a strong incentive to default , because mortgages in the US are effectively non-recourse loans : the creditor may take the property if the borrower doesn &apos;t pay , but cannot take other assets or a portion of wage income . 
As a result , 10 % of mortgages are now in default or foreclosure , creating an overhang of properties that will have to be sold at declining prices . 
Businesses have responded negatively to the weakness of household demand , with indices maintained by the Institute of Supply Management falling for both manufacturing and service firms . 
Although large firms continue to have very substantial cash on their balance sheets , their cash flow from current operations fell in the first quarter . 
The most recent measure of orders for nondefense capital goods signaled a decline in business investment . 
The pattern of weakness accelerated in April and May . 
The relatively rapid rise in payroll employment that occurred in the first four months of the year came to a halt in May , when only 54,000 new jobs were created , less than one-third of the average for employment growth in the first four months . 
As a result , the unemployment rate rose to 9.1 % of the labor force . 
The bond market and share prices have responded to all of this bad news in a predictable fashion . 
The interest rate on 10-year government bonds fell to 3 % , and the stock market declined for six weeks in a row , the longest bearish stretch since 2002 , with a cumulative fall in share prices of more than 6 % . 
Lower share prices will now have negative effects on consumer spending and business investment . 
Monetary and fiscal policies cannot be expected to turn this situation around . 
The US Federal Reserve will maintain its policy of keeping the overnight interest rate at near zero ; but , given a fear of asset-price bubbles , it will not reverse its decision to end its policy of buying Treasury bonds - so-called &quot; quantitative easing &quot; - at the end of June . 
Moreover , fiscal policy will actually be contractionary in the months ahead . 
The fiscal-stimulus program enacted in 2009 is coming to an end , with stimulus spending declining from $ 400 billion in 2010 to only $ 137 billion this year . 
And negotiations are under way to cut spending more and raise taxes in order to reduce further the fiscal deficits projected for 2011 and later years . 
So the near-term outlook for the US economy is weak at best . 
Fundamental policy changes will probably have to wait until after the presidential and congressional elections in November 2012 .
