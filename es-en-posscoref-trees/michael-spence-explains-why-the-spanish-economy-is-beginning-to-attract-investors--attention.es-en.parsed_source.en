The Gain in Spain 
MILAN - The Spanish economy is beginning to attract investors &quot; attention - and not only because asset prices are depressed in the current climate ( arguably implying a good buy for longer-term , value investors ) . 
While there are huge problems that must still be overcome , there is also a clear sense on the ground that the economy has passed a turning point , roughly at the start of this year . 
To skeptics , green shoots of recovery will not bloom without access to the credit spigot , which is still clogged by balance-sheet damage in many banks . 
But , though the road back to full employment and sustainable growth will not be built overnight , progress on it may be faster than most observers expect . 
It is easy to get lost in the details of recovery patterns , so a sound framework for assessing potential growth helps . 
In fact , the Spanish economy is a classic case of a defective growth pattern followed by a predictable , policy-assisted recovery that is driven ( with a delay ) mostly by the tradable sector . 
Prior to the crisis , Spain &apos;s economy relied on demand created by a leveraged real-estate bubble - a pattern not dissimilar in some respects to that in the United States . 
Thus , both growth and employment came at the expense of the tradable side of the economy . 
Unit labor costs rose steadily relative to Germany - not only in Spain but also in all of southern Europe , and in France - in the decade beginning in 2000 , following the euro &apos;s introduction . 
The crisis struck domestic demand , and the tradable sector was incapacitated , because the rapid rise in relative unit labor costs , combined with an over-valued euro , had undermined competitiveness . 
Moreover , the crisis-related damage to banks &quot; balance sheets constrained demand by severely limiting household credit and lending to small and medium-size businesses . 
Spain was not in an enviable position . 
The rapid deterioration of fiscal position after the crisis made any substantial countercyclical response impossible , while regulatory constraints limited the economy &apos;s structural flexibility . 
The path to recovery , though difficult and lengthy , has been relatively clear and specific . 
First , unit labor costs needed to decline toward productivity levels to restore competitiveness - a painful process without the exchange-rate mechanism . 
In fact , there has been substantial post-crisis re-convergence toward German levels . 
Second , both capital and labor needed to flow to the tradable sector , where demand constraints can be relaxed as relative productivity converges . 
Like many other southern European countries , however , labor-market and other rigidities dramatically reduced the speed and increased the costs of structural economic adjustment , resulting in lower levels of growth and employment , especially for young people and first-time job-seekers . 
But Spanish policymakers and business leaders appeared to grasp the nature of the pre-crisis economic imbalances - and the importance of the tradable sector as a recovery engine . 
Recognizing that the economy could not benefit from a partial restoration of competitiveness without structural shifts , the government passed a significant labor-market reform in the spring of 2013 . 
It was controversial , because , like all such measures , it rescinded certain kinds of protections for workers . 
But the ultimate protection is growing employment . 
With a lag , the reform now appears to be bearing fruit . 
Indeed , though domestic investment is constrained by credit availability , major European and Latin American multinationals have begun investing in the Spanish economy , attracted partly by its enhanced competitive posture and structural flexibility , and , on a slightly longer time horizon , by a recovery in domestic demand . 
Private equity is flowing in as well , not only because the valuations are attractive , but also because potential growth in Spain now seems within reach . 
Though Spain and Italy are similarly depressed in terms of current growth and employment , especially for the young , two significant differences stand out . 
One is that , unlike Spain , Italy has experienced relatively little convergence of unit labor costs with productivity . 
That restricts the potential of the tradable part of the economy as a growth engine . 
The second difference is that labor-market reform and market liberalization in Italy remain on the to-do list for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi &apos;s new government . 
If Italy is to take advantage of the growth potential on the tradable side of the economy , following through is crucial - just as it was for Spain . 
There is no chance in either country that domestic demand alone will support sustained growth in the short to medium term . 
Moreover , both countries need growth-oriented policies to help with deleveraging . 
As Spain &apos;s experience has shown , though structural flexibility is difficult to achieve politically , it is essential for strong economic performance . 
One reason is that rebalancing is needed when a defective growth pattern distorts the economy &apos;s structure , particularly the balance between the tradable and non-tradable sectors . 
Another is that technological and global market forces are imposing structural change on all advanced economies , even those that are not unbalanced . 
Built-in rigidities impede adaptation and adversely affect growth and employment . 
Generally , the successful economies in the past three decades have been those that adopted reforms and policies aimed at increasing structural adaptability : one thinks of the US after Ronald Reagan , the United Kingdom after Margaret Thatcher , Germany after Gerhard Schr√∂der , and China after Deng Xiaoping . 
Spain appears to be in the early stages of restoring a balanced and sustainable growth pattern . 
One hopes that others will soon follow its example .
