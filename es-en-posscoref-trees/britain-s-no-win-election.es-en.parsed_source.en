Britain &apos;s No-Win Election ? 
LONDON - With Labour trailing the Conservatives slightly in opinion polls , the British election on May 6 could well produce a &quot; hung &quot; parliament , in which neither major party obtains a majority and the Liberal Democrats hold the balance of power . 
Depending on which party wins more seats , either Labour &apos;s Gordon Brown or the Conservatives &quot; David Cameron will become prime minister with the Liberal Democrats &quot; support . 
The surprise is that the Conservatives are not polling far ahead of Labour . 
After 13 years in power , Labour started the election with a huge disadvantage : the legacy of Tony Blair . 
From being Labour &apos;s most potent asset in 1997 , Blair turned into the party &apos;s greatest liability after the Iraq war , and had to be practically forced out in 2006 . 
His successor , Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) Gordon Brown , was well described by Blair as &quot; clunking . &quot; 
A man of charm and humor in private life , he is relentlessly dour in public . 
In Britain &apos;s first ever &quot; presidential &quot; television debate the youthful Nick Clegg stole the show for the Liberal Democrats with his freshness and directness . 
David Cameron was polished but vague , and the jowly Brown came across as gun loaded with statistics . 
But the statistics were not as good as they should have been . 
Brown &apos;s reputation for fiscal prudence evaporated with the Great Recession . 
Nevertheless , it is the Great Recession that keeps Labour in contention , particularly in the light of the Conservatives &quot; pledge to start cutting public spending the moment they take power . 
This makes people anxious for their jobs . 
Most people - bankers and many &quot; experts &quot; excepted - are instinctive Keynesians , even if they have never heard of John Maynard Keynes . 
At some level , they understand what Keynes called the &quot; paradox of thrift &quot; : if households and firms are forced to reduce their expenses , and the government simultaneously cuts spending , unemployment will rise , because one person &apos;s spending is another &apos;s income , and the outcome will be less spending and less income all around . 
Moreover , now is not the time for a political party to be seen to be in cahoots with the bankers . 
Although there is no real British equivalent of the American revolving door between Washington and Wall Street , the Conservatives are widely considered to be friends of the City of London and soft on rich tax evaders like Lord Ashcroft and Zak Goldsmith . 
Although the MPs &quot; expenses scandal - parliamentarians claiming reimbursement for dubious expenses - hit both main parties , the most egregious cases involved wealthy Conservative MPs . 
And even though inequality of wealth and income in Britain increased in the 13 years Labour has been in power , this is thought to be something that a left-wing party might seek to correct , whereas there is no similar expectation for a party of the right . 
In short , when the power of money is under attack , a party that represents money will have a harder time . 
Labour has an obvious interest in fighting the election on their handling of the economic crisis . The Conservatives would have done better to support them on this , while focusing their attack on the government &apos;s economic record as a whole -especially Labour &apos;s addiction to centralization and over-regulation . But this is going to be difficult to do because their na√Øve Shadow Chancellor , George Osborne , seems determined to put &quot; cutting the deficit &quot; at the heart of the Conservative program . 
Spending cuts , he argues , would restore credibility to Britain &apos;s public finances , thereby quelling the anxieties of businesses , investors , and consumers about future tax increases and inflation . 
A more certain future would restore confidence , boosting private investment and ensuring a robust recovery . 
Public spending cuts come more naturally to Conservatives , and they have - despite their lack of candor - attempted to make a virtue out of this necessity . 
The Conservative manifesto &quot; An Invitation to Join the Government of Britain &quot; is merely a grandiloquent way of saying that under a Conservative government the people will have to look after themselves . 
Labour , by contrast , argues that immediate spending cuts would wreck the recovery - that the hole in the economy , not the government budget deficit , is the problem needing most attention . 
In practice , both parties are afraid of their convictions . 
The Conservatives &quot; pledge to start cutting the deficit immediately amounts to only a 1 % reduction in the coming year . 
Any promise of deeper cuts would , they feel , be electoral suicide , even though their model of the economy tells them that the government should be smaller , and that the deficit is unnecessary and even damaging . 
Labour &apos;s model of the economy implies maintaining the deficit for as long as needed , and even increasing government spending if the recovery appears to be flagging . 
But Labour is too afraid of the markets to say so openly . 
So , like St. Augustine , they promise virtue , but not until next year . 
In other words , neither major party can afford to blurt out the awkward truth : how much deficit reduction any government can achieve will depend on what happens to the economy over the next five years , and no one can say anything for certain about that . 
So the main parties vie with each other in their promises not to cut public services . 
Labour will not cut spending on unspecified &quot; front-line services . &quot; 
The Conservatives will not cut spending on health , international aid , and defense , similarly leaving unclear just where the cuts will be made . 
Only the Liberal Democrats are committed to a big cut : scrapping Britain &apos;s nuclear submarines . 
Finally , all the parties promise big constitutional changes . 
The Conservatives want to reduce the size of the House of Commons by 10 % . 
Labour wants to reduce the House of Lords &quot; membership by half and hold referenda on making it wholly elected and on changing the voting system . 
The Liberal Democrats want MPs to be elected by proportional representation . 
In a hung parliament , Britain &apos;s ancient constitution would become a pawn among the parties as they haggle for a share of power . 
In that case , voters would get both more and less than they bargained for .
