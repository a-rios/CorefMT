Mitt Romney &apos;s Fair Share 
NEW YORK - Mitt Romney &apos;s income taxes have become a major issue in the American presidential campaign . 
Is this just petty politics , or does it really matter ? 
In fact , it does matter - and not just for Americans . 
A major theme of the underlying political debate in the United States is the role of the state and the need for collective action . 
The private sector , while central in a modern economy , cannot ensure its success alone . 
For example , the financial crisis that began in 2008 demonstrated the need for adequate regulation . 
Moreover , beyond effective regulation ( including ensuring a level playing field for competition ) , modern economies are founded on technological innovation , which in turn presupposes basic research funded by government . 
This is an example of a public good - things from which we all benefit , but that would be undersupplied ( or not supplied at all ) were we to rely on the private sector . 
Conservative politicians in the US underestimate the importance of publicly provided education , technology , and infrastructure . 
Economies in which government provides these public goods perform far better than those in which it does not . 
But public goods must be paid for , and it is imperative that everyone pays their fair share . 
While there may be disagreement about what that entails , those at the top of the income distribution who pay 15 % of their reported income ( money accruing in tax shelters in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens may not be reported to US authorities ) clearly are not paying their fair share . 
There is an old adage that a fish rots from the head . 
If presidents and those around them do not pay their fair share of taxes , how can we expect that anyone else will ? 
And if no one does , how can we expect to finance the public goods that we need ? 
Democracies rely on a spirit of trust and cooperation in paying taxes . 
If every individual devoted as much energy and resources as the rich do to avoiding their fair share of taxes , the tax system either would collapse , or would have to be replaced by a far more intrusive and coercive scheme . 
Both alternatives are unacceptable . 
More broadly , a market economy could not work if every contract had to be enforced through legal action . 
But trust and cooperation can survive only if there is a belief that the system is fair . 
Recent research has shown that a belief that the economic system is unfair undermines both cooperation and effort . 
Yet , increasingly , Americans are coming to believe that their economic system is unfair ; and the tax system is emblematic of that sense of injustice . 
The billionaire investor Warren Buffett argues that he should pay only the taxes that he must , but that there is something fundamentally wrong with a system that taxes his income at a lower rate than his secretary is required to pay . 
He is right . 
Romney might be forgiven were he to take a similar position . 
Indeed , it might be a Nixon-in-China moment : a wealthy politician at the pinnacle of power advocating higher taxes for the rich could change the course of history . 
But Romney has not chosen to do so . 
He evidently does not recognize that a system that taxes speculation at a lower rate than hard work distorts the economy . 
Indeed , much of the money that accrues to those at the top is what economists call rents , which arise not from increasing the size of the economic pie , but from grabbing a larger slice of the existing pie . 
Those at the top include a disproportionate number of monopolists who increase their income by restricting production and engaging in anti-competitive practices ; 
It is perhaps no accident that rent-seeking and inequality have increased as top tax rates have fallen , regulations have been eviscerated , and enforcement of existing rules has been weakened : the opportunity and returns from rent-seeking have increased . 
Today , a deficiency of aggregate demand afflicts almost all advanced countries , leading to high unemployment , lower wages , greater inequality , and - coming full , vicious circle - constrained consumption . 
There is now a growing recognition of the link between inequality and economic instability and weakness . 
There is another vicious circle : Economic inequality translates into political inequality , which in turn reinforces the former , including through a tax system that allows people like Romney - who insists that he has been subject to an income-tax rate of &quot; at least 13 % &quot; for the last ten years - not to pay their fair share . 
The resulting economic inequality - a result of politics as much as market forces - contributes to today &apos;s overall economic weakness . 
Romney may not be a tax evader ; only a thorough investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service could reach that conclusion . 
But , given that the top US marginal income-tax rate is 35 % , he certainly is a tax avoider on a grand scale . 
And , of course , the problem is not just Romney ; writ large , his level of tax avoidance makes it difficult to finance the public goods without which a modern economy cannot flourish . 
But , even more important , tax avoidance on Romney &apos;s scale undermines belief in the system &apos;s fundamental fairness , and thus weakens the bonds that hold a society together .
