East Asia &apos;s Lessons for Africa 
NEW YORK - On June 1-3 , Japan is hosting the fifth meeting of TICAD , the Tokyo International Cooperation on African Development . 
The meeting is a reminder that , while the rest of the world obsesses over Europe &apos;s economic travails , America &apos;s political paralysis , and the growth slowdown in China and other emerging markets , there remains a region - Sub-Saharan Africa - where poverty is almost the rule , not the exception . 
From 1990 to 2010 , the number of people living in poverty ( $ 1.25 per day ) across Sub-Saharan Africa rose from less than 300 million to nearly 425 million , while the number living on less than $ 2 a day grew from about 390 million to almost 600 million . 
Still , the proportion of those living in poverty declined from 57 % to 49 % in this period . 
&#91; See graph below . &#93; 
Yet Japan , still suffering from two decades of economic malaise , has somehow managed to remain actively engaged - not because of its strategic interests , but in order to meet a genuine moral imperative , namely that those who are better off should help those in need . 
Africa today presents a mixed picture . 
There are some notable successes - from 2007 to 2011 , five of the world &apos;s ten fastest-growing countries with a population of more than 10 million were in Africa . 
And their progress has not been based solely on natural resources . 
Among the best-performing countries have been Ethiopia , where GDP grew by roughly 10 % annually in the five years ending in 2011 , and Rwanda , Tanzania , and Uganda , where annual output has grown by more than 6 % for a decade or more . 
But , while some sources indicate that there are now more middle-class families in Africa ( defined as having annual incomes in excess of $ 20,000 ) than in India , the continent also contains countries with the world &apos;s highest levels of inequality . 
Agriculture , on which so many of the poor depend , has not been doing well . 
Yields per hectare have been stagnating . 
Only 4 % of arable and permanent cropland is irrigated , compared to 39 % in South Asia and 29 % in East Asia . 
Fertilizer use in Africa amounts to just 13 kilograms per hectare , compared to 90 kilograms in South Asia and 190 kilograms in East Asia . 
Most disappointing , even countries that have put their macroeconomic house in order and have made progress in governance have found it difficult to attract investment outside of the natural-resource sector . 
Japan &apos;s engagement is particularly important not only in terms of money and moral support , but also because Africa may learn something from East Asia &apos;s development experience . 
This may be particularly relevant today , with China &apos;s rising wages and appreciating exchange rate underscoring rapid change in global comparative and competitive advantage . 
Some manufacturing will move out of China , and Africa has a chance of capturing some fraction of it . 
This is especially significant , given that , over the last 30 years , Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered from de-industrialization . 
Indeed , by the late 2000 &quot; s - owing partly to the structural-adjustment policies pushed by the international financial institutions - manufacturing as a share of GDP in developing African economies was lower than it was in 1980 . 
But a manufacturing boom will not happen by itself . 
African governments must undertake industrial policies to help restructure their economies . 
Such policies have been controversial . 
Some argue that government is not good at picking winners . 
Some argue that it makes no difference whether a country produces potato chips or computer chips . 
Both perspectives are misguided . 
The purpose of such policies is to address well-known limitations in markets - for example , the important learning externalities , as skills relevant to one industry benefit nearby industries . 
The goal of industrial policies is to identify these spillovers , and governments have done a very credible job in this respect . 
In the United States , the government promoted agriculture in the nineteenth century ; supported the first telegraph line ( between Baltimore and Washington , demonstrated in 1844 ) and the first transcontinental line , thereby launching the telecommunications revolution ; and then nurtured the Internet revolution . 
Inevitably , government - through its infrastructure , laws and regulations ( including taxation ) , and education system - shapes the economy . 
For example , American tax and bankruptcy laws , combined with deregulation policies , effectively encouraged the creation of a hypertrophied financial sector . 
With resources so scarce , developing countries cannot afford the luxury of such waste . 
They have to think carefully about the future direction of their economies - about their dynamic comparative advantages . 
The world &apos;s most successful developing countries - those in East Asia - did just this , and among the lessons to be shared are those concerning how they conducted industrial policies at a time when their governments lacked the sophistication and depth of talent that they have today . 
Weaknesses in governance may affect the instruments of industrial policy , but not its use . 
Japan has other lessons to teach as well . 
Key elements of its development strategy - including its stress on education , equality , and land reform - are even more important today in Africa . 
The world has changed markedly since East Asia began its remarkable developmental transition more than a half-century ago ; and differences in history , institutions , and circumstances mean that policies must be adapted to local conditions . 
But what is clear is that Japan and other East Asian countries followed a markedly different course from that recommended by the neo-liberal &quot; Washington Consensus . &quot; 
Their policies worked ; all too often , those of the Washington Consensus failed miserably . 
African countries will benefit from reflecting on these successes and failures , and on what they mean for their own development strategies .
