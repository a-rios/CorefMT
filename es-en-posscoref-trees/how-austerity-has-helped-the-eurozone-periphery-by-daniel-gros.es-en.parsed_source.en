Has Austerity Failed in Europe ? 
BRUSSELS - Although many European governments have announced expenditure cuts and tax hikes , their debt / GDP ratios continue to deteriorate . 
So , if the purpose of austerity was to reduce debt levels , its critics are right : fiscal belt-tightening has failed . 
But the goal of austerity was not just to stabilize debt ratios . 
In fact , austerity has worked as advertised in some cases . 
Germany &apos;s fiscal deficit temporarily increased by about 2.5 percentage points of GDP during the global recession of 2009 ; subsequent rapid deficit reduction had no significant negative impact on growth . 
So it is possible to reduce deficits and keep the debt / GDP ratio in check - provided that the economy does not start out with large imbalances , and that the financial system is working properly . 
Obviously , the countries on the eurozone &apos;s periphery do not meet these conditions . 
Countries whose governments have either lost access to normal market financing ( like Greece , Ireland , and Portugal ) , or face very high risk premia ( like Italy and Spain in 2011-2012 ) simply do not have a choice : they must reduce their expenditures or get financing from some official body like the International Monetary Fund or the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) . 
But foreign official financing will always be subject to lenders &quot; conditions - and lenders see no reason to finance ongoing spending at levels that previously led a country into trouble . 
So , in the eurozone periphery , austerity is not a question of fine-tuning demand , but of ensuring governments &quot; solvency . 
Economists like to point out that solvency has little to do with the ratio of public debt to today &apos;s GDP , and much to do with debt relative to expected future tax revenues . 
A government &apos;s solvency thus depends much more on long-term growth prospects than on the current debt / GDP ratio . 
A reduction in the deficit today might lead in the short run to a fall in GDP that is larger than the cut in the deficit ( if the so-called multiplier is larger than one ) , which would cause the debt / GDP ratio to rise . 
But almost all economic models imply that a cut in expenditures today should lead to higher GDP in the long run , because it allows for lower taxes ( and thus reduces economic distortions ) . 
Austerity should thus always be beneficial for solvency in the long run , even if the debt / GDP ratio deteriorates in the short run . 
For this reason , the current increase in debt / GDP ratios in southern Europe should not be interpreted as proof that austerity does not work . 
Moreover , austerity has been accompanied by structural reforms , which should increase countries &quot; long-term growth potential , while pension reforms are set to reduce considerably the fiscal cost of aging populations . 
Such reforms promise to strengthen the solvency of all governments that adopt them , including those on the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
More important , austerity has been very successful in restoring external balance to the eurozone &apos;s periphery . 
The current accounts of all southern eurozone countries are improving rapidly and , with the possible exception of Greece , will soon swing into surplus . 
This fundamental change has contributed to the reduction in risk premia over the last year , despite the political upheaval that continues in many countries ( particularly Italy , Portugal , and Greece ) . 
The external aspect is crucial . 
If public debt is owed to domestic investors , it can be serviced with the taxes levied on GDP . 
But debt owed to foreigners can be serviced only with goods and services sold abroad - that is , exports . 
Thus , the key variable for countries that had large current-account deficits , and thus are burdened today with high foreign-debt levels , is not the debt / GDP ratio , but the foreign debt / exports ratio ( together with the growth prospects for exports ) . 
Here , developments are encouraging . 
During the boom years , when countries like Greece , Portugal , and Spain were running ever-larger external deficits , their exports did not grow quickly , so their foreign debt / exports ratios deteriorated steadily , reaching levels that are usually regarded as a warning signal . 
For example , for Spain and Portugal , the sum of past deficits relative to annual exports reached 300 % and 400 % , respectively , in 2009 , whereas a 250 % ratio is typically regarded as the threshold at which external-financing problems can arise .

With austerity , imports have crashed everywhere in the periphery , while exports - helped by falling labor costs - are increasing ( except in Greece ) . 
As a result , these countries &quot; current accounts are now moving into surplus , and their external solvency is improving rapidly . 
Indeed , according to the IMF , Spain should record growing current-account surpluses over the next five years , as exports rise strongly , thus cutting the external debt / export ratio by half ( to about 150 % in 2018 ) , while Portugal &apos;s ratio should fall to about 250 % . 
Even Italy , whose external deficits have remained small , will soon record a current-account surplus . 
Austerity always involves huge social costs ; but it is unavoidable when a country has lived beyond its means and lost its foreign creditors &quot; confidence . 
The external fundamentals of the eurozone &apos;s periphery are now improving rapidly . 
In this sense , austerity has done exactly what it was intended to do .
