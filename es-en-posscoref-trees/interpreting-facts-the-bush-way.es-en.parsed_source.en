Interpreting Facts the Bush Way 
Last month &apos;s American election saw the two sides throw facts , figures , interpretations , and counter-interpretations at the hapless electorate . 
It is an old trick : throw enough mud and some of it will stick . 
Confuse the voters enough , and eventually more will be likely to stay with the horse they know . 
Most of the media not controlled by the right wing tried to play the role of honest broker , giving equal weight to each interpretation . 
If one side said the sky was blue and the other said it was orange , journalists would work hard , for the sake of appearing balanced , to find some academic , even a color blind one , willing to say that the sky was indeed orange . 
But is it all just a matter of opinion ? 
Are all interpretations equally valid ? 
I can answer that question only in my own area expertise , economics . 
With the election over , the debate itself has much to teach us about economics , economic policy , and media spin . 
President Bush cited seeming huge job growth in the last 13 months , claiming that America &apos;s labor market turned the corner . 
Is this true ? 
Although job growth in October was robust at last , in September there were only 96,000 new jobs , 50,000 short of what was needed . 
But at this point in the business cycle , the United States normally should be creating jobs at a rapid pace to make up for job losses earlier in the cycle - as it did in 1993-1995 . 
In fact , this is the worst job recovery after any of America &apos;s nine postwar recessions . 
No spin can alter this fact . 
America has not turned the corner . 
On the contrary , most forecasters expect 2005 to be weaker than 2004 , with growth insufficient to eliminate the &quot; job deficit &quot; - the gap between the number of jobs needed during the past four years to provide employment for new labor-market entrants and the actual number of jobs created . 
But don &apos;t blame Bush . 
The economy was in a downturn when he took office in 2001 , and 9 / 11 and Iraq made matters worse . 
True , the economy was slowing when Bush took office , but he also inherited an enormous fiscal surplus , amounting to 2 % of GDP , which he transformed into a yawning deficit , equaling 4.5 % of GDP . 
Normally , a fiscal turnaround of this magnitude would provide massive stimulus . 
The economy should be going gangbusters . 
This has not happened because Bush pushed a tax cut that was not designed to stimulate the economy , but to benefit the rich . 
A tax cut to low-income individuals or increased unemployment benefits would have provided far more stimulus to consumption , just as a temporary investment tax credit would have boosted capital spending far more than reducing taxes on dividends did . 
In fact , fixed business investment as a share of GDP is some 2 % lower today than 4 years ago . 
True , the terrorist attacks on America and the Iraq war hit the economy hard . 
But it was evident even before 9 / 11 that Bush &apos;s medicine wasn &apos;t working . 
In his annual economic report in February 2002 , and again in February 2003 and February 2004 , Bush confidently - and wrongly - predicted that his tax cut would create millions of jobs . 
Finally , Bush cannot be given a pass on the Iraq war and its economic consequences . 
Critics warned that the war would cause instability in Iraq and the Middle East , and that this would lead to high oil prices . 
Bush ignored these warnings . 
Today , two factors threaten America &apos;s recovery . 
Moreover , real estate prices might fall dramatically , in which case many households may find the value of their mortgage exceeding the value of their house . 
US bankruptcy rates are already up 33 % over four years ago . 
But can Bush really be blamed for Americans &apos; borrowing too much ? 
He can and should . 
Failure to design an effective fiscal stimulus shifted the burden to monetary policy . 
Interest rates were brought to new lows , which helped the economy , but without stimulating much investment . 
Monetary loosening worked only because households took on more debt , leaving the economy more vulnerable to rising interest rates . 
The second threat to economic recovery is high oil prices . 
Bush &apos;s failed Mid-East policy is only part of the problem . 
He could , and should , have pushed for strong energy conservation measures ; had he done so four years ago , America &apos;s consumption - and oil prices - would be lower today . 
Japan and other developed countries prove that a high standard of living requires only a fraction of the energy per dollar of GDP . 
Instead , Bush pushed for subsidies to oil companies to encourage more domestic production . 
This &quot; drain America first &quot; policy will leave America more vulnerable in the future . 
We know from the recent US election campaign that facts do not always speak for themselves . 
Yet it doesn &apos;t take much to work out where America &apos;s economy is today , where it &apos;s heading , and who &apos;s to blame . 
But more important than assessing blame is correcting mistakes . 
Unfortunately , President Bush has been as reluctant to admit the mistakes of his economic policy as he has in the case of his Iraqi misadventure . 
Without grasping what has gone wrong in either area , it will be difficult to avoid repeating the same mistakes .
