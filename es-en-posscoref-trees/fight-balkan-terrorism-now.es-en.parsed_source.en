Fight Balkan Terrorism Now 
Slobodan Milosevic &apos;s trial in the Hague is a timely reminder of just how devastating terroristic violence can be . 
President Bush may or may not have been careless in portraying Iraq , Iran and North Korea as an &quot; axis of evil , &quot; but he was correct in pointing out the many hidden links in the global terrorist chain . 
Within that chain Balkan terrorism remains a small but vital link , one which has continued to flourish right under the eyes of NATO and the UN . 
Osama bin Laden established his presence in the region through a series of so-called &quot; humanitarian &quot; organizations in Bosnia and Albania sometime around 1994 . 
Some of the fighters in Bosnia , Kosovo and Macedonia during the Balkan wars included mujahedeen from many countries who had trained in Afghanistan . 
Local terrorist centers were also important . 
Indeed , in Albania terrorists were trained on the property of former Albanian President Sali Berisha near the town of Tropoje . 
Beyond this powerful hint of local support for terrorists , there was an economic infrastructure . 
Two tons of heroin per month passed from Asia to Europe through Kosovo during the rule of Slobodan Milosevic . 
Instead of diminishing since Milosevic &apos;s fall , drug smuggling has increased . 
Last year , five tons of heroin was smuggled through the lands now overseen by the United Nations and NATO . 
Interpol says that Albanian gangs now control 70 % of heroin trafficking in Germany , Austria , Switzerland and Scandinavia . 
Cooperation over the last few years between the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) , the NATO-led multinational Kosova Force ( KFOR ) , and local governments - boosted by the arrival of a democratic government in Serbia - has cut down the number of terrorist attacks in Southern Serbia and Macedonia . 
Yet this cooperation has failed to stymie the fusion of terrorist and criminal activity . 
Indeed , due to the wealth of terrorist groups engaged in drug dealing , Erhard Busek , the Coordinator of the EU &apos;s Stability Pact for the former Yugoslavia , thinks that the chance of peace in Macedonia will be a mere 50 % once this winter &apos;s snows thaw . 
Calm will not return to the Balkans so long as the UN and NATO fail to destroy extremism &apos;s base in Kosovo . 
For the criminal / terrorist heart of the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army continues to fortify its power and to expand into Macedonia , Southern Serbia and Montenegro . 
Some less careful commanders of the KLA even talk about the 100,000 Albanians in Greece as an ultimate target for their irredentist goals . 
The goal of a &quot; Greater Albania , &quot; has not been forgotten . 
Instead of suppressing the terrorists , they have been treated as part of the solution to instability in the Balkans . 
NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson did call Albanian terrorists in Macedonia &quot; a bunch of murderous thugs , &quot; yet those same thugs were holding public press conferences in Pristina under the noses of UNMIK or KFOR . 
So solicitous of the terrorists &apos; desires are some countries that America &apos;s representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) conducted negotiations with Macedonian politicians and terrorist commanders not in Skopje or Tetovo but in Prizren , a Kosovar city where they are influential . 
Over the last few years Kosovo has been ethnically cleansed of a quarter of a million people . 
One hundred churches and monasteries have been razed . 
Ethnically motivated murders are less common of late , but this cannot be deemed a success so long as Kosovo &apos;s non-Albanians remain isolated in enclaves protected by KFOR . 
Recent elections have confirmed the general aversion to violence of the local population . 
But elections are a democratic instrument only if all parties accept their results . 
Real power in Kosovo , however , remains in the hands of those with kalashnikovs . 
The international forces in Kosovo are strong enough to cut the Balkan link in the global terrorist chain . 
The Balkan traffickers in drugs , arms , women , and refugees - the underground criminal trades that fund the terrorists - can be closed down . 
But to do this , the international bodies that control Kosovo must dissolve any organization that relies on violence . 
Known criminals should not sit in Kosovo &apos;s Parliament , but in prison . 
The worst of them don &apos;t belong in Kosovo &apos;s government but on trial with Milosevic in the Hague . 
Fearful of challenging the armed terrorists , the international bodies that govern Kosovo prefer to appease them . 
Frustrated international administrators , indeed , have forced Albania &apos;s political parties to form a coalition . 
This , however , may result in eviscerating the power of Dr. Ibrahim Rugova , finally confirmed as President earlier this month , while the extremist &apos;s parties transformed from the Kosovo Liberation Army are admitted into government . 
The goal behind the bombing of Yugoslavia , of Security Council resolution 1244 and today &apos;s provisional constitutional framework for Kosovo , was the creation of the pre-conditions for the democratic development of a multiethnic society . 
As this remains the only worthwhile and workable goal , the only viable solution to Kosovo &apos;s future is a coalition of moderate Albanians and the parties of Kosovo &apos;s ethnic minorities . 
But pragmatic cynics have been arguing for three years that such a solution is impossible . 
By appeasing the terrorists in this way , the most powerful states in the world give a green light to terrorists not only in the Balkans but all over the world . 
Kosovo is a territory far smaller than Afghanistan . 
If the world fails to eliminate terrorists from politics in Kosovo , what hope does it have of defeating terrorism elsewhere ? 
So , before the anti-terror campaign seeks other terrorist bases to destroy , it should eliminate terror in a place where the UN itself is ruling . 
If not , the UN , NATO and the European Union will discredit themselves as well as the humanitarian values they use to justify their &quot; humanitarian &quot; interventions .
