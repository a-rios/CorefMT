Taming the Tigers 
BRUSSELS - Three years ago , Sri Lanka elected Mahinda Rajapaksa as president because he pledged to take the offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , the guerillas who have been fighting for 25 years to carve out an independent homeland for the country &apos;s Tamil minority . 
Many well-meaning people saw Rajapaksa &apos;s promise as warmongering , and , even as Sri Lanka &apos;s army has been pressing toward victory , urged him to negotiate with perhaps the world &apos;s most fanatical terror organization ( the Tamil Tigers , it should be recalled , virtually invented the cult of the modern suicide bomber . ) 
Fortunately , Rajapaksa listened more to his war-ravaged citizens than to outsiders , and today what seemed impossible - military victory over the Tigers , the oldest , largest , and wealthiest guerrilla army in South Asia - appears at hand . 
Over the past few months , the Tigers have suffered a series of devastating blows . 
Instead of commanding much of northern Sri Lanka , they are now confined to a shrinking pocket , and are reduced to mindless military stunts such as the recent bombing by light aircraft of the tax administration building in the capital , Colombo . 
Thousands of Tamil Tiger fighters have deserted . A rebel army has dwindled to a fanatical few . 
But fighting the Tigers and seeking a peace deal have never been alternatives . 
President Rajapaksa &apos;s predecessors spent years engaged in fruitless talks and ceasefires , during which the guerrillas remained committed to their aim of dividing the country , and making demands for political and socio-economic changes that no democracy could accept , even as they carried on killing and kidnapping . 
Weakening the Tigers militarily has thus always been a necessary condition for achieving a political settlement with Sri Lanka &apos;s Tamils . 
Now that the guerrillas are boxed in , what can Rajapaksa reasonably offer to them and ordinary Tamils ? 
The Tigers &quot; leaders have committed crimes against humanity , and some of them engage in criminal activities . 
So they have little incentive to demobilize . 
True , but in politics the best justice can be the enemy of the general good . 
Though the Tigers can no longer destroy Sri Lanka &apos;s democracy , fighting to the last guerrilla is in nobody &apos;s interest . 
Ending this conflict will require political adroitness as well as continued military firmness . 
Achieving a lasting peace , though difficult , is possible . 
On the most basic level , it will almost certainly require security guarantees for the Tigers &quot; leaders . 
Sri Lanka is a democracy . 
In exchange for laying down their arms and ending a pointless and destructive war , Tiger soldiers should be encouraged to take part in politics , but on exactly the same terms as any other Sri Lankan . 
Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of rebuilding Sri Lanka &apos;s war-ravaged north and reconciling the Tamils at a time of global recession . 
In countries with strong ethnic , tribal , and religious divisions , unless it is made clear from the start that everything possible will be done to foster reconciliation , communal enmity will most likely simmer . 
Any &quot; victory &quot; that the Tamils perceive as leading to subjugation of their rights and aspirations for equality with the majority Sinhalese will be short-lived . 
So Rajapaksa must offer the Tamil people a political compromise , perhaps including some cabinet positions , as well as the promise of a revived economy . 
Indeed , the Rajapaksa government , and the majority Sinhalese , must understand that the political and economic reforms needed to achieve a lasting peace are inextricably intertwined . 
One cannot succeed without the other . 
On the political front , a power vacuum must be avoided . 
Although one of the main goals of reconstruction must be the creation of a democratic system that the Tamils regard as their own , establishing effective governance , and fast , in Sri Lanka &apos;s north matters just as much . 
Order must be restored rapidly , with zero tolerance of looting and other crimes . 
Nevertheless , victory over the Tigers need not rule out some form of decentralization that guarantees the Tamils some political say , so long as a degree of local autonomy does not destroy Sri Lanka &apos;s unity . 
The alternative to such a political compromise may be a return to the tragic and bloody secessionist course that the Tigers sought for so long . 
Indeed , no effort should be spared to get skeptical Tamil groups to participate in the forthcoming peacemaking . 
Of course , it may take some time for the Tamils and their leaders to learn the mutual tolerance and self-discipline of democratic government . 
Handing over any local power before those leaders are ready to use it would be an error , with potentially disastrous consequences . 
In the Eastern Province , a good start has been made , with former terrorists now winning through the ballot box and not the bullet . 
Economic reform also must begin without delay . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s economy must open up - ï¿½ not an easy thing to achieve at a time when liberal economic reforms appear to be in disrepute . 
Sri Lanka &apos;s Buddhist traditions and historic links with Burma , Thailand , Cambodia and Laos makes it easy for it to be a future member of ASEAN , which Sri Lanka should try to join as a means of anchoring its economy in the wider region . 
Some of what needs to be done , including the sequencing of reconstruction measures , is now better understood - not least due to the different recent experiences in rebuilding Bosnia , Colombia , and other war-torn states . 
In this respect , Sri Lanka &apos;s ability to maintain its democracy throughout decades of war gives reason for hope .
