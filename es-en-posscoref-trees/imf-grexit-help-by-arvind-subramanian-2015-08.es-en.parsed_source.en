How the IMF Failed Greece 
NEW DELHI - Democracy is about real choices . 
But , throughout their country &apos;s crisis , the Greek people have been deprived of them . 
For this , the Europe Union and especially the International Monetary Fund bear considerable responsibility . 
Greece was offered two stark choices : Leave the eurozone without financing , or remain and receive support at the price of further austerity . 
But Greece should have been offered a third option : Leave the euro , but with generous financing . 
This option should have been put on the table , recognizing that Greece has broader political reasons for staying within the eurozone . 
Although exiting the monetary union would have yielded considerable benefits , &quot; Grexit &quot; would have entailed sizeable costs as well . 
The benefits would have included a massive devaluation , which would have restored some dynamism to what was once a fast-growing economy . 
But the costs were terrifying . 
The government would have had to default , the banks would have been ruined , and both would have struggled for years to regain the trust of financial markets . 
As a result , interest rates would have remained high for a long time to come , impeding efforts to restore growth . 
Is it any wonder that the Greek government shrank from this horror and chose the &quot; safe &quot; option of austerity ? 
But this option may not be safe at all . 
It is in fact , to quote T.S. Eliot , that &quot; awful daring of a moment &apos;s surrender ... &quot; 
Greece will now need to grind away at austerity , hoping that in some distant future &quot; internal devaluation &quot; - that is , wage and price deflation - will help to spark a recovery . 
Only the IMF could have offered the third option of an orderly exit . 
Greece should have been told that it could reap the benefits of devaluation , while the international community would act to minimize the attendant costs . 
The precise terms of Grexit - agreed by the troika ( the IMF , the European Commission , and the European Central Bank ) and Greek authorities - surely would have included a negotiated reduction in Greece &apos;s debts , as well as a strategy for recapitalizing the banking system in order minimize uncertainty , pain , and disruption . 
Still , the costs would have been sizeable , so the IMF would have needed to offer generous financing , covering the country &apos;s import requirements for , say , two years while providing the liquidity to manage the transition to a new currency . 
Of course , this would have increased the IMF &apos;s already-large exposure to Greece ; but this would have been a worthwhile trade-off , because it would have served a strategy that would have had a much better chance of success . 
But is there any strategy that could have succeeded in restoring the Greek economy ? 
After all , under any scenario , Greece will need to run a primary surplus and undertake structural reforms to transform its economy . 
And many insist that this will not happen , because Greece simply refuses to change . 
And yet such assessments overlook the record of the past few years , during which successive governments have taken some fairly radical measures to strengthen Greece &apos;s fiscal position and scale back the public payroll . 
Moreover , the skeptics overlook the fact that incentives to carry out structural reforms are partly endogenous . 
After all , without devaluation and the prospect of debt relief , reform merely spells more short-term pain , not less . 
The reason why an assisted Grexit was never offered seems clear : Greece &apos;s European creditors were vehemently opposed to the idea . 
But it is not clear that the IMF should have placed great weight on these concerns . 
Back in 2010 , creditor countries were concerned about contagion to the rest of the eurozone . 
If Grexit had succeeded , the entire monetary union would have come under threat , because investors would have wondered whether some of the eurozone &apos;s other highly indebted countries would have followed Greece &apos;s lead . 
But this risk is actually another argument in favor of providing Greece with the option of leaving . 
There is something deeply unappealing about yoking countries together when being unyoked is more advantageous . 
More recently , creditor countries have been concerned about the financial costs to member governments that have lent to Greece . 
But Latin America in the 1980s showed that creditor countries stand a better chance of being repaid ( in expected-value terms ) when the debtor countries are actually able to grow . 
In short , the IMF should not have made Europe &apos;s concerns , about contagion or debt repayment , decisive in its decision-making . 
Instead , it should have publicly pushed for the third option , which would have been a watershed , for it would have signaled that the IMF will not be driven by its powerful members to acquiesce in bad policies . 
Indeed , it would have afforded the Fund an opportunity to atone for its complicity in the creditor-driven , austerity-addled misery to which Greeks have been subject for the last five years . 
Above all , it would have enabled the IMF to move beyond being the instrument of status quo powers - the United States and Europe . 
From an Asian perspective , by defying its European shareholders , the IMF would have gone a long way toward heralding the emergence of a new institution : a truly International Monetary Fund , in place of today &apos;s Euro-Atlantic Monetary Fund . 
All is not lost . 
If the current strategy fails , the third option - assisted Grexit - remains available . 
The IMF should plan for it . 
The Greek people deserve some real choices in the near future .
