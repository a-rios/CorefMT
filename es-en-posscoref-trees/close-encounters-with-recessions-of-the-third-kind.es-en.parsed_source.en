Close Encounters with Recessions of the Third Kind 
PARIS : Three types of recessions exist . 
The first type are those caused by major shocks , say an outbreak of war or a sudden , sharp increase in the price of petroleum . 
Recall that the OPEC oil shocks of the 1970 &apos;s incited two world recessions . 
The second category of recessions arise by chance , for example when consumer confidence dips , or businesses become uneasy and cut back on investment and / or inventory . 
This was the cause of America &apos;s recession in the early 1990 &quot; s . 
The third type of recession occurs when imbalances in an economy build up to unsustainable levels before exploding . 
This form of recession is sometimes characterized by vast increases in debt ( corporate or consumer ) , or by dizzying stock market or capital asset speculations that eventually come crashing down . 
The &quot; popping &quot; of such an asset bubble is what happened in Japan 10 years ago , an event from which that country has not yet recovered . 
Recessions of the first type are , almost by definition , largely unpredictable . 
Those of the second type are minor and relatively easy to repair if not to avoid . 
All that they usually require is a reduction in interest rates or a bit of reflation . 
Recessions of the third kind are the most worrying . 
Is America facing this third type of recession ? 
What , indeed , will be the nature of America &apos;s next recession , that is , if America has a recession ? 
Optimists predict a recession of the second type ; pessimists suspect that a third variety recession is lurking in the economic shadows . 
Who is right ? 
The answer depends almost entirely on one single number : the growth rate of American productivity in the future . 
After adjusting for inflation , America &apos;s stock exchanges roughly tripled in value in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Indeed , stock prices doubled compared to profits . 
The savings rate for households has gone from 5 % of American GDP in 1990 to zero in 2000 . 
America &apos;s current account balance - the surplus of imports over exports - is now in deficit to the tune of 3 % of GDP . 
Do these figures reflect alarming imbalances or are they the usual signs of a boom ? 
If America &apos;s rate of growth in the coming decades remains what it has been over the past thirty years , the answer is simple , and terrifying . 
Stock market prices would be much too high . 
Households would be behaving in a totally irresponsible manner . 
The exterior imbalance would be unjustifiable , indeed , unsustainable . 
If America &apos;s annual rate of improvement in productivity turns out to be higher in the next thirty years than they have been over the past three decades , the country &apos;s worries will be few . 
High stock market valuations would reflect a radiant future , households would be behaving in a reasonable way , and America would be wise to run a trade deficit in order to invest . 
Under such conditions , a mere nudge in interest rates by the Federal Reserve should set right any residual problem ; if not , a tax cut will do the trick . 
Any recession would likely be short and limited . 
What level of improved productivity can America expect in future years ? 
Productivity growth will probably be higher than before 1995 : the soaring growth rates of recent years are not accidents ; the high tech explosion is real . 
All the same , I still fear that improvements in productivity will turn out to be lower than the prophets of the New Economy promise . 
This prospect literally gives me the shivers . 
Not only may the future be less radiant , but the adjustments that will be required once reality sets in could set off a nastier recession and a more persistent slowing of the economy than anything predicted today .
