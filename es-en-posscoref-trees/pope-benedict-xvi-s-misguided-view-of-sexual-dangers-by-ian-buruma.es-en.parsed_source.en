The Pope &apos;s Dangerous Sex Appeal 
NEW YORK - Human sexual behavior can be perilous , as the ghastly rape of a 23-year-old woman by six men on a Delhi bus in December once again showed . 
After going to the cinema , she and her boyfriend were beaten , before she was brutally assaulted and attacked with an iron rod for more than an hour . 
Thirteen days later , she died from her wounds . 
It is often claimed that rape is not really about sex , but about power . 
True enough . 
But it is not unrelated to sex . 
The sexual act is used as a form of torture , or even , in some cases , as a deadly weapon . 
But that was not what Pope Benedict XVI had in mind when he spoke recently about the dangers of sexual behavior . 
In his pre-Christmas speech to the Roman Curia , the pope did not mention rape , let alone the sexual murder in Delhi . 
Instead , in his defense of the family - or , as he would put it , the sacred union between man and woman - he pointed out how sexual arrangements outside that union were a threat to human civilization . 
What he had in mind , without quite saying so , were same-sex unions . 
It was a deeply confused speech . 
His disquisition on the dangers posed by same-sex marriage followed a passage deploring the modern tendency to avoid lifelong commitments in human relationships , as if that were not precisely what gay marriage is about . 
Of course , in the pope &apos;s view , commitment in gay relationships is part of the problem : more and more people , especially in the Western world , now claim the freedom to choose their own sexual identities instead of sticking to the &quot; natural &quot; roles &quot; ordained by God . &quot; 
The pope &apos;s words suggest that homosexuality is a kind of lifestyle choice , a form of modern decadence - a secular , even blasphemous act against God and nature - rather than a fact of birth . 
This is a common belief among religious believers , be they conservative Catholics , Protestants , Jews , or Muslims . 
Tellingly , Benedict quoted Gilles Bernheim , the Chief Rabbi of France , who has expressed similar views on the threats to conventional family life . 
Fear of sexual behavior is one of the main reasons why most religions establish strict rules concerning sexual relationships . 
Marriage is a way to contain our dangerous desires . 
Restricting sexual conduct to procreation is supposed to make the world safer and more peaceful . 
Because women excite the desires of men , they are thought to pose a threat outside the confines of the family home . 
That is why , in some societies , they are not allowed to emerge from those confines , or may do so only if fully covered and accompanied by a male relative . 
Benedict is not so extreme . 
On the contrary , he sees himself as a deeply civilized man of peace . 
But I would argue that his speech actually encourages the kind of sexual aggression that can result in the savagery that took place in Delhi . 
The six rapists who killed the young woman were not modern decadents who chose to defy God and nature by claiming new secular freedoms , let alone heterodox sexual identities . 
From what we can surmise from this case - and many others like it - they are the semi-urbanized products of a highly conventional rural society where the roles of men , and especially women , are tightly regulated . 
Their victim , a well-educated physiotherapy intern , seems to have been a great deal more modern than her attackers . 
For that reason , the six rapists saw her as a &quot; loose &quot; woman , a city slut , fair game . 
After all , she was out late with her boyfriend . 
That is precisely how the men taunted the young couple : What was an unmarried young woman doing out in the Delhi streets with a young man ? 
She deserved what was coming to her . 
The reaction in some quarters followed similar lines . 
When demonstrations against sexual violence erupted in Delhi , the Indian president &apos;s son denounced the protesters as &quot; dented and painted . &quot; 
Some politicians have described rape victims as &quot; adventurous . &quot; 
Violent hatred of homosexuals comes from a similar source . 
Just as women outside the family home - women who stake a claim to public space , working and living among men - are seen as dangerous temptresses , men who love men are often regarded as predators , ready to pounce on society &apos;s children . 
What many people fear is not just uncontrolled sexual behavior , but sex itself . 
But the more sex is repressed and people are made to fear it the greater the chance of sexual violence , because anyone who might possibly stir our sexual desires , man or woman , becomes a potential target of our rage . 
This might help to explain what happened in Delhi , but it does not in any way excuse it . 
After all , most men in that city would not beat a young couple with metal pipes and rape the woman to death . 
Hundreds of thousands of Indians are demonstrating in the streets to show their loathing of such atrocities . 
One wishes that the pope had said something about that , and had offered some words of encouragement to the men and women in India who have had enough of sexual violence coming not from modern libertines , but from deeply repressed men . 
But that is too much to expect from a man who appears to understand little about sexual life . 
That is why , instead of talking about rapists , he targeted peaceful homosexual men and women who wish to show their commitment to their lovers by marrying them .
