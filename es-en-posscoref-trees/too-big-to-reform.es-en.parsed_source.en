Too Big to Reform ? 
LONDON - The best journalism , it is said , is the first draft of history . 
Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin is certainly worthy of that designation . 
As a bit player in the dramatic events that Sorkin describes ( I am an independent director of Morgan Stanley in my spare time ) , I can confirm that he accurately captures the atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty that reigned in New York in the autumn of 2008 . 
It was a time when the tectonic plates of the financial system seemed to be shifting beneath us . 
Institutions that had been seen as Rocks of Gibraltar were revealed to be smoking volcanoes , at risk of imminent dissolution into lava and ash . 
Even Goldman Sachs continued to exist only thanks to the kind attentions of the United States Federal Reserve . 
On the other side of the Atlantic , the British government found itself to be the proud owner of over 80 % of Royal Bank of Scotland , which , according to some measures , had for a while been the world &apos;s largest bank . 
The experience was a lesson for banks , regulators , central banks , and treasuries , which , not surprisingly , were unprepared to handle a comprehensive crisis . 
Their tools and powers were lacking . 
The overriding conclusion that emerges from any analysis of these unhappy events is that nothing will ever be the same again : the relationship between the state and the markets needs to be rethought . 
A new &quot; social contract &quot; between finance and the people , through their governments , is required . 
That is easy to say , but governments , individually and collectively , are still struggling to redefine the terms of that contract . 
Progress has been painfully slow , partly because officials have been fire-fighting , and partly because urgent domestic political imperatives compete with the desire to establish new , globally applicable mechanisms that would provide a stable underpinning for the international financial system and prevent regulatory arbitrage and the de-globalization of finance . 
As a result , we are seeing different national regulatory approaches emerge . 
In the US , the key driver of the biggest institutions &quot; decision-making is the Fed &apos;s stress tests , which essentially assumed that everything that could go wrong would go wrong . 
In Switzerland , the leverage ratio is now central . 
Elsewhere , various versions of the Basel 1 and Basel 2 accords on international banking standards are in operation , sometimes with ad hoc supplements . 
A new global Financial Stability Board is trying to make sense of all this , and also to work out a new &quot; macro-prudential mechanism &quot; reflecting system-wide risks . 
But it has no formal authority to mandate a common approach to capital ( the G-20 should give it one ) . 
There is not much more progress to report on the too-big-to-fail problem itself . 
What should be done about the mammoths of the financial jungle - some of which were conjured into being by governments themselves in the heat of the crisis ? 
Sorkin &apos;s book reminds us that only 18 months ago , the US administration saw one answer in the creation of bigger and bigger banks , on the shaky argument that lashing two sinking ships together would somehow make them both seaworthy . 
The British government did the same , acting as midwife to the Lloyds-Halifax Bank of Scotland combine , now widely seen to have been a major error . 
It is no secret that there are deep divisions among public authorities on this question . In the red corner , so to speak , we find former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and current Bank of England Governor Mervyn King , not natural revolutionaries . 
They would like to carve up the megabanks and especially to separate retail banking from securities trading , or what is often now called &quot; casino banking . &quot; 
( In fact , the analogy is unfair to casino owners , who have a much stronger record in risk management than do most investment banks ) . 
In the blue corner sit US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and his British counterpart , Alistair Darling , who argue that a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act , which divided investment banking from commercial banking , is not appropriate for today &apos;s markets . 
They believe that regulators can ring-fence capital supporting different business lines , to prevent contagion risk , and perhaps impose a surcharge on large &quot; systemic &quot; firms , to reflect the price of their implicit support from the central bank and government . 
Depending on size , this might constrain the ambitions of institutions that have plainly been &quot; too big to manage , &quot; as well as &quot; too big to fail , &quot; which is the most fearsome combination . 
Where do I stand in this lively debate ? 
I believe that more diversity in banking , and more competition , is highly desirable . 
There is far too much concentration following the crisis , certainly in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe . 
Neelie Kroes , the retiring EU Competition Commissioner , was surely right to demand some divestiture of branches from the biggest groups , though arguably she did not go far enough . 
It is encouraging , too , that private equity funds look interested in creating and funding new entrants . 
We need new capital , and new approaches to management , in the banking system . 
But I am nervous about the idea that regulators are best placed to determine the future shape of markets . 
If the authorities are seen to have brought new institutions into being by fiat , might they not be obligated to support them , come what may ? 
Over time , the aim must surely be to minimize the proportion of the financial sector that is subject to some form of state guarantee . 
A regulator-designed banking system would make that aim more difficult to achieve .
