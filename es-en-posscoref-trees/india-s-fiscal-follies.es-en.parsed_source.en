India &apos;s Fiscal Follies 
NEW DEHLI  -  
India &apos;s new budget for 2008-2009 says less about the country &apos;s current financial health than it does about the irresistible tendency of Indian governments to use the national budget as a pre-election cudgel . 
Every year , India struggles to reconcile the irreconcilable : stimulate economic growth and investment , alleviate endemic poverty , and feed a ravenous military appetite . 
The government must be seen to care about &quot; aam aadmi , &quot; the common man ( who votes ) , while satisfying the needs of businessmen ( who keep the economy humming ) . 
Indeed , the new budget is a pre-election bonanza for key constituencies : tax cuts for the middle class and perks for the country &apos;s big corporations . 
There &apos;s a little something for everyone , including a stunning $ 15 billion in loan waivers for small farmers . 
For all the attention that India &apos;s retail revolution , information technology prowess , and booming manufacturing sectors have garnered in recent years , agriculture , on which 70 % of the population still directly depends , is in crisis . 
Growth in India &apos;s agricultural sector declined from a lackluster 3.8 % to an even more anemic 2.6 % last year . 
Water tables are dropping where farmers are lucky enough to have wells , and rainfall has become increasingly unpredictable . 
Subsistence farming of traditional food grains , fruits , and vegetables is giving way to cash crops and monocultures dependent on high-priced inputs that small farmers cannot afford and water that they can &apos;t provide . 
Farmers borrow money from usurious private lenders . 
Unable to repay their loans , they kill themselves . 
Farmer suicides in India have raged unabated over the past decade , a period of much-vaunted rapid growth . 
These more than 100,000 deaths are a tragic indictment of India &apos;s economic &quot; miracle , &quot; and an embarrassment for a government eager to promote India &apos;s image as an up-and-coming global economic and military power . 
While well intentioned , the new budget &apos;s lavish loan forgiveness scheme will not help those farmers who most need relief : 80 % of India &apos;s farmers have no access to formal credit , and it is bank loans that are to be forgiven . 
Moreover , since farmers who do have access to formal credit will have less incentive to repay their loans , banks will become more reluctant to lend to any farmers at all . 
A policy of expanding legitimate micro-lending schemes and prosecuting illegal loan sharks , not to mention the promotion of sustainable agricultural practices that require fewer expensive ( and environmentally dangerous ) inputs , would do far more to help India &apos;s poorest farmers than this expensive and misguided measure . 
The new budget , recognizing the country &apos;s acute water crisis , also calls for more money to expand irrigation . 
Most Indian farmers will benefit from greater access to irrigation , but if this means building more ill-conceived dams and pursuing large-scale projects , the result will be more water for industrial agriculture , more damage to India &apos;s damaged environment , and little improvement for poor farmers . 
Aggressive expansion of proven low-cost , high-impact micro-irrigation techniques would do more to help small-scale farmers . 
The new budget is also likely to do little to improve India &apos;s poor education and primary health-care systems . 
True , spending in these two critical areas is to rise dramatically ( by 20 % for education and 15 % for health care ) . 
But , because these items amount to a pittance of India &apos;s total budget , total spending remains low , especially relative to need . 
Meanwhile , the lion &apos;s share of the new budget , 63 % , will go to the military , police , administration , and debt service . 
India &apos;s defense spending will hit a new record of $ 26.5 billion as the world &apos;s fourth-largest military embarks on an aggressive drive to modernize its capabilities in the face of the deteriorating situation in Pakistan and China &apos;s military expansion . 
Having performed poorly in a spate of recent state elections , the ruling Congress Party is betting that the new budget will swing voters its way if the national election , currently scheduled for April 2009 , is moved forward to this autumn . 
The lesson of the 2004 election , when poorer voters , fed up with the previous BJP-led government &apos;s &quot; India Shining &quot; policies and slogans , threw it out of office , has not been forgotten . 
But the strategy of embracing &quot; poor-friendly &quot; policies that deliver little real relief could backfire . 
Poor voters may not associate the largesse with the Congress-led government in New Dehli , but rather with the state governments that actually hand out the goods . 
Moreover , there is nothing to indicate that the government aid proposed in the budget will reach those who need it with any more efficiency than the dismal record so far . 
It is conceivable that Mayawati Kumari , the self-appointed &quot; goddess &quot; of the poor whose low-caste-based party , the BSP , swept to power last year with a clear majority in Uttar Pradesh , could be the biggest winner in an early election . 
This would represent a revolution in Indian politics , but it is hardly the outcome the champions of business-driven market reforms would welcome . 
Whether a more populist government would be able to break radically with India &apos;s flawed fiscal policies and create an environment favorable to a dramatic improvement in India &apos;s shamefully poor human and physical infrastructure - which would give a solid boost to India &apos;s economy over the long term - remains to be seen .
