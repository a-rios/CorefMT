Lebanon &apos;s Moment of Decision 
Lebanon is at a historic crossroad . 
It can choose to lead the Middle East into vibrant multi-sectarian democracy or slump back into corrupt local politics under foreign tutelage . 
The latter path could easily lead to civil strife and , perhaps , another civil war . 
At this very moment , Lebanon &apos;s political leaders are meeting jointly for the first time in the country &apos;s modern history without the interference of Syria , France , or the United States . 
Everyone from Saad Hariri , the son of our murdered Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , to Hizbullah &apos;s leader , Hassan Nasrallah , is present to discuss openly the issues that divide the country , as are the leaders of Lebanon &apos;s Shiia , Sunni , Greek Orthodox , Maronite Christian , and Druze communities . 
This national dialogue , held under security measures that have basically shut down central Beirut , began March 2 and is expected to last up to ten days . 
Lahoud &apos;s absence is not surprising , as the discussions deal with the fate of his illegal presidency and how to break the deadlock that his continuance in office has imposed on the country . 
Indeed , just as Lahoud &apos;s chair at the talks is vacant , so - in the eyes of the world and under the country &apos;s 150-year old constitution - is Lebanon &apos;s presidency . 
It has been vacant since September 2004 when Lahoud , backed by Syria , forced an extension of his six-year term on the Lebanese parliament , which elects the president . 
We Lebanese can already claim victory in our year-long non-violent fight for independence and democracy . 
We have succeeded in placing the issue of the presidency at center stage in Lebanese politics . 
Parliament Speaker Nabih Birri , Hizbullah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah , and Michel Aoun , leader of the Free Patriotic Movement , remain reluctant participants in the search for a new head of state . 
Nevertheless , the election of a new , democratic , and lawful president has become accepted nationally as a necessary point of departure from the murderous path taken by the country with the extension of Lahoud &apos;s mandate . 
This was clearly demonstrated on February 14 , when roughly a million people assembled to commemorate the first anniversary of Rafik Hariri &apos;s assassination . 
The crowd &apos;s sole demand was that Lahoud step down . 
On that day , I urged Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and Future Movement leader Saad Hariri , a Sunni and the political heir of his slain father , to make this their paramount slogan . 
The democratic movement &apos;s main objective is to bring about a non-violent , constitutional process to replace Lahoud with a new president in free and open elections . 
In this we have the clear support of the international community , with the United Nations Security Council giving its unanimous support to my demand for presidential elections . 
On January 23 , the Security Council issued a statement expressing regret that the conduct of &quot; free and fair presidential elections &quot; had not yet been carried out in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1559 , which was passed on the eve of Lahoud &apos;s extension . 
At a historic gathering of the parliamentary majority on February 16 , I presented a four-step process to complete , in a constitutional manner , our non-violent revolt against foreign power . 
First , the popular and parliamentary majority in Lebanon must declare that no solution is possible without the election of a new president . 
Second , a majority of parliamentarians must sign a petition declaring null and void the extension of Lahoud &apos;s term . 
Third , the parliamentary majority must formally acknowledge Lahoud &apos;s illegitimacy . 
Finally , Lebanon must elect a new president . 
With the national dialogue now underway , we are in the midst of phase three . 
If , during this dialogue , a consensus is reached on the need to elect a new president , so much the better . 
If not , phases three and four will be completed by other means . 
Lahoud has become irrelevant . 
Once the president &apos;s illegitimacy is formally acknowledged by a majority of parliamentarians , all his acts will be considered beyond his constitutional powers , and the process of electing a new president will be firmly on track . 
This can only be reversed by violence , which is unlikely , so strong is the consensus that Lebanon needs a new president , and so ingrained is the rejection of force by all Lebanese . 
While we must be vigilant in preventing extremist groups from derailing the process , the best way to do so is to accelerate transformation at the top . 
As for me , I realize that in seeking Lebanon &apos;s presidency , we must look to the future . 
That is why I offer a program that addresses such key issues as the effective representation of women in government , the need to urgently address environmental problems , to strengthen rule of law , transparency , and accountability , and to move toward universal suffrage in the election of top executive positions . 
I have also emphasized that Lebanon must develop its comparative advantages , particularly in education , banking , and services . 
All these issues have now become part of the national debate . 
Lebanon &apos;s traditional political class may not like it , but , as more of its members are now recognizing , the momentum for a new kind of presidency will not be stopped .
