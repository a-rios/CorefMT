Opening Europe &apos;s Mediterranean Window 
MADRID - One year after the fall of Hosni Mubarak , with popular upheavals continuing to roil the Arab world , it is increasingly clear that Europe can no longer sit still and do nothing . 
The ongoing protests have exposed an urgent need for renewed engagement by the European Union with the region in general - and , in particular , with the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean that are the Union &apos;s neighbors . 
Until now , the European Neighborhood Policy , born as an afterthought of the EU &apos;s successful policy towards Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall , has governed the Union &apos;s actions in the southern and eastern Mediterranean . 
Over time , however , the ENP was largely hijacked by immigration and security considerations . 
Moreover , it provided an economic lifeline to the region &apos;s autocratic regimes . 
On the Mediterranean &apos;s southern shore , a panoply of grievances , from corruption to a desire for liberty , has motivated the unrest . 
But the one underlying theme has been the absence of viable economic opportunities for the region &apos;s growing population of unemployed , and underemployed , young people . 
One year after the Arab Spring erupted , however , economic opportunities are even fewer . 
The economies of Egypt , Libya , and Tunisia have all contracted sharply . 
National budgets are strained , and foreign-exchange reserves are dwindling . 
Instead of foreign investors jumping in , capital is flooding out . 
Given the scale of the challenge facing Europe &apos;s southern neighbors , the EU must forge a far more effective Euro-Mediterranean partnership than anything attempted thus far . 
The first challenge is to reestablish trust , which requires Europeans to reconsider their attitude towards &quot; political Islam , &quot; in general , and Islamists in government , in particular . 
A relevant litmus test is Morocco . 
Even though it has not followed the region &apos;s revolutionary path , Moroccans &quot; perceptions and aspirations mirror those in neighboring countries . 
The EU welcomed the country &apos;s recent constitutional reforms , as well as the election results that brought to power an affiliate of Egypt &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood . 
But the EU also called for a strong commitment to pluralism , the rule of law , and equal rights for minorities and women - key areas in which Islamists everywhere need to prove themselves . 
This conditionality - the &quot; more for more &quot; principle - suggests that the EU has hit upon a viable way to influence developments in the region . 
But there is also a need to dispel the idea that Europe , supposedly in decline , cannot be a useful interlocutor and partner in fostering regional prosperity . 
On the contrary , the EU remains the Maghreb &apos;s top trading partner , accounting in 2010 for 70 % of the region &apos;s exports . 
Europe , though cash-strapped , can also facilitate engagement by multilateral institutions , from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , where the EU is the biggest shareholder ( close to 37 % , compared to the United States &quot; 16 % share ) , to the European Investment Bank , which recently raised the region &apos;s loan ceiling by € 1 billion ( $ 1.3 billion ) . 
Likewise , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) recently announced the start of donor-funded activities in parts of the region , including Morocco , in 2012 . 
A good example of this sort of EU engagement is the € 37 million Ouarzazate Solar Power Plant and Drinking Water Efficiency Program , sponsored by the EU Neighborhood Investment Facility , which was instrumental in securing loans amounting to more than € 600 million . It is this leveraging capacity that the EU needs to use more effectively . 
Beyond challenges of perception , the success of renewed partnership with Europe requires the region to undertake vital structural reforms . 
First , the region &apos;s countries must consolidate a sound regulatory and institutional framework that will foster efficiency and legal security for investors , both local and foreign . 
Such a framework is central to attracting not just big companies , but also to nurturing small and medium-size enterprises , which in Europe , for example , generated 85 % of all new jobs in 2002-2010 . 
It is equally important to frame EU policy as a matter of co-localization , rather than de-localization , and to overcome the zero-sum mentality that is pervasive today . 
An encouraging illustration of the co-localization approach is the launch of a Renault project in Morocco ( which , unfortunately , prompted a public backlash at the height of pre-election fever in France ) . 
Infrastructure is another vital concern , not only for linking the EU and the southern Mediterranean , but also for boosting the much-needed regional integration . 
Today , most of the Maghreb &apos;s economies are virtual enclaves , cut off from each other for reasons that are often political in nature . 
Here , too , Morocco is a good example : the Western Sahara conflict looms large behind the closure of the border with Algeria , at an annual cost to both sides that is conservatively estimated at 1-2 percentage points of GDP . 
More broadly , the Maghreb countries have the lowest intra-regional trade in the world , accounting for less than 5 % of GDP , compared to 70 % in the EU and 50 % in North America , owing , in large measure , to a &quot; spaghetti bowl &quot; of preferential trade agreements and non-tariff measures within the region . 
The EU should use its array of bilateral agreements with southern Mediterranean countries to promote a viable regional trade framework . 
The Arab revolutions have given everyone the chance to look at the Mediterranean world with fresh eyes . 
Instead of the old patron / client relationship , an EU / Maghreb partnership , as part of a transformed Neighborhood Policy founded on trust is needed . 
Only such a partnership can boost economic opportunity and increase prosperity - the demands that ignited the Arab upheaval . 
If well managed , moreover , such a partnership could also contribute to buoying the European economies in their current time of trouble .
