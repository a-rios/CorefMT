A Path through Europe &apos;s Minefield 
LONDON - Earlier this week , a group of almost 100 prominent Europeans delivered an open letter to the leaders of all 17 eurozone countries . 
And , just as importantly , they now understand that it is not enough to ensure that governments can finance their debt at reasonable interest rates ; they must also address the weakness of Europe &apos;s banking system . 
Indeed , Europe &apos;s banking and sovereign-debt problems are mutually self-reinforcing . 
The decline in government bond prices has exposed the banks &quot; undercapitalization , while the prospect that governments will have to finance banks &quot; recapitalization has driven up risk premiums on government bonds . 
Facing the prospect of having to raise additional capital at a time when their shares are selling at a fraction of book value , banks have a powerful incentive to reduce their balance sheets by withdrawing credit lines and shrinking their loan portfolios . 
Europe &apos;s leaders are now contemplating what to do , and their next move will have fateful consequences , either calming the markets or driving them to new extremes . 
But , when it comes to the banks , I am afraid that the eurozone &apos;s leaders are contemplating some inappropriate steps . 
Specifically , they are talking about recapitalizing the banking system , rather than guaranteeing it . 
And they want to do it on a country-by-country basis , rather than on the basis of the eurozone as a whole . 
There is a good reason for this : Germany does not want to pay for recapitalizing French banks . 
But , while Chancellor Angela Merkel is justified in insisting on this , it is driving her in the wrong direction . 
Let me stake out more precisely the narrow path that would allow Europe to pass through this minefield . 
The banking system needs to be guaranteed first , and recapitalized later . 
Governments cannot afford to recapitalize the banks now ; it would leave them with insufficient funds to deal with the sovereign-debt problem . 
It will cost much less to recapitalize the banks after the crisis has abated and both government bonds and bank shares have returned to more normal levels . 
Governments can , however , provide a credible guarantee , given their power to tax . 
A new , legally binding agreement - not a change to the Lisbon Treaty ( which would encounter too many hurdles ) , but a new agreement - will be needed for the eurozone to mobilize that power , and such an accord will take time to negotiate and ratify . 
But , in the meantime , governments can call upon the European Central Bank , which the eurozone member states already fully guarantee on a pro rata basis . 
In exchange for a guarantee , the eurozone &apos;s major banks would have to agree to abide by the ECB &apos;s instructions . 
This is a radical step , but a necessary one under the circumstances . 
Acting at the behest of the member states , the ECB has sufficient powers of persuasion : it could close its discount window to the banks , and the governments could seize institutions that refuse to cooperate . 
The ECB would then instruct the banks to maintain their credit lines and loan portfolios while strictly monitoring the risks they take for their own account . 
This would remove one of the two main driving forces of the current market turmoil . 
The ECB could deal with the other driving force , the lack of financing for sovereign debt , by lowering its discount rate , encouraging distressed governments to issue treasury bills , and encouraging the banks to subscribe ( an idea I owe to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa ) . 
The T-bills could be sold to the ECB at any time , making them tantamount to cash ; but , as long as they yield more than deposits with the ECB , the banks would find it advantageous to hold them . 
Governments could meet their financing needs within agreed limits at very low cost during this emergency period , and the ECB would not violate Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty . 
These measures would be sufficient to calm markets and bring the acute phase of the crisis to an end . 
Recapitalization of the banks should wait until then ; only the holes created by restructuring the Greek debt would have to be filled immediately . 
In conformity with Germany &apos;s demand , the additional capital would come first from the market and then from individual governments - and from the European Financial Stability Facility only as a last resort , thereby preserving the EFSF &apos;s firepower . 
A new agreement for the eurozone , negotiated in a calmer atmosphere , should not only codify the practices established during the emergency , but also lay the groundwork for an economic-growth strategy . 
During the emergency period , fiscal retrenchment and austerity are unavoidable ; but , in the longer term , the debt burden will become unsustainable without growth - and so will the European Union itself .
