Brazil &apos;s Growth Conundrum 
SANTIAGO - Brazil needs to grow more . 
With the economy nearly stagnant in 2011 and the first half of 2012 , faster growth is a political necessity for her . 
That outlook sets Brazil apart in a region where politicians - from Argentina and Chile to Ecuador and Venezuela - often seem more concerned with handing out slices of natural-resource wealth than with creating new sources of prosperity . 
To be sure , Brazil &apos;s economic growth over the last decade owed much to the commodity boom that has also benefitted its South American neighbors . 
In 2010 , growth reached an impressive 7.5 % clip , as highly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies , implemented in response to the global financial crisis , lifted the economy out of harm &apos;s way . 
Today , similar policies are again doing the trick , with GDP growth picking up in the second half of 2012 and expected to reach more than 4 % in 2013 . 
But can Brazil move beyond these stop-and-go cycles and ensure steady growth ? 
One obvious constraint is a lack of investment in physical capital , as anyone who has used Brazil &apos;s maddening airports and roads can attest . 
Brazil wants to compete with Asian giants like China and India , but its investment rate , at just 19 % of GDP , is decidedly un-Asian . 
And , even at such a low level of investment , Brazil &apos;s current-account deficit is more than 2 % of GDP , exposing an alarming paucity of domestic savings . 
With Brazil &apos;s new middle class focused on the consumption patterns commensurate with its status , the additional savings must come from the public sector - a task that previous governments found politically unmanageable . 
Now , however , the country &apos;s improved macroeconomic picture is creating greater room for maneuver . 
Brazil &apos;s central bank has brought interest rates to record lows , and has vowed to keep them there for a long time . 
For an indebted government , that is just what the doctored ordered . 
Ilan Goldfajn , the chief economist at Ita√∫ Unibanco , estimates that a sustained drop of one percentage point in the short-term interest rate saves the government the equivalent of 0.5 % of GDP . 
The political challenge for Rousseff &apos;s administration is to channel those savings to new public investment or to tax incentives for private investment , rather than adding to current expenditures . 
That is why she adopted a hard line in a recent protracted wage dispute with public-sector workers - in which she ultimately prevailed , despite opposition within her own party . 
But even if new financing for investment can be found , it remains unclear which samba troupes can lead Brazil &apos;s economic carnival in the future . 
Brazil has spawned some world-class companies - for example , aircraft manufacturer Embraer - but most industrial sectors remain focused on the internal market and are not internationally competitive . 
High production costs , particularly in energy , are one key obstacle . 
The government has recently used its regulatory power to push down rates for both households and firms . 
But , in the long term , Brazil will have to invest more in generation - and those investments , as every government in Latin America knows , are increasingly controversial for political and environmental reasons . 
The exchange rate is another essential issue . 
Brazil has quietly dropped its decade-long commitment to floating its currency , and has moved to a de facto semi-fixed regime , with the exchange rate allowed to move only within a narrow band slightly above two reals to the US dollar . 
Brazilian authorities have tried to fix the exchange rate before , but these attempts tended to be short-lived , because the financial costs of sterilizing the central bank &apos;s currency-market interventions are too high . 
Intervention costs have been limited so far , owing to uncertainty in Europe , capital controls , and lower interest rates at home . 
But another wave of global liquidity , prompted perhaps by a third round of quantitative easing in the United States , could upset this delicate equilibrium . 
The Rousseff administration is also creating incentives ( subsidies , directed credit , and even some new import tariffs ) aimed at developing certain sectors . 
Enthusiasts describe it as a new brand of modern industrial policy that can help to push Brazil beyond its traditional role as a commodity exporter . 
Critics call it a misguided effort that will only create more distortions and retard growth . 
In my view , the intellectual case for activist policies - as made , for example , by Dani Rodrik and Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard - is strong . 
Markets for innovation and new ideas work poorly and governments can help to address those market failures . 
But Rodrik and Hausmann also show that getting such policies right implies exacting requirements . 
Countries must create institutions to ensure that support is given - and withdrawn - only with expected productivity in mind , not as a way to reward friends or political allies . 
If Brazil can get it right , it would rival a victory in the 2014 World Cup for the country &apos;s football team as a badge of national pride .
