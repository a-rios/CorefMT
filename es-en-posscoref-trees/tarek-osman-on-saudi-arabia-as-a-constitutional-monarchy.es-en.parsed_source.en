The Saudi Spring ? 
LONDON - In the early 1970 &quot; s , Saudi Arabia &apos;s King Faisal reportedly confided to senior members of the royal family his fear that , just as in a single generation the country had moved from &quot; riding camels to riding Cadillacs .... the next generation could be riding camels again . &quot; 
His warning seems more apt than ever . 
Saudi Arabia , long one of the Arab world &apos;s most rigid societies , now finds itself in a state of flux . 
Its relations with the West - and with the United States in particular - have frayed in the turmoil unleashed in the Middle East and North Africa by the Arab Spring . 
Meanwhile , a group of women provided the latest sign of domestic restiveness by defying the Kingdom &apos;s prohibition against women drivers . 
While Saudi Arabia remains the largest Arab economy , the world &apos;s leading producer and exporter of oil , and the guardian of Sunni Islam , its political influence has diminished significantly in recent years . 
From the early 1980 &quot; s to the mid-2000 &quot; s , Saudi Arabia was the coordinator of pan-Arab politics , with the palaces of Riyadh and Jeddah drawing political leaders from throughout the Arab world . 
But the reception rooms have since been noticeably empty . 
Qatar - with its seemingly inexhaustible wealth and a comprehensive foreign , investment , and media strategy - has replaced Saudi Arabia as the decisive arbiter in almost every Middle Eastern conflict . 
The deterioration of Saudi Arabia &apos;s political influence has contributed to a growing sense of national decline . 
King Abdullah &apos;s reform efforts - especially those aimed at curbing the power of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi-Salafi religious establishment - have lost steam , and the deaths of two crown princes have complicated the inter-generational transfer of power . 
While Saudi leaders have managed to buy middle-class support by allocating a significant proportion of oil revenues to targeted welfare and credit-support programs , widespread poverty and massive income inequality persist . 
Shia Muslims in the oil-rich Eastern Province have repeatedly defied the ban on anti-regime demonstrations . 
And Saudi Arabia &apos;s campaign against the Shia Houthis in Yemen has proved longer and costlier than expected . 
Against this background , Saudi leaders remain conspicuously wary of popular empowerment and disruption of the Arab order that they have dominated for the last three decades . 
For Saudi Wahhabism , in which absolute power is granted to the royal family by religious mandate , innovative forms of political Islam that anchor legitimacy in genuine representation are a strategic threat . 
Over the last year , the Saudi family has been focusing on many of these challenges . 
King Abdullah has made significant personnel changes within the defense , interior , foreign , and intelligence ministries , granting broad powers to two experienced princes - Bandar bin Sultan , who was Ambassador to the US for more than two decades , and Miteb bin Abdullah , the king &apos;s son and long-time commander of the National Guard . 
The government has also sought to attract foreign investment and promote economic diversification . 
And some factions of the Saudi family are reaching out - albeit cautiously - to civil-society actors , attempting to engage them in a dialogue about the country &apos;s future . 
Moreover , in order to combat Iran &apos;s influence in the eastern Mediterranean , Saudi Arabia has increased support for its allies in Iraq , Jordan , and Lebanon , and has effectively taken responsibility for financing , arming , and directing the Syrian opposition and rebel forces . 
It has helped to curb the rise of political Islam across North Africa , including by backing the overthrow of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi . 
And , through a combination of positive and negative incentives , it has checked the threat posed by the Houthis in Yemen . 
But none of these policies addresses the fundamental challenge facing the Kingdom - namely , the gradual erosion of its wealth ( indeed , Saudi Arabia is expected to become a net energy importer by 2030 ) . 
Given many economic sectors &quot; lack of competitiveness and the inadequacy of the educational system , the Saudi population - 70 % of which is under 35 years old - will experience skyrocketing unemployment in the coming years . 
Many Saudis sense a wasted opportunity ; despite sitting atop one of history &apos;s most liquid fortunes , the country has failed to become an advanced economy . 
And Saudi Arabia &apos;s large middle class is likely to respond to diminishing prosperity by calling for a more representative political system . 
The problem is that the obvious challenges facing Saudi Arabia require a level of cohesion in the upper echelons of government that remains elusive . 
As the journalist Christian Caryl put it , &quot; to say that historical or economic conditions predispose a country to embark on a particular path does not mean that its politicians will necessarily decide to take it . &quot; 
The continued absence of resolute action could easily drive Saudi Arabia toward irreversible decay . 
In such a scenario , the economy would gradually weaken , hampering the royal family &apos;s ability to continue buying middle-class support , while enabling rebel groups in the east and the south to erode the government &apos;s authority . 
This could cause Wahhabi religious and political doctrine to lose ground among young people and fuel regime infighting . 
Ultimately , Abdulaziz bin Saud &apos;s unification of the Kingdom in the late 1920 &quot; s could even be reversed , making the last eight decades an anomaly in the Arabian Peninsula &apos;s long history of fragmentation . 
Such an outcome would effectively make Yemen and the rest of the Gulf states ungovernable , allowing the Sunni-Shia confrontation that is currently unfolding in the Levant to overwhelm the region . 
But there is another possibility . 
The new generation of Saudi leaders could spearhead a transition to a genuine constitutional monarchy , based on a transparent system of checks and balances . 
A more representative governance model , together with strong economic incentives , could unleash the young population &apos;s creativity and dynamism - and secure Saudi Arabia &apos;s future in the process . 
That promise was captured in the recent film &quot; Wadjda &quot; - written , produced , and directed by Saudi women - which tells the story of a young girl from a middle-class family who challenges social conventions and pushes boundaries , as she attempts to fulfill her potential . 
If she is not Saudi Arabia &apos;s future , the country may not have a future at all .
