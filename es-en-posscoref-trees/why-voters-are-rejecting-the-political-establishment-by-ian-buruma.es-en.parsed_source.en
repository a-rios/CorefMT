Send in the Clowns 
NEW YORK - When too many Italians voted late last month for either a louche and discredited business tycoon or a comedian , European stock markets plummeted . 
With no public trust in the political class , Italy might become ungovernable . 
But Italians are not alone . 
Rage against the political establishment has become a global phenomenon . 
Chinese bloggers , American Tea Party activists , British Europhobes , Egyptian Islamists , Dutch populists , Greek ultra-rightists , and Thai &quot; red shirts &quot; all have one thing in common : hatred of the status quo and contempt for their countries &quot; elites . 
We are living in an age of populism . 
The authority of conventional politicians and traditional media is slipping away fast . 
Populism can be a necessary corrective when political parties grow sclerotic , mass media become too complacent ( or too close to power ) , and bureaucracies are unresponsive to popular needs . 
In a globalized world managed by bankers and technocrats , many people feel that they have no say in public affairs ; they feel abandoned . 
Our national politicians , increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises , are suspected , often with good reason , of simply looking after their own interests . 
All we can do is vote the rascals out , sometimes by voting for candidates whom we would not take seriously in more normal times . 
Italian elites are not the only ones in need of being shaken up . 
In the 1930 &quot; s , it resulted in violent movements led by dangerous men in uniform . 
Today &apos;s populists are different . 
They do not , on the whole , advocate violence . 
Some preach that Muslims are destroying Western civilization . 
Others think that President Barack Obama is a kind of communist out to destroy America . 
Two types of contemporary populist , however , stand out : the ultra-rich business tycoon and the clown . 
In the Anglo-Saxon media world , Rupert Murdoch , owner of far too many newspapers , TV stations , and movie studios , is a typical populist tycoon . 
But he never aspired to lead a country . 
Neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader . 
The question is which is worse . 
Clowns have always played a role in politics . 
Medieval court jesters were often the only ones who could speak truth to despotic kings . 
Today , it is often comedians who claim to speak truth to power - and to the public . 
In America , liberals turn for political commentary to television comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert , who are now more trusted than traditional news broadcasters . 
And clownish right-wing radio talk-show hosts now have more influence on many conservative American voters than the sober journalists of the mainstream media do . 
A few years ago , a clown named Brozo , with a large red nose and a bright green wig , was Mexico &apos;s most popular political commentator on television , actively courted by all candidates running for national office . 
In 1980 , the French clown Coluche actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16 % , causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much . 
The prototype of modern European populism was the flamboyant Dutch political showman Pim Fortuyn , who was assassinated in 2002 by a fanatical vegan . 
Fortuyn &apos;s outrageousness was deliberately provocative and always entertaining . 
His rants against the elites were often confused , but he was funny , which made the old elite politicians look like stuffy old bores - which many of them were . 
And now Italy has Beppe Grillo , whose success in the country &apos;s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in Europe . 
The thing about clowns , though , is that few have any aspirations to rule their countries . 
Before his death , Fortuyn is said to have been terrified of the prospect of becoming Prime Minister . 
And Grillo cannot even aspire to the job in Italy because of his criminal record . 
Clowns mostly seek to provoke , and this can be healthy . 
They are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views . 
And , sometimes , they actually say things that are uncomfortable but true , and that need to be said . 
Political business tycoons , on the other hand , have different ambitions . 
Promising to spread the riches that they have made for themselves , they exploit the fantasies of those of us who have little and want more . 
Berlusconi understood the dreams of many Italians very well . 
His extravagance , clownishness , and even his girls were part of his popular appeal . 
In Thailand , the self-made ethnic-Chinese media billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra was especially admired by the rural poor . 
Like a beneficent king , he would give them money , and promised to challenge the old elites in Bangkok - the bankers , generals , judges , and even the courtiers surrounding the Thai king . 
But tycoons are not natural democrats . 
Their main interest is in their own business . 
Even though his sister , Yingluck Shinawatra , is now in power , Thaksin is still trying to evade trial in Thai courts on a wide array of financial charges . 
As it happens , Thaksin was overthrown in 2006 by a military coup that was largely backed by the Bangkok elites . 
Berlusconi was replaced by a government run by elite technocrats , whose policies had to be approved by European bankers and European Union bureaucrats . 
Neither of these responses to populism is likely to boost democracy . 
On the contrary , they make things worse . 
What is needed is mainstream politicians who understand and respond to what is fueling popular rage . 
Paying attention to some of what the clowns are saying might be a good first step .
