Europe \ u0027s War of Big and Small 
The debate on proposals for a new Constitution for the European Union , now entering its final stage in the so-called &quot; European Convention , &quot; is turning into a power struggle between member states over rival visions of the future of the Union . 
In the past , the main axis of debate was usually been between federalists , who want a stronger EU , and inter-governmentalists , who want to preserve the member states &apos; national autonomy . 
This remains true today . 
But the debate is now being distorted by a secondary struggle between the EU &apos;s large and small countries , with results that are sometimes paradoxical . 
The immediate issue is management of the EU Council of Ministers . 
At present , the Council meets under the Presidency of an individual member state for a period of six months , at the end of which the Presidency rotates to another member state . 
France and Germany argue that this rotational system is dysfunctional , partly because of discontinuity , and have proposed that the Council should appoint a full-time permanent President for a period of five years . 
Their proposal was categorically rejected in a joint submission by 16 existing or future member states , all of them small countries , who insisted that the principle of rotation must be retained , as a symbol of the equality of all member states . 
The stakes on this issue have now been raised two notches higher . 
Val√©ry Giscard d &apos;Estaing , the President of the Convention , has formally endorsed the Franco-German proposal . 
The same day , the European Commission hit back with a strong criticism of the proposal , saying that it would create rival bureaucracies and a sense of confusion . 
The deep reason for this particular argument is the EU &apos;s looming enlargement , which will take the membership from 15 to 25 countries in May 2004 . 
When the European enterprise started , there were three small and three large countries ; but almost all the new members are small countries . 
So after enlargement there will be six large and 19 small member states . 
This re-balancing between the large and small member states is shifting some old assumptions in a number of paradoxical ways . 
In the past , small member states used to gravitate towards federalist positions , because they calculated that they needed strong central institutions to contain the power of the large member states ( especially France ) . 
Today , by insisting on Presidential rotation and the equality of member states , whatever their size , the small countries are effectively adopting an inter-governmentalist position , because they fear that the real purpose of the Franco-German proposal is to ensure that the Council will remain under the leadership of a big member . 
There is , in fact , little doubt that is what France and Germany ( and Britain ) intend . 
So here is the second paradox : both large and small EU countries imagine that they can optimize their relative leverage by adopting inter-governmentalist positions . 
They cannot both be right . 
It is far too soon to draw hard and fast conclusions . 
The &quot; Convention , &quot; though influential , is just a debating group ; the real negotiations between governments will come later this year . 
We can have no idea in advance how a 25-member EU will really operate ; practical realities will exert their influence on political chemistry . 
It is conceivable that the swarm of small new member states may revert to the traditional and logical predisposition towards federalism . 
But my personal hunch is that the Franco-German proposal is based on a fundamental error of judgment . 
To understand why , consider that their proposal for a permanent Council President was paired with a proposal that the Commission President - currently nominated by the Council of Ministers - should in future be elected by the European Parliament , and subsequently be endorsed by a majority vote of the Council of Ministers . 
If adopted , this innovation would confer much greater political legitimacy on the Commission President , as well as greater independence from the Council of Ministers ( i.e. , the member states ) . 
It is possible that the French thought that a permanent Council President would be an appropriately inter-governmental counter-weight to a super-legitimate integrationist Commission President . 
There are just two problems : first , an appointed President of the Council would have no particular legitimacy , he would be just another appointed official . 
Second , his ostensible task - representing the EU abroad - must depend on a degree of agreement between the member states on foreign policy that is now completely absent . 
On the contrary , even if a number of large member states talk up about a common foreign policy , they prove by their actions that they are determined to maintain their own national foreign policies . 
In the run-up to the Iraq war , many member states refused even to consult their colleagues . 
So even if the French and Germans get their way , the Council will have a President representing nobody but himself . 
Of course , the future is unpredictable . 
Even the British may learn to understand Europe , though no one should count on it . 
But we should not overlook the fact that the Convention has slipped in quite a number of proposals which are inherently federalist . 
These include the generalization of majority voting , enlargement of the European Parliament &apos;s role , the notion of public proceedings for the Council of Ministers ( making it almost like a senate ) , the introduction of the possibility of withdrawal from the Union , and even the possibility of treaty ratification by majority . 
These ideas may go nowhere , at least not right away . 
But they reflect the fundamental reality that at every turning point , the EU has moved forward through more integration . 
On his return from the signature of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 , Robin Cook , the British Foreign Secretary at the time , announced that &quot; The federalists have been defeated . &quot; 
Don &apos;t bet on it .
