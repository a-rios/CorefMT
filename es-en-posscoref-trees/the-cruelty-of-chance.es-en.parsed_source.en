The Cruelty of Chance 
MOSCOW - In Russia , somewhere behind every event lurks the question : Who is to blame ? 
In the tragedy that claimed the lives of Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 other Polish leaders , we can answer that question with certainty in at least one respect : history is to blame . 
The event is so hideous that it seems like a bad joke , or an evil KGB plot , a mad conspiracy out of James Bond - or some combination of all three . 
Yet the crash that has sent all of Poland into mourning was none of these things . 
A tragedy that defies any logical explanation confirms only one thing : the cruelty of chance . 
What if no fog prevented the safe landing at Smolensk airport ? 
What if the plane was not a 20-year-old , Russian-made Tupolev-154 , but a newer and safer model ? 
What if the Polish pilot had obeyed the Russian air traffic controller who tried to divert the plane to Moscow or Minsk ? 
Unfortunately , the cruelty of chance also lies at the heart of the centuries of mistrust between Poland and Russia . 
The irony ( if there is an irony at all ) is that this tragedy came at a time when mistrust seemed , at long last , to be giving way to better , more businesslike relations and greater understanding between the two countries . 
After 70 years of denial , Russia &apos;s leadership ( if not yet ordinary Russians ) were ready to admit that Joseph Stalin &apos;s NKVD ( precursor to the KGB ) slaughtered more than 20,000 Polish officers , intellectuals , and clergy in the nearby Katyn forest in 1940 . 
Indeed , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , a former KGB officer himself , invited his Polish counterpart , Donald Tusk , to commemorate that tragedy together . 
But Kaczynski , a member of Solidarity in the 1980 &quot; s who was eager to overthrow the communist regime , was more mistrustful of the Russians than Tusk . 
He put together his own delegation to visit Katyn , and wondered aloud if the Russians would give him a visa . 
Certainly , no Russians were invited . 
When the pilot of the presidential plane ( ironically , again , Soviet made ) was advised not to land in the thick fog , either he , or perhaps even the president himself , may have mistrusted the Russians &quot; willingness to give honest advice . 
Indeed , they may well have wondered if the cunning ex-KGB men around Putin simply wanted to make Kaczynski &apos;s Katyn commemoration a mockery ? 
Russian-Polish suspicions and disagreements date back to the sixteenth century , when Poland was the far greater power ; indeed , the Grand Duchy of Moscow was a backwater . 
Across the centuries , there have been wars , started by both sides , and partitions of Poland executed by the Russians , followed by attempts at &quot; Russification , &quot; with the Russian Christian Orthodox Empire trying to control the &quot; silver-tongued , &quot; &quot; deceptive , &quot; West European-oriented Catholic Poland . 
Then there was the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution , which the Poles refused to join , and Marshal Jozef Pilsudski &apos;s miraculous victory over the Red Army at the gates of Warsaw in 1920 . 
Throughout the interwar years , Poland and the nascent Soviet regime were at daggers drawn almost without interruption . 
When Stalin signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with Nazi Germany in 1939 , it gave him an opportunity to invade Poland . 
The Katyn massacre was a direct result , with Stalin ordering the mass murder of Poland &apos;s elite in order to decapitate Polish society and thus make it more pliable . 
Katyn was also the occasion for the Soviets to break off relations with Poland &apos;s wartime government-in-exile in London . 
Because the Polish leaders refused to exonerate the Russians , Stalin accused the Poles of collaborating with the Germans in trying to shift the blame for Nazi crimes onto Russians . 
Soon after , the idea of establishing a puppet regime in Warsaw took root . 
Although the Nazi-Soviet Pact did not last long - Germany invaded Russia in 1941 - for Poland there was no way out . 
With Hitler &apos;s defeat , it once again became part of the Russian sphere , this time of Soviet Russia . 
But Poland never stopped striding - and striking - for independence . 
The rise of Solidarity in the 1980 &quot; s was the earliest and most severe blow to the stagnating Soviet system . 
The Polish-born Pope John Paul II crystallized the anti-communist &quot; threat &quot; that Poland now posed to the Soviet Union . 
The Pope &apos;s call for religious freedom around the world , including in the socialist countries , rubbed the atheistic Soviets - and Orthodox Russians - the wrong way . 
Indeed , throughout the twentieth century , animosity between Poland and Russia remained at fever pitch , manifested not only in politics but also culturally . 
This , of course , continued an old pattern , too . 
Alexander Pushkin , Nicolai Gogol , and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were all suspicious of the Poles , calling them &quot; cold , &quot; &quot; distant , &quot; and &quot; manipulative , &quot; and seeing Poland as always on the side of the West , rather than standing with its Slavic brothers . Indeed , Pushkin &apos;s friendship with Adam Mickiewicz ended in acrimony over the 1830 Polish insurrection against Tsarist rule . 
In fact , the animosity ran so deep that when both countries were no longer communist , and Russia was looking to replace its November 7 Bolshevik Revolution holiday , it came up with November 4 , the anniversary of the Russian boyars &quot; victory in 1612 over Polish King Sigismund &apos;s short-lived occupation of Moscow . 
Now there is talk , in both Warsaw and Moscow , that the second tragedy of Katyn might usher in a new era in bilateral relations . 
Perhaps so , but as the Polish essayist Stanislaw Jerzy Lec said : &quot; You can close your eyes to reality , but not to memories . &quot;
