America Goes from Teacher to Student 
Cambridge  -  
Americans don &apos;t seem to realize that their &quot; sub-prime &quot; mortgage meltdown has all too much in common with many previous post-1945 banking crises throughout the world . 
The silver lining is that there are many highly distinguished current and former policymakers out there , particularly from emerging market countries , who have seen this movie before . 
If US policymakers would only listen , they might get an idea or two about how to deal with financial crises from experts who have lived through them and come out safely on the other side . 
Unfortunately , the parallel between today &apos;s US crisis and previous financial crises is not mere hyperbole . 
The qualitative parallels are obvious : banks using off-balance loans to finance highly risky ventures , exotic new financial instruments , and excessive exuberance over the promise of new markets . 
But there are strong quantitative parallels as well . 
Professor Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland and I systematically compared the run-up to the US sub-prime crisis with the run-up to the 19 worst financial crises in the industrialized world over the past 60 years . 
These include epic crises in the Scandinavian countries , Spain , and Japan , along with lesser events such as the US savings and loan crises of the 1980 &quot; s . 
Across virtually all the major indicators - including equity and housing price runs-ups , trade balance deficits , surges in government and household indebtedness , and pre-crisis growth trajectories - red lights are blinking for the US . 
Simply put , surging capital flows into the US artificially held down interest rates and inflated asset prices , leading to laxity in banking and regulatory standards and , ultimately , to a meltdown . 
When Asia and Latin America had their financial meltdowns in the 1990 &quot; s and early 2000 &quot; s , they took advice not only from the IMF , but also from a number of small panels composed of eminent people representing diverse backgrounds and experiences . 
The US should do the same . 
The head of the IMF , Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn , could easily select a superb panel from any range of former crisis countries , including Mexico , Brazil , Korea , Turkey , Japan , and Sweden , not to mention Argentina , Russia , Chile , and many others . 
Admittedly , the IMF &apos;s panel would have to look past America &apos;s current hypocrisy . 
The US Treasury strongly encouraged Asia to tighten fiscal policy during its 1990 &quot; s crisis . 
But today the US Congress and President are tripping over themselves to adopt an ill-advised giant fiscal stimulus package , whose main effects will be to tie the hands of the next president in simplifying the US tax code and closing the budget deficit . 
Americans firmly told Japan that the only way to clean up its economy was to purge insolvent banks and regenerate the financial system through Schumpeterian &quot; creative destruction . &quot; 
Today , US authorities appear willing to contemplate any measure , no matter how inflationary , to insure that none of its major banks and investment houses fails . 
For years , foreign governments complained about American hedge funds , arguing that their non-transparent behavior posed unacceptable risks to stability . 
Now , many US politicians are complaining about the transparency of sovereign wealth funds ( big government investors mainly from Asia and the Middle East ) , which are taking shares in trophy American assets such as Citibank and Merrill Lynch . 
In fact , having countries like Russia and China more vested in the well-being of the US economy would not be a bad thing . 
Yes , the IMF ought to develop a voluntary code of conduct for SWF &apos;s , but it should not be used as a weapon to enforce financial protectionism . 
For years , I , along with many others , have complained that emerging markets need greater representation in global financial governance . 
Today , the issue goes far beyond symbolism . 
The US economy is in trouble , and the problems it spins off are unlikely to stop at the US border . 
Experts from emerging markets and elsewhere have much to say about dealing with financial crises . 
America should start to listen before it is too late .
