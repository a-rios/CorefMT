The Resource Curse Revisited 
There is a curious phenomenon that economists call the resource curse - so named because , on average , countries with large endowments of natural resources perform worse than countries that are less well endowed . 
Yet some countries with abundant natural resources do perform better than others , and some have done well . 
Why is the spell of the resource curse cast so unequally ? 
Thirty years ago , Indonesia and Nigeria - both dependent on oil - had comparable per capita incomes . 
Today , Indonesia &apos;s per capita income is four times that of Nigeria . 
Indeed , Nigeria &apos;s per capita income ( as measured in constant dollars circa 1995 ) has fallen . 
A similar pattern holds true in Sierra Leone and Botswana . 
Both are rich in diamonds . 
Yet Botswana averaged 8.7 % annual economic growth over the past thirty years , while Sierra Leone plunged into civil strife . 
The failures in the oil-rich Middle East are legion . 
Economists put forward three reasons for the dismal performance of some richly endowed countries : 
• First , the prospect of riches orients official efforts to seizing a larger share of the pie , rather than creating a larger pie . 
The result of this wealth grab is often war . 
At other times simple rent-seeking behavior by officials , aided and abetted by outsiders , is the outcome . 
It is cheaper to bribe a government to provide resources at below-market prices than to invest and develop an industry , so it is no surprise that some firms succumb to this temptation . 
• Second , natural resource prices are volatile , and managing this volatility is hard . 
Lenders provide money when times are good , but want their money back when , say , energy prices plummet . 
( As the old adage has it , banks only like to lend to those who do not need money . ) 
Economic activity is thus even more volatile than commodity prices , and much of the gains made in a boom unravels in the bust that follows . 
• Third , oil and other natural resources , while perhaps a source of wealth , do not create jobs by themselves , and unfortunately , they often crowd out other economic sectors . 
For example , an inflow of oil money often leads to currency appreciation - a phenomenon called the Dutch Disease . 
The Netherlands , after its discovery of North Sea gas and oil , found itself plagued with growing unemployment and workforce disability ( many of those who could not get jobs found disability benefits to be more generous than unemployment benefits . ) 
When the exchange rate soars as a result of resource booms , countries cannot export manufactured or agriculture goods , and domestic producers cannot compete with an onslaught of imports . 
So abundant natural wealth often creates rich countries with poor people . 
Two thirds of the people in Venezuela , the Latin American country with the largest oil deposits , live in poverty . 
No wonder that they are demanding that the small group of those who benefit from the country &apos;s wealth start to share it . 
Fortunately , as we have become aware of these problems , we have learned much about what can be done about them . 
Democratic , consensual , and transparent processes - such as those in Botswana - are more likely to ensure that the fruits of a country &apos;s wealth are equitably and well spent . 
We also know that stabilization funds - which set aside some of the money earned when prices are high - can help reduce the economic volatility associated with natural resource prices . 
Moreover , such fluctuations are amplified by borrowing in good years , so countries should resist foreign lenders who try to persuade them of the virtues of such capital flows . 
The Dutch disease , however , is one of the more intractable consequences of oil and resource wealth , at least for poor countries . 
In principle , it is easy to avoid currency appreciation : keep the foreign exchange earned from , say , oil exports out of the country . 
Bring it in only gradually . 
Some countries , notably Nigeria , are trying to implement these lessons . 
Nigeria has proposed creating stabilization funds , and , in the future , it will sell its natural resources in transparent , competitive bidding processes . 
Most importantly , the Nigerians are taking measures to ensure that the fruits of this endowment are invested , so that as the country &apos;s natural resources are depleted , its real wealth - fixed and human capital - is increased . 
Western governments can help with common-sense reforms . 
Secret bank accounts not only support terrorism , but also facilitate the corruption that undermines development . 
Similarly , transparency would be encouraged if only payments that are fully documented were tax deductible . 
Violent conflict is fed and its effects worsened by massive sales of arms by Western governments to developing countries . 
This should be stopped . 
Abundant natural resources can and should be a blessing , not a curse . 
We know what must be done . 
What is missing is the political will to make it so .
