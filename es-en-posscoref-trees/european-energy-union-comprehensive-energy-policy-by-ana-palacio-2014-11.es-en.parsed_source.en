Europe &apos;s Energy Essentials 
MADRID - At last month &apos;s European Council meeting in Brussels , energy issues dominated the agenda - for the third time this year . 
Energy &apos;s emergence as a focal point for European leaders makes sense , given that it lies at the confluence of the three existential threats facing the European Union : a revisionist Russia , the declining competitiveness of European businesses , and climate change . 
As these developments challenge Europe &apos;s values , its social model &apos;s viability , and the world &apos;s long-term security , EU leaders must focus on building a new energy system that ensures a reliable supply , sensible pricing , and ecological sustainability . 
The good news is that a framework is already emerging that could facilitate this initiative . 
Indeed , beyond widely discussed targets for energy production for 2030 - covering greenhouse-gas emissions , energy efficiency , and renewable resources - the European Council &apos;s conclusions embrace key elements of a practical and effective approach to energy . 
But , in order to move from aspiration to implementation , Europeans must muster the unity of purpose that so far has been conspicuously absent in EU energy policy . 
The most tangible element of the EU &apos;s emerging energy-policy framework is the internal energy market , which , once completed , will allow for the unimpeded flow of energy and related investments throughout the EU . 
Such an integrated energy market would lead to significant savings - estimates go as high as € 40 billion ( $ 51 billion ) annually by 2030 - thereby providing a much-needed competitiveness boost . 
The internal energy market would enhance Europe &apos;s energy security as well . 
Though the EU as a whole maintains a balanced energy mix , with supply divided relatively evenly among gas , coal , oil , renewables , and nuclear generation , individual countries are often excessively dependent on a single source and , more dangerously , a single supplier : Russia . 
Unrestricted energy flows within the EU would mitigate the risks of supply disruptions or shocks . 
Of course , establishing an internal energy market is not just a matter of policy . 
The EU needs the right infrastructure to facilitate the movement of energy among states and regions . 
On this front , there is much to be done . 
Spain , for example , can currently transmit only 1.5 % of its electricity-generating capacity to the rest of Europe , owing to a lack of transmission infrastructure in the Pyrenees and France &apos;s reluctance to open its energy market to competition from the Iberian Peninsula . 
The European Council , recognizing the urgency of this issue , has called for greater electricity interconnection , targeting 10 % of generating capacity by 2020 and 15 % by 2030 , with countries exporting 15 megawatts of power for every 100 megawatts they produce . 
Achieving these benchmarks will require both significant capital investment and a shift in EU member states &quot; mentalities , so that fears like France &apos;s do not continue to impede progress . 
Countries need to know that their companies will not suffer either from outflows of electricity to other EU countries during shortages , or from price increases , owing to the rising emphasis on renewables . 
The emerging European &quot; energy union , &quot; which the Council has endorsed , could be the ideal vehicle to facilitate this shift . 
The problem is that EU leaders have yet to define a compelling and effective strategy for building it . 
Indeed , though European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has established a vice-presidential post responsible for energy union - now held by Maroš Šefčovič - no one seems to know what exactly the position will entail . 
So far , Šefčovič has merely presented five vague pillars for the energy union , leading many to consider the current policy approach to an energy union hollow . 
The EU needs a well-defined energy strategy that helps to overcome the trust deficit that is hampering effective solutions . 
This means , first and foremost , establishing clear and predictable community rules and cost-sensitive policies for the energy union . 
Doing so would help the EU to achieve another critical goal : presenting a more united front to the rest of the world . 
The Council &apos;s recent conclusions recognize this imperative , and the new Commission structure is conducive to policy coherence . 
Member states must now fall into line . 
A major test will be next year &apos;s United Nations climate change conference ( COP21 ) in Paris . 
The 2009 conference in Copenhagen was an unmitigated disaster , as Europe &apos;s &quot; lead by example &quot; approach failed to attract followers . 
The EU cannot afford to isolate itself , or misunderstand the geopolitical forces at play , yet again . 
Fortunately , the Council seems to have internalized this lesson , leaving open the possibility of reconsidering its commitments after COP21 . 
But it has a lot to do before then , not only to establish a unified approach , but also to translate that approach into strong tactics and a clear message at COP21 . 
Success would provide a strong foundation for the broader EU energy agenda . 
If the EU is to address the key challenges of energy security , competitive pricing , and sustainability , it will need a unified , comprehensive , and compelling policy approach . 
The foundations of such an approach - an internal energy market , the framework of an energy union , and a cohesive external voice - are emerging . 
Now Europe needs to follow through and make it work .
