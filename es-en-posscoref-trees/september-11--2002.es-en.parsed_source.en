September 11 , 2002 
In the year since the terrorist attacks of last September 11th , many of us have repeatedly looked in the mirror to ask : What has changed ? 
Shock and sadness remain with us , but there is also a determined sense that we face challenges - as individuals and as a civilization - that were unknown a year ago . 
Even more unsettling , we recognize that America or another country may well be attacked by surprise once again , and are left wondering if such an event will match or exceed the horror of last year . 
We have all been hurt and are convinced that there are people who , having honed their malignant audacity to a sharp point , are now planning to hurt us again . 
In memory , then , the Twin Towers still stand tall , still cast a shadow into our lives . 
What happened to them was unimaginable until , through deliberate action , it became real . 
Against all expectation , and contrary to our wishes , this violence has put us in front of choices we had not seen before . 
In many ways , this is the story of the 20th century . 
Violence and brutality that were once beyond the realm of possibility now seem commonplace . 
Adapting to the latest horror , we conclude - repeatedly , and despite all evidence to the contrary - that we have at last seen all that there is to see . 
But then we are shocked into recognizing that our imagination failed us - there was worse to come . 
The philosopher Berel Lang brilliantly analyzed how cataclysmic violence reshapes our conception of the world . 
In &quot; The Future of the Holocaust , &quot; he wrote that those generations born before the genocide of European Jewry &quot; at least began life in a different world , one from which genocide was absent , in which that occurrence was quite inconceivable . &quot; 
For those born afterward &quot; that absence was dismissed before they were born . 
They do not remember the world without it . &quot; 
There is no comparison to be made between the Holocaust and the events of September 11th , yet Lang &apos;s insight underscores a larger point about the transforming power of new forms of mass violence . 
Thinking about ourselves , and the world we now live in , his phrase is worth repeating : &quot; They do not remember the world without it . &quot; 
September 11 , 2001 emerges then as the starting point of something new : a world in which the events of September 11th have become real . 
From that bright September morning onward , those events have been and will be a reference point for anyone who would use them . 
A year ago , the idea that some number of young men would come to the US to train as pilots , hijack four fully loaded passenger jets , and then turn them into missiles to be exploded into some of the most important symbols of Western civilization - was inconceivable . 
Today , it is a contingency that must be accounted for in every trip to the airport . 
This is not only a matter of heightened security . 
Our understanding of the world , of our freedom to act in the world , and the possibilities of violence aimed at us because of who we are - these have all changed . 
Here lies the difference between September 11 , 2001 and September 11 , 2002 . 
Until then , we shared a certain sense of what was and was not possible . 
Since then , we struggle with the shock that something so large could have happened - could have taken so much from us - without our having anticipated any of it . 
This first anniversary of the attack will be the first and sharpest of many annual reminders that once again history has turned the unimaginable into the real . 
This is the realization that lies underneath our all-encompassing focus on security . 
We will not wait for another version of this lesson . 
It has now become the central principle of our interaction with the world , and it will be for the foreseeable future . 
Beyond the vast questions of geopolitics and security , we might also hope for another realization to come out of September 11th . 
The international dimension of the attacks also includes an encounter with the after-effects of violence , and the longer-term problems of understanding what happened and how it changed us . 
In this , Americans are finding out that they now have more in common with many members of the international community than they had ever imagined possible . 
Americans , too , are now recovering from a brutal act of violent dislocation , a phenomenon the United States has long been spared , but one familiar in many places around the world . 
The events of September 11th hit America because of who Americans are , and those events transformed the moral horizon of the world community . 
Yet , even so , Americans are not alone in living in the aftermath of violence . 
September 11 , 2002 commands an authority that was unimaginable a year ago . 
The calendar has now fully cycled , setting the attack itself apart from our memories of what happened . 
In commemorating the passage of a year , we mark the passage from &quot; before &quot; to &quot; after . &quot; 
Looking back a year , we see how the future has changed .
