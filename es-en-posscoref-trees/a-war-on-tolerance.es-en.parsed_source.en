A War on Tolerance 
AMSTERDAM  -  
The Dutch always took pride in being the most tolerant people on earth . 
In less feverish times than these , no one could possibly have taken exception to Queen Beatrix &apos;s speech last Christmas , when she pleaded for tolerance and &quot; respect for minorities . &quot; 
But Geert Wilders , leader of the right-wing , anti-Muslim Freedom Party , was so disgusted by the Dutch queen &apos;s &quot; multi-cultural rubbish &quot; that he wanted her to be stripped of her constitutional role in the government . 
Wilders , a popular rabble-rouser whose party occupies nine seats in the Dutch parliament , compares the Koran to Hitler &apos;s Mein Kampf , wants to stop Muslims from moving to the Netherlands , and thunders that those who are already in the country should tear up half the Koran if they wish to stay . 
Tolerance towards Islam is cowardly appeasement in his eyes . 
He thinks that Europe is in peril of being &quot; Islamized . &quot; 
&quot; There will soon be more mosques than churches , &quot; he says , if true Europeans don &apos;t have the guts to stand up and save Western civilization . 
Notwithstanding his call to ban the Koran , Wilders and his admirers claim to believe in unfettered free speech as a Western birthright . 
Beatrix stated that the right to free speech does not automatically mean the right to offend . Wilders disagrees . 
No criticism of Islam , however offensive , should ever be hampered by political correctness . 
Wilders uses every opportunity to test Muslims &quot; ( often very limited ) tolerance . 
His latest provocation is a short film denouncing Islam , which is yet to be shown , but has already caused panic all around . 
Remarkably for a Dutch politician - and a minor one , at that - news of Wilders &apos;s antics has reached the world press . 
So Dutch embassies are bracing themselves for violent demonstrations , and the government is considering special security measures . 
Some commentators suggest that Wilders , born and raised as a Catholic in a provincial Dutch town , is , like his Muslim enemies , a true believer , driven by the goal of keeping Europe &quot; Judeo-Christian . &quot; 
Perhaps , but this is probably a red herring . 
His war on Islam is also , and perhaps even mainly , a war on the cultural and political elites , the Dutch intellectual establishment , the Eurocrats of Brussels , and the liberal-minded queen . 
Indeed , his speeches are studded with references to arrogant elites who are out of touch with the feelings of the common man . 
&quot; Tolerance &quot; is seen as weak and elitist , typical of people who live far removed from the harsh realities of the street , where violent and unruly foreigners menace upstanding Dutch folks . 
This notion of the elitist appeaser is not confined to the Netherlands . 
In Israel , the educated Jewish activists who criticize Israeli abuses against Palestinians , the peaceniks who believe that negotiation is better than violence and that even Arabs have rights , are called , with a knowing sneer , &quot; beautiful souls . &quot; 
The common man , rooted in the real world , supposedly knows better : uncompromising toughness , the hard line , is the only way to get results . 
In the United States , the word &quot; liberal , &quot; in the mouths of populist radio hosts and right-wing politicians , has become almost synonymous with &quot; effete East Coast snob &quot; or , worse , &quot; New York intellectual . &quot; 
Liberals , in this view , are not only soft , but are somehow distinctly un-American . 
The association of elites with foreignness , tolerance , and metropolitan cities is nothing new . 
Elites often can speak foreign languages , and big cities are traditionally more tolerant and open to mixed populations . 
Modern populism - American politicians running , or pretending to run , &quot; against Washington , &quot; or French populists speaking for &quot; deep France &quot; - is invariably hostile to capital cities . 
Brussels , the capital of the European Union , stands for everything populists , whether left or right , hate . 
And Muslim immigrants live in Amsterdam , London , or Marseilles , not in the kind of small towns where right-wing populists find most of their support . 
Still , the politics of resentment works best when it can tap into real fears . 
There are reasons for people to feel anxious about economic globalization , pan-European bureaucracy , the huge and not always effectively controlled influx of immigrants , and the aggression of radical political Islam . 
These anxieties have too often been ignored . 
There is a sense among many Europeans , not just in the Netherlands , that they have been abandoned in a fast-changing world , that multi-national corporations are more powerful than nation-states , that the urban rich and highly educated do fine and ordinary folks in the provinces languish , while democratically elected politicians are not only powerless , but have abjectly surrendered to these larger forces that threaten the common man . 
Tolerance is seen as not just weak , but as a betrayal . 
The Muslim threat is , of course , not a fantasy . 
A small number of ideological extremists has inflicted real violence in the name of Islam , and will continue to do so . 
But the popular resentment of Islam goes deeper and wider . 
Wilders , and others like him , are not just attacking Islamic extremists . 
His success is based on that sense of tolerance as betrayal . 
And , as so often happens , the loathing of elites has found an outlet in the loathing of outsiders , who look different and whose ways are strange . 
We must fight Islamic extremism , but not by tapping into the darkest gut feelings of the unthinking mob . 
Nothing good ever came from that .
