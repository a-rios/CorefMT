Seeing Through Cultural Bias in Science 
Most people now accept that fields like politics and journalism reflect and perpetuate cultural bias . 
Yet we imagine science as free of unexamined cultural assumptions . 
This is more or less true for some fields - say , chemistry or physics . 
My own corner of science , ethology , or the study of animal behavior , is certainly not pristine . 
How we look at animals reflects how we view ourselves . 
The founder of Japanese primatology , Kinji Imanishi , could attest to this . 
Imanishi argued that nature is inherently harmonious rather than competitive , with species forming an ecological whole . 
This rather un-Darwinian perspective so upset a British paleontologist , the late Beverly Halstead , that in 1984 he traveled to Kyoto to confront Imanishi . 
Unconstrained by first-hand knowledge of Imanishi &apos;s works , which were never translated , Halstead told him that his theory was &quot; Japanese in its unreality . &quot; 
What compelled Halstead to be so rude ? 
Why did he later write an article criticizing not just Imanishi &apos;s views , but his country ? 
Why did &quot; Nature , &quot; one of the most prestigious journals in science , publish it , in 1985 , beneath the patronizing assertion that the &quot; popularity of Kinji Imanishi &apos;s writings in Japan gives an interesting insight into Japanese society &quot; ? 
Could not the same be said of Darwin &apos;s theory of unremitting competition , which grew out of a society giving birth to free-market capitalism ? 
Even if Imanishi &apos;s ecological and evolutionary ideas were problematic , he and his followers were right about quite a lot . 
In fact , well before Halstead &apos;s contemptuous pilgrimage , Western ethologists began adopting Eastern concepts and approaches - although without being aware of their sources . 
To understand how this could occur is to appreciate the role of different cultural assumptions about the relations between humans and animals and how linguistic hegemony affects science . 
Eastern philosophy has no counterpart to Plato &apos;s &quot; great chain of being , &quot; which places humans above all other animals . 
In most Eastern belief systems , the human soul can reincarnate in many shapes and forms . 
A man can become a fish and a fish can become God . 
There are no grounds in Eastern thought for resisting the central idea of evolutionary theory : that all animals are historically linked . 
Unlike in the West , this acceptance of evolution was never tainted by hubris or an aversion to acknowledging human-like characteristics in animals . 
Japanese primate researchers assumed that each individual animal had a distinct personality , and they did not hesitate to give their subjects names . 
They plotted kinship relationships over multiple generations , believing that primates must have a complex family life , just like us . 
They did all of this well before any Western scientist thought of it . 
In 1958 , when Imanishi and his students toured the US to report their findings , they were ridiculed for humanizing their subjects and for believing that they could distinguish between all those monkeys . 
The Western view of apes regarded them as akin to Rousseau &apos;s &quot; noble savage &quot; - autonomous individuals , devoid of social ties and obligations , driven by instinct to swing haphazardly from one fruit tree to the next . 
But while Jane Goodall was describing female chimpanzees and their dependent offspring as the only socially bonded units in the primate world , a Japanese team , working only 130 kilometers away , eventually proved that chimpanzees live in large communities with stable memberships . 
We now know that chimpanzee society is male-bonded , and there is ample evidence of territorial warfare between communities . 
The initial discovery arose from the assumption that chimpanzees , so close in evolution to humans , could not be as &quot; individualistic &quot; as Western science supposed . 
The same initial assumption led Imanishi in 1952 to suggest that animals might have culture , which he reduced to its lowest common denominator : the social rather than genetic transmission of behavior . 
If individuals learn from one another , over time their behavior may diverge from that of other groups , thus constituting a distinct culture . 
We now know that cultural learning among animals is widespread , including birdsong , the use of tools by chimpanzees , and the hunting techniques of whales . 
Yet only a few decades ago , some Western professors forbade their students even to make reference to papers by Japanese colleagues ! 
How could a cultural outlook that the West treated with such raw condescension - even in 1985 - simultaneously shape Western science so profoundly ? 
The answer lies in language . 
A single language for scientific papers and conferences is clearly desirable , and the language of international science is English . 
Good scientific ideas formulated in bad English either die or get repackaged . 
Like a Hollywood interpretation of a French novel , their origins become erased . 
Eastern thinking could creep into ethology unnoticed partly because it filtered into the literature through awkward formulations and translations that native English speakers found it easy to improve on . 
The problem is not the English language per se , but the attitude and behavior of many native speakers . 
Naturally , you speak and write your own language faster and more eloquently than any other , and this can place scientists whose English is poor at a severe disadvantage . 
Imanishi &apos;s influence is now pervasive - all primate scientists have adopted the technique of following individuals over time , and animal culture is the hottest topic in our field . 
But Imanishi &apos;s writings are rarely , if ever , cited . 
We should not wonder at the difficulties that other cultural and linguistic groups must experience in gaining a voice and proper acknowledgment in science .
