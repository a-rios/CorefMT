The Threat to the Central-Bank Brand 
NEW YORK - The &quot; branding &quot; of modern central banking started in the United States in the early 1980 &quot; s under then-Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker . 
Facing worrisomely high and debilitating inflation , Volcker declared war against it - and won . 
In delivering secular disinflation , he did more than change expectations and economic behavior . 
He also greatly enhanced the Fed &apos;s standing among the general public , in financial markets , and in policy circles . 
Volcker &apos;s victory was institutionalized in legislation and practices that granted central banks greater autonomy and , in some cases , formal independence from long-standing political constraints . 
To many , central banks now stood for reliability and responsible power . 
Simply put , they could be trusted to do the right thing ; and they delivered . 
As any corporate executive will tell you , brands can be consequential drivers of behavior . 
In essence , a brand is a promise ; and powerful brands deliver on their promise consistently - be it based on quality , price , or experience . 
In some cases , consumers have been known to act on the strength of brand alone , even purchasing a product with relatively limited knowledge about it . 
Indeed , brands send signals that facilitate the task at hand . 
In some special cases - think of Apple , Berkshire Hathaway , Facebook , and Google - they have also acted as a significant catalyst for behavioral modification . 
In the process , they often insert a wedge that essentially disconnects fundamentals from pricing . 
Building on Volcker &apos;s success , Western central banks have used their brand to help maintain low and stable inflation . 
By signaling their intention to contain price pressures , they would alter inflation expectations - and thus essentially convince the public and the government to do the heavy lifting . 
In the last few years , however , the threat of inflation has not been an issue . 
Instead , Western central banks have had to confront market failures , fragmented financial systems , clogged monetary-policy transmission mechanisms , and sluggish growth in output and employment . 
Facing greater challenges in delivering desired outcomes , they have essentially pushed both policies and their brand power to the limit . 
This is apparent in central banks &quot; aggressive emphasis on communication and forward policy guidance . 
Both have been used more widely - indeed , taken to extreme levels - to supplement the unconventional expansion of balance sheets in the context of liquidity traps . 
Now , corporate executives will also tell you that brand management is a tricky affair . 
It is particularly hard to maintain or control your brand when popular sentiment overshoots . 
This is what happened to Apple &apos;s stock this year . 
As brilliantly explained by Guy Kawasaki in his book on the company , the brand essentially created &quot; enchantment . &quot; 
Extrapolating this into a market view that Apple could not only innovate continuously , but also fend off any and all competitors , investors took the company &apos;s share price to dizzying heights . 
Elsewhere in California , Facebook found its brand fueling enormous hype for the company &apos;s initial public offering . 
Encouraged by investor excitement and indications of over-subscription , underwriters hiked the IPO &apos;s price well above what they had first deemed reasonable . 
Issuing the stock to the public at an inflated price a year ago , the shares initially traded even higher . 
In both of these cases , and in many others , brand power did more than lead to price behavior that was disconnected from fundamentals ; it also caused a dangerous overshoot , which , when subsequently reversed , damaged the brand . 
However powerful , brands cannot divorce pricing from fundamentals entirely and forever . 
Accordingly , and despite a significant market rally that has taken many individual stocks to record highs , Apple and Facebook currently trade at almost half their record levels . 
Their dominance and influence are no longer unquestioned . 
Western central bankers should spend some time reflecting on these experiences . 
Some have actively encouraged markets to take the prices of many financial assets to levels no longer warranted by fundamentals . 
Others have stood by passively . 
Indeed , it seems that only retiring central bankers , such as Mervyn King of the Bank of England , are willing to raise concerns publicly . 
This behavior is understandable . 
Central bankers are basically hoping that financial-market hype by itself can help pull fundamentals higher . 
The idea is that price action will trigger both the &quot; wealth effect &quot; and &quot; animal spirits , &quot; thus inducing consumers to spend more and companies to invest in future capacity . 
Count me among those who worry about this situation . 
Far from a world of optimal policy , central bankers have been forced into prolonged reliance on imperfect approaches . 
From my professional vantage point , I sense a mounting risk of collateral damage and unintended consequences . 
Market signals are more distorted , fueling resource misallocations . 
Investors are piling on more risk at increasingly elevated prices . 
Fundamentals-based investing is giving way to a frantic search for relative bargains in an increasingly overpriced financial world . 
All this will not matter much if central banks live up to their reputation as responsible and powerful institutions that deliver on their economic promises . 
They will have materially damaged their standing and , consequently , the future effectiveness of their policy stance . 
By extending well beyond their comfort zone , today &apos;s central banks face unusual brand-management risks . 
Their prior ability to deliver on promises and expectations has made today &apos;s financial markets take the forward pricing of the economy to levels that exceed what central bankers alone can reasonably deliver . 
The implication is not that central banks should immediately halt their hyper-activism and unconventional measures . 
Western central bankers need to become much more vocal and , one hopes , more persuasive in placing pressure on politicians and other policymakers . 
Otherwise , risking major brand damage , they will end up adding yet another item to an already-overloaded plate of challenges for the next generation .
