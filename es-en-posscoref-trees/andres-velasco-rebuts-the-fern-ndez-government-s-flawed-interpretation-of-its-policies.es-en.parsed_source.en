Argentina &apos;s Use and Abuse of Keynes 
BUENOS AIRES - &quot; We are all Keynesians now , &quot; Republican US President Richard Nixon famously said in 1971 . 
Today , Axel Kicillof , Argentina &apos;s Peronist economy minister , is echoing this sentiment . 
Is he right ? 
Kicillof has gained international recognition as the public face of Argentina &apos;s fight against the so-called vulture funds that want to extort full payment on Argentine bonds that they purchased for a few pennies on the dollar . 
But , before joining President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner &apos;s cabinet , Kicillof was known in Argentine intellectual circles as the author of the book Volver a Keynes ( Return to Keynes ) . 
Last week , addressing a gilded ballroom packed with the elite of Argentina &apos;s business community , Kicillof explained the government &apos;s policies as a real-world application of Keynesian theories . 
In an hour-long speech , he made two key points . 
First , Kicillof attributed Argentina &apos;s rapid economic growth in the years between its 2001 debt default and the 2008 global financial crisis to a Keynesian reflation of domestic aggregate demand . 
Keynes made a tremendous intellectual contribution in showing that supply in a market economy does not necessarily create its own demand , and that demand shortfalls can cause avoidable recessions . 
Is this logic at work in Argentina ? 
When the Argentine economy imploded in 2001 , citizens lost their jobs and firms lost their access to credit , causing domestic demand to collapse . 
Output fell sharply . 
But , as the country abandoned the one-to-one currency peg to the US dollar , the real exchange rate depreciated . 
This shifted demand away from imports toward domestically produced goods . 
Next , a sharp rise in the price of food exports , heavily taxed in Argentina , augmented government revenues , providing the cash to finance increased expenditure . 
Given Argentina &apos;s isolation from world financial markets , its central bank could cut domestic interest rates with limited fear of capital flight . 
The fiscal and monetary impulse supported a rapid recovery . 
At first glance , Kicillof seems to be correct ; this looks like textbook Keynesian reflation . 
But Keynes would not have approved of the macroeconomic policies pursued by Fernández and her predecessor and husband , the late Néstor Kirchner . 
A Keynesian approach would ensure that demand does not fall short of supply . 
The Kirchners have made sure that demand far exceeds supply . 
The fact that Argentina &apos;s annual inflation rate has stood at 20 % or more for over a decade clearly illustrates this - and cannot be obscured by frozen utility rates and repeated manipulation of the consumer price index . 
Kicillof &apos;s second point was that Argentina &apos;s businesses and consumers should not succumb to pessimism . 
Alluding to Keynes &apos;s theories about self-fulfilling expectations , he warned that , if people expect things to go wrong , they will . 
Keynes did say - and it was a very important insight - that a capitalist economy resembles a beauty contest , with judges voting not for the most beautiful contestant , but for the contestant whom they believe their colleagues will find most beautiful . 
Shifts in expectations can thus alter the outcome . 
But Argentines are not pessimistic about the economy because other Argentines are pessimistic . 
They are pessimistic because the economy &apos;s fundamentals are weak - a fundamental difference . 
In 1991 , the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman , who is perhaps the world &apos;s leading Keynesian today , showed that whether or not expectations are self-fulfilling depends on underlying economic conditions . 
If an economy &apos;s fundamentals are very weak , a crisis will inevitably occur sooner or later ; if its fundamentals are very strong , a crisis never happens ; and if they are in an intermediate range , a crisis happens if - and only if - people expect one . 
A couple of years ago , the eurozone was in the latter situation . 
That is why European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s pledge to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro immediately brought the eurozone &apos;s debt crisis to a halt . 
( The growth crisis , of course , has yet to be resolved . ) 
But Argentina is not the eurozone . 
There is nothing that Kicillof could say today that would have the soothing effect that Draghi &apos;s promise did . 
Argentines today feel much like Dorothy did when she first landed in Oz - they are not in the safe and familiar &quot; Kansas &quot; anymore . 
But Keynes is not to blame .
