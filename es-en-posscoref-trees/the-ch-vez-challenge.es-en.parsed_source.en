The Chávez Challenge 
Venezuela &apos;s recent legislative elections confirmed trends that have repeatedly brought the country into the headlines in recent years . 
President Hugo Chávez showed once again that he enjoys broad support among the nation &apos;s poor and desperate , and that he is miles ahead of his opposition in terms of political skill , cunning , and ruthlessness . 
Yet at the same time voter turnout is declining with each passing election under Chávez , and the questionable fairness of the electoral process has grown increasingly apparent . 
To be sure , the opposition &apos;s withdrawal from the election just days before the vote was , as Chávez claimed , more a symptom of its own weakness than of problems with the electoral process . 
And , just as surely , that very weakness is a function of the gradual stifling of many features of Venezuela &apos;s traditional democratic order . 
Even so , the opposition &apos;s mistakes have been massive , ranging from support for the failed coup against the democratically elected Chávez in April 2002 to the failed strike at PEDEVSA , Venezuela &apos;s national oil company , in early 2003 . 
Nothing is more lethal in politics than failure in direct confrontation . 
In such circumstances , Chávez can afford to be bold , despite his policies &quot; failure to benefit his core constituency : the more than 50 % of Venezuelans who live in destitution and despair . 
Poverty has grown since Chávez took office in 1998 ; government finances and the trade balance are more dependent on oil revenues than before , and , aside from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood &quot; barefoot doctor &quot; services , the overall welfare of the poor remains the same , if not worse . 
Major changes are unlikely in the foreseeable future . 
Chávez will be able to modify the Constitution largely as he pleases , and pack both the justice system and the electoral authority with his placemen . 
He will continue to dole out oil-based subsidies in the well-worn Venezuelan tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez . 
As a result , Chávez will be re-elected late next year , and he may well remain in power until the end of the next decade . 
Yet , if this is what the Venezuelan people want , then so be it . 
It is , after all , their business who governs them , and how , as long as human rights are not systematically violated , democratic institutions are not indefinitely suspended , and standard norms of international conduct are respects . 
Judged by the last standard , at least , Chávez may have crossed the line . 
For years , he has been accused of taking over where Fidel Castro left off : supporting the rhetoric of radicalism and anti-imperialism , if not revolution , throughout Latin America . 
It could now be time for other Latin American nations and the international community to take such charges more seriously . 
Chávez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba , and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner &apos;s political fortunes . 
In Mar del Plata , Argentina , last month , he openly participated in a rally against the Free Trade Area of the Americas ( FTAA ) , in the company of , among others , Evo Morales , the coca-leaf growers &quot; leader from Bolivia who might well become that country &apos;s next president . 
Similarly , Chávez is clearly supporting Daniel Ortega , the perennial Sandinista presidential candidate in Nicaragua , and Shafick Handal , the equally perennial FMLN candidate in El Salvador . 
His former ambassador to Mexico participated openly and vociferously in campaign events for Mexico City Mayor Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador &apos;s presidential campaign . 
There seems to be a common thread to most of Chávez &apos;s foreign policy : to provoke a major confrontation with the United States . 
The danger , of course , is that if and when confrontation comes - over Bolivia , the FTAA , human rights , or press freedoms - it will be too late to defuse it . 
The challenge , then , lies in avoiding a confrontation that Chávez clearly wants . 
Unfortunately , George W. Bush &apos;s administration has not proved particularly adept at conflict prevention . 
The hemisphere &apos;s other nations have a direct stake in attempting to pre-empt a fight that would force them to take sides and might threaten their economic and national-security interests . 
Although many of Chávez &apos;s positions have found support in certain Latin American nations , the division that he and Castro &apos;s Cuba have created in Latin America - between left and right , free-traders and &quot; Bolivarians , &quot; and pro- and anti- Americans - is mainly artificial and certainly not impossible to overcome . 
To be sure , many Latin American leaders have tried to assuage and control Chávez , and they have all failed . 
But the cost of not trying again could be extremely high . 
The last time revolutionary leaders confronted the US head-on , in Central America during the 1980 &quot; s , everyone lost . 
A new split up and down the hemisphere , engineered by a leader awash in oil money , would prove far more disastrous .
