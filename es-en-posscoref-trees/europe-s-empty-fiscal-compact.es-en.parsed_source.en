Europe &apos;s Empty Fiscal Compact 
CAMBRIDGE - The driving force of Europe &apos;s economic policy is the &quot; European project &quot; of political integration . 
That goal is reflected in the European Union &apos;s current focus on creating a &quot; fiscal compact , &quot; which would constitutionalize member states &quot; commitment to supposedly inviolable deficit ceilings . 
Unfortunately , the compact is likely to be another example of Europe &apos;s subordination of economic reality to politicians &quot; desire for bragging rights about progress toward &quot; ever closer union . &quot; 
The plans for a fiscal compact have evolved rapidly in recent months , shifting from a politically unpopular &quot; transfer union &quot; to a dangerous plan for fiscal austerity and , finally , to a modified version of the defunct Stability and Growth Pact of 1997 . 
In the end , the agreement that will emerge later this year will do little , if anything , to change economic conditions in Europe . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel initially proposed the &quot; transfer union , &quot; in which Germany and other strong eurozone economies would transfer funds year after year to Greece and other needy countries , in exchange for the authority to regulate and supervise the recipient countries &quot; budgets and tax collections . 
The German public rejected the idea of permanent transfers from German taxpayers to Greece , while Greek officials and the Greek public rejected the idea of German control over their country &apos;s fiscal policy . 
The next step was the fiscal plan that was agreed in Brussels at the end of last year , which completely abandoned the idea of a transfer union in favor of an agreement that each eurozone country would balance its budget . 
Under this scheme , a financial penalty would &quot; automatically &quot; be imposed on any country that violated that obligation . 
With balanced budgets everywhere , there would be no need for fiscal transfers . 
But how , exactly , should the balanced budget requirement be defined ? 
In a letter to the officials negotiating the formal agreement , Jorg Asmussen , the German member of the European Central Bank &apos;s Executive Council , stressed that a balanced budget meant just that . 
Even if a country ran budget deficit because a cyclical downturn caused a fall in tax revenue and an increase in social transfers , it should be required to raise taxes or cut spending to restore a balanced budget . 
If this proposal were actually implemented , it would have the effect of turning small recessions into major economic downturns . 
Fortunately , this recipe for creating future European depressions was rapidly dropped . 
The most likely form of the fiscal compact now seems to be a very mild agreement requiring each country to &quot; balance its budgets over the business cycle . &quot; 
Although failure to comply would in principle lead to automatic financial penalties , it is difficult to imagine how such failure could be determined in a country like Spain . 
At what future point would Spain , with a persistent unemployment rate of more than 15 % , be required to raise taxes and cut social transfers ? 
Ordering Spain to do so might rest with the European Commission , making it a political decision , rather than the &quot; automatic &quot; technical requirement that its proponents promise . 
If this is the essence of the fiscal compact that is eventually agreed , it will have no predictable effect on eurozone countries &quot; behavior . 
Its only effect will be to allow the eurozone &apos;s political leaders to claim that they have created a fiscal union , and thus that they have moved Europe closer to the political union that is their ultimate goal . 
But a fiscal union conceived in this way is completely different from how most people understand the term . 
In the United States , for example , the central government collects about 20 % of the country &apos;s GDP and pays out a similar amount . 
That centralization of taxes and spending creates an automatic stabilizer for any region that experiences an economic downturn : the affected region &apos;s residents send less money to Washington and receive more in transfers . 
There is no similar process in the eurozone , where taxes and spending occur at the national level . 
The centralized fiscal role in the US also allows all of the individual states to operate with true balanced budgets , modified only by relatively small &quot; rainy day &quot; funds . 
But , although the current European political process will not create strong fiscal discipline , financial markets are likely to force eurozone governments to reduce their sovereign debts and limit their fiscal deficits . 
During the single currency &apos;s first decade , private investors &quot; belief in the equality of all eurozone sovereign bonds kept interest rates low in the peripheral countries , even as their governments ran up large deficits and accumulated massive debt . 
Investors will not repeat that mistake : once bitten , twice shy . 
For eurozone governments , that means that financial markets will now enforce what the political process cannot achieve . 
The EU &apos;s fiscal compact , whatever its final form , will be little more than a sideshow .
