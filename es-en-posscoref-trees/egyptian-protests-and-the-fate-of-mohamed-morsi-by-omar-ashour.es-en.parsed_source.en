Showdown in Egypt 
LONDON - With massive anti-government protests across Egypt on June 30 - a year to the day after Egyptians elected their first-ever civilian president - a diverse and decentralized movement has challenged President Mohammad Morsi &apos;s hold on power as never before . 
Hundreds of thousands were mobilized to take to the streets , with many storming and burning down the Cairo headquarters of the ruling Muslim Brotherhood . 
At the end of the day , the president was given an ultimatum . 
The first &quot; revolutionary &quot; statement of Egypt &apos;s new grassroots Tamarod ( rebel ) movement demanded that Morsi leave within two days or face a march on the presidential palace . 
&quot; In the name of 22 million citizens , we declare that Mohammad Morsi is no longer the legitimate President of Egypt . &quot; 
The protesters then appealed to &quot; the institutions of the state , the army , the police , and the judiciary to side with the popular will . &quot; 
The army has spoken , issuing an ultimatum of its own to Morsi : Address the protesters &quot; demands or face a military solution to the crisis . 
As the day ended , Morsi &apos;s office declared that it had not been consulted prior to the army &apos;s statement , and tens of thousands of the president &apos;s supporters demonstrated in several cities simultaneously at midnight . 
So what will happen next ? 
And what impact will the Tamarod movement and the army intervention have on Egypt &apos;s precarious democratization process ? 
The path to today &apos;s crisis was predictable . 
Morsi won the presidential election with only 51.7 % of the vote , while the other 48.3 % included very powerful forces , including figures from the Mubarak regime and their supporters . 
Opposition to Morsi hardened following the annulled November 2012 constitutional declaration , by which he had sought sweeping powers - allegedly to protect the country &apos;s infant elected institutions against a politicized judiciary . 
The lack of tangible material gains for ordinary Egyptians also fueled public anger . 
All of the presidential candidates had made wild promises ; but the absence of significant achievement , such as resolving the country &apos;s chronic shortages of gas and electricity , helped to fuel the massive anti-Morsi mobilization . 
Incompetence during a political transition has a high price . 
But Morsi is not entirely without accomplishments or supporters . 
Last August , he culled the leaders of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces ( SCAF ) . 
This improvement did not trickle down to ordinary citizens , and there was no effective media and communication strategy to capitalize on it . 
But Morsi &apos;s core supporters remain committed . 
Whereas only a few hundred showed up to support the fraudulently elected Mubarak during the revolution , hundreds of thousands of Egyptians rallied for two consecutive weeks in Rab &apos;a al- &quot; Adawiyya square , near the presidential palace , to express their solidarity with Morsi . 
If Morsi survives in office , he will have to rely on the army to guarantee his government &apos;s safety . 
He will also need a massive show of strength from his supporters . 
But this would mean returning the army to the center of politics - and thus sacrificing the gains from Morsi &apos;s imposition last August of greater civilian control . 
And the army &apos;s ultimatum indicates that the military is moving in the direction of a coup . 
Mobilization of Morsi &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist supporters is also risky . 
Indeed , the revolutionary step of steering once-armed Islamists toward electoral and constitutional politics could be reversed in ongoing power struggle . 
If Morsi does not remain in power , much will depend on how he is removed . 
Reliance on street mobilization and army intervention to bring down an elected leader who has support on the ground is unlikely to lead to a positive outcome . 
On the contrary , that pattern - seen in Spain in 1936 , Iran in 1953 , Chile in 1973 , Turkey in 1980 , Sudan in 1989 , and Algeria and Tajikistan in 1992 - usually leads to military dictatorships , civil wars , or both . 
But there is also Charles de Gaulle &apos;s precedent of a peaceful exit by an elected president . 
The massive protests in France in 1968 led to an early parliamentary election , which de Gaulle &apos;s supporters won decisively . 
But de Gaulle later resigned of his own volition , over an issue of minor importance . 
The problem with this precedent is that Morsi does not have de Gaulle &apos;s background , and Egypt &apos;s chaotic political transition of 2013 is far from France &apos;s consolidated democracy of 1968 . 
French Gaullists did not face persecution ; several Egyptian opposition figures have already vowed that Morsi and the Muslim Brothers will . 
That raises the stakes of political survival considerably , especially given the absence of any credible guarantor of constitutional norms and behavior . 
Moreover , a possible replacement for Morsi is not very clear . 
Parts of the opposition speak of a transitional &quot; presidential council . &quot; 
But that idea failed once already , during the SCAF &apos;s rule ( February 2011-June 2012 ) , owing partly to the lack of popular mobilization behind a uniting figure ( s ) , but mostly because of the egos - indeed , megalomania - of the politicians involved . 
Morsi will almost certainly not be removed without the involvement of the army and the security establishment . 
And the winners will probably try their best to block the Islamist forces from a comeback , implying another cycle of no-holds-barred political - and perhaps physical - combat , in which democracy serves as a mask to legitimize the exclusion , and possibly the destruction , of one &apos;s political opponents .
