Taiwan \ u0027s Democratic Labor Pains 
Young democracies can be cruel : their voters are often as unforgiving as political opponents . 
The two weeks since Taiwan &apos;s disputed presidential election of March 20 - only the third such democratic vote in the country &apos;s history - has tested this truism almost to the breaking point . 
Taiwan &apos;s young democracy must now cope with the balancing act that President Chen Shui-bian &apos;s re-election has thrust upon it . 
While canvassing for votes in his hometown in southern Taiwan on the eve of the election , President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were both wounded by an assassin &apos;s bullet . 
The sympathy this secured gave the President his razor-thin margin of victory - with just 50.1 % of the votes - over Lien Chan , the candidate of the Kuomintang Party and People &apos;s First Party ( KMT-PFP ) coalition . 
Opposition street protests and shouts that the assassination was stage followed . 
A recount was demanded . 
None of this is surprising , because Taiwan &apos;s society is evenly and deeply polarized . 
President Chen &apos;s Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) called for &quot; one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait &quot; and for &quot; preventing the return of an alien regime &quot; ( meaning the KMT , which came to Taiwan in 1949 ) . 
But while Chen &apos;s campaign to safeguard Taiwan against threats from mainland China clearly galvanized the party &apos;s supporters , it made the uncommitted nervous and the rival KMT angry . 
For the KMT-PFP coalition , the campaign was a virtual holy war , conducted not only to revive an ailing economy , but also to keep the country &apos;s official name : the &quot; Republic of China . &quot; 
With so much at stake , both camps mobilized millions of people . 
President Chen upped the stakes even more by holding Taiwan &apos;s first-ever popular referendum . 
Not only did China denounce the referendum as provocative , but so did the US President George W. Bush . 
In the weeks since the vote , Taiwan has staggered ahead . 
President Chen agreed to a recount . 
But the questions on everyone &apos;s lips are whether the loser of the recount will accept the result , and whether Taiwan &apos;s young democracy can survive this tumult ? 
For the most important issue facing Taiwan today is not re-unification with China , but consolidating and deepening our democratic institutions . 
Traditions of tolerance must replace the turbulence that has so far dominated the building of Taiwan &apos;s democracy . 
The one benefit to be gained from the referendum is that , for the first time , Taiwan &apos;s citizens were asked to debate issues related to national defense and cross-Strait relations . 
Any citizen could take part in one of ten nationally televised debates and argue with government officials . 
Moreover , the presidential candidates themselves engaged in two rounds of televised debates and gave another two televised speeches - a political openness new to Taiwan and unique in the Chinese political world . 
Although China &apos;s rulers dismissed the election , Taiwan &apos;s open democratic exercises will have vast repercussions for other Chinese political communities in their pursuit of greater political pluralism . 
From this perspective , Taiwan &apos;s democratic traditions can only grow stronger . 
The DPP is a relatively young party , formed only in 1986 . 
For a long time , indeed , Taiwan was overshadowed by the KMT . 
That dominance is now definitively a thing of the past . 
The uneven distribution of power between the two parties had many predicting a victory for the KMT-PFP coalition . 
Indeed , the DPP had never been able to win more than 40 % of the vote previously . 
Its victory has now made it a fixture on the political landscape . 
Having ruled for four years , the DPP has already redrawn Taiwan &apos;s political map . 
Its calls for more reforms , its belief in Taiwan , and the urgency of its appeal to defend the island against undue influence from China have now captured the allegiance of a small majority of the population . 
Yet this should not be considered an outright victory for Taiwanese nationalism . 
Were it not for the shooting incident on the election &apos;s eve , the opposition might have eked out a victory , with the soft economy the deciding factor . 
The slim majority , and the clear differences between the two political camps , will assure a robust two-party system in the future . 
But more than two strong parties have emerged from the campaign . 
The law , too , is giving democracy here a boost . 
For example , the two parties are now engaged in tense negotiations to amend the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law to avert any repeat of the current confused circumstances surrounding the current recount . 
In the future a compulsory recount will be held should the winning margin be less than 1 % . 
A &quot; sunshine law &quot; to regulate political donations was enacted before the ballots were cast . 
The finances of the president and his / her family will henceforth be more strictly monitored . 
Taiwan &apos;s democratic experiences are messy , but no messier than the vote that brought President Bush to power four years ago . 
Yes , Taiwan &apos;s recent vote will leave a divided country behind , but those divisions are democratic divisions , and people are now organizing for the next elections . 
Instead of writing off Taiwan &apos;s democratic experiment as doomed to instability or worse , the disputed vote will help consolidate and invigorate our democratic order .
