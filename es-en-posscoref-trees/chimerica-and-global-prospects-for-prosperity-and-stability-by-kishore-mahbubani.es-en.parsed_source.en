Silver Linings for a Golden Age 
SINGAPORE - Are prospects for global stability and prosperity improving or deteriorating ? 
With enlightenment and progress in some parts of the world accompanied by atavism and stagnation elsewhere , this is not an easy question . 
But we can gain greater purchase on it by considering three other questions . 
The first is whether the United States will regain its standing as a source of moral leadership . 
Despite its flaws , America did provide such leadership , beginning at the end of World War II . 
But the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , changed everything . 
Americans &quot; anger following the attacks drove them to support policies that they once would have considered inconceivable . 
In the name of the &quot; global war on terror , &quot; they have tolerated torture ; accepted - and even endorsed - the illegal invasion of Iraq ; and allowed innocent civilians to become collateral damage of mechanical drone strikes . 
In order to restore America &apos;s moral leadership , President Barack Obama must make good on his early rhetoric - exemplified in his speeches in Istanbul and Cairo early in his presidency - which demonstrated genuine regard for the oppressed . 
In 2007 , during his first presidential campaign , he wrote that America &quot; can neither retreat from the world nor try to bully it into submission . 
We must lead the world , by deed and by example . &quot; 
But Obama cannot do it alone - and , so far , neither the American public nor the US Congress seems committed to reconnecting with its moral compass . 
It should be unacceptable , for example , for Congress to block the release of 86 Guant√°namo Bay detainees cleared by a committee of national-security officials . 
Not even the revelations by former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden that no one is exempt from the possibility of US surveillance have stirred Americans to demand a new approach . 
The answer to the second major question shaping the world &apos;s future - whether China will regain its economic momentum - also appears to be &quot; no , &quot; at least in the short term , with most experts agreeing that China &apos;s export- and investment-led growth model has all but exhausted its potential . 
Indeed , China cannot continue to rely on manufacturing exports when its major sources of demand - the US and Europe - are struggling and its labor costs are rising . 
Likewise , China &apos;s government cannot continue to waste resources on economic-stimulus packages that have led to industrial overcapacity and skyrocketing local-government debt . 
And China cannot move toward a more market-oriented , efficient , and innovative economy with bloated state-owned enterprises blocking the way . 
Whether China can develop and implement a viable new economic-growth model in post-crisis conditions depends on whether President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang can revive the legacy of their predecessors , Deng Xiaoping and Zhu Rongji . 
In other words , China &apos;s future - and that of the global economy - depends on how committed its leaders are to overcoming vested interests and pursuing comprehensive structural and policy reform . 
While many in the West contend ( and perhaps hope ) that China will not succeed in transforming its economy , Xi and Li are acutely aware of the previous growth model &apos;s unsustainability - and the challenges that changing it will entail . 
For example , in March , Li said that implementing the needed market reforms &quot; will be very painful , and even feel like cutting one &apos;s wrist . &quot; 
And both Xi and Li have indicated the government &apos;s willingness to tolerate slower GDP growth in the short term for the sake of building a stronger , more sustainable economy . 
The final question is whether Europe and Japan will recover their &quot; animal spirits . &quot; 
Given Europe &apos;s current malaise and the waning impact of so-called &quot; Abenomics &quot; in Japan , it is difficult to believe that their economies , which fueled global output growth for several decades , will regain their former stature . 
Indeed , Europeans and Japanese have largely given up hope of doing so . 
Although European Union leaders have managed to keep the eurozone intact , they lack a long-term strategy to lift their economies out of the doldrums . 
The seriousness of Europe &apos;s situation is reflected in growing acceptance of the high unemployment - and youth-unemployment rates of over 50 % - that some EU countries , including Spain and Greece , now face . 
Meanwhile , the first two &quot; arrows &quot; of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s economic program - radical monetary-policy easing and increased government spending - seem to have given the country &apos;s long-stagnant economy a lift . 
But the third and most important arrow - structural reform - has so far had little impact . 
And , after more than two decades of political turmoil and economic decline , the Japanese public has become skeptical of official promises of economic revival . 
Fortunately , the US and Chinese economies are underpinned by societies that remain dynamic , vibrant , and hopeful . 
Young people in other parts of Asia , especially India and the ten ASEAN countries , are similarly optimistic - as well they should be . 
Asia &apos;s middle-class population is expected to experience explosive growth in the coming years , rising from 500 million people in 2010 to 1.75 billion in 2020 . 
Africa , with its population of one billion , is also gaining economic momentum , contributing further to the rapid expansion of the global middle class , which is expected to surge from 1.8 billion in 2010 to 3.2 billion in 2020 and to 4.9 billion people - more than half of the world &apos;s population - in 2030 . 
Despite the massive challenges that countries like Syria , Somalia , Egypt , and Afghanistan currently face , and global challenges like food security and climate change , the world has reason to be hopeful about the future . 
Notwithstanding today &apos;s tragic and terrifying headlines , we may be entering a new golden age of human history .
