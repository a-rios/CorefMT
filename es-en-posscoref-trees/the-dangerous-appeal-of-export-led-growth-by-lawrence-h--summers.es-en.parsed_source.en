Will the Global Economy Add Up ? 
CAMBRIDGE - This year has begun on a note of cautious optimism for the global economy . 
Europe is back from the brink . 
The United States did not fall over the fiscal cliff . 
Japan is moving to change its economic strategy , and China appears to be getting back on track . 
Financial-market indices in the US , moreover , are near pre-crisis levels , and expected volatility is at multi-year lows . 
Major financial institutions are , for the most part , better capitalized than they have been in a long time . 
Balance sheets have been repaired , and many actors are awash with cash . 
While 2013 will not be a banner year , it may nonetheless come to be viewed as the first year of the post-crisis period . 
To be sure , the political environment remains challenging almost everywhere . 
The US will face a trifecta of new fiscal hurdles - lack of legal authority to pay debt , no operating budget for the federal government , and the dreaded prospect of sequestration - before the end of March . 
Crucial elections lie ahead in Italy and Germany . 
China &apos;s new government comes to power amid unprecedented levels of public concern about corruption and inappropriate enrichment of public officials . 
And it is not clear that Japan &apos;s fractured politics will permit stable governance in the years ahead . 
But there is the prospect of a virtuous circle in which economic improvement leads to less surly politics , in turn reducing uncertainty and boosting recovery further . 
So far , at least , the worst fears about the adverse political consequences of poor economic performance have not materialized - even in Greece . 
So my guess is that if nothing else goes terribly wrong , politics will not undo the global economy . 
Unfortunately , much else could go wrong . 
In particular , while each of the global economy &apos;s major regions has a plausible growth strategy , these strategies may not add up . 
Virtually the only proposition on which international economists agree is that the sum of all trade balances must equal zero . 
So , a major challenge now is that around the world there seems to be far more planning for export-led growth than acceptance of reduced competitiveness and increased imports . 
At the beginning of 2010 , US President Barack Obama set the lofty goal of doubling America &apos;s exports by the end of 2014 . 
More than halfway through that five-year period , the US is pretty much on track to meet that target , implying that export growth is ahead of import growth or growth in the global economy . 
In Europe , the only way that the financially distressed countries of the periphery can reduce their debt is to run trade surpluses . 
With limits on Germany &apos;s willingness to accept a reduction in its competitiveness and repeated signals from the European Central Bank that monetary policy will remain highly accommodating , export-led growth seems to be the goal here , too . 
And , in Asia , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s new Japanese government has already depressed the value of the yen and buoyed export prospects by placing reflation through monetary easing at the center of its agenda , while the most recent statistics out of China suggest significantly faster export growth than was anticipated . 
So , where will the extra imports needed to support all of this additional exporting come from ? 
Perhaps weaker commodity prices will create space for other imports , and commodity producers &quot; trade positions will swing toward lower surpluses . 
Perhaps emerging economies with improved prospects will attract higher capital flows , financing larger trade deficits as capital goods are purchased directly or indirectly . 
It is quite likely that some would-be export champions will be disappointed as planned competitiveness increases do not materialize . 
This is why serene views of the effects of austerity based on historical experience are misguided . 
A single country or region consolidating or deleveraging in a thriving global economy can expect that its lower interest rates will translate into a weaker currency and an improved trade position . 
Each country &apos;s austerity imposes external costs by reducing demand for other countries &quot; products . 
In this sense , it has a beggar-thy-neighbor aspect , which may be enhanced if the austerity is offset by monetary expansion . 
The implication for policymakers is clear . 
More than at almost any time in recent years , international coordination to avoid excessive austerity will be essential for global economic success . 
Ensuring that national strategies are not just locally prudent , but also globally consistent should be the central task for the G-20 and the International Monetary Fund in 2013 . 
Otherwise , the global growth equation may not add up .
