Why an American Recovery Matters 
MILAN - It is hard to be optimistic about America at present . 
With the help of crucial government support in the crisis , the US financial sector ( or at least parts of it ) has bounced back , while America &apos;s real economy struggles with high unemployment , discouraged labor-force dropouts , and damaged balance sheets . 
So it is no surprise that the American public and the US Congress are angry . 
The focus of that anger has been the massive and unwise financial-sector bonuses . 
As a result , regulatory reforms have thus far consisted of , first , a threat to the Federal Reserve &apos;s autonomy , and , second , a tax on bonuses . 
The first idea is a bad one . 
The latter may be politically mandatory and marginally beneficial in fiscal terms . 
Its effects on risk-taking are debatable . 
But the much-needed structural reforms to limit leverage and contain the risks that the financial system periodically imposes on the real economy - and the public purse - have only belatedly gotten off the to-do list , and the prospects of enacting them are difficult to estimate . 
In fairness , the new rule proposed by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to separate financial intermediation from proprietary trading is not a bad idea . 
Combined with elevated capital requirements for banks , it would reduce the chance of another simultaneous failure of all credit channels . 
But it is not sufficient . 
Hedge funds can also destabilize the system , as the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998 demonstrated . 
So they also need clear , albeit different , limits on leverage . 
Health-care reform has deeply divided the American public and US politicians alike . 
Whatever the merits and shortcomings of various proposals , these divisions suppressed the bipartisan aspects of the political process and emphasized its zero-sum dimension . 
That , in turn , has put in jeopardy other reforms . 
One might expect that after a dangerous crisis rooted in growing structural imbalances and an unsustainable growth pattern on the demand side , there would be serious , ongoing debate about what is needed to restore long-term growth and productive job creation in the context of a rapidly evolving global economy . 
But there is not , which is both puzzling and worrisome . 
This is not to say that the US economy has lost its dynamism . 
Far from it . 
But in the long term , sustaining it will require far-sighted public policies and investments in hard and soft infrastructure to support the private sector &apos;s high capacity for innovation . 
There are those who disagree and believe that an economy &apos;s dynamism is found almost entirely in the private sector , while the task of government is mainly to stay out of the way . 
Still others accept that government could in principal do something useful , but believe that it normally does not , and that the risks outweigh the benefits . 
A policy agenda in the US that is overloaded , overwhelmingly domestically focused , and partially paralyzed will mean a lack of attention to global issues that require cooperation and compromise , including the international dimensions of financial reform . 
Absent coordination , there is also a risk that monetary policies designed to promote growth ( or at least not impede it ) will lead to a return of financial-sector distortions and imbalances . 
The rebalancing and restoration of global demand in the medium term is discussed within the G-20 , but has not really gotten underway . 
From the perspectives of both policy and investment , the short and medium term is once again risky . 
Many countries , including developing ones , will adopt defensive postures , some of which , such as making better use of the domestic market as a driver of growth , will have broadly positive impacts , even if growth prospects are somewhat diminished in the aggregate . 
More importantly , the crisis highlighted the risks associated with high dependence on foreign capital . 
That , combined with slow progress on financial-sector reform , makes it likely that risk-aversion will prevail , which could slow , if not reverse , financial globalization , and probably lead to slower growth in many countries . 
Restarting the Doha round of trade negotiations with a more manageable agenda - and one focused on the poorer and more vulnerable developing countries - would be a good way to revive progress on trade . 
But , in an environment of slow growth and high unemployment , sentiment in the advanced countries regarding efforts to liberalize trade is distinctly negative . 
The restoration of growth and balance in the US economy is crucially important , not only for its effect on global growth , but also as a foundation for tackling a broad array of international problems and challenges . 
Right now , it looks as though creating that foundation is on hold . 
Outside the advanced countries , there is a view that the world will return to pre-crisis conditions , with a stable US that functions as borrower , lender , and consumer of last resort . 
What this perspective ignores is that pre-crisis growth in the US and the global economy was based in part on an unsustainable configuration . 
Returning to that model is neither likely nor wise . 
While a relatively high and sustainable growth pattern can be achieved , it will take time . 
And it will occur ( if it does ) in a global economy with fundamentally different structural and regulatory characteristics . 
Waiting around for the advanced countries to right their ships so that we can all go back to the old normal is neither good policy nor a good bet . 
What is needed is coordinated restructuring and policy setting . 
That is hard to do when the US , the largest fiscally unified economy , is focused elsewhere .
