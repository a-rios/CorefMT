Dying for Free Trade 
Last year was a bad one for free trade . 
The Doha Round was supposed to make agriculture the centerpiece of negotiations to assuage the deep frustrations of developing countries . 
But , instead of breathing life into free trade in food , rural protectionism in rich countries seems to have killed the Doha Round - and , with it , potentially the whole multilateral trading regime . 
Agriculture has always presented the greatest challenge to free-trade doctrine and its promise of empowering the poor , for it is one of the most distorted areas of global trade . 
In 2004 , OECD countries spent more than four times their official development aid budgets on support for domestic farmers . 
In 2000 , the World Bank estimated that OECD agricultural protectionism cost the developing world $ 20 billion in welfare losses annually . 
Most galling , agriculture is a small and declining part of these &quot; rich club &quot; economies , and the richer and larger they are , the less significant agriculture is and the more resources are wasted on rural welfare . 
The practical challenge comes from agriculture &apos;s two advantages that insulate the rural sector from global market forces and turn even the most urbane , liberal politicians into its defenders . 
First , farming is geographically concentrated and farmers vote on agricultural policy above everything else , greatly enhancing the power of their votes - something that few , if any , urban consumers do . 
Second , protectionists have developed populist but logically questionable arguments that agricultural staples cannot be treated as tradable commodities subject to competition . 
Domestic farmers are portrayed as irreplaceable defenders of the social fabric and traditional values . 
On top of this , farming is presented as analogous to the military . 
Just as no government should outsource national security to untrustworthy foreigners , nor should any government permit the national food supply to rely on the supposed vagaries of foreign production . 
We accept paying a high and inefficient cost for national defense against what are often unknown enemies . 
Agricultural protectionists , through the language of food security and food self-sufficiency , claim that the same holds true for food . 
Japan has long been the paragon of rich-country agricultural protectionism . 
Its electoral system heavily favors rural voters . 
Farmers are well organized politically , and the Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry , and Fisheries ( MAFF ) has been a fierce defender of agricultural protectionism . 
Food security arguments resonate well in Japan , owing to memories of shortages during World War II and its aftermath . 
Ironically , Japan now offers a seed of hope for agricultural liberalization . 
The country &apos;s declining number of voters are lining up in favor of cheaper , imported food . 
Japan &apos;s demographic crisis is particularly acute in rural areas , where the average age of farmers is surpassing the retirement age . 
One enterprising village recently sold itself entirely to a waste disposal firm after it could no longer find any young people willing to return to bucolic bliss . 
Despite decades of immense government support , Japan &apos;s rural sector cannot even aspire to feed its declining population . 
Food self-sufficiency in staple cereals now stands at 28 % on a calorie supply basis , with no signs of growth . 
Farming , fishing , and forestry now account for less that 2 % of the total economy and less than 4 % of the workforce . 
The rapid aging and decline of Japan &apos;s rural population is fundamentally shifting Japan &apos;s approach to food . 
The MAFF is wistfully abandoning the cherished goal of food autarky . 
Its latest strategic plan calls for a self-sufficiency ratio of 45 % by 2015 and focuses instead on &quot; securing the stability of food imports &quot; through diversification and free-trade agreements . 
For decades , the MAFF &apos;s power meant that Japan &apos;s trading partners would not even contemplate free-trade discussions . 
Now the Japanese government , supporting the reformers at the MAFF , is using free-trade deals and negotiations with competitive exporters like Thailand and Australia to pursue agricultural consolidation . 
Even more galling for the MAFF &apos;s traditionalists , their food security argument is being turned on its head . 
Leveraging Japan &apos;s inability to feed itself , trade negotiators now argue that Japan needs to open up to imports or face being shut out of global food markets by fast-growing giants like China . 
Deepening these fears , China &apos;s free-trade deals in Southeast Asia give agriculture priority . 
While the logic of this argument is shaky , it taps into deep Japanese concerns about China &apos;s rise . 
The rich countries face a similar demographic challenge , while the rest of the world waits to see how their responses will reshape the global economy . 
Japan , due to its advanced demographic decline , is the bellwether , yet other traditional rural protectionists like France and South Korea are not far behind . 
France now has half the number of farmers it had 20 years ago . 
That is good news for farmers and consumers around the world . 
Rich and aging countries may finally become promoters , rather than opponents , of free trade in food .
