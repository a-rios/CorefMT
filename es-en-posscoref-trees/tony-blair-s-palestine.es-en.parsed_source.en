Tony Blair &apos;s Palestine 
LONDON -Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has many positive attributes , including great charm . 
He will need all his skills to address the bewildering range of global tasks that he has taken on since being shoehorned out of office by his dour successor , Gordon Brown . 
His initial daytime job , after running Britain , was to bring peace to the Middle East by helping establish the governing institutions of a Palestinian state . 
Since then , Blair has become an adviser to banks ( which need all the advice they can get these days ) , is touring the world to promote a sensible policy on global warming and climate change , has created a foundation to help bridge the divide between different faiths , and will lecture on religion at Yale . 
All that is left is to restore the fortunes of England &apos;s national football and cricket teams . 
Perhaps he could fit that in on weekends . 
But Blair has just made a useful comment on Palestine and Israel , which deserves to be taken seriously . 
Throughout the long years of this bloody tragedy , we have tried to inch our way to a settlement through confidence-building measures or , in the case of the long dead &quot; Road Map , &quot; through pushing both parties to take parallel steps towards an agreement . 
Some observers , not least hard-headed Israeli peace campaigners , have suggested a different approach . 
You will never succeed , they say , if you try to bob and weave your way slowly towards an end game . 
Instead , you should jump straight into a final deal . 
And , since you won &apos;t get the two sides to agree to it , you &apos;ll have to impose it from the outside . 
But that ambitious outcome is easier described than achieved . 
While Israeli public opinion has usually appeared to run well ahead of its political leaders in the approach to peace , it is difficult to see how one could act over their heads . 
They need to be pushed and shoved into a successful negotiation . 
What would it mean to go straight to Palestinian statehood ? 
Presumably , Blair is not proposing to the Palestinians the creation of a state before an agreement is reached on final borders . 
There cannot be a Palestinian state without dealing with West Bank settlements . 
If you don &apos;t believe me , just visit the West Bank and see , for example , how the proposed suburban Israeli development of East Jerusalem stabs through the heart of Palestinian territory towards the Dead Sea . 
How can you have a viable state carved up by fences , military roads , and barbed wire ? 
Any Palestinian state should be within the 1967 borders ( as adjusted through negotiation ) . 
Peace activists on both sides solved that in the Geneva initiative . 
Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak came close to doing so at Camp David almost eight years ago . 
Moreover , a Palestinian state would not only comprise the West Bank and Gaza , but presumably would also have to accommodate the principal political parties in each area . Attempts to destroy Hamas - whether politically or physically - have not worked and cannot work . 
The Americans and Europeans committed a major error in conspiring to destroy the Fatah-Hamas national unity government , which was created largely thanks to the diplomacy of Saudi Arabia and other Arab League countries . 
I hope that Blair is saying that to his American friends . 
His greatest achievement was the peace deal in Northern Ireland . 
That historic triumph depended on bringing in Sinn Fein politicians - leaders of the Irish Republican movement who in many cases could not be distinguished from the IRA , which bombed , shot , and maimed civilians in pursuit of its political goals . 
Why should what worked in Northern Ireland - indeed , what was pressed on Britain by the United States - be unthinkable in the Middle East ? 
I abhor any and every terrorist act , by Hamas or anyone else . 
I have had friends killed by terrorists . 
But since when were sentiment and moral denunciation sufficient ingredients of a policy ? 
And when did a disproportionate military response to terrorism ever work ? 
The third challenge in establishing a Palestinian state is to create the institutions of statehood : hospitals , ports , airports , roads , courts , police stations , tax offices , and government archives . 
When I was a European Commissioner , we provided funds from European taxpayers to pay for these things . 
How did destroying driving licenses in Palestine preserve Israeli security ? 
How was it preserved by digging up runways , uprooting olive trees , and fouling wells ? 
A Palestinian state will need to be built from the bottom up . 
And what is built should not be destroyed . 
I want to see - and I &apos;m sure Blair does , too - a peaceful Palestinian state next door to a secure Israel in a region united in prosperity and stability . 
Maybe Blair has hit on how this can be achieved .
