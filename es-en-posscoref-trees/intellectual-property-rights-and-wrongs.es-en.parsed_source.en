Intellectual-Property Rights and Wrongs 
Last October , the General Assembly of the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) decided to consider what a development-oriented intellectual property regime might look like . 
The move was little noticed , but , in some ways , it was as important as the World Trade Organization &apos;s decision that the current round of trade negotiations be devoted to development . 
Both decisions acknowledge that the current rules of the international economic game reflect the interests of the advanced industrial countries - especially of their big corporations - more than the interests of the developing world . 
Without intellectual property protection , incentives to engage in certain types of creative endeavors would be weakened . 
But there are high costs associated with intellectual property . 
Ideas are the most important input into research , and if intellectual property slows down the ability to use others &quot; ideas , then scientific and technological progress will suffer . 
In fact , many of the most important ideas - for example , the mathematics that underlies the modern computer or the theories behind atomic energy or lasers - are not protected by intellectual property . 
Academics spend considerable energy freely disseminating their research findings . 
I am pleased when someone uses my ideas on asymmetric information - though I do appreciate them giving me some credit . 
The growth of the &quot; open source &quot; movement on the Internet shows that not just the most basic ideas , but even products of enormous immediate commercial value can be produced without intellectual property protection . 
By contrast , an intellectual property regime rewards innovators by creating a temporary monopoly power , allowing them to charge far higher prices than they could if there were competition . 
In the process , ideas are disseminated and used less than they would be otherwise . 
The economic rationale for intellectual property is that faster innovation offsets the enormous costs of such inefficiencies . 
But it has become increasingly clear that excessively strong or badly formulated intellectual property rights may actually impede innovation - and not just by increasing the price of research . 
Monopolists may have much less incentive to innovate than they would if they had to compete . 
Modern research has shown that the great economist Joseph Schumpeter was wrong in thinking that competition in innovation leads to a succession of firms . 
In fact , a monopolist , once established , may be hard to dislodge , as Microsoft has so amply demonstrated . 
Indeed , once established , a monopoly can use its market power to squelch competitors , as Microsoft so amply demonstrated in the case of the Netscape Web browser . 
Such abuses of market power discourage innovation . 
Moreover , so-called &quot; patent thickets &quot; - the fear that some advance will tread on pre-existing patents , of which the innovator may not even be aware - may also discourage innovation . 
After the pioneering work of the Wright brothers and the Curtis brothers , overlapping patent claims thwarted the development of the airplane , until the United States government finally forced a patent pool as World War I loomed . 
Today , many in the computer industry worry that such a patent thicket may impede software development . 
The creation of any product requires many ideas , and sorting out their relative contribution to the outcome - let alone which ones are really new - can be nearly impossible . 
Consider a drug based on traditional knowledge , say , of an herb well known for its medicinal properties . 
How important is the contribution of the American firm that isolates the active ingredient ? 
Pharmaceutical companies argue that they should be entitled to a full patent , paying nothing to the developing country from which the traditional knowledge was taken , even though the country preserves the biodiversity without which the drug would never have come to market . 
Not surprisingly , developing countries see things differently . 
Society has always recognized that other values may trump intellectual property . The need to prevent excessive monopoly power has led anti-trust authorities to require compulsory licensing ( as the US government did with the telephone company AT &amp; T ) . 
When America faced an anthrax threat in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , officials issued a compulsory license for Cipro , the best-known antidote . 
Unfortunately , the trade negotiators who framed the intellectual-property agreement of the Uruguay trade round of the early 1990 &quot; s ( TRIP &apos;s ) were either unaware of all of this , or more likely , uninterested . 
I served on the Clinton administration &apos;s Council of Economic Advisors at the time , and it was clear that there was more interest in pleasing the pharmaceutical and entertainment industries than in ensuring an intellectual-property regime that was good for science , let alone for developing countries . 
I suspect that most of those who signed the agreement did not fully understand what they were doing . 
If they had , would they have willingly condemned thousands of AIDS sufferers to death because they might no longer be able to get affordable generic drugs ? 
Had the question been posed in this way to parliaments around the world , I believe that TRIP &apos;s would have been soundly rejected . 
Intellectual property is important , but the appropriate intellectual-property regime for a developing country is different from that for an advanced industrial country . 
The TRIP &apos;s scheme failed to recognize this . 
In fact , intellectual property should never have been included in a trade agreement in the first place , at least partly because its regulation is demonstrably beyond the competency of trade negotiators . 
Besides , an international organization already exists to protect intellectual property . 
Hopefully , in WIPO &apos;s reconsideration of intellectual property regimes , the voices of the developing world will be heard more clearly than it was in the WTO negotiations ; hopefully , WIPO will succeed in outlining what a pro-developing intellectual property regime implies ; and hopefully , WTO will listen : the aim of trade liberalization is to boost development , not hinder it .
