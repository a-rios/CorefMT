China &apos;s Great Migration 
BEIJING - China &apos;s Henan province has a population of about 100 million - larger than that of most countries . 
In China &apos;s administrative system , a province is at the highest level of sub-national government , followed by counties , cities , and townships . 
Thus , it is difficult to overestimate the importance of regional issues - particularly inter-regional disparities - for China &apos;s politics . 
China is divided by nature . 
Among the large continental countries , including India and Brazil , only China has a small segment of coastline but vast interior regions . 
When the main object of human consumption was food , this was not a problem , because what mattered was land and water . 
Though such disparities can , of course , have other causes as well , geography does seem to explain a lot . 
First of all , it explains why China &apos;s coastal regions developed earlier and faster after the country launched its market reforms and opened to the world . 
It was not &quot; preferential &quot; policies or skewed resource allocation by the government that caused China &apos;s coastal cities to boom , but rather their proximity to the ocean , which was and remains the cheapest way to move resources and products . 
China may have more and larger high-tech and service industries - sectors that do not depend so heavily on transport - in the future . 
Thus , regional disparities in terms of economic prosperity may never narrow ; indeed , they could often widen . 
Lanzhou , the capital city of Gansu province in the west , might never catch up with Suzhou , a well-known manufacturing base near Shanghai . 
China &apos;s effort to develop more evenly , despite the permanent in-built advantages of the coast , takes the form of two-way traffic in capital and labor between coastal and interior regions . 
Financial transfers flow from the coast to interior regions , via government fiscal allocation or other mechanisms , to improve infrastructure , including transport . 
Such investments may not be as profitable as in other regions , but they should be regarded as public goods intended to equalize conditions for growth . 
China &apos;s central government has attempted this for the past 10 years through its &quot; Western Development Program . &quot; 
Of course , the government &apos;s efforts alone cannot entice industrial investors to &quot; go West , &quot; because public infrastructure spending cannot overcome all problems . 
Without a road , you cannot transport resources and finished goods . 
The other &quot; traffic &quot; may , in some ways , be even more important . 
This is the labor that flows in the opposite direction , from west to east , promoting the only economic equality a country can ever achieve - equality of per capita income , not of GDP . 
A coastal city that produces more GDP and boasts higher productivity and wages will attract more people to share in its prosperity until &quot; marginal productivity &quot; decreases . 
As some people migrate to the coast , fewer people will share the interior regions &quot; resources , causing their per capita income to increase . 
This is why mobility is so important to achieving greater social equality . 
Most developed countries underwent great domestic migrations as they modernized , with 80 % of their populations eventually re-allocated to coastal regions . 
China is experiencing this process now . 
If China &apos;s authorities continue to encourage domestic migration , the problem of regional disparities will eventually be solved . 
The same could be said of the global North-South disparity . 
Some people used to argue that as long as one factor of production - i.e. , capital - could move freely , the world could be equalized . 
But I believe that other factors are also essential One-factor mobility may work well in a theoretical model , but in the dynamic real world , if the income gap cannot be narrowed rapidly enough , conditions that serve to enlarge the gap - such as unfavorable geography - may come to dominate . 
The good news for China now is that the new national Five-Year Plan for 2010-2015 calls for the government not only to encourage domestic migration between regions , but also to improve the conditions for rural people to move and settle in the cities . 
The infamous &quot; Hukou &quot; system ( the resident registration system that restricts migration ) may not be abolished overnight , but will be phased out step by step . 
Of course , migration and urbanization will produce social problems and conflict . 
Otherwise , the country will remain divided forever .
