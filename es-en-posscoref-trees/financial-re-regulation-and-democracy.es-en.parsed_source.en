Financial Re-Regulation and Democracy 
NEW YORK - It has taken almost two years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers , and more than three years since the beginning of the global recession brought on by the financial sector &apos;s misdeeds for the United States and Europe finally to reform financial regulation . 
Perhaps we should celebrate the regulatory victories in both Europe and the United States . 
After all , there is almost universal agreement that the crisis the world is facing today - and is likely to continue to face for years - is a result of the excesses of the deregulation movement begun under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan 30 years ago . 
Unfettered markets are neither efficient nor stable . 
But the battle - and even the victory - has left a bitter taste . 
Most of those responsible for the mistakes - whether at the US Federal Reserve , the US Treasury , Britain &apos;s Bank of England and Financial Services Authority , the European Commission and European Central Bank , or in individual banks , have not owned up to their failures . 
Banks that wreaked havoc on the global economy have resisted doing what needs to be done . 
Worse still , they have received support from the Fed , which one might have expected to adopt a more cautious stance , given the scale of its past mistakes and the extent to which it is evident that it reflects the interests of the banks that it was supposed to regulate . 
This is important not just as a matter of history and accountability : much is being left up to regulators . 
And that leaves open the question : can we trust them ? 
To me , the answer is an unambiguous no , which is why we need to &quot; hard-wire &quot; more of the regulatory framework . 
The usual approach - delegating responsibility to regulators to work out the details - will not suffice . 
And thatraises another question : whom can we trust ? 
On complex economic matters , trust had been vested in bankers ( after all , if they make so much money , they obviously know something ! ) and in regulators , who often ( but not always ) came from the markets . 
But the events of recent years have shown that bankers can make megabucks , even as they undermine the economy and impose massive losses on their own firms . 
Bankers have also shown themselves to be &quot; ethically challenged . &quot; 
A court of law will decide whether Goldman Sachs &quot; behavior - betting against products that it created - was illegal . 
But the court of public opinion has already rendered its verdict on the far more relevant question of the ethics of that behavior . 
That Goldman &apos;s CEO saw himself as doing &quot; God &apos;s work &quot; as his firm sold short products that it created , or disseminated scurrilous rumors about a country where it was serving as an &quot; adviser , &quot; suggests a parallel universe , with different mores and values . 
As always , the &quot; devil is in the details , &quot; and financial-sector lobbyists have labored hard to make sure that the new regulations &quot; details work to their employers &quot; benefit . 
As a result , it will likely be a long time before we can assess the success of whatever law the US Congress ultimately enacts . 
But the criteria for judgment are clear : the new law must curb the practices that jeopardized the entire global economy , and reorient the financial system towards its proper tasks - managing risk , allocating capital , providing credit ( especially to small- and medium-sized enterprises ) , and operating an efficient payments system . 
We should toast the likely successes : some form of financial-product safety commission will be established ; more derivative trading will move to exchanges and clearing houses from the shadows of the murky &quot; bespoke &quot; market ; and some of the worst mortgage practices will be restricted . 
Moreover , it looks likely that the outrageous fees charged for every debit transaction - a kind of tax that goes not for any public purpose but to fill the banks &quot; coffers - will be curtailed . 
But the likely failures are equally noteworthy : the problem of too-big-to-fail banks is now worse than it was before the crisis . 
Increased resolution authority will help , but only a little : in the last crisis , US government &quot; blinked , &quot; failed to use the powers that it had , and needlessly bailed out shareholders and bondholders - all because it feared that doing otherwise would lead to economic trauma . 
As long as there are banks that are too big to fail , government will most likely &quot; blink &quot; again . 
It is no surprise that the big banks succeeded in stopping some essential reforms ; what was a surprise was a provision in the US Senate &apos;s bill that banned government-insured entities from underwriting risky derivatives . 
Such government-insured underwriting distorts the market , giving big banks a competitive advantage , not necessarily because they are more efficient , but because they are &quot; too big to fail . &quot; 
The Fed &apos;s defense of the big banks - that it is important for borrowers to be able to hedge their risks - reveals the extent to which it has been captured . 
The legislation was not intended to ban derivatives , but only to bar implicit government guarantees , subsidized by taxpayers ( remember the $ 180 billion AIG bailout ? ) , which are not a natural or inevitable byproduct of lending . 
There are many ways of curbing big banks &quot; excesses . 
A strong version of the so-called Volcker Rule ( designed to force government-insured banks to return to their core mission of lending ) might work . 
But the US government would be remiss to leave things as they are . 
The Senate bill &apos;s provision on derivatives is a good litmus test : the Obama administration and the Fed , in opposing these restrictions , have clearly lined up on the side of big banks . 
If effective restrictions on the derivatives business of government-insured banks ( whether actually insured , or effectively insured because they are too big to fail ) survive in the final version of the bill , the general interest might indeed prevail over special interests , and democratic forces over moneyed lobbyists . 
But if , as most pundits predict , these restrictions are deleted , it will be a sad day for democracy - and a sadder day for prospects for meaningful financial reform .
