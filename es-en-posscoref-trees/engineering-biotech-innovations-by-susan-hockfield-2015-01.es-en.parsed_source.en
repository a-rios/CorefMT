A New Century &apos;s New Technologies 
DAVOS - This year &apos;s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos , Switzerland , addresses threats to geopolitical stability and human life , and seeks ways to accelerate the design of more effective political , economic , and technological tools to address them . 
Among this generation &apos;s most daunting challenges are food , water , and energy shortages ; climate change and rising sea levels ; and the spread of new , drug-resistant diseases . 
Humanity has faced threats to its existence and the health of the planet before , yet we have managed to avoid the apocalypse , or at least postpone it , through ingenuity and invention . 
This year &apos;s Davos meeting will offer a glimpse of where the next life- , planet- and economy-saving discoveries and products will come from , and where we should invest our talents and treasure to fuel the next generation of transformative technologies . 
An accelerating convergence of the biological , physical , and engineering sciences promises a stunning array of new technological solutions . 
Imagine a coal-fueled power plant that emits only water and clean air . 
Inside the plant , designer yeast cells transform the carbon dioxide released during the coal &apos;s combustion into raw materials for floor tiles and other construction supplies . 
Or imagine a simple and inexpensive urine test that can diagnose cancer , eliminating the need for a surgical biopsy . 
And , when cancer treatment is needed , its toxic punch hits cancer cells selectively , with far fewer damaging side effects . 
Or imagine a future with plentiful food and fuel crops . 
Through improved seed stocks and more efficient water management , we can have crops that require less water , grow at higher density , and thrive in wider temperature ranges . 
And data-driven agriculture supply chains will move them more effectively to the market . 
These advances will enable us to feed and provide power - at a lower economic and environmental cost - to the anticipated 2050 population of nine billion people . 
These and other innovations are emerging from the convergence of biology and engineering that is now upon us . 
A new generation of scientists , engineers , and clinicians , educated more broadly than their predecessors , speak the languages of both and are working together in unprecedented ways . 
They are conversing across disciplines - not only engineering and biology , but also chemistry , physics , mathematics , and computation - and setting new paths for innovation , from initial discovery to the launch of advanced applications in the marketplace . 
The technologies on which many of us depend today arose from a parallel convergence of discoveries in physics and engineering in the early twentieth century . 
In 1900 , the world did not have ready access to electricity , automobiles and aviation , or telecommunications . 
In much of the world , we now take these conveniences for granted ; indeed , we regard them as necessities . 
What began as esoteric explorations of the workings of the physical world - the nature of electromagnetism and the atomic structure of matter , for example - became , in the hands of inventors and innovators , telecommunications , new drugs , medical imaging and devices , nuclear power , the computer chip , and the Internet . 
There are now more connected mobile devices than there are people on the planet . 
The products of electronic and digital industries will continue to expand their impact , with &quot; big data , &quot; the &quot; Internet of things , &quot; and the &quot; industrial Internet &quot; becoming increasingly prevalent . 
Beyond the extension of these twentieth-century technologies , we can also anticipate a new set of transformational industries - as yet nameless - as we advance into the new millennium . 
At the same time , just as the twentieth century &apos;s convergence of physics and engineering transformed our lives , the accelerating convergence of biology and engineering is driving unprecedented discoveries that promise to create another platform for innovation , the rise of new industries , and economic growth . 
The manufacture of fuels and pharmaceuticals already relies on purpose-developed microbes that create sophisticated biological products . 
New manufacturing processes will incorporate specially designed microbes and computer-characterized compounds into an array of products . 
Likewise , the dramatic reduction in the cost of gene sequencing , from roughly $ 40 million per human genome in 2003 to about $ 5,000 today , together with a rapid increase in computational power , is boosting the speed , accuracy , and robustness of medical diagnostic tests . 
That promises not only more timely and effective therapies for cancer , but also similar advances against other currently intractable diseases . 
The industries and economic drivers of the twenty-first century will arise from the increasingly combined efforts of biology and engineering . 
It is this convergence that will help deliver the technological solutions needed to supply enough clean energy , food , and water , as well as better health , to sustain the world &apos;s nine billion people in 2050 .
