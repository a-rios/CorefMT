Peace , Not Process 
RAMALLAH - The United States should stop pushing for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process . 
Doing so might be the best way to achieve peace - a paradox that reflects the huge gap between a peace process and achieving genuine peace . 
Make no mistake : this is not a call to arms or an appeal for a violent uprising . 
Peace between the conflicting parties east of the Mediterranean and west of the Jordan river can and must be achieved through negotiations . 
For Israel , an occupying power whose people enjoy democratic civilian authority and a GDP tens times that of the people it is denying basic rights of freedom and independence , photo opportunities provided by meeting and greeting Palestinian leaders has replaced achieving peace . 
A serious look back at the 17 years since Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn is revealing . 
The number of illegal Jewish settlements and settlers has more than doubled in the areas Israel occupied in 1967 . 
Negotiators have parsed every possible solution to the permanent-status issues of Jerusalem , borders , settlements , refugees , and economic relations . 
Leaders of the world &apos;s superpowers , United Nations officials , the Elders , and tens of people of goodwill have offered their goodwill offices and their services to bring about peace . 
All to no avail . 
The US efforts , led by Special Envoy George Mitchell , have shown clearly that the current ruling coalition in Israel is incapable of doing the minimum required for peace . 
The Obama administration staked its reputation on getting Israelis and Palestinians to agree at least on security and borders . 
The results are mixed , at best . 
Palestinians complied with all Israeli and international requirements for security , while Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s Israeli government , which gives lip-service to the two-state solution , has yet to elucidate where Israel &apos;s borders will be . 
Meanwhile , the Israeli government wants to continue building settlements in occupied areas , in total violation of international law and the minimum requirements for peace detailed in the &quot; roadmap &quot; sponsored by the Quartet ( the US , UN , European Union , and Russia ) . 
The US tried to bribe the Israelis - with $ 3 billion in fighter jets and political support at the UN - into suspending settlement activities for three months . 
Instead , Netanyahu stuck his fingers in America &apos;s eyes , counting on the Republicans &quot; mid-term election victory to help him afterwards . 
Not only did Israel &apos;s leaders reject the world community &apos;s requests , but they had the chutzpah to claim that they had convinced the US to drop this requirement for the resumption of talks . 
Withdrawal by the US from the current push to restart negotiations would send a clear message that bad behavior will not be tolerated , and would encourage Israelis , who overwhelmingly want peace , to force a change in their own government &apos;s position . 
Israel &apos;s Labor Party has consistently said that it would bolt from the current coalition if peace talks were halted . 
This would force at least a change in the coalition &apos;s makeup ( possibly the replacement of the right-wing Yisrael Beitenu , headed by Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , with the more moderate Kadima , headed by Tzipi Livni , Lieberman &apos;s predecessor as foreign minister ) . 
Public-opinion polls have consistently shown that the majority of Israelis and Palestinians want peace ( not a peace process ) based on a two-state solution . 
Almost every learned pundit , expert , or politician in the Middle East and around the world knows pretty much what a solution to the conflict would look like - a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with slight land swaps and an equitable negotiated solution of the Palestinian refugee issue . 
One group of respected Israelis and Palestinians , the Geneva Group , even drew up a peace plan that tackles every possible negotiating point honestly and fairly . 
So what is needed is not negotiations , but political will . 
The Palestinians , for their part , have the necessary will . 
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad &apos;s latest chapter in his two-year plan - the &quot; home stretch to freedom &quot; - will be complete in August 2011 . 
In Fayyad &apos;s vision , Palestinians , who bear the brunt of the occupation and are in a greater hurry than the Israelis are to be free of it , are to accept a peace strategy that aims at realizing statehood . 
Once the institutions of the Palestinian state are in place , the will of the people , coupled with world support , will nonviolently overcome all efforts at denying Palestinians their right to self-determination . 
In the meantime , there is no need for a process that has no chance of accomplishing peace .
