Hamas in Power 
The victory of the fundamentalist Hamas in the Palestinian elections will have far-reaching consequences for the region , some totally unexpected . 
Two aspects , however , are already visible . 
The Hamas victory is , first and foremost , an indication of the total failure of the traditional Palestinian leadership to create a body politic . 
Palestine is not yet a state , but it is already a failed one . 
Since the Oslo Accords of l993 between Israel and the PLO , the Palestinians enjoyed limited transitional autonomy . 
To be sure , the new Palestinian Authority ( PA ) took power under difficult conditions , but which new liberation movement does not face serious challenges when it finally must govern ? 
The PA had an opportunity to lay the institutional foundations for a functioning state . 
It created what is called in Arabic a Mukhabarat ( security services ) state , very much like what is prevalent in almost all Arab countries - Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia , republics and monarchies alike . 
The vacuum that the PA left elsewhere , including the social sphere , was filled by Hamas . 
Indeed , its popularity is due not only to its fundamentalist Islamic ideology and its commitment to the destruction of Israel . 
The high esteem in which Palestinians hold Hamas also grew out of what Hamas actually did for them while the PA squandered its resources . 
It was not only the endemic corruption of the official Palestinian leadership that turned so many Palestinians from it . 
Hamas set up better schools , kindergartens , cr√®ches for mothers , medical centers , welfare services , and programs for youth and women - all of this in addition giving special grants to the families of suicide bombers . 
In the elections , Hamas received its dividend for doing what the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority failed to do . 
It is still an open question whether Hamas in government will become more pragmatic and less committed to terrorism : it certainly is a possibility , and one should not prejudge the outcome . 
But nor , on the other hand , is it clear that the existing organs of the Palestinian Authority - especially the security services at its disposal - will allow a peaceful transfer of power . 
Indeed , no such precedent exists : there has never been a peaceful transfer of power in any of the Arab League &apos;s 22 member states . 
Israel &apos;s response to Hamas &apos;s victory will obviously be complicated by its own elections on March 28 , and by a government headed by an interim prime minister , Ehud Olmert , owing to Sharon &apos;s incapacitation just weeks after leaving Likud and founding a new , centrist party , Kadima ( Forward ) . 
Despite Sharon &apos;s absence , Kadima maintains its lead in public opinion polls - the most recent gave it 44 of the Knesset &apos;s 120 seats , compared to 21 for Labor and 14 for the right-wing rump-Likud , under Binyamin Netanyahu . 
Kadima &apos;s success is due to Sharon &apos;s main innovation in Israeli politics : the successful unilateral disengagement from Gaza . 
That withdrawal was based on the conviction that the gaps between the Israeli and Palestinian positions are too wide to enable meaningful negotiations . 
Hence , Israel must start deciding the future boundaries of the country unilaterally , hoping for eventual negotiations at a later stage . 
This is also the line adopted by Olmert . 
This leaves further unilateral Israeli moves - such as a partial set of withdrawals from selected areas in the West Bank - as the only feasible option . 
Realistic conflict management will replace utopian hopes for conflict resolution . 
In a region full of paradoxes , the Hamas victory may have added another one : usually , when extremists on one side become stronger , it plays into the hands of extremists on the other side , producing a dangerous spiral effect . 
In this case , however , the victory of the extremist Hamas may strengthen not the extremists of Likud , but , surprisingly , the more moderate centrists of Kadima . 
One cannot be certain of such an outcome , of course , but it is now the best that one can realistically hope for .
