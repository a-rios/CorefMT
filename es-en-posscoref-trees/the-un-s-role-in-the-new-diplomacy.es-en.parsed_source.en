The UN \ u0027s Role in the New Diplomacy 
As international diplomacy tackles issues in which science and technology play a central role , the United Nations ( UN ) risks being relegated to the sidelines . 
The influence and effectiveness of diplomats and international civil servants will increasingly depend on the extent to which they can mobilize scientific and technical expertise in their work . 
This need not require the UN to acquire extensive in-house scientific competence , but the organization - especially the office of the secretary general - must learn to tap advisory services to identify , mobilize , and use the best available expertise . 
Although a large number of UN agencies , programs , and treaties rely on scientific and technological expertise for their work , they are not designed to receive systematic science advice as a key component of effective performance . 
In most cases - no surprise - science is used in the UN to support special interests and political agendas that do not necessarily advance the goals of the organization . 
The UN was founded and grew to prominence during the Cold War , when external aggression was the core issue . 
Today , issues such as infectious diseases , environmental degradation , electronic crimes , weapons of mass destruction , and the impact of new technologies are of importance . 
In the past , these were the concerns of individual nations ; now they have grown to international stature . 
The UN &apos;s capacity to deal with these questions must also grow . 
The UN includes organizations that cater to a wide range of jurisdictions but not to the growing community of science advisors . 
Even agencies such as the UN Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) have done little to provide a platform for the world &apos;s science advisors . 
Specialized agencies such as UNESCO , the Food and Agriculture Organization , the World Health Organization , and the UN Industrial Development Organization relate to the UN secretary general &apos;s office through a bureaucratic hierarchy blithely unresponsive to timeliness . 
Even UN programs that deal with science-based issues - say , the environment - have not placed knowledge at the core of their operations . 
They fail to take into account the long-term 
Much attention in these programs is devoted to territorial aggrandizement , not to the role of knowledge in global governance . 
They are Cold War vestiges . 
Moreover , national bodies that provide scientific advice lack a focal point in the UN system . 
But as scientific and technological issues start to dominate global affairs , ways must be found to provide a forum for global consensus building on scientific issues . 
The UN &apos;s ability to convene states and other actors makes it a good candidate for the task . 
Such a forum will not be a substitute for the activities carried out under various specialized UN agencies , but it will support the work of national academies as well as other science advisory bodies . 
International organizations that fail to take advantage of these developments may lose credibility and importance . 
The power to rally political support around specific issues might shift from UN organizations to technical bodies linked to various expert communities . 
Organizations linked by new communications technologies , for example , are increasing in influence . 
Such organizations engage in virtual diplomacy and try to bypass the traditional structures used by UN agencies . 
The campaign to ban land-mines , say , relied heavily on Internet communication . 
Environmental groups also use the Internet and the Web as tools for advocacy . 
Knowledge-based organizations are forming a wide range of alliances with the media and play an important role in influencing public opinion as well as diplomacy . 
A number of international negotiations on issues such as bio-safety and organic pollutants benefit from such alliances . 
Knowledge-based institutions are also better equipped to use the expanding global information infrastructure to influence diplomacy . 
Modern international diplomacy is more and more dependent on groups that make rules , set standards , and collect technical data . 
In the environmental field , new institutions are emerging that focus their work on harmonizing criteria and indicators , especially for use in programs that certify sustainable use of resources as in the case of forests and fisheries . 
Voluntary standards , such as those set by the International Standards Organization , are also gaining wider currency . 
For the scientific / technical community to play a larger role in international affairs the UN must make it easier for scientists to engage with it . 
The first step is for the secretary general to establish an office responsible for mobilizing scientific advice . 
This should not be mere symbolism but a serious step toward genuine reform in the UN &apos;s functions . 
It is not the size or complexity of the UN that is the problem ; its weakness lies in how it uses scientific and technical knowledge . 
The secretary general must re-equip the agency to adapt to the needs of the post-Cold War world . 
The scientific community needs to explore ways in which it can contribute effectively to international discussions . 
This can be achieved through the active participation of the Inter-Academy Panel and the Inter-Academy Council ( www.interacademies.net ) , established by over 80 national academies from around the world . 
These bodies need to forge closer partnership with the UN . 
Creation of a scientific / technical advisory office under the UN secretary general and of a coordinated platform for international science advice would play an important role in
