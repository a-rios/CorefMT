Roman Polanski &apos;s American Dream 
NEW YORK - What purpose is Switzerland serving by jailing the renowned Franco-Polish film director Roman Polanski on a 30-year-old warrant ? 
Arrested in 1977 for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles , Polanski pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of having unlawful sex with a minor . 
In the belief that his judge , the late Laurence J. Rittenband , would renege on his promise to let Polanski go free after serving 42 days in a California prison , the director fled the United States in 1978 before his final sentence was announced . 
Since then , the victim of Polanski &apos;s sex crime , Samantha Geimer , publicly forgave him , and expressed her wish for the charges to be withdrawn . 
So the reason to pursue the case now can have nothing to do with the rights or feelings of the victim . 
Nor is Polanski , a married father of two children with no other criminal record , likely to repeat his offenses . 
So the good of society is not served by forcing him to return to LA for a trial . 
Common sense would seem to leave no other conclusion than that his arrest - in a country that is obliged by treaty to extradite fugitives from US justice - serves no purpose at all . 
Yet the reactions to his sad plight , especially in France , have been oddly shrill . 
The French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , called Polanski &apos;s arrest &quot; sinister . &quot; 
Fr√©deric Mitterand , the culture minister , spoke of &quot; a scary America that has just shown its face . &quot; 
The former culture minister , Jack Lang , said the &quot; American system of justice had run amok . &quot; 
He added that it was like &quot; an infernal machine &quot; that advances &quot; blindly . &quot; 
Infernal or not , one might argue that justice is 
Polanski is a French citizen , and France is probably more indulgent towards its great artists than is the US . 
In 1943 , after a life of petty crime , the writer Jean Genet faced another prison sentence for theft , when Jean Cocteau declared that Genet was a literary genius . 
A French court , afraid of being too hard on a master of letters , reduced his sentence . 
Allowing recognized artists to get away with behavior that would not be tolerated in lesser men is a tribute France pays to superior talent . 
( Think of Oscar Wilde , who , like Polanski , found refuge in Paris . ) 
Perhaps this shows that France is more civilized than the US . 
The Americans , and to an extent the British , sometimes pay a different kind of tribute to famous artists . 
If they are caught misbehaving , they are often treated with particular harshness by courts and the popular media alike . 
This is a form of populism : it shows that even the most famous people are no better than us - and it sells newspapers ( or , nowadays , generates Web traffic ) . 
A particularly nasty example was the case of &quot; Fatty &quot; Arbuckle , a great comedy actor in Hollywood &apos;s silent-movie era . 
When a girl claimed to have been raped at one of his parties in 1921 , and then died a few days later , Arbuckle was pilloried in the press , and sentenced for rape and murder twice . 
It was not established until his third trial that he was innocent . 
The girl was a known blackmailer , and she died of causes that had nothing to do with her sex life . 
But Arbuckle &apos;s career was ruined , the victim of an ambitious prosecutor and a popular press that made money out of scandals . 
Polanski was not innocent , but he , too , may have fallen victim to the same combination of a judge &apos;s desire to bring down a famous man and a sensation-starved media . 
Perhaps the US is not as civilized as France , but it is more democratic . 
And , while equal treatment under the law obviously is one of democracy &apos;s more commendable features , the zeal of elected officials and mass media that pander to popular opinion in their treatment of talented artists is the ugly face of democracy . 
The great French observer of American democracy , Alexis de Tocqueville , saw this face of American democracy in the 1830 &quot; s , noting that &quot; Americans are so enamored of equality that they would rather be equal in slavery than unequal in freedom . &quot; 
The price for American-style democracy , he wrote , was artistic mediocrity and public conformity . 
This , too , was an exaggeration , but Tocqueville had a point . 
If too much deference to great artists is the mark of a society that has never quite escaped from its aristocratic roots , too little regard for them is a sign of narrow philistinism . 
So what should Polanski do ? 
In an ideal world , he would agree to return to Los Angeles , face his judges , and hope that his case will be dismissed . 
This is not an unlikely outcome . 
Americans can be generous . 
And he would then be free to go wherever he likes in the remaining years of his life . 
Alas , the world is not ideal , and Polanski might find the risk of incarceration in a US prison too high . 
If he decides to resist being tried in a court of law , like any other offender , this would be understandable . 
Whether it is admirable is another question .
