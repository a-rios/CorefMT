The History of Russia &apos;s Future 
MOSCOW - Strategic vision has never been a Russian attribute , and it certainly was absent in 2012 . 
Russia &apos;s vast territory continually seems to obscure for its leaders the need to plan for the future , while its seemingly infinite supply of natural resources convinces them that the country can handle any contingency . 
As a result , Russia is perpetually unprepared for the future . 
Indeed , just as its leaders failed to prepare for the fall of communism , the softening of the Russian economy shows that they are poorly equipped for the coming decades , which will be characterized by depleted resources , a declining population , and shrinking territory . 
Vladimir Putin &apos;s return to the presidency this year marked a new low for Russian strategic vision . 
After all , the past is the only future that Putin has ever wanted for the country . 
When the Soviet Union collapsed , the Kremlin lost not only control of vast portions of territory , but also half of the USSR &apos;s nearly 300 million people . 
Since then , the population has fallen by millions more , owing to Russia &apos;s high mortality rate , especially among men . 
Over the same period , the population of the United States has grown from 248 million to more than 300 million . 
Despite calls by the Russian public for reform - from modernization of the military and decrepit and corrupt legal institutions to diversification of the economy beyond natural-resource extraction and the military-industrial complex - Putin has stuck to his autocratic guns . 
When Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov tried to reform Russia &apos;s armed forces - by expanding the military &apos;s training in modern defense techniques , cutting costs , and boosting efficiency - he was replaced by Sergei Shoigu , Moscow &apos;s former governor and a die-hard Putin loyalist , who restored the outdated system . 
Even the army &apos;s new uniforms , which border on the comic with their eighteenth-century epaulets and World War II jackets , invoke the past , rather than provide the comfort and efficiency needed in modern warfare . 
More ominously , in a move reminiscent of Stalin , Putin has initiated a new anti-extremism law , according to which anyone can be accused of terrorism , espionage , being a foreign agent , or disseminating hatred . 
The law has proven to be a powerful tool in stifling dissent , which can include mass protests against election fraud , journalists working to expose corruption , or a librarian in Siberia fulfilling a patron &apos;s request for a banned book . 
Likewise , Putin &apos;s foreign policy remains mired in old Russian obsessions , beginning with restoring the empire in whatever form possible . 
In his effort to prove that losing its imperial status has not diminished Russia &apos;s global role , Putin has meddled relentlessly in international decisions , opposing sanctions against Iran and supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime , even as it slaughters its own citizens . 
Furthermore , while Russia has finally joined the World Trade Organization , doubts about the country &apos;s human-rights record persist . 
In 2009 , for example , Sergei Magnitsky , a lawyer , was accused of embezzlement after uncovering a fraudulent tax-refund scheme run by Russian officials . 
He died in prison after he was badly beaten and denied medical treatment . 
Similar laws have been adopted in Canada and across Western Europe . 
But , instead of admitting the crime and working to bring the perpetrators to justice , Russia &apos;s leaders have fought back , declaring that certain Europeans and Americans will , in turn , be barred from visiting Russia . 
Putin &apos;s unwillingness to heed popular discontent , and his failure to develop relations with the West during his 12 years in power , has backed him into a corner - and he is running out of ideas . 
In his most recent attempt to restore Russia &apos;s empire , he announced the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan . 
But , even here , the President is bullying the very leaders he seeks to woo . 
Given that Ukraine &apos;s participation would significantly enhance the union &apos;s legitimacy , Russia is using all available tactics - from lower gas prices to trade sanctions - to persuade its leaders to join . 
But Ukraine &apos;s President Viktor Yanukovych , who nurtures his own thuggish reputation , wants no part of it . 
Putin &apos;s effort to unify the ex-Soviet states is hardly the only initiative that exemplifies his flawed vision . 
In order to appeal to the leaders of East Asia &apos;s fast-growing economies - which Putin has called the most important factor for Russia &apos;s long-term success - the government spent billions of dollars this year to modernize the dilapidated port of Vladivostok . 
But , given that Asian leaders view Russia as little more than a natural-resource milk cow , it is far from clear that the investment will pay off , particularly given the absence of a comprehensive economic-development plan for the region . 
Putin hopes that harsh policies , at home and abroad , will allow him to maintain a stranglehold on Russia . 
As 2013 begins , Russia is back on the hamster wheel of history , treating the past as prologue - and thus wasting its resources and blighting its people &apos;s lives .
