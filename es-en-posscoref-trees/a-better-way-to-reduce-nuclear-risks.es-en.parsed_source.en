A Better Way to Reduce Nuclear Risks 
In 1977 , when I served in President Jimmy Carter &apos;s State Department , I was sent to India to dissuade that country &apos;s leaders from developing a nuclear bomb . 
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China . 
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe . 
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology . 
So far as we know , its leaders have kept their word . 
Some call Khan &apos;s network an effort to spread an &quot; Islamic bomb , &quot; but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran , it might better be termed a corrupt bomb . 
As events in Pakistan illustrate , the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence . 
Rather , it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons . 
That makes everyone less safe . 
Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi , Tokyo , Paris , or any city they chose . 
Now the world &apos;s attention is focussed on Iran , one recipient of Pakistani technology , as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal . 
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August , and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities . 
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy , but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium . 
Last October , Mohamed El Baradei , the head of the IAEA , announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures . 
In addition , after visits by the French , British , and German foreign ministers , Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program . 
Now it hints that it may resume enrichment , and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA . 
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty , it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes . 
Correct , because the NPT was born with a loophole . 
Even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections , it can legally accumulate enriched uranium ( or reprocessed plutonium ) under the guise of a peaceful energy program , and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice . 
If Iran did this , it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region , but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide . 
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons . 
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others . 
For these reasons , President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable . 
However , America &apos;s unilateral options are limited . 
Not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq , but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility , making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
Fortunately , there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent . 
In the mid-1970 &apos;s , many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities . 
Realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime , countries as diverse as the Soviet Union , France , Germany , and Japan formed a &quot; Nuclear Suppliers Group &quot; that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities . 
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it . 
Today , such countries should join together to offer Iran ( and others ) a deal . 
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel . 
For example , Russia , which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr , should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor &apos;s spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing . 
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council . 
The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace , and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions . 
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle . 
The pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear . 
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran &apos;s nuclear program . 
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services . 
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle . 
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan .
