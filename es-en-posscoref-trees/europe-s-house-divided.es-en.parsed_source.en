Europe \ u0027s House Divided 
Travelling from Berlin to Riga , Latvia &apos;s capital , is an eye-opener , because you get to see much of what is going wrong in European integration nowadays , just months before a further 10 states join the European Union , bringing it up to 25 from the original 6 . 
In Berlin before I left , Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had just welcomed his French and British colleagues for an exchange of views on the state and future of the Union . 
They were , the chiefs of the three largest members of the EU declared , only advancing proposals ; nothing could be further from their minds than to form a steering group to run the affairs of the enlarged Union , even if henceforth they would meet again at more or less regular intervals . 
If they really hoped to be believed , they should have listened to my interlocutors in the old city of Riga over the next few days . 
The three Baltic countries - Latvia , Estonia and Lithuania - will be among the smallest members when they join the Union on May 1 , 2004 , their total of 6 million people representing just 1.5 % of the then EU &apos;s population . 
Yet in marked contrast to the smaller nations that half a century earlier had joined France , Italy and Germany in launching the Union &apos;s fore-runner , the European Economic Community , the new arrivals are digging in their heels , demanding equal rights . 
Although as small countries they have learnt that the big ones usually get their way , they deeply resented the Berlin meeting because they see in it an attempt to limit their rights in the club they are about to join . 
The attitudes of the EU &apos;s big and small countries suggests that European integration &apos;s basic bargain is no longer regarded as fair . 
Europe , once the continent of power clashes and balances , became a community of law where big and small follow common rules to reach common decisions . 
Now , as Berlin and Riga suggest , power is returning as the trump card . 
The authority of the big countries derives not from their European credentials but from their power ranking ; the resentment of the smaller countries flows not from a different notion of integration but from their fear of losing out . 
What used to succeed as a win-win arrangement for big and small alike , now appears as a zero-sum game to many of them . 
There are explanations for this . 
In a Union of soon 25 members , it will be increasingly difficult to let everyone have a say and to generate consensus . 
On issues of foreign and security policy , moreover , agreement among the heavy-weights of the Union is essential for common action . 
Unless France , Britain and Germany agree , there is little chance the Union can act effectively on the international stage . 
At the same time , giving up sovereignty for the sake of integration is tough for the new members from Eastern Europe that only a decade ago wrested the right to govern themselves from Soviet control . 
Yet big and small alike must realize that their current disposition implies the slow suffocation of Europe &apos;s most exciting and successful experiment in bringing peace and prosperity to the old continent . 
To save it , the bigger ones will indeed have to take the lead . 
Only then will the smaller members feel adequately respected . 
Only then will all members again concentrate on getting things done for all instead of each of them on getting the most out of it for himself . 
There are many who believe that this kind of patient leadership is incompatible with a Union of 25 . 
France and Germany , acting together , were able for many years to provide this sort of leadership , and this should be recalled . 
Whenever they came out with a proposal , the others gave them credit that it was in the interest of the Union as a whole ; whenever there was a deadlock , the others looked for leadership from Paris and Bonn / Berlin to overcome it . 
In the past , German governments rightly took pride in being seen by the smaller members as their best partner , essential for the Franco-German leadership to work . 
Today , Germany has joined France in neglecting the smaller members for the sake of being recognized as one of the big boys . 
So the Franco-German couple has lost the credit it once enjoyed . 
Bringing in Britain is an admission of that fact . 
But because Britain remains lukewarm on European integration , the threesome can never serve as the motor for moving Europe forward . 
Even in an enlarged Union , only France and Germany can do that job , provided they make a determined effort to regain the trust of the other , mostly smaller members , old and new . 
While these expect little from an often indifferent France , they still , as the discussions in Riga suggest , would be disposed to putting their trust in Germany  -  if only German governments once again show they care .
