La Naus√©e Russe 
MOSCOW - The history of successive authoritarian regimes in Russia reveals a recurring pattern : they do not die from external blows or domestic insurgencies . 
Instead , they tend to collapse from a strange internal malady - a combination of the elites &quot; encroaching disgust with themselves and a realization that the regime is exhausted . 
The illness resembles a political version of Jean-Paul Sartre &apos;s existential nausea , and led to both the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the Soviet Union &apos;s demise with Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s Perestroika . 
Today , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin &apos;s regime is afflicted with the same terminal disease , despite - or because of - the seemingly impermeable political wall that it spent years constructing around itself . 
Putin &apos;s simulacrum of a large ideological regime simply couldn &apos;t avoid this fate . 
The leader &apos;s &quot; heroic image &quot; and &quot; glorious deeds &quot; are now blasphemed daily . 
And these verbal assaults are no longer limited to marginal opposition voices ; they are now entering the mainstream media . 
Two events have sharply accelerated the collapse of confidence in Putin &apos;s regime , both among the &quot; elite &quot; and ordinary Russians . 
First , in September , at the congress of Putin &apos;s political party , United Russia , Putin and &quot; President &quot; Dmitri Medvedev formalized what everyone anticipated , with Putin announcing his intention to return to the presidency in March - and thus virtually declaring himself Russia &apos;s dictator for life . 
His quest for eternal rule is driven not so much by a thirst for power as by a fear that he will one day be held accountable for his actions . 
The second lethal blow to Putin &apos;s prestige came with the unprecedented scale of fraud perpetrated in December &apos;s parliamentary elections . 
According to reliable observers , such as the election-monitoring NGOs Golos ( The Voice ) and Citizens &quot; Watch , vote-rigging in favor of United Russia resulted in an estimated 15-20 % advantage for what is now commonly called the party of &quot; crooks and thieves . &quot; 
And the trickery began long before voting day , with nine opposition parties prevented from even appearing on the ballot . 
These two events have rendered Putin &apos;s regime not only illegitimate , but also ridiculous . 
Even if the regime formally &quot; wins &quot; the presidential election on March 4 , the die has already been cast . 
What is happening in Russia today is part of a global phenomenon . 
Despite Putin &apos;s best efforts to isolate Russia and its post-Soviet near abroad , anti-authoritarian trends in nearby regions ( like the Middle East ) are infiltrating . 
Russian voters , the establishment , and intellectuals sense that Putinism has already lost . 
It is now only a matter of time before events make that defeat a political reality . 
And , after Putin falls , the leaders of other authoritarian post-Soviet regimes - from Belarus &apos;s Alexander Lukashenko and Kazakhstan &apos;sNursultan Nazarbayev to Ukraine &apos;s would-be Putin , Viktor Yanukovych - will not survive in power for long . 
In fact , authoritarianism was already on the way out in the former Soviet Union , but the global economic crisis halted the process . 
Georgia was the first to oust its communist apparatchiks . 
Ukraine followed , but , owing to internal discord , Kremlin pressure , and the European Union &apos;s indifference , the Orange Revolution was unable to deliver on the promise of democracy . 
Now Yanukovych is trying to reverse the country &apos;s democratic gains , but he is finding it difficult , despite imprisoning many opposition leaders . 
In Moldova , a real transition to democracy has been underway for some time . 
In Kazakhstan , too , rumblings against Nazarbayev &apos;s presidency for life are growing louder . 
Even the people of tiny South Ossetia , which the Kremlin annexed following its war with Georgia in 2008 , are resisting the Putin regime &apos;s local puppets . 
Back at home , mass disapproval of Putin &apos;s corrupt administration is rapidly turning into open contempt . 
What began just a few months ago as an attitude of protest has quickly become a social norm . 
To stop the protests now is virtually impossible . 
If Putin unleashes his well-developed apparatus of coercion , he will have played his last remaining card . 
Any resort to brute force to suppress demonstrations would finalize the regime &apos;s loss of legitimacy . 
&quot; We all understand , &quot; one of the leading Kremlin ideologues recently confided to me , &quot; but we can &apos;t get out . 
They will come for us at once . 
So we have to keep running like a squirrel in a cage . 
For how long ? 
For as long as there is strength ... &quot; 
Those who warn that the current government &apos;s collapse will be a risky leap into the unknown are correct . 
But they are mistaken to believe that preserving this government is safer . 
Russia must rid itself , once and for all , of Putinism &apos;s systemic corruption , lest the country be consumed by it .
