Dispersing the Terrorist Storm 
WARSAW - On September 11 , 2001 at three p.m. , Warsaw time , I was talking on the telephone with Poland &apos;s Consul General in New York . 
She informed me that two planes had hit the World Trade Center . 
That moment , I realized , was more than just a plane crash . 
The United States , the world , indeed our very lives , were about to change fundamentally . 
Ten years later , it is clear that the fanatics behind those attacks miscalculated in two central respects . 
They regarded Western democracies as weak - unwilling or unable to respond to their evil extremism . 
And they expected Muslim communities and countries around the world to rise up and mobilize behind their millenarian worldview . 
But , far from being uncertain or indecisive , the democratic world responded with unrelenting determination to terrorist outrages of all shapes and sizes . 
Across Europe and in America , new arrangements have been set up to pool information about possible terrorist attacks and take the speedy ( and sometimes robust ) action needed to prevent or disrupt them . 
Where possible , we work closely with India , Russia , Pakistan , the Gulf states , and other key international partners . 
The institutions and policies established by the European Union are a vivid example of the unobtrusive benefits of modern cross-border integration . 
EU member states share highly sensitive intelligence and police information as never before , thereby increasing public security while upholding world-class legal and democratic standards . 
These operational measures have been complemented by carefully calibrated policies that aim to acknowledge social diversity but reduce the political space available for intolerance and bigotry . 
Success does not come easy . 
Most of Al Qaeda &apos;s leaders are dead , but our democracies rightly experience impassioned debates about means and ends , and about the balance between individual freedom and state authority . 
In the current difficult global economic climate , public concerns about immigration and access to jobs inevitably grow more acute , increasing the risk that rival forms of lumpen populism and associated tensions will emerge . 
Above all , the West &apos;s effective crackdown on domestic extremism has tended to drive would-be terrorists - now often based in remote parts of the world , where they hope to operate with impunity - to higher levels of technical sophistication . 
As a result , painful policy dilemmas arise , and they can divide even the closest allies . 
How best to respond if some states cannot or will not take the necessary steps to thwart terrorist planning on their territory ? 
How to deal with evidence of terrorist planning gleaned from states suspected of practicing torture ? 
The sheer nihilistic irrationality of terrorism strains and tests our own beliefs like nothing else can . 
Yet the terrorist blows inflicted on New York , London , and Madrid over the past decade have not shaken Western democracies . 
Our societies are more resilient , open , and diverse than ever . 
That said , we are not doomed to succeed . 
Even well-intentioned social policies can have unwelcome consequences . 
Above all , we should be grateful to the police forces and intelligence agencies whose unflagging hard work and dedication far away from the public eye help keep us safe . 
The 9 / 11 terrorists &quot; second blunder was to believe that their terrorist attacks would inspire irresistible surge in anti-Western Islamist extremism . 
In some parts of the world , radicalization of this sort did take place . 
Yet , since 9 / 11 , most victims of Islamist-inspired terrorist extremism - often in the vile form of suicide attacks - have been Muslims , in Iraq , Pakistan , and elsewhere . 
Terrorist groups have to resort to organized crime to fund themselves . 
In short , far from leading some sort of worldwide Islamist revolution , the violent fanaticism of Al Qaeda and other organizations now resembles a repulsive , but manageable , form of ideological toxic waste . 
And the focus this year has shifted decisively away from it . 
Millions of people in North Africa and the Middle East have started to demand a normal society with basic democratic rights and , above all , the rule of law . 
They welcome measured and respectful US , European , and wider support . 
Faced with this unexpected challenge , some desperate rulers , above all now in Syria , have been using repressive , even terrorist methods against their open people . 
In Libya , Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s appalling tyranny has collapsed ; the EU will be generous in helping the Libyan people start to build a modern pluralist society . 
Poland &apos;s initiative to create a European Endowment for Democracy could play a leading role here , and with Europe &apos;s own unfinished business of democratization in Belarus and elsewhere , like backsliding Ukraine . 
Few people decide to commit terrorist outrages . 
Of those who do , a minute fraction actually tries to carry them out , and only a tiny number of those succeed . 
But the main lesson of 9 / 11 is that in any free society a tiny number of people can exploit their freedom and do vast damage , especially when the underlying motivation is incoherent . 
This is exemplified in very different ways by the murderous killing spree in Norway in July , and now by WikiLeaks &quot; disgraceful release of huge numbers of unredacted diplomatic cables . 
The terrorism threat ten years from now probably will be even more diverse and unpredictable . 
In Europe various homegrown &quot; single issue &quot; extremist groups need close monitoring . 
In each case , we see obsessive people arrogating to themselves the right to decide others &quot; fate , and using modern technology for their harmful purposes . 
By its very nature , this sort of disaggregated but highly focused threat is almost impossible to identify and intercept in advance . 
Of course , the democratic world cannot build a bomb-proof house .
