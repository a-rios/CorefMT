A Great Breakdown ? 
ISTANBUL - This month - the centenary of the outbreak of World War I - is an opportune time to reflect on big risks . 
As Michael Spence recently warned , the international order &apos;s widening security deficit , reflecting the weakening of whatever global governance we have , is fast becoming the biggest risk facing the world economy . 
The same point could have been made a century ago . 
On July 30 , 1914 , Austrian warships bombarded Belgrade , five weeks after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo . 
By mid-August , the world was at war . 
The armistice that was agreed four years later , after about 20 million people had died , amounted only to an interlude before the horror of World War II . 
In the years preceding August 1914 , until the assassination of the archduke , the global economy performed relatively well : trade expanded worldwide , financial markets seemed healthy , and the business community shrugged off political problems as either temporary or irrelevant . 
It was a political breakdown that led to three terrible decades for the world economy . 
Markets and economic activity can withstand a great deal of political stress and uncertainty - up to the point that the international order breaks down . 
Today , for example , the economic mood is rather upbeat . 
The International Monetary Fund forecasts 4 % growth for the world economy in 2015 , while stock-market indices are up in many parts of the world ; indeed , the Dow Jones reached an all-time high in July . 
In the last few months , however , a civilian airliner was downed in eastern Ukraine by a sophisticated Russian-made missile , tensions have increased around disputed islands in the South and East China Seas , and chaos in the Middle East has continued to spread . 
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is in one of its worst phases in decades , with the renewed frustration unleashed by the massive loss of civilian life in Gaza likely to encourage extreme reactions . 
Terrorists may be on the verge of designing much less detectable weapons . 
There are other , less &quot; political &quot; dangers . 
West Africa is afflicted by a terrible outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus , which will kill thousands of people . 
The outbreak has so far remained regional , but it serves as a reminder that in an age of air travel by millions , no one is safe from the spread of infectious disease . 
Containing a disease or a terrorist threat by curtailing international travel or transport would devastate the world economy . 
Thinking about August 1914 should remind us that great catastrophes can materialize gradually . 
Leaders can be &quot; sleepwalkers &quot; who fail to manage risk by , say , establishing institutions that can channel the rival interests and claims that fuel international conflict . 
Such sleepwalking by policymakers caused the financial meltdown of 2008 as well . 
Its consequences were not as deadly , though the political effects of mass unemployment and the heightened perception of economic insecurity are still with us . 
These examples should spur the world to find ways forward for cooperative action . 
The United Nations seems more paralyzed than ever . 
The US Congress still has not approved the IMF reform package agreed in 2010 , weakening one of the most important international institutions . 
Partly because the United States makes capital increases and governance reforms in global financial institutions so difficult , the BRICS countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa ) have launched their own development bank , to be based in Shanghai . 
Likewise , instead of providing a shining example of supranational cooperation and pooled sovereignty for the twenty-first century , the European Union remains mired in rather petty disputes . 
While it still cannot fully agree on the design of its banking union , it is allowing Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n of Hungary , a member country , to denigrate the democratic and liberal values upon which the EU rests . 
The way forward cannot be a return to the past , with its clashing nation-states . 
The future can be secured only by strong cooperation among all those committed to liberal democracy and the rule of law , with no double standards or excuses , and by patient strengthening of international institutions that embody these values and can translate them into practice . 
Whenever a global or regional power acts in a way that contradicts these values , or allies itself closely with those who do , it undermines the international order , which should deliver security and increasing prosperity ( and to some degree has ) . 
The global economy holds great promise , but it is a promise that can be realized only in an international system based on rules , consent , respect , and a shared sense of justice . 
The fact that neither the mayhem in the Middle East nor the crisis in Ukraine seem to touch financial markets should not lull us into complacency . 
The memory of August 1914 should remind us how the world stumbled into catastrophe . 
As we know - or should know - from the example of climate change , big risks must be managed , even if the probability of worse-case outcomes is low .
