A Time to Spend 
BERKELEY - The central insight of macroeconomics is a fact that was known to John Stuart Mill in the first third of the nineteenth century : there can be a large gap between supply and demand for pretty much all currently produced goods and services and types of labor if there is an equally large excess demand for financial assets . 
A normal gap between supply and demand for some subset of currently produced commodities is not a serious problem , because it is balanced by excess demand for other currently produced commodities . 
As industries suffering from insufficient demand shed workers , industries benefiting from surplus demand hire them . 
The economy rapidly rebalances itself and thus returns to full employment - and does so with a configuration of employment and production that is better adapted to current consumer preferences . 
By contrast , a gap between supply and demand when the corresponding excess demand is for financial assets is a recipe for economic meltdown . 
There is , after all , no easy way that unemployed workers can start producing the assets - money and bonds that not only are rated investment-grade , but really are - that financial markets are not adequately supplying . 
The flow of workers out of employment exceeds the flow back into employment . 
Thus , the first principle of macroeconomic policy is that because only the government can create the investment-grade financial assets that are in short supply in a depression , it is the government &apos;s task to do so . 
The government must ensure that the money supply matches the full-employment level of money demand , and that the supply of safe savings vehicles in which investors can park their wealth also meets demand . 
How well have the world &apos;s governments performed this task over the past three years ? 
In East Asia ( minus Japan ) , governments appear to have been doing rather well . 
Shortage of demand for currently produced goods and services and mass unemployment no longer loom as the region &apos;s biggest macroeconomic problems . 
Flooding their economies with liquidity , maintaining export-friendly exchange rates , and spending to employ workers directly and boost the supply of safe savings vehicles have made the Great Recession in East Asia less dire than it has been elsewhere . 
In North America , governments appear to have muddled through . 
They have not provided enough bank guarantees , forced enough mortgage renegotiations , increased spending enough , or financed enough employment to rebalance financial markets , return asset prices to normal configurations , and facilitate a rapid return to full employment . 
The most serious problems right now are in Europe . 
Uncertainty about how , exactly , the liabilities of highly leveraged banks and over-leveraged peripheral governments are to be guaranteed is shrinking the supply of safe savings vehicles at a time when macroeconomic rebalancing calls for it to be rising . 
And the rapid reductions in budget deficits that European governments are now pledged to undertake can only increase the likelihood of a full double-dip recession . 
The broad pattern is clear : the more that governments have worried about enabling future moral hazard by excessive bailouts and sought to stem the rise in public debt , the worse their countries &quot; economies have performed . 
The more that they have focused on policies to put people back to work in the short run , the better their economies have done . 
This pattern would not have surprised nineteenth-century economists like Mill or Walter Bagehot , who understood the financial-sector origins of industrial depression .
