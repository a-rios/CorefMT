The Terror Next Door 
LONDON - In a prominent hadith , the Prophet Mohammed said : &quot; If disorder threatens , take refuge in Yemen . &quot; 
The Prophet was referring to the prosperous and civilized Yemen . But today disorder and radicalization in Yemen are beginning to infect Saudi Arabia , and thus the safety of the world &apos;s largest oil producer . 
The Prophet &apos;s hadith about Yemen has enjoyed new resonance ever since the 1980 &quot; s , when Saudi Arabia - in line with American policy - sought to export domestic dissenters , most prominently Osama bin Laden , a Yemeni of Saudi birth , to fight Soviet infidels in Afghanistan . 
Although dissent was mostly diverted to Afghanistan , bin Laden &apos;s most trusted companions ( his wife , too ) have remained mainly in Yemen . 
In the wake of the Taliban &apos;s ouster in Afghanistan , bin Laden and his followers have come to regard Yemen , alongside Pakistan , as a haven . 
Indeed , Yemen is now a bubbling cauldron of jihadis who have flocked there because it , like Afghanistan and Pakistan , has weak , easily manipulated state institutions . 
US President Barack Obama &apos;s recent order to shut down the Guantánamo Bay detention facility has made the problem of Yemen &apos;s weakness a leading international issue . 
One-third of the Guantánamo detainees are Yemeni , but Yemen cannot guarantee the United States that the detainees will be controlled effectively if they are returned home . 
This fear is real . 
Many previously released Guantánamo inmates have disappeared underground . 
Saudi Arabia , unlike Yemen , has supposedly created a &quot; model &quot; system for reintegrating and re-educating Guantánamo returnees . 
The Al Munasaha rehabilitation center is supposed to &quot; cure &quot; jihadi passions , and Saudi returnees from Guantánamo who spend time at Al Munasaha are later offered jobs and wives . 
But many of them relapse and escape to Yemen . 
Most notorious among these recidivists is Abu Sufyan Al Shihri , now &quot; Deputy Leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . &quot; 
Seven other Saudi jihadis who escaped to Yemen are also known to be active in Al Qaeda there . 
Thus the two largest countries on the Arabian peninsula - Saudi Arabia , the biggest in terms of landmass and oil wealth , and Yemen in terms of population - are now locked in life-and-death struggles with internal enemies . 
The paradox is that , though the threat to both countries is the same , each is worsening the outlook for the other by the policies they are pursuing . 
For example , in the 1980 &quot; s , millions of Yemeni men worked in the Kingdom . 
Remittance income formed a big part of Yemen &apos;s budget . 
Since then , Yemeni labor has been banned from Saudi Arabia . 
Embittered and unemployed , young Yemeni men often become subject to another Saudi policy gone awry - its propagation for export of the Sunni Wahhabi form of Islam . 
With new Wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in Yemen because of Saudi financial support , it is small wonder that the number of Yemeni jihadis has grown exponentially . 
But Yemen , too , is engaged in its own destructive policies . 
President Ali Abdullah Salih has regularly used Yemeni Wahhabis to defeat his domestic opponents - first the Communists , then the Zaidis , and then the Huthis . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s relationship with Yemen is unlike that with any other Arab country . 
The two countries are joined through historical , ethnic , and tribal ties , yet neither has the means to resolve popular resentments and resistance . 
Saudi Arabia &apos;s traditional &quot; soft power &quot; foreign policy tools - lavish spending of oil money and da &apos;wa , &quot; the Call &quot; - are no longer effective . 
Building fences and sending helicopters to police the borders will not be sufficient , and the idea that jihadis can be rehabilitated is a myth . 
No medicine will work if , when the patient is released , he encounters the same virus : institutionalized Wahhabism . 
Yet there are things the Saudis can do to vaccinate themselves , and Yemen , from fanaticism . 
The tentative moves toward liberalization that King Abdullah has made over the past two years need to be accelerated , made more daring , and become more effective in removing the Wahhabi ideology as an incubator for radicalism . 
This should not be impossible , because both Saudi Arabia and Yemen have moderate , indigenous Islamic traditions that can be mobilized against jihadism . 
If given the financial support that the Wahhabis received , these forces could reverse the current drift to fanaticism . 
Both King Abdullah and President Salih understand the problem ; they need to stop using the old tactics and grasp the strategic need for change . 
The first change is economic . 
Instead of exporting radicalism , Saudi Arabia must start importing Yemeni manpower by lifting its ban on Yemeni workers . 
Yemeni officials have also requested admission to the Gulf Cooperation Council . 
Up to now , GCC leaders have spurned Yemen &apos;s membership for the same reasons that the European Union fears admitting Turkey : Yemen would instantly become the bloc &apos;s most populous country . 
Indeed , Yemen &apos;s population exceeds that of all six GCC members - Qatar , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Oman , and Saudi Arabia - combined . 
The GCC can and must assume that role . 
Yemen is strategically important , not only for Saudi Arabia , but for the world , because it is the only country on the Arabian Peninsula from which oil can reach the open seas without passing through a narrow strait - either the Strait of Hormuz or the Suez Canal . 
To endanger this passage is to endanger the world economy &apos;s energy lifeline . 
When considering Yemen &apos;s future , therefore , the stakes could hardly be higher .
