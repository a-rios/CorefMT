Is the Reagan-Thatcher Revolution Over ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Thirty years ago Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher brought about a revolution in thinking and policy in both economics and foreign affairs . 
The economies of the United States and Britain are today fundamentally different because of what they did . 
The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union is also the result of their policies . 
Of course , Reagan and Thatcher have always had their critics , some of whom now believe that the world economy will revert to pre-Reagan and pre-Thatcher policies . 
But anyone who recalls what the American and British economies were like before Reagan and Thatcher , and who knows the changes that they introduced , must also recognize that the world cannot go back . 
I had the good fortune to work with President Reagan as his chief economic adviser . 
Because of his close relationship with Prime Minister Thatcher , I also had several opportunities to meet with her . 
They were revolutionaries in their thinking and in their ability to inspire others to accept fundamental change . 
Reagan had four key economic goals when he assumed office in 1981 : reduce inflation , reduce high personal tax rates , reduce the size of government , and reduce regulation of the private sector . 
Inflation came down rapidly , from more than 10 % in 1981 to less than 4 % in 1983 , because Reagan backed the tough monetary policies of US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker . 
Today an inflation rate of close to zero is the accepted goal of US policy . 
Reagan &apos;s tax policies reduced the top income-tax rate from 70 % in 1980 to 28 % in 1986 . 
Although the top rate has climbed back to near 40 % , no one proposes a return to pre-Reagan levels . 
Although Reagan could not bring down spending on entitlement programs for retirees , America &apos;s non-defense discretionary spending was reduced by one-third , from 4.7 % of GDP in the 1980 to 3.1 % in 1988 . 
It stood at 3.4 % in 2008 . 
Finally , regulations were reduced in a wide range of industries , including air transport and the financial sector . 
While some restrictions on banks will be imposed in the wake of the financial crisis , we will not see a return to severe regulatory constraints on banks &quot; activities . 
Reagan characterized the Soviet Union as an &quot; evil empire &quot; and increased defense spending to challenge Soviet aggression and capabilities . 
The collapse of the Soviet Union and of communism were , in part , dramatic responses to US policies and to the inability of the Soviet economy to keep up with the West . 
There will be no going back here as well . 
When Margaret Thatcher became prime minister of Britain in 1979 , she faced an economy with much more fundamental problems than those in the US . 
Britain was a much more socialized economy , with widespread government ownership and dominant trade unions . 
She privatized the major government-owned industries and sold government-owned housing to tenants . No one is proposing to renationalize industries or to take back that housing . 
Trade union power was permanently broken after long and painful national strikes . 
The top tax rate on wage income was cut in half during her tenure as prime minister , falling from over 80 % when she took office to 40 % . 
Additional taxes on investment income meant the top tax rate before Thatcher came to power was initially above 95 % . 
Although the top rate of income tax in Britain was recently raised to 50 % , there is no thought of going back to pre-Thatcher taxes . 
Faced with high inflation , Thatcher backed a monetarist approach that supported high interest rates and succeeded in sharply reducing inflation . 
Today Britain has an independent central bank with an inflation target of 2 % . 
Thatcher supported Britain &apos;s entry into the European Union in order to benefit from free trade , but she forcefully opposed joining the single currency . 
The Labour government that followed her continued the policy of remaining outside the euro zone , as will the Conservatives , who are likely to return to power under David Cameron in the spring of 2010 . 
Financial deregulation made London a global financial center . 
Some of those regulatory changes may be reversed , but Britain is unlikely to jeopardize an important component of its economy by returning to pre-Thatcher financial rules . 
Indeed , there are no prospects of counter-revolution in Britain . 
Both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown , who headed Labour governments after almost two decades of Conservative rule , have been the face of market-friendly &quot; New Labour , &quot; and it is now the only face that the Labour Party has . 
Policies do evolve as conditions change and as we learn from experience . 
But the dramatic policy changes in the US and Britain under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher brought about such profound improvements that there is no going back .
