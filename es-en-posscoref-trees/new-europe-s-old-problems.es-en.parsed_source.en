New Europe &apos;s Old Problems 
The riots in Budapest , incited by leaked tapes that show Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany openly admitting that his government had lied for over a year about the country &apos;s dire finances , are but the latest evidence that things are going seriously wrong across Eastern Europe . 
Last June , the Slovaks evicted the government that brought the country out of the international isolation and economic malaise that it had suffered under the autocratic regime of Vladimir Meciar . 
Mikulas Dzurinda , whose reforms provided the country with growth and economic stability , was replaced by Robert Fico , a leftist who , having forged an alliance with Meciar and a neo-fascist party , has also adopted a worrisomely populist tone . 
That same month , Hungary reelected Gyurcsany , who had pursued a supposedly reformist program , but also oversaw a massive accumulation of public debt . 
Earlier plans to adopt the euro quickly have now been shelved , with the target date pushed back to 2011 or 2012 . 
But even that may be wishful thinking . 
Meanwhile , financial markets fret about the country &apos;s budget deficit and talk of a serious crisis . 
Meanwhile , the Czechs managed to elect a perfectly hung parliament . 
Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek is an advocate of urgently needed reforms , but he lacks a parliamentary majority and is pressing for a fresh general election in the first half of 2007 . 
With no means of stemming election-year fiscal expansion , the Czechs , too , have been forced to abandon their 2010 target date for euro adoption . 
Then consider Poland , where the Kaczynski twins , who hold the presidency and the prime ministership , have allied themselves with populist , xenophobic , and anti-Semitic parties . 
One of their priorities is to attack the central bank and slander its governor , Leszek Balcerowicz , the iconic father of Poland &apos;s economic transformation , with accusations that echo those of the Stalinist era . 
So much for the region &apos;s &quot; big four &quot; countries . 
But bad news is emerging from the smaller countries as well , including the Baltic states . 
Across Central and Eastern Europe , the scene is almost universally depressing . 
When so much goes wrong at the same time , it is tempting to look for a common cause . 
One factor that is often cited is &quot; reform fatigue . &quot; 
In barely 15 years , these countries have moved from central planning and economic backwardness to &quot; normal &quot; market economies with impressive GDP growth . 
But rapid change is always unnerving , and not everyone has emerged better off . 
Above all , uncertainty has become the norm , in contrast to the gray but predictable future offered by the old communist regimes . 
Today , many people now long for that period , which they see as less driven by material values . 
Communist parties , more or less reformed as socialists , appeal to a surprising number of voters . 
In some countries , like Slovakia and Poland , far-right nationalist parties provide another alternative , by offering the soothing appeal of traditional values and familiar enemies . 
Reform fatigue implies that Central and Eastern Europe needs a respite to catch its breath . 
But another explanation of recent developments in the region begins by noting that post-communist reforms were largely dictated from outside , as a condition of admission to the European Union . 
With membership achieved and EU money starting to pour in , leaders feel secure enough to let economic policy slip . 
Thus , budget deficits are the rule , and where they are largest , as in the Czech Republic and Hungary , they have gained priority over euro adoption . 
Indeed , only Slovenia has been admitted to join the euro area in 2007 , the earliest possible date . 
Estonia and Lithuania applied as well , but were refused entry . 
There is some truth in both explanations of Eastern Europe &apos;s backsliding . 
But what is the phenomenon that such explanations are supposed to clarify ? 
There has been no general tilt to the right or left in the region . 
Reforms that are attacked in one country continue to guide others . 
Nevertheless , the EU &apos;s newest members share some key features . 
Most importantly , they inherited from the Soviet era bloated and inefficient public sectors , which they are finding hard to downsize and professionalize . 
The private sector has been entirely rebuilt and is vibrant , but it cannot remain competitive if fiscal demands are not reduced - a familiar problem in Europe as a whole . 
For now , the tension has been left unresolved , leading to high budget deficits . 
But the EU &apos;s new member countries have no access to any safety net . 
They could well squander the significant transfers that they receive through the agricultural and structural funds , as many previous EU recipients did . 
If they abandon macroeconomic discipline , as Hungary and possibly the Czech Republic may be doing , they alone will face the consequences . 
Being outside the euro area , their currencies would fall , undermining growth in purchasing power and living standards . 
As they are economically small , the rest of the EU would barely shudder . 
Fortunately , the main lesson to emerge from the region &apos;s current troubles is that economies adapt faster than polities to changing conditions . 
Growth has been strong ; while it could have been stronger under more favorable policies , only huge mistakes could break the rise in living standards , given the region &apos;s productivity gains . 
Western Europe went through a similar phase of economic development in the 1950 &quot; s and 1960 &quot; s ; now it is Central and Eastern Europe &apos;s turn . 
Sadly , then as now , countries never seem to learn from others &quot; mistakes .
