Two Degrees of Misrepresentation 
COPENHAGEN  -  
Environmental campaigners vilified America for resisting European Union pressure to pre-commit to specific temperature targets - namely , that global warming should be limited to no more than 2 째 C ( 3.6 째 F ) above pre-industrial temperatures . 
This target has become a veritable commandment of campaigners since the EU embraced it in 1996 . 
The media often refer to it , sometimes saying that unless it is met , climate change would be very dangerous for humanity . 
In fact , the target is not scientifically backed , and the suggestion that we could achieve it is entirely implausible . 
Stopping temperatures from rising by more than 2 째 C would require draconian , instant emission reductions - for the OECD the reductions would have to be between 40-50 % below their expected path in just 12 years . 
Even if political consensus could be found , the cost would be phenomenal : one model estimates that the total global cost would be around $ 84 trillion , while the economic benefits would amount to just a seventh of this amount . 
The suspiciously round figure of 2 째 C provides one clue to the fact this target is not based in science . 
The first peer-reviewed study that analyzed it , published in 2007 , scathingly described it as being supported by &quot; thin arguments , based on inadequate methods , sloppy reasoning , and selective citation from a very narrow set of studies . &quot; 
In any case , a temperature limit is obviously a political rather than a scientific statement . 
Setting a limit means weighing up the costs and benefits of a world with temperatures at one level , and comparing them with the costs and benefits if we were to turn down the thermostat . 
This is an inherently political process . 
Deciding how much we should let temperatures rise is like working out how many people should die in traffic accidents by adjusting the speed limit . 
There is no scientifically &quot; correct &quot; number of traffic deaths . 
But that would require lowering the limit to walking speed - at an immense cost to society . 
It has been widely reported that the UN &apos;s climate change panel ( the IPCC ) tells us that science shows that industrial countries &quot; emissions should be reduced by 25-40 % by 2020 . 
This is simply incorrect : the IPCC &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize-winning scientists are &quot; policy neutral . &quot; 
Yet many journalists reported from Bali that the US had rejected the science of the 25-40 % emission reduction . 
They lamented how the science in the final document had been relegated to a footnote , stressing how shortsighted , national self-interest had won out . 
But this interpretation is flatly wrong . 
If we look at the reference in the Bali footnote , the IPCC clearly says that emissions should be reduced 25-40 % if you choose the low EU target but 0-25 % or less if you choose a higher target . 
Nevertheless , like many newspapers , the International Herald Tribune wrote that the IPCC assessment said &quot; that the temperature rise had to be limited to 2oC . &quot; 
Our one-sided focus on rapid reductions in CO2 emissions is both unnecessarily expensive and unlikely to succeed . 
At the Rio summit in 1992 , we promised to cut emissions by 2000 , yet overshot the target by 12 % . 
In Kyoto in 1997 , we promised even more radical emission cuts by 2010 , which we will miss by 25 % . 
Making ever-stronger promises on top of ever more failed promises is hardly the right way forward . Instead , we should look for smarter policy options , like aiming to ensure that alternative energy technologies at reasonable prices will be available within the next 20-40 years . 
This could be achieved if all countries committed to spending 0.05 % of GDP on research and development of non-carbon-emitting energy technologies . 
The cost - a relatively minor $ 25 billion per year - would be almost 10 times cheaper than the Kyoto Protocol ( and many more times cheaper than a standard Kyoto II ) . 
Yet it would increase R D globally 10-fold . 
Moreover , while it would embrace all countries , the rich would pay the larger share . 
It would let each country focus on its own vision of future energy needs , whether that means concentrating on renewable sources , nuclear energy , fusion , carbon storage , conservation , or searching for new and more exotic opportunities . 
It would also avoid ever-stronger incentives for free riding and ever-harder negotiations over ever more restrictive Kyoto-style treaties . 
A sensible policy dialogue requires us to talk openly about our priorities . 
Often , there is a strong sentiment that we should do anything required to ameliorate a situation . 
But we don &apos;t actually do that . 
In democracies , we debate how much to spend on different initiatives , knowing that we don &apos;t have infinite resources , and that sometimes throwing more money at the problem isn &apos;t the best answer . 
When we talk about the environment , we know tougher restrictions will mean better protection , but with higher costs . 
Deciding what level of temperature change we should aim for - and how to achieve it - is a discussion that should engage all of us . 
But confusing political campaigning with scientific reason won &apos;t help .
