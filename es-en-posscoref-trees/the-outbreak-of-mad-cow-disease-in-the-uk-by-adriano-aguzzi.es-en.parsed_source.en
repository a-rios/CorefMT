The Prion Puzzle 
ZURICH - The outbreak of mad cow disease in the United Kingdom , which ultimately led to the slaughter of 3.7 million cows and severely damaged the British cattle industry , began insidiously . 
In 1986 , a UK cow developed an unknown brain disease . 
The following year , tests revealed that the brain had been eroded by a myriad of small vacuoles , producing the sponge-like appearance that inspired the disease &apos;s scientific name : bovine spongiform encephalopathy . 
Within a few months , cases began appearing throughout the country . 
A similar disease , called scrapie , was common in sheep , but had not previously been diagnosed in cows . 
And a nearly identical , invariably lethal disease , kuru , had ravaged the aboriginal people in Papua New Guinea throughout the twentieth century . 
Both kuru and scrapie are infectious . 
Kuru was transmitted through cannibalistic rituals that were commonplace in Papua New Guinea until the 1950 &quot; s . 
Similarly , in the UK and elsewhere , healthy cattle were fed meat and bone meal made from infected cattle . 
At its peak in 1992 , mad cow disease was claiming nearly 1,000 head of cattle weekly . 
Faced with a rapidly growing health crisis , the British authorities - equipped with little scientific understanding of the disease , and under pressure from a powerful industrial lobby - made a fatal mistake . 
Because scrapie had never been definitively linked to human disease , they assumed that infected cows were also innocuous . 
This assumption not only ignored the kuru tragedy ; it also overlooked the hundreds of young people who had died of spongiform encephalopathy after receiving growth hormones extracted from human corpses . 
This mixture of hubris , ignorance , and subservience to commercial interests reached peak toxicity in 1990 , when the UK &apos;s agriculture minister , John Gummer , televised his daughter eating a hamburger , declaring that British beef was safe . 
But British beef was not safe . 
In late 1995 , two young people were diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - a rare disease typically seen in elderly patients . 
Post-mortem examinations of their brains revealed deposits of prions - the infectious agents that cause scrapie , kuru , and mad cow disease . 
Since then , &quot; new variant &quot; Creutzfeltdt-Jakob disease has claimed roughly 300 lives . 
As the tragedy unfolded , however , scientists gained a greater understanding of the disease . 
Prions seem to defy all conventional wisdom , surviving pressure-cooking , irradiation , and even incineration at 340 Â° C for four hours - treatments that are routinely and reliably used to deactivate all known viruses and bacteria . 
Furthermore , prions lack their own genes . 
The prion gene is provided by the infected individual , in whom it resides in an innocuous state . 
Since the disease &apos;s outbreak , it has been revealed that many common ailments - including Alzheimer &apos;s disease and Parkinson &apos;s disease - have similar properties . 
While no cure has been found , some progress has been made , particularly on early detection of prions , which had been a daunting problem . 
Sensitive detection of pathogens , such as HIV , typically relies on the presence of nucleic acids ( DNA or RNA ) , which are absent in prions . 
Recently , however , effective methods for amplifying prions have been developed , which could enable detection of the pathogen before it can damage its host . 
Moreover , there is hope that an effective vaccination can be developed . 
Introducing an innocuous version of a pathogen into the body causes the immune system to produce antibodies , which will neutralize the &quot; wild &quot; pathogen if it enters the body later . 
A decade ago , my laboratory showed that an anti-prion antibody could significantly delay - and , in some cases , prevent - infection in mice that had been exposed to prions . 
But several problems have emerged . 
The host &apos;s body produces its own version of the prion protein , and it is difficult to create a high-quality antibody against a body &apos;s own components . 
As a result , rather than trying to induce immunity , researchers must develop prefabricated anti-prion antibodies that can be delivered directly to patients . 
This solution might work for related diseases like Alzheimer &apos;s , but it has its own array of problems , including the difficulty of driving such antibodies from the injection site to the brain . 
Severe side effects in animals , meanwhile , may prohibit the antibodies &quot; use in humans altogether . 
Another possibility could be to eradicate prion diseases in livestock by removing the host &apos;s prion gene . 
The Swiss scientist Charles Weissmann demonstrated this using mice in a series of experiments two decades ago . 
Using recently developed &quot; zinc finger nuclease &quot; technology , any given gene can be removed from an animal &apos;s DNA . 
In fact , prion-free sheep and cows have already been created . 
While the quality of their meat remains to be assessed , they can provide a safe source of biological agents - such as therapeutic antibodies and growth factors - for use in human medicine .
