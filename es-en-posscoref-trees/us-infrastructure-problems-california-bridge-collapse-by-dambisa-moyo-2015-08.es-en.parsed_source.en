A Marshall Plan for the United States 
NEW YORK - When a major highway bridge in California collapsed last month , the impact on the entire southwestern United States once again highlighted the country &apos;s serious infrastructure problem . 
Indeed , in a sense , the world &apos;s largest economy is falling apart . 
Ideological aversion to public-sector investment , together with the endemic short-term thinking of those who write budgets , has kept spending on roads , airports , railways , telecommunication networks , and power generation at levels far below what is needed . 
And yet the problem can no longer be ignored . 
If the US does not act quickly to provide its fragile economic recovery with a solid foundation of modern infrastructure , it could find itself sinking slowly back into stagnation . 
It seems self-evident that a developed economy requires adequate , ongoing investment in public goods . 
But the state of infrastructure in the US suggests that many decision-makers do not share this view . 
A 2013 report by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the US a pathetic overall grade of D + for its infrastructure . 
The report cited numerous state-specific shortcomings , including Michigan &apos;s &quot; 88 high-hazard dams and 1,298 structurally deficient bridges &quot; and the &quot; $ 44.5 billion needed to upgrade drinking-water systems &quot; in California . 
The report concludes that a $ 3.6 trillion investment ( roughly one-fifth of the country &apos;s annual GDP ) will be needed by 2020 to boost the quality of US infrastructure by addressing the &quot; significant backlog of overdue maintenance &#91; and the &#93; pressing need for modernization . &quot; 
Otherwise , the country &apos;s crumbling infrastructure will drag down economic growth for years to come . 
America &apos;s desperate need for modern infrastructure has come , in some ways , at a fortuitous moment . 
At a time when the economic recovery remains fragile , a publicly financed infrastructure program could meaningfully transform the prospects of US workers , providing new employment opportunities for low and un-skilled labor . 
Meanwhile , scaling up infrastructure spending could provide an often-overlooked opportunity for long-term institutional investors . 
Pension funds , insurance companies , and mutual funds in the US manage combined assets totaling roughly $ 30 trillion , and they have been struggling to find investments that match their long-term obligations . 
Persistently low interest rates have been particularly challenging for pension funds , which face rising liabilities ( calculated on a discounted basis ) . 
A large-scale program to reboot America &apos;s crumbling infrastructure would go a long way toward addressing this gap between assets and liabilities , providing pension funds with investments with long time horizons ( and thus guaranteeing the incomes of tomorrow &apos;s retirees ) while leveraging private capital for the public good . 
In fact , US pension funds are already investing in infrastructure , but they are doing so in Canada , Australia , the United Kingdom , and the Netherlands . 
Sadly , ideological objections and partisan politics are likely to strew obstacles in the path of any effort to modernize America &apos;s infrastructure and create such opportunities at home . 
Public-sector investment invariably rekindles the age-old struggle between those who insist that government should stay out of efforts to create jobs and those who believe that part of government &apos;s role is to put underutilized human resources to work . 
One way to avoid this bottleneck would be for US President Barack Obama to establish a bipartisan Infrastructure Commission tasked with finding solutions to the problem . 
This would operate much like the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform , established in 2010 to address America &apos;s fiscal challenges , or the military-base-closing commissions of the 1980s and 1990s . 
By splitting the responsibility between the country &apos;s two main parties , the commission would free its members from the pressures of day-to-day politics and allow them to concentrate on the health of the economy . 
Congress would then hold an up-or-down vote on the commission &apos;s recommendations . 
Infrastructure has long been acknowledged as fundamental to a country &apos;s economic prospects . 
In neglecting the necessary investments , the US has put itself on a precarious path , one that could lead to stagnation and decline , which would be difficult to reverse . 
There is little reason for US policymakers to accept this fate . 
Low interest rates , the dollar &apos;s continuing role as the world &apos;s main reserve currency , and the capacity of the public sector to increase spending make the case for higher infrastructure spending compelling . 
In the twentieth century , the US government spent billions of dollars to rebuild the European economy . 
Its project for the first half of this century should be to do the same at home .
