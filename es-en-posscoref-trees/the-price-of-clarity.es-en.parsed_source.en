The Price of Clarity 
LONDON  -  &quot; Through the contrivance and cunning of stock jobbers there hath been brought in such a complication of knavery and cozenage , such a mystery of iniquity , and such an unintelligible jargon of terms to involve it in , as were never known in any other age or country . &quot; 
Jonathan Swift &apos;s eighteenth-century barb resonates in today &apos;s world of financial &quot; intermediation &quot; : now , as then , finance shrouds its &quot; complication of knavery and cozenage &quot; in &quot; unintelligible jargon . &quot; 
As US President Barack Obama explained in a speech in April : &quot; Many practices were so opaque and complex that few within these companies - let alone those charged with oversight - were fully aware of the massive wagers being made . &quot; 
But was Swift right to see knavery as the main motive for unintelligibility ? 
Obviously , it is a very powerful motive , in politics no less than in finance . 
The less people understand about something , the easier it is to fool them . 
There has never been a shortage of snake-oil merchants : Donizetti wrote an opera , L &apos;Elisir D &apos;Amore , about one of them advertising a love potion in a nonsensical patter . 
But the intention to deceive , or even to make money , is not necessarily what has driven the recent explosion of financial innovation . 
Consider the US Securities and Exchange Commission &apos;s current civil suit against Goldman Sachs . 
Goldman whiz-kid Fabrice Tourre is charged with having created a complicated security that was designed to fail . 
Was his intention to deceive ? 
Or was it the intellectual pleasure he got from creating a &quot; Frankenstein monster &quot; ( as one of his e-mails described it ) , regardless of the consequences ? 
The latter seems the dominant motive . 
As another of his e-mails put it : &quot; The entire system is about to crumble any moment ... the only potential survivor the fabulous Fab ... standing in the middle of all these complex , highly levered , exotic trades he created . &quot; 
To be cleverer than the pack ( and of course making money by his cleverness ) seems to have been Tourre &apos;s driving passion . 
Finance has always been opaque , quite apart from the motive of swindling the investing public . 
&quot; Double-entry bookkeeping &quot; is one of the great discoveries of European civilization , but five centuries later most people are still muddled about assets and liabilities . 
Without such knowledge , technical terms like &quot; balance-sheet recession &quot; and &quot; rebuilding balance sheets &quot; are meaningless . 
Opacity has grown with complexity . 
The explosion of derivative instruments has demanded such an effort at understanding that metaphorical language is needed . 
Think of collateral debt obligations ( CDOs ) as poisoned sausages , says the economist Nouriel Roubini , with sub-prime mortgages as the rat meat in them . 
With a mental effort , the layperson can then imagine these poisonous sausages , otherwise known as &quot; toxic assets , &quot; spreading through the world &apos;s banks , ruining their digestions and crippling the economies they are meant to serve . 
But complexity is not the only reason for obscurity . 
In his famous essay &quot; Politics and the English Language , &quot; George Orwell pointed to the widespread use of euphemism , which means not calling a spade a spade . 
This , he thought , was due to too many facts in the modern world having become too horrible , or unpalatable , to be stated clearly . 
One of his examples was the phrase &quot; rectification of frontiers &quot; to sugar-coat forced population movements . 
Political correctness is another aspect of this : calling disabled people &quot; differently abled , &quot; for example . 
As the historian Tony Judt points out : &quot; It &apos;s not a &quot; different &quot; ability , it &apos;s no ability . 
Lousy language ... conceals the effects of real power and capacity , real wealth and influences . &quot; 
It enables deep inequality to happen more easily . 
As important is a straightforward decline in literacy . 
Orwell talked of officials putting together blocks of words like &quot; prefabricated hen houses . &quot; 
This quality is much in evidence in a recent IMF report : 
&quot; Risks to global financial stability have eased as the economic recovery has gained steam , but concerns about advanced country sovereign risks could undermine gains and prolong the collapse of credit . 
Without more fully restoring the health of financial and household balance sheets , a worsening of public debt sustainability could be transmitted back to banking system or across borders . 
Hence , policies are needed to ( 1 ) reduce sovereign vulnerabilities , including through communicating credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plans ; ( 2 ) ensure that the ongoing deleveraging process unfolds smoothly ; and ( 3 ) decisively move forward to complete the regulatory agenda so as to move to a safer , more resilient , and dynamic global financial system . 
For emerging market countries , where the surge in capital inflows has led to fears of inflation and asset price bubbles , a pragmatic approach using a combination of macroeconomic and prudential financial policies is available . &quot; 
Ironically , the same document is full of demands for greater &quot; transparency . &quot; 
So let us translate that IMF passage into transparent English : 
&quot; The world economy has become less risky as it has recovered from recession , and as banks and households have reduced their debts . 
But fears of government default in rich countries could threaten the recovery by causing interest rates to rise and exchange rates to fall . 
So three things are needed : governments must ( 1 ) cut their deficits gradually in a believable way , ( 2 ) keep enough spending going to compensate for increased saving in the private sector , and ( 3 ) press on with bank regulation . 
For developing countries , economic policy and bank regulation should be used together to stop inflation and asset bubbles . &quot; 
The greater the distance between the language of elites and ordinary people , the greater the risk of revolt . 
To the extent that complexity in finance or politics creates new opportunities to deceive , impedes understanding , or blurs lines of accountability , we should aim to reduce it . 
To the extent that such problems reflect decreased ability to express oneself clearly , the remedy is to improve education . 
The price of clarity , like the price of liberty , is eternal vigilance , and the two are connected .
