A Class of Its Own 
PRINCETON - The very rich , F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote , &quot; are different from you and me . &quot; 
Their wealth makes them &quot; cynical where we are trustful , &quot; and makes them think &quot; they are better than we are . &quot; 
If these words ring true today , perhaps it is because when they were written , in 1926 , inequality in the United States had reached heights comparable to today . 
During much of the intervening period , between the end of World War II and the 1980s , inequality in the advanced countries was moderate . 
The gap between the super-rich and the rest of society seemed less colossal - not just in terms of income and wealth , but also in terms of attachments and social purpose . 
The rich had more money , of course , but they somehow still seemed part of the same society as the poor , recognizing that geography and citizenship made them share a common fate . 
As the University of Michigan &apos;s Mark Mizruchi points out in a recent book , the American corporate elite in the postwar era had &quot; an ethic of civic responsibility and enlightened self-interest . &quot; 
They cooperated with trade unions and favored a strong government role in regulating and stabilizing markets . 
They understood the need for taxes to pay for important public goods such as the interstate highway and safety nets for the poor and elderly . 
Business elites were not any less politically powerful back then . 
By contrast , today &apos;s super-rich are &quot; moaning moguls , &quot; to use James Surowiecki &apos;s evocative term . 
Exhibit A for Surowiecki is Stephen Schwarzman , the chairman and CEO of the private equity firm the Blackstone Group , whose wealth now exceeds $ 10 billion . 
Schwarzman acts as if &quot; he &apos;s beset by a meddlesome , tax-happy government and a whiny , envious populace . &quot; 
He has suggested that &quot; it might be good to raise income taxes on the poor so they had &quot; skin in the game , &quot; and that proposals to repeal the carried-interest tax loophole - from which he personally benefits - were akin to the German invasion of Poland . &quot; 
Other examples from Surowiecki : &quot; the venture capitalist Tom Perkins and Kenneth Langone , the co-founder of Home Depot , both compared populist attacks on the wealthy to the Nazis &quot; attacks on the Jews . &quot; 
Surowiecki thinks that the change in attitudes has much to do with globalization . 
Large American corporations and banks now roam the globe freely , and are no longer so dependent on the US consumer . 
The health of the American middle class is of little interest to them these days . 
Moreover , Surowiecki argues , socialism has gone by the wayside , and there is no need to coopt the working class anymore . 
Yet if corporate moguls think that they no longer need to rely on their national governments , they are making a huge mistake . 
The reality is that the stability and openness of the markets that produce their wealth have never depended more on government action . 
In periods of relative calm , governments &quot; role in writing and upholding the rules by which markets function can become obscured . 
It may seem as if markets are on autopilot , with governments an inconvenience that is best avoided . 
But when economic storm clouds gather on the horizon , everyone seeks shelter under their home government &apos;s cover . 
It is then that the ties that bind large corporations to their native soil are fully revealed . 
As former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King aptly put it in the context of finance , &quot; global banks are global in life , but national in death . &quot; 
Consider how the US government stepped in to ensure financial and economic stability during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 . 
If the government had not bailed out large banks , the insurance giant AIG , and the auto industry , and if the Federal Reserve had not flooded the economy with liquidity , the wealth of the super-rich would have taken a severe blow . 
Many argued that the government should have focused on rescuing homeowners ; instead , the government chose to support the banks - a policy from which the financial elite benefited the most . 
Even in normal times , the super-rich depend on government support and action . 
It is largely the government that has financed the fundamental research that produced the information-technology revolution and the firms ( such as Apple and Microsoft ) that it has spawned . 
It is the government that enacts and enforces the copyright , patent , and trademark laws that protect intellectual property rights , guaranteeing successful innovators a steady stream of monopoly profits . 
It is the government that subsidizes the higher-education institutions that train the skilled work force . 
It is the government that negotiates trade agreements with other countries to ensure that domestic firms gain access to foreign markets . 
If the super-rich believe that they are no longer part of society and have little need of government , it is not because this belief corresponds to objective reality . 
This is a narrative that afflicts all segments of society , the middle class no less than the rich . 
There is no reason to expect that the super-rich will act less selfishly than any other group . 
The more significant roadblock is the missing recognition that markets cannot produce prosperity for long - for anyone - unless they are backed by healthy societies and good governance .
