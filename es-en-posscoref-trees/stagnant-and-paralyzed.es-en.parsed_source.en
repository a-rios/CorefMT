Stagnant and Paralyzed 
MILAN - The recent dramatic declines in equity markets worldwide are a response to the interaction of two factors : economic fundamentals and policy responses - or , rather , the lack of policy responses . 
First , the fundamentals . 
Economic growth rates in the United States and Europe are low - and well below even recent expectations . 
Slow growth has hit equity valuations hard , and both economies are at risk of a major downturn . 
A slowdown in one is bound to produce a slowdown in the other - and in the major emerging economies , which , until now , could sustain high growth in the face of sluggish performance in the advanced economies . 
Emerging countries &quot; resilience will not extend to double-dip recessions in America and Europe : they cannot offset sharp falls in advanced-country demand by themselves , notwithstanding their healthy public-sector balance sheets . 
America &apos;s domestic-demand shortfall reflects rising savings , balance-sheet damage in the household sector , unemployment , and fiscal distress . 
As a result , the large non-tradable sector and the domestic-demand portion of the tradable sector cannot serve as engines of growth and employment . 
That leaves exports - goods and services sold to the global economy &apos;s growth regions ( mostly the emerging economies ) - to carry the load . 
And strengthening the US export sector requires overcoming some significant structural and competitive barriers . 
What the world is witnessing is a correlated growth slowdown across the advanced countries ( with a few exceptions ) , and across all of the systemically important parts of the global economy , possibly including the emerging economies . 
And equity values &quot; decline toward a more realistic reflection of economic fundamentals will further weaken aggregate demand and growth . 
Hence the rising risk of a major downturn - and additional fiscal distress . 
Combined , these factors should produce a correction in asset prices that brings them into line with revised expectations of the global economy &apos;s medium-term prospects . 
But the situation is more foreboding than a major correction . 
Even as expectations adjust , there is a growing loss of confidence among investors in the adequacy of official policy responses in Europe and the US ( and to a lesser extent in emerging economies ) . 
It now seems clear that the structural and balance-sheet impediments to growth have been persistently underestimated , but it is far less clear whether officials have the capacity to identify the critical issues and the political will to address them . 
In Europe , risks spreads are rising on Italian and Spanish sovereign debt . 
Yields are in the 6-7 % range ( generally viewed as a danger zone ) for both countries . 
Combined with their low and declining GDP growth prospects , their debt burdens are becoming sufficiently onerous to raise questions about whether they can stabilize the situation and restore growth on their own . 
Italy and Spain expose the full extent of Europe &apos;s vulnerability . 
Like Greece , Ireland , and Portugal , membership in the euro denies Italy and Spain devaluation and inflation as policy tools . 
But the declining value of their sovereign debt - and the size of that debt relative to that of Europe &apos;s smaller distressed countries - implies much greater erosion of banks &quot; capital base , raising the additional risk of liquidity problems and further economic damage . 
The domestic policy focus in Europe has been to cut deficits , with scant attention to reforms or investments aimed at boosting medium-term growth . 
At the EU level , there is not yet a complementary policy response designed to halt the vicious cycle of rising yields and growth impairment now faced by Italy and Spain . 
Credible domestic and EU-wide policies are needed to stabilize the situation . 
Neither is forthcoming . 
Recent market volatility has been partly a response to the apparent rise in the downside risk of policy paralysis or denial . 
In the US side , the integrity of sovereign debt was kept in question for too long . 
During those months of political dithering , US treasuries became a riskier asset . 
Then , with the immediate default risk removed , money stormed out of risky assets into Treasuries to wait out the economic bad news - mainly feeble and declining growth , employment stagnation , and falling equity prices . 
Little in America &apos;s domestic policy debates hints at a viable growth and employment-oriented strategy . 
In fairness , some believe that cutting the budget is a sufficient growth strategy . 
Structural and competitive impediments to growth have been largely ignored . 
There is little recognition that domestic aggregate demand cannot be restored to its pre-crisis levels except through growth . 
In fact , the household savings rate continues to rise . 
The details may elude voters and some investors , but the focus of policy is not on restoring medium- and long-term growth and employment . 
Indeed , there is profound uncertainty about whether and when these imperatives will move to the center of the agenda . 
In the emerging economies , by contrast , inflation is a challenge , but the main risk to growth stems from the advanced countries &quot; problems . 
In addition , reforms and major structural changes are needed to sustain growth , and these could be postponed , or run into delays , in a decelerating global economy . 
The resetting of asset values in line with realistic growth prospects is probably not a bad outcome , though it will add to the demand shortfall in the short run . 
But uncertainty , lack of confidence , and policy paralysis or gridlock could easily cause value destruction to overshoot , inflicting extensive damage on all parts of the global economy . 
This somewhat bleak picture could change , though probably not in the short run . 
Stability can return , but not until domestic policy in the advanced countries , together with international policy coordination , credibly shifts to restoring a pattern of inclusive growth , with fiscal stabilization carried out in a way that supports growth and employment . 
In short , we confront two interacting problems : a global economy losing the struggle to restore growth and the absence of any credible policy response . 
Too many countries seem to be focused more on political outcomes than on economic performance . 
Markets are simply holding up a mirror to these flaws and risks .
