Central Bank Confidential 
LONDON - In 1993 , the economists Alberto Alesina and Larry Summers published a seminal paper that argued that central bank independence keeps inflation in check , with no adverse consequences for economic performance . 
Since then , countries around the world have made their central banks independent . 
None has reversed course , and any hint that governments might reassert political control over interest rates , as happened recently in India , are met with alarm in financial markets and outrage among economists . 
In truth , however , there are many degrees of independence , and not all nominally independent central banks operate in the same way . 
Some monetary authorities , like the European Central Bank , set their own target . 
Others , like the Bank of England ( BoE ) , have full instrument independence - control over short-term interest rates - but must meet an inflation target set by the government . 
There are differences , too , in how central banks are organized to deliver their objectives . 
In New Zealand , the bank &apos;s governor is the sole decision-maker . 
At the US Federal Reserve , decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , whose members - seven governors and five presidents of the Fed &apos;s regional reserve banks - enjoy varying degrees of independence . 
The ECB does not publish voting records and seeks consensus at the meetings of its General Council . 
By contrast , the BoE &apos;s Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) has nine members , four of whom are appointed from outside the bank , and all votes are individually recorded ; nobody is allowed to hide behind an institutional view . 
The Fed does not keep a voting record , but &quot; dissents &quot; from its major decisions are noted ( these were almost unheard of when Alan Greenspan was Chairman , but have since become more common ) . 
There are differences , too , in the relationship between policymakers and their staff , which also influences a central bank &apos;s independence . 
At the Fed , the staff present their own economic forecasts to the FOMC , without input from the policymakers who set the interest rate . 
At the BoE , the MPC is responsible for official forecasts , which it publishes in its Inflation Reports . 
That is helpful in influencing expectations , because a range of different views from the central bank could confuse the private sector ; but it carries the risk of institutional groupthink . 
Groupthink can be particularly dangerous if the central bank is also the banking supervisor , as the 2008 global financial crisis demonstrated . 
In 2006 , every central bank that published a financial stability report ( in other words , most of them ) concluded that their country &apos;s banking system was in fine shape : well-capitalized and endowed with robust governance and strong risk management . 
It seems unlikely that not a single central bank analyst was the least bit worried about the massive growth in credit and leverage at the time . 
Economists at the Bank for International Settlements - an organization of central banks - were laying out the risks very starkly . 
And yet not a dissenting voice was heard from the world &apos;s small army of central bank economists . 
Central banks may have been independent vis-à-vis their countries &quot; governments , but internally it was very difficult to stray from the party line . 
There is , of course , a balance to be struck between tight institutional discipline and letting a hundred intellectual flowers bloom . 
A central bank is not a university economics department , where diversity is almost invariably a source of strength . 
External observers are bound to try to read policy messages between the lines of any publication , which may not always help the bank to achieve its objectives . 
That said , there is clearly room for allowing more heterodox thinking . 
So it is encouraging that the BoE is experimenting with a platform that enables a wider variety of views to be heard : a blog called Bank Underground ( a reference to the Tube station beneath the Bank &apos;s headquarters ) that publishes posts by junior staff challenging - or supporting - prevailing policy . 
In a matter of weeks , Bank Underground already has established itself as a fertile source of provocative ideas . 
One post in the middle of August ( when the Bank &apos;s top cats were certainly away , allowing free rein to the mice ) pointed to some of the weaknesses in banks &quot; internal capital models , which are at the heart of the Basel 3 capital-requirements regime . 
The author , a BoE employee named Tobias Neumann , argued that incorporating more data into the models could lead them to pick up noise and mistake it for an important signal . 
As a result , he concluded , highly complex models may regularly yield misleading information . 
Another post , published in July , explicitly challenged the BoE &apos;s &quot; official &quot; view that as the economy recovers , we can expect non-financial companies to begin to run down their cash balances to fund investment . 
The authors , Katie Farrant and Magda Rutkowska , suggest that corporate behavior may have changed as a result of the financial crisis , as difficulties in accessing bank financing led them to increase their cash buffers permanently . 
If true , this has important implications for the financial system , and especially for banks . 
In its short life , Bank Underground has already proved its worth . 
The BoE &apos;s governor , Mark Carney , deserves great credit for allowing us to peer through a small crack in the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street &apos;s façade ( assuming , of course , that the blog is not a wholly unlicensed initiative ! ) . 
Perhaps we will eventually see the emergence of a rival Fed Subway blog , though I am not optimistic about the prospects for an ECB U-Bahn blog anytime soon . 
In the meantime , I plan to spend more time underground . 
The light seems to be better there .
