Grading Obamanomics 
PALO ALTO - It is still too soon to gauge the full economic impact of President Barack Obama &apos;s implemented and proposed policies , but a preliminary read indicates limited short-term benefit at large long-term cost . 
The administration is exploiting a crisis atmosphere to enact a vast agenda that would reengineer the American economy , from autos and financial services to health care , energy , and the distribution of income . 
Obama outsourced the details of the $ 787 billion fiscal stimulus to Congress and , no surprise , the old barons of the House stuffed it with pork and social engineering . 
Several months later , only 4 % -6 % of the funds have been spent , and the federal government is brow-beating state governments - for example , demanding that California rescind a small pay cut for some unionized workers or lose $ 7 billion in stimulus funds . 
( Intervening in contractual relations ex post to enforce union demands is an emerging characteristic of the administration ) . 
The foreclosure relief plan is off to an even slower start , and is likely to run into numerous problems concerning how to rework delinquent mortgages without inducing a lot more delinquencies . 
So score the stimulus a very expensive , largely wasted opportunity . 
Instead , Obama could , for example , have suspended the payroll tax for a year , getting money directly into people &apos;s pockets quickly and decreasing the need for firms to lay off workers . 
Obama &apos;s long-run budget calls for much higher spending , higher taxes , and an explosion of debt that will crowd out borrowing in capital markets by private companies , state and local governments , and developing countries . 
Obama would add $ 6.5 trillion to the United States &quot; national debt , more than all previous presidents , from George Washington to George W. Bush , combined . 
That is in addition to explicit tax hikes on income , capital gains , and dividends , the implicit ones on energy via cap-and-trade , etc . 
The large deficits will eventually force much higher taxes , such as a national value-added tax similar to those in Europe , or gigantic increases in everyone &apos;s income taxes . 
The Federal Reserve lowered its target federal funds rate to zero before Obama was inaugurated , and initiated many programs to try to revive credit markets , with mixed results ( the commercial paper facility has helped , whereas others seem to have gotten off to less sanguine starts ) . 
The Fed &apos;s independence is a key component of its anti-inflation credibility , and a key test for Obama will be to support the Fed &apos;s efforts to withdraw the liquidity before substantial inflation pressures assert themselves several years from now . 
The Obama administration also seems to be heading toward regulating derivatives and financial institutions deemed too big to fail . 
America does need a clearinghouse for derivatives , and a much higher percentage of derivative trading should take place on exchanges , rather than bilaterally over the counter . 
Any institution that is or could quickly become too big to fail needs to have adequate capital ( rising with size ) , and real-time continuous monitoring of risk , but these measures should be implemented without overbearing micromanagement . 
Unfortunately , the Obama administration &apos;s decision to put the unions ahead of secured debt-holders in the orchestrated Chrysler bankruptcy risks rupturing the basic fabric of credit markets . 
But Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner &apos;s much-ridiculed bank &quot; stress tests &quot; made sense ( although one can argue that sufficiently dire scenarios were not included or that too much was negotiated with the banks , etc . ) . 
Determining the size of likely losses is necessary to decide whether banks &quot; retained earnings from profitable ongoing operations and their ability to raise private capital will allow them to work down their toxic assets over time . 
If not , more draconian solutions will be necessary . 
I support Geithner &apos;s plan to cooperate with private investors in dealing with the banks &quot; toxic assets , because they make better business decisions than government bureaucrats . 
Will banks be willing to part with the assets at a low enough price to attract private investment ? 
And would doing so force larger write-downs , requiring banks , in turn , to ration credit - and thus harming the economy ? 
Obama has been better than feared on international trade . 
He was famously protectionist during the primaries , declaring he would unilaterally rewrite NAFTA . 
But , while he has continued his softer tone since the election , he has not even bothered to ask for fast-track trade-promotion authority , let alone try to pump new life into the Doha Round of global trade talks . 
Obama is getting a large part of his agenda . 
Unfortunately , the numbers don &apos;t add up and he is laying twin time bombs with the explosion of federal government debt and inefficient government micromanagement of the economy . 
His call for immense deficits even once the economy is back to normal , funds are returned from the financial bailouts , and the US is out of Iraq - is simply irresponsible . 
The American economy will likely return to growth late this year and next , especially with all the monetary and fiscal stimulus ( growth would have initially been slower and then much stronger without it ) , but it will still be an economy on a government lifeline . 
The big questions left unanswered are how far Obama wants to push the US toward a European-style social-welfare state , how he intends to pay for it , and how much long-term economic damage will result ?
