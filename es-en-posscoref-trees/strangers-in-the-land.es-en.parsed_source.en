Strangers in the Land ? 
Migration is the side of globalization that , to borrow Oscar Wilde &apos;s phrase , dare not speak its name . 
Advocates of globalization dance around the topic because they fear it will incite nativist backlash . 
Respectable opponents of globalization avoid it in fear that they will be called racists or insensitive to the plight of the world &apos;s poorest . 
This silence is not only disingenuous ; it is certainly dangerous . 
In theory , global economic integration implies a world where the markets for goods , services , capital , and labor are perfectly integrated . 
Although many markets are nowadays increasingly open - even if others , notably agriculture , remain distorted by protectionism - integrating global labor markets has largely been left out of the globalization process . 
This is hardly surprising . 
Over the centuries , governments have always been concerned to protect &quot; their &quot; local poor and unskilled from immigrant competition . 
Of course , such concerns are quickly discarded when countries become rich and local workers no longer want to perform menial jobs . 
The history of much of the great migrations to the US in the 19 th and 20 th centuries fits this model . 
So do the Indo-Pakistani and Afro-Caribbean migrations to Britain that followed the UK &apos;s post-war imperial retreat , and the migrations of Algerians to France and Turks to Germany during the &quot; economic wonder &quot; of the 1960s . 
But political leaders and citizens in the developed world are wrong to think that economic migration can be turned on and off like a spigot . 
Despite massive government efforts in Europe and the developed world to restrain immigration after the oil price shocks of the 1970s , labor inflows into the rich countries started to increase in the 1980s to an annual average of about 1.4 million in Europe and 2.3 million in the US . 
The number of foreign-born workers increased throughout the OECD area ( Japan being the sole exception ) . 
Foreign workers now account for 25 % of Australia &apos;s labor force , 10.3 % in the US , and 5.3 % in Europe . 
These flows reflect the growing shortage of skilled workers and declining populations ( particularly in Europe ) that are beginning to bedevil the developed world . 
So Germany , if not warmly welcoming , finds itself soliciting Indian computer programmers , while Canada and other countries entice China &apos;s middle classes with a safe haven in which to invest just in case things go wrong at home . 
But this tolerance is confined to the skilled and the wealthy . 
No one wants to open the door to large-scale immigration by the poorest of the poor . 
Underlying this discrimination , especially in Europe , is cultural aversion to immigrants from regions with alien cultures , which may account for the absence of widespread protests against the EU &apos;s eastward enlargement . 
Indeed , the economic justification - that skilled immigrants tend to be net economic contributors while low-skilled workers impose a fiscal burden and threaten low-skilled natives - is weak . 
Immediate welfare costs , for example , can be passed on to the next generation , which will encompass these immigrants &apos; children . 
More importantly , immigration &apos;s overall benefits outstrip the costs . 
In Britain , for example , the net annual contribution to GDP from immigrants is Â£ 2.5 billion , according to a recent Home Office report . 
Facts , however , rarely pose an effective obstacle to hardened nativists , which is why governments worried about immigrants prefer to see some jobs go to people in poor countries rather than see poor people come to jobs in rich countries . 
Open international trading relations ( especially allowing farmers in developing countries greater access to rich countries &apos; markets ) is , of course , the best way to achieve this . 
Indeed , liberalization of agriculture would provide a viable substitute for migration in many cases . 
Farm politics in Europe and America , however , make this virtually impossibile . 
Recent academic studies by Sergei Guriev of Moscow &apos;s New Economic School and Guido Freibel of the University of Toulouse expose a link between strict immigration rules and illicit trafficking in human beings , confirming the need for reform . 
If such criminal activity is to be stopped , the despair found in poor countries must be reduced . 
Politicians in rich countries will be forced to strike a better balance between more liberal immigration policies and less trade protectionism . 
History offers bitter lessons concerning the failure to meet this challenge . 
The economic historian Harold James notes that the countries that turned toward aggressive militarism in the 1930s had previously been large suppliers of emigrants . 
Japan , Germany , and Russia all saw large outflows of their populations before the First World War , but these flows slowed to a trickle as countries like the US closed their doors to immigrants in the wake of the Great Depression that began in 1929 . 
In today &apos;s world , Africa and Asia are the world &apos;s biggest suppliers of migrants . 
If more jobs do not appear in these places , and doors to immigration remain shut , it should be no surprise that events born of frustration and hopelessness will occur with ever-greater frequency . 
Liberal immigration policies and the economic growth promised by globalization are the keys to preventing dire conditions in poor countries from being translated into violence at home and abroad .
