Divided Asia Stands 
Why can &apos;t Asia unite even for the sake of its own security ? 
For decades , Western experts have complained about the failure of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) to learn the value of collective security from Europe &apos;s post-War experience . 
ASEAN &apos;s leaders have ignored the lessons offered first by the Common Market , and then the European Union . 
The benefits of these models are supposedly so obvious that it seems incomprehensible that ASEAN &apos;s leaders cannot see them . 
East Asia &apos;s apparent disarray over a response to North Korea &apos;s nuclear d√©marche brings these complaints into the open once again . 
A North Korea with nuclear bombs surely poses a common threat to all Asians . 
Everybody , it is said , should help the US put Kim Jong Il in his place . 
The fact that North Korea &apos;s close neighbors seem unable to grasp this seems to confirm that Asian disunity is not just stupid , but chronic and willful . 
But history and geography matter in assessing the nature of a threat . 
Different traditions in tactical and strategic thinking also matter - to say nothing of the unique way Europeans forged their current cooperative arrangements out of aggressive nation-states that shared a common civilization . 
Nothing in Asia &apos;s history , however , remotely compares to Europe &apos;s half-century of division and veritable occupation by two rival superpowers . 
So it is no surprise that Asia &apos;s leaders do not look to Europe for solutions to their regional problems . 
Of course , human beings and nation states do often behave in similar ways . 
When threatened , countries tend to group together against a common enemy . 
When the world was divided into two camps during the Cold War , deciding who was an enemy and who a friend seemed easy . 
Alliances were established along pro-American or pro-Soviet lines . 
But even then , things in Asia were not so clear-cut . 
A jagged line loosely joining Tokyo to Jakarta via Seoul , Taipei , Hong Kong , Bangkok , Kuala Lumpur , and Singapore was sufficient to sustain international cooperation . 
But that cooperation was nothing like a lasting alliance . 
Why ? 
There are many layers of explanation . 
At one level , Asian history has been dominated by rival elites from China , &quot; Turkestan , &quot; India , Persia , &quot; Arabia , &quot; Japan , and Java ( to name but a few examples ) who claimed to lead separate indigenous cultural entities . 
This differs markedly from Europe &apos;s shared Greco-Roman-Christian civilization . 
Throughout Asian history , the continent &apos;s ancient foundations of power were more sharply divided from one another - and over much longer time spans - than in Europe . 
Modern history , however , did teach Asians that disunity led to European triumphs over them . 
In the 20 th century , leaders advocating unity against the colonial and imperial powers emerged . 
But the Europeans , who controlled over half the globe , seemed able to disrupt any temporary gains . 
Europe &apos;s approach was two-pronged . 
First , it aimed to keep Asia divided insofar as the West was concerned . 
This was relatively easy during the Cold War , as Asia &apos;s postcolonial elites were forced to choose sides in a conflict of ideologies . 
Today &apos;s global war against terrorism permits this approach to be modified to create new divisions . 
Second , Asia was brought under the rubric of a single interdependent global economy in which the West holds the key technological and financial cards . 
That strategy has proved remarkably successful . 
Over the past decade , Asia moved from division between two superpowers to something that could be described as dominance by one super-economy . 
Either way , no regional unity on politics and security has arisen . 
The only prospect for a feeble identity of interest is the emergence of some form of economic regionalism , pursued by Asian leaders through free-trade agreements . 
Asian disunity can be overcome only if Asia as a whole confronts a common enemy . 
The West will do everything possible to prevent Asians from viewing Westerners as that enemy . 
In fact , most calls for Asian unity are concerned with uniting Asia with the West ( often equated with the interests of the whole world ) against some part of Asia , whether it be Iraq , Iran , North Korea , or Myanmar . 
Given that most Asian leaders believe Asian disunity made the West all-powerful in the first place , these calls are treated with understandable caution . 
What , then , of the future ? 
It will take time for Asia &apos;s leaders to shed the burdens of the past , in some cases especially where relations with the West are concerned . 
In the meantime , if the global economy continues to integrate , will the prospect of Asian unity be enhanced or hindered ? 
Much depends on whether the West retains its sway in other parts of the world . 
If that dominance continues through increasingly powerful networking technologies , the chances of Asia creating a distinct unity of its own are slim . 
It is in this context that we can see why Asian leaders appear two-faced or unreliable in the eyes of Europe and the US . 
Asia cannot afford to unite against the West . 
But Asia equally cannot afford to divide itself by ostracizing one of its parts . 
For that way lies permanent dependence on the West .
