Europe &apos;s Bogus Banking Union 
LONDON - After a 16-hour marathon negotiating session ending on March 20 , politicians , technocrats , and journalists were all keen to declare the deal on the final piece of Europe &apos;s banking union a success . 
While the &quot; banking union &quot; may soon exist on paper , in practice the eurozone banking system is likely to remain fragmented along national lines and divided between a northern &quot; core , &quot; where governments continue to stand behind local banks , and a southern &quot; periphery , &quot; where governments have run out of money . 
Think back to June 2012 . 
Spain &apos;s busted banks threatened to drag down the Spanish state , as Ireland &apos;s had done to the Irish state 18 months earlier , while panic tore through the eurozone . 
European Union leaders resolved to break the link between weak banks and cash-strapped governments . 
A European banking union would move responsibility for dealing with bank failures to the eurozone level - akin to America , where distressed banks in , say , Florida are dealt with by federal authorities with the power to bail in bondholders , inject federal funds , and close down financial institutions . 
That saved the euro , but it also relieved the pressure on Germany to cede control of its oft-distressed banks . 
Since then , the German government has used its clout to eviscerate the proposed banking union ; all that remains is a shell to keep up appearances . 
For starters , it will not apply to the huge losses incurred during the current crisis . 
The ECB will directly supervise bigger eurozone banks starting in November ( the first step of the banking union ) , and now it is assessing the strength of their balance sheets . 
If this exercise is conducted properly - a big if - undercapitalized banks that are viable would be forced to raise additional equity , from bondholders if necessary , while unviable ones would be wound down . 
But EU rules on national bank resolution will not yet be in force , while the eurozone &apos;s single resolution mechanism will be initiated only in 2015 . 
So banks in northern Europe that are still backed by creditworthy governments would be treated differently than those in cash-strapped southern Europe : Germany can afford to bail out its banks ; 
Italy cannot . 
More likely , the ECB will fudge the exercise , owing to fear of reigniting the financial crisis and pressure from national governments . 
Small countries will be singled out to make the exercise look tough , while bigger problems will be swept under the carpet : German banks have already succeeded in excluding many of their assets from the assessment . 
One argument for making the ECB the watchdog for eurozone banks was that it was less captured by the banks than national supervisors were . 
It has repeatedly prioritized the interests of banks in &quot; core &quot; countries and proved more pliable to political pressure from Berlin and Paris than from Madrid or Rome , let alone Dublin or Athens . 
Even after the new banking union framework is fully in place , it will be full of holes . 
At Germany &apos;s insistence , the ECB will supervise only the eurozone &apos;s 130 or so biggest banks . 
The argument that smaller lenders are not a systemic threat is spurious : consider Spain &apos;s cajas . 
In any case , there will not be a level playing field . 
Above all , the single resolution mechanism is a mirage , because national governments retain a veto over closing down any bank . 
The mechanism is deliberately complex to the point of being unworkable ; it is inconceivable that a bank could be wound down over a weekend to avert market panic . 
And the collective funds that eventually will be at its disposal are meager : a mere â‚¬ 55 billion ( $ 76 billion ) . 
In practice , then , rescuing banks will remain in the hands of national governments , all of which are captured by &quot; their &quot; banks but whose capacity to bail them out varies : French and German banks will be rescued ; 
Cypriot banks will not . 
Thus , national taxpayers will remain on the hook for bankers &quot; losses . 
The upshot is that the eurozone as a whole is likely to struggle with a zombie banking system , with only patchy efforts to restructure banks decisively and fairly . 
Worse , the north-south , core-periphery divide will harden , with taxpayer-backed banks on one side and banks that must fend for themselves on the other . 
That is a bonus for struggling southern taxpayers , but it implies that even sound banks could have higher funding costs than dubious northern European banks for the foreseeable future . 
The bogus banking union is thus a recipe for entrenching economic and political division .
