President Bush Goes Soft 
The first term of George W. Bush &apos;s presidency was marked by unilateralism and military power . 
The United States was the world &apos;s only superpower , so others had to follow . 
The result was a dramatic decline in America &apos;s &quot; soft &quot; or attractive power . 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said he did not know what soft power was . 
Now it is back in fashion in Washington . 
Bush &apos;s second inaugural address was devoted to the power of liberty and democracy . 
Such rhetoric is not new to American presidents . 
Harry Truman spoke of defending free people everywhere , and Woodrow Wilson spoke of promoting democracy . 
The neo-conservatives in Bush &apos;s first administration were in that tradition , but ignored the fact that both Wilson and Truman were also institution-builders who consulted other countries . 
In dropping that half of Wilson &apos;s approach , they stepped on their own message , reducing its effectiveness . 
The tone at the beginning of the second Bush administration is different . 
As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said recently in Paris : &quot; I use the word &quot; power &quot; broadly , because even more important than military and indeed economic power is the power of ideas , the power of compassion , and the power of hope . &quot; 
Bush not only chose to visit Brussels , the capital of the European Union , on his February trip to Europe , but stated that what &quot; we seek to achieve in the world requires that America and Europe remain close partners . &quot; 
Even Rumsfeld is trying to be conciliatory ! 
Will Bush &apos;s new approach succeed ? 
On a recent trip to Europe , I encountered both encouragement and skepticism . 
Many people welcomed the new tone , but wondered if it was simply sugarcoated cynicism . 
Words must be matched by deeds before people are convinced . 
One place to look to see if deeds are forthcoming is in Bush &apos;s latest budget . 
The budget cuts discretionary spending ( other than defense and homeland security ) by nearly 1 % , and slashes as many as 150 domestic programs . 
Yet , in this climate of fiscal stringency , he calls for increased contributions to international organizations , the Millennium Challenge Account to provide assistance to countries with a commitment to making progress in poverty reduction , and the Global HIV / AIDS Initiative . 
Bush &apos;s new budget also includes an increase in funding for public diplomacy . 
The allocation for the State Department &apos;s educational and cultural exchange programs , including overseas research centers , libraries , and visitor programs , is boosted by nearly 25 % . 
As Bush &apos;s budget request to Congress puts it , &quot; Rarely has the need for a sustained effort to ensure foreign understanding for our country and society been so clearly evident . &quot; 
This comes after a first term in which public diplomacy was a neglected stepchild , and a Pentagon advisory panel summed up the situation as a &quot; crisis . &quot; 
Even with these increases , there is a long way to go to improve America &apos;s standing . 
The Bush administration still has much to do in promoting ideas , but early indications suggest a change from the neglect of the first term . 
But it will not be enough for Bush to start his second term with grand rhetoric about values and increased investment in public diplomacy . 
A country &apos;s attractiveness or soft power stems partly from its culture and values ( where they are attractive to others ) , but it also grows out of a country &apos;s policies when they are seen as legitimate , consultative , and inclusive of the interests of others . 
Unless the policies fit the values , the discrepancy will give rise to charges of hypocrisy . 
At a minimum , Bush will need to pursue policies - in a more consultative manner - that seek a political solution in Iraq and progress in the Israel-Palestine peace process . 
Here too , the early signs are encouraging . 
The 60 % turnout in the January elections and the scenes of Iraqis risking their lives to vote has led to hopes that a political settlement in Iraq may be possible . 
The elections are but a first step ; the insurgency continues ; civil war remains possible . 
Nonetheless , the elections may have softened some of the sense of illegitimacy that has clouded Bush &apos;s Iraq policy . 
Similarly , with regard to the Middle East peace process , the replacement of Yasir Arafat by Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian elections , and the meetings between Abbas and Ariel Sharon suggest progress . 
On difficult nuclear issues , such as North Korea and Iran , Bush has pursued multilateral consultation and coordination with other powers . 
Of course , this still leaves unresolved other multilateral issues , like the International Criminal Court and global climate change . 
There is little prospect that Bush will reverse his rejection of the Kyoto Treaty , but it will be interesting to see how far he accommodates Prime Minister Tony Blair &apos;s efforts to make climate change a priority during Britain &apos;s period as chair of the Group of Eight major economies . 
It is much too early for a verdict on Bush &apos;s second term policies . 
As he looks ahead to the verdict of history , he seems to realize that hard power alone will not consolidate his reputation , but he remains hostage to incidents and accidents that could drive even his best-laid plans off course . 
Nonetheless , the most striking thing at this point in Bush &apos;s second term is his belated discovery of the importance of diplomacy and soft power .
