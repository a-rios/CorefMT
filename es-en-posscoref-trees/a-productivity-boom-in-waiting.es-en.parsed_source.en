A Productivity Boom-in-Waiting ? 
BERKELEY - A double-dip recession is one thing , but a lost decade is something far more sinister . 
In the United States , there is growing concern that the worst recession since the Great Depression has damaged the economy &apos;s capacity to grow . 
Indeed , there are good reasons for worrying that the US and other advanced countries will now be consigned to a long period of sub-par growth . 
Having been burned by the crisis , banks have tightened their lending standards , and will now be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements . 
As a result , bank credit will be harder to obtain . 
A more limited supply of bank credit will mean higher capital costs . 
Small and medium-sized firms - the most important sources of innovation and employment growth - will feel the effects most acutely . 
Governments , for their part , will come out of the crisis more heavily indebted , which implies higher future taxes , less investment , and hence slower rates of growth . 
Another worry is that the crisis will create a hard core of long-term unemployed whose skills atrophy and who become stigmatized in the eyes of potential employers . 
Rising structural unemployment will reduce labor input and efficiency . 
It is harder to grow when construction workers and hedge-fund managers have to be retrained to work as welders and nurses . 
This mismatch between skills supplied and demanded represents a serious drag on employment growth . 
All of these effects were evident in the wake of the Great Depression , too . 
In the US , there was zero growth in bank lending between 1933 , the trough of the Depression , and 1937 , the subsequent business-cycle peak . 
Investment suffered . 
Stocks of both equipment and structures were actually lower in 1941 than in 1929 . 
Similarly , mismatch problems hindered the transfer of human resources from declining to expanding sectors . 
In Britain , where coalminers were unemployed in large numbers , the expansion of the motor-vehicle and engineering industries was hindered by a shortage of skilled mechanics . 
Everywhere , long-term unemployment became acute . 
Skills were lost , and the hard core of unemployed were stigmatized and demoralized . 
An influential 1933 study of the Austrian town of Marienthal by the sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld painted this dismal picture in detail . 
George Orwell graphically described it in The Road to Wigan Pier . 
The result was a disappointing , all-but-jobless recovery . 
In the US , unemployment was still 14 % in 1937 , four full years into the recovery , and in 1940 , on the eve of the country &apos;s entry into World War II . 
But there was another side to this coin . 
Output expanded robustly after 1933 . 
Between 1933 and 1937 , the US economy grew by 8 % a year . 
Between 1938 and 1941 , growth averaged more than 10 % . 
Rapid output growth without equally rapid capital-stock or employment growth must have reflected rapid productivity growth . 
This is the paradox of the 1930 &quot; s . 
Despite being a period of chronic high unemployment , corporate bankruptcies , and continuing financial difficulties , the 1930 &quot; s recorded the fastest productivity growth of any decade in US history . 
How could this be ? 
As the economic historian Alexander Field has shown , many firms took the &quot; down time &quot; created by weak demand for their products to reorganize their operations . 
Factories that had previously used a single centralized power source installed more flexible small electric motors on the shop floor . 
Railways reorganized their operations to make more efficient use of both rolling stock and workers . 
More firms established modern personnel-management departments and in-house research labs . 
There are hints of firms responding similarly now . 
General Motors , faced with an existential crisis , has sought to transform its business model . 
US airlines have used the lull in demand for their services to reorganize both their equipment and personnel , much like the railways in the 1930 &quot; s . 
Firms in both manufacturing and services are adopting new information technologies - today &apos;s analog to small electric motors - to optimize supply chains and quality-management systems . 
So , even if there are good reasons to expect a period of sub-par investment and employment growth , this need not translate into slow productivity or GDP growth . 
But this positive productivity response is not guaranteed . 
Policymakers must encourage it . 
Small , innovative firms need enhanced access to credit . 
Firms need stronger tax incentives for R D. Productivity growth can be boosted by public investment in infrastructure , as illustrated by the 1930 &quot; s examples of the Hoover Dam and the Tennessee Valley Authority . 
Productivity growth makes many things possible . 
It makes it easier to eliminate budget deficits , and it makes it possible to increase education spending and to fund training schemes for the long-term unemployed . 
But , even if rapid productivity growth is possible under current circumstances , it cannot be taken for granted . 
Policymakers need to act .
