From Christian Democracy to Muslim Democracy ? 
BUDAPEST - This summer , Turkey &apos;s ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) narrowly escaped being banned by the country &apos;s constitutional court . 
State prosecutors alleged that the party was trying to &quot; Islamicize &quot; the country and ultimately introduce theocracy . 
Not only did AKP supporters celebrate after the decision , but those in the West who view it as a prototype &quot; Muslim Democratic &quot; party also breathed a sigh of relief . 
The clear model for a moderately religious party - one committed to the rules of the democratic game - are the Christian Democratic parties of Western Europe and , to a lesser extent , Latin America . 
Yet opponents of the idea of &quot; Muslim democracy &quot; argue that European Catholics only turned to democracy under orders from the Vatican , and that since Muslims do not have anything like a Church hierarchy , Christian Democracy is an irrelevant example . 
But history shows that political entrepreneurs and liberalizing Catholic intellectuals were crucial to the creation of Christian Democracy . 
Christian Democratic parties first emerged in Belgium and Germany toward the end of the nineteenth century as narrowly focused Catholic interest groups . 
The Vatican initially regarded them with suspicion , perceiving parties participating in elections and parliamentary horse-trading as signs of &quot; modernism . &quot; 
A breakthrough came with the Italian Popular Party &apos;s founding in 1919 . 
Its leader , Don Luigi Sturzo , wanted it to appeal to tutti i liberi e forti - all free and strong men . 
The Vatican , having prohibited Italian Catholics from participating in the political life of newly united Italy for almost sixty years , lifted its ban . 
But while Christian Democracy got nowhere politically between the World Wars , momentous changes were initiated in Catholic thought . 
In particular , the French Catholic thinker Jacques Maritain developed arguments as to why Christians should embrace democracy and human rights . 
During the 1920 &quot; s , Maritain was close to the far-right Action Fran√ßaise . 
Maritain accepted the Pope &apos;s verdict and began a remarkable ideological journey toward democracy . 
He criticized France &apos;s attempts to appear as a modern crusader , incurring the wrath of Catholics in the United States in particular . 
More importantly , he began to recast some of Aristotle &apos;s teachings and medieval natural law doctrines to arrive at a conception of human rights . 
He also drew on the philosophy of &quot; personalism , &quot; which was highly fashionable in the 1930 &quot; s , as it sought a middle way between individualist liberalism and communitarian socialism , and insisted that &quot; persons &quot; always had a spiritual dimension that materialistic liberalism supposedly failed to acknowledge . 
After the fall of France , Maritain decided to remain in the US , where he happened to find himself after a lecture tour ( the Gestapo searched his house outside Paris in vain ) . 
He authored pamphlets on the reconciliation of Christianity and democracy , which Allied bombers dropped over Europe , and he never tired of stressing that the Christian origins of America &apos;s flourishing democracy had influenced him . 
Maritain also insisted that Christians , while they should take into account religious precepts , had to act as citizens first . 
Acceptance of pluralism and tolerance were thus central to his vision and forbade any one-to-one translation of religion into political life . He was in fact rather skeptical of exclusively Christian parties . 
Maritain participated in the drafting of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights , and the Second Vatican Council eventually approved many of the ideas that he had been propounding since the 1930 &quot; s . 
He also influenced the Christian Democratic parties that governed after 1945 in Germany , Italy , the Benelux countries , and , to a lesser extent , France , and which consolidated not only democracy , but also built strong welfare states in line with Catholic social doctrine . 
While still emphasizing family values and traditional morality , they lost the whiff of incense that had clung to the Christian Democratic parties at the beginning of the century - by the 1970 &quot; s , they even began to stress that one didn &apos;t have to be a believer to join . 
Maritain &apos;s example disproves the claim that the analogy between Christian and Muslim democracy fails . 
It wasn &apos;t the Vatican that took the lead in creating Christian Democracy - it was innovative philosophers like Maritain ( who never served in the Church hierarchy , though he was briefly French ambassador to the Vatican ) and political entrepreneurs like Sturzo ( a simple Sicilian priest ) . 
Of course , Muslim democracy will not be brought about by intellectuals alone . 
After all , Christian Democracy &apos;s success is also explained by its strongly anti-communist stance during the Cold War - and , in Italy , by the benefits of widespread corruption . 
Nevertheless , some body of thought that makes democracy attractive for believers - and reassures non-believers that the faithful have accepted pluralism - had to be available . True , some of the philosophies used in the European Catholic transition to democracy - such as personalism - were rather nebulous , although it was probably their vagueness that helped to bring as many believers as possible on board . 
But the point remains that ideas matter .
