The Ethiopia Card 
BRUSSELS - Two decades ago , Ethiopia was a Cold War battlefield . 
On the ideological map of the world , it was Soviet territory , a land of famine , dictatorship , and civil war . 
But , with the overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam &apos;s Marxist-Leninist dictatorship in 1991 , Ethiopia began to transform itself . 
Today , it ranks among the five fastest-growing economies in the world , and is a bastion of regional stability . 
That stability matters , because the Horn of Africa is becoming a security headache once again . 
If the region is to be stabilized , Ethiopia will need to play a key part . 
Indeed , it should be considered an indispensable strategic partner for those in the international community who want to prevent the entirety of East Africa from slipping into chaos . 
Besides the never-ending anarchy of neighboring Somalia , the regional challenges facing Ethiopia and its long-serving prime minister , Meles Zenawi , are daunting . 
The country remains on a war footing with Eritrea over the disputed border village of Badme . 
The peace deal between the government and the former rebel SPLM is unraveling fast in neighboring Sudan , where a scheduled referendum in the South in January 2011 on secession and independence - part of the 2005 peace deal - may provoke a return to all-out war . 
Further south , Kenya remains scarred by the aftermath of post-election violence , and its constitutional review process could lead to yet more bloodshed . 
Moreover , Ethiopia &apos;s proximity to strife-torn Yemen ( where violent jihadis are congregating ) just across the Red Sea , is complicating the country &apos;s foreign policy because of its role in working to keep Somalia out of Islamist control . 
Despite these myriad problems - or perhaps because of them - Ethiopia has an opportunity to emerge as the undisputed regional leader . 
Rapid population growth is projected to put it among the world &apos;s ten most populous states by mid-century . 
Though landlocked , Ethiopia is comparatively well endowed with natural resources , not least its fertile farmland , which has attracted significant investment from Saudi Arabia , among others . 
A final settlement of the lengthy dispute with Egypt over the waters of the Blue Nile - which rises in Ethiopia - appears to be in sight , and could have a powerful impact on economic growth . 
But , despite Ethiopia &apos;s progress , the international community ( especially the West ) has been reluctant to view the country as a strategic partner . 
Of course , Ethiopia has its problems , but these should be seen in an African context . 
The human-rights situation could undoubtedly be improved - in particular , the treatment of the political opposition leader Birtukan Mideksa - but Isaias Afwerki &apos;s regime in neighboring Eritrea is worse by orders of magnitude . 
The country &apos;s ruling coalition , the Ethiopian People &apos;s Revolutionary Democratic Front , dominates the political landscape - but who can blame Ethiopians , surrounded by potential enemies , for giving priority to stability and order over Western-style democratic development ? 
Western leaders can hardly denounce Zenawi while lauding Vladimir Putin for bringing a focus on modernization to Russia &apos;s governance . 
Furthermore , President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has created what amounts to a one-party state during his 24 years in power , yet he is feted in the West as one of Africa &apos;s visionary leaders . 
It seems that Ethiopia , more often than not , is the victim of diplomatic double standards . 
If Zenawi consolidates his hold on power in the parliamentary elections due this May , the world should expect the stability that he has brought to take deeper root . 
Whether it will ripple throughout the region is another question . 
That is why , regardless of the electoral result , Ethiopia needs international backing . 
It is interesting to contrast the likely consequences of the election in Ethiopia with the expected fallout from the presidential election scheduled in Sudan at around the same time . 
If Omar al-Bashir retains Sudan &apos;s presidency , as expected , he will be emboldened to step up his hostility to the country &apos;s restless regions . 
Bashir will also no doubt try to stop the oil-rich devolved region of South Sudan from declaring independence . 
The people of South Sudan , most of whom are Christian or animists , are likely to favor secession - not least because of the memory of decades of war and the deeply resented imposition of Sharia law by Bashir &apos;s government in Khartoum . 
Many now believe that Bashir will seek to prevent the referendum from taking place , or to use its result as a pretext to return to war with the South - with devastating consequences across the Horn of Africa . 
Ethiopia &apos;s diplomacy will be vital to minimizing the potential for such violence to spread , but Ethiopia can fulfill this role only if it receives strong strategic backing from the West . 
Regional rivalries and past history mean that Ethiopia has few natural allies in the region . 
One such ally could be Somaliland , the former British protectorate , which broke away from Somalia in 1991 and lies to the northeast of Ethiopia . 
Somaliland is , like Ethiopia , relatively stable , economically improving , and secure . 
It also has a lengthy coastline and a deepwater port , Berbera , which could help land-locked Ethiopia unlock even more economic growth . 
The moderate Islam practiced in Somaliland could not be farther removed from the barbarity of the Al-Shabab in Somalia . 
If Ethiopia were to recognize Somaliland as sovereign , other African Union countries would likely follow - and so , perhaps , would the United States and EU member states , which increasingly despair of patching Somalia together . 
Ethiopia &quot; s leadership throughout the Horn of Africa could bring lasting change in a part of the world that has largely been written off . 
It is time to give Ethiopia the diplomatic tools that it needs .
