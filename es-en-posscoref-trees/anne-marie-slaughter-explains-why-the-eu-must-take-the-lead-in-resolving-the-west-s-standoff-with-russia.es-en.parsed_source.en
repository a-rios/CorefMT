Let Europe Lead in Ukraine 
WASHINGTON , DC - As Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea proceeds , the United States must step back ; the European Union must step forward ; and the international community must ensure both that Russia pays a steep economic and political price for its actions , and that Russian and Ukrainian nationalists do not lock both sides into a deadly spiral of violence . 
Thus far , Western leaders have played their cards about as well as they could , barring early missteps by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who described a calculated assertion of Russia &apos;s regional interests as the behavior of a leader who was out of touch with reality . 
Escalation of the crisis by the US at this stage would merely play into Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s hands and expose the West as a paper tiger . 
To see why , it is useful to recall some history . 
Throughout the twentieth century , the US intervened repeatedly in Latin America to topple or subvert governments it did not like : in Cuba , Nicaragua , the Dominican Republic , Panama , Guatemala , Haiti , El Salvador , Chile , and Grenada , to name only the most prominent cases . 
During the Cold War , successive US presidents were perfectly happy to send in troops , directly or indirectly , to ensure that friendly governments prevailed in the Americas ( and beyond ) . 
Now recall Western responses to previous Soviet and Russian incursions into strategically important countries : Hungary in 1956 , Czechoslovakia in 1968 , or Georgia in 2008 . 
Each time , the US refused to engage militarily with a state possessing the largest number of nuclear weapons on earth . 
To recite this history is not to approve it , but rather to try to understand how Russians might understand the legitimacy of Putin &apos;s actions . 
There is also the universal political dynamic whereby a foreign threat or crisis strengthens a leader domestically . 
Putin is getting the same bump in popularity from his Crimean adventure that then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher got from the Falklands War in 1982 . 
Even left-wing intellectuals are lining up to support Putin for protecting ethnic Russians from what the Kremlin and its allied media portray as &quot; fascist &quot; Ukrainian nationalism . 
Against this backdrop , US Secretary of State John Kerry is right to make clear that NATO is not contemplating a military response of any kind . 
He would do even better to hand off responsibility as lead negotiator and spokesman in this crisis to a group of EU leaders : EU High Representative Catherine Ashton , Merkel , UK Prime Minister David Cameron , and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk . 
The EU as a whole has far more extensive economic ties - and hence influence - with Russia than the US does . 
The EU is Russia &apos;s largest trading partner - the US is in fifth place , behind China and Ukraine . 
Roughly half of Russian foreign direct investment in 2012 went to the Netherlands , Cyprus , and Switzerland ( which is not an EU member , but is subject to EU pressure ) , while an estimated 75 % of Russia &apos;s inward FDI comes from EU countries . 
Finally , Russian oligarchs own more property in London and the south of France than they do in New York or Miami . 
Moreover , EU pressure on Russia is less likely to whip up Russian nationalism than US &quot; interference &quot; in Russia &apos;s neighborhood . 
For starters , Ukraine is in the EU &apos;s neighborhood as well . 
But , more important , the EU does not remind Russians daily of their post-Soviet losses and humiliation on the global stage in the same way that the US does . 
The US has far fewer Russia experts in politics today than it did two decades ago , because most American foreign policymakers have been paying far more attention to China , India , and the Middle East . 
No country , much less a former superpower , likes to be ignored . 
Finally , if the US steps back , the EU , the United Nations , and even China can remind the Russians of the political consequences of flagrantly violating international law and swallowing up impoverished , restive territories that will prove far harder to digest than the fixed referendum results would suggest . 
The Muslim Tatars - roughly 15 % of Crimea &apos;s population - strongly oppose joining the Russian Federation and may become a permanent thorn in its side , along with the 25 % of Ukrainian-speaking Crimeans who have been silenced over the past ten days . 
The US and European decision to impose some economic sanctions now , with the possibility of adopting tougher and broader sanctions later , is not a sign of weakness but of strategic calculation . 
Heavier weapons remain in the diplomatic arsenal to deter Putin from trying to carve off further sections of Ukraine ; in the meantime , markets are imposing additional economic costs on all Russians . 
It is now equally important to strengthen the moderate members of the new Ukrainian government and to reduce the influence of right-wing nationalists who would trample on the rights of Russian-speaking Ukrainians . 
From the French Revolution to Egypt and Syria , extremists have repeatedly overtaken moderates and then proceeded to mimic the tactics and politics of the government they originally united to overthrow . 
That is not to say that the US , the EU , and other concerned actors should not do everything possible to ensure that Ukraine &apos;s people , whatever language they speak and religion they practice , gain the rights and prosperity that they desperately seek . 
For the US , the defense of universal values is , according to President Barack Obama &apos;s National Security Strategy , a core American interest . 
But the way to pursue that interest in this case is not to invite a Cold War-style face-off .
