A German Conservative Credo 
Few concepts are as elastic as that of &quot; Conservatism . &quot; 
At one end of its spectrum of meanings , conservatism has ( over the last two decades ) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civic life of greed and grab . 
At the other end , conservatism in many European countries has historically veered too close for comfort to right-wing extremism . 
In Germany today , conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic &apos;s failures , experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives . 
This history accounts for the type of conservatism practiced by the Christian-Democratic Union ( CDU ) and Christian-Social Union ( CSU ) , who focus on moderation and balance , preservation and innovation , and on commanding Germany &apos;s political center . 
With federal elections due in Germany this autumn , much will be said about the nature of German conservatism . 
Some , looking at CDU / CSU candidate for Chancellor Edmund Stoiber &apos;s emphasis on Bavaria &apos;s economic success , will seek to portray the coalition as shaded dangerously by the &quot; anything goes &quot; market conservatism practiced in America . 
Others , pointing to the German conservatives &apos; emphasis on social values , will say that we are as statist as the Social Democrats . 
The truth itself is far more complex than these facile comparisons , which also makes it more durable . 
CDU / CSU policies are , of course , founded on the idea of individual freedom , but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and the Christian tradition . 
We are skeptical about unfettered individualism because of our awareness of man &apos;s sins , but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and aberrations in Germany &apos;s 20 th century history . 
Yet , despite this deeply ingrained skepticism about human nature , we embrace humanity &apos;s talent for progress and innovation , because we recognize man &apos;s ability to correct mistakes and errors . 
These two traits , although they seem to conflict , and are certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives , nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that Germany now requires . 
Far from being willing to coerce people to live in a certain way , German conservatives seek a politics that recognizes limits - the limits of the state , the market , and the individual . 
We conceive of politics as a mechanism to reconcile enduring conflicts , such as those that exist between freedom and security . 
Each , indeed , is unsustainable without the other . 
Security is useless without freedom , but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security . 
The social market economy , which we continue to embrace , is based on these principles . 
It sees competition as the most effective means to promote economic growth , but also embraces state interference , when necessary , to secure equality of opportunity , social solidarity , and social balance . 
This interference is also intended to help avoid the &quot; economization &quot; of all aspects of civic life . 
The market is merely a tool , not an answer to every human problem . 
It is in recognition of this fact that German conservatives strive , for example , to strike a balance between economy and ecology . 
We feel responsible , on a global level , for the environment , which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world . 
For globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity . 
As we open ourselves to the wind &apos;s of globalization , we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity , such as the family , local and regional communities , religious communities , and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglected in recent years . 
This is the principle of &quot; subsidiarity &quot; which supports placing decision-making power , wherever and whenever possible , in governmental bodies nearest to the individual citizen . 
This is of particular importance for our ideas about the European Union , where we seek an effective balance between the nation and Europe . 
For German conservatives , European integration and national identity are not warring concepts , as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others . 
They are , instead , two sides of the same coin . 
The EU was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation . 
Decades later , the European Union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constituent nations , as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations , because a common European identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a unitary constitutional structure . 
In essence , the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept . 
Indeed , only an ongoing skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both of the statist and market fundamentalist variety - can promote pluralism and tolerance , and avoid a ballooning of the bureaucracy that enfeebles our economy . 
In a fast changing world , this skepticism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike . 
Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism , for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future . 
Moderation , tolerance , and a capacity for reform in equal measure are the watchwords of today &apos;s German conservatism .
