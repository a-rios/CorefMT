Mountains and Minarets 
New York - Switzerland has four mosques with minarets and a population of 350.000 nominal Muslims , mostly Europeans from Bosnia and Kosovo , of which about 13 % regularly go to prayer . 
Not a huge problem , one might have thought . 
Yet 57.5 % of Swiss voters opted in a referendum for a constitutional ban on minarets , allegedly because of worries about &quot; fundamentalism &quot; and the &quot; creeping Islamization &quot; of Switzerland . 
Are the Swiss more bigoted than other Europeans ? 
Probably not . 
Referendums are a measure of popular gut feelings , rather than considered opinion , and popular gut feelings are rarely liberal . 
Referendums on this issue in other European countries might well produce startlingly similar results . 
To attribute the Swiss vote to ban minarets - an idea that was promoted by the right-wing Swiss People &apos;s Party , but by none of the other political parties - to &quot; Islamophobia &quot; is perhaps to miss the point . 
To be sure , a long history of mutual Christian-Muslim hostility , and recent cases of radical Islamist violence , have made many people fearful of Islam in a way that they are not of Hinduism , say , or Buddhism . 
And the minaret , piercing the sky like a missile , is easily caricatured as a fearsome image . 
But if the Swiss and other Europeans were self-assured about their own identities , their Muslim fellow-citizens probably would not strike such fear in their hearts . 
And that might be the problem . 
It was not so long ago that the majority of citizens in the Western world had their own unquestioned symbols of collective faith and identity . 
The church spires that grace many European cities still meant something to most people . 
Few people married outside their own faith . 
Until recently , too , many Europeans believed in their kings and queens , flew their national flags , sang their national anthems , were taught heroic versions of their national histories . 
Foreign travel was for soldiers , diplomats , and rich people . 
&quot; Identity &quot; was not yet seen as a problem . 
Most of us live in a secular , liberal , disenchanted world . 
The lives of most Europeans are freer now than ever before . 
We are no longer told what to do or think by priests or our social superiors . 
But there has been a price to pay for our newly liberated world . 
Freedom from faith and tradition has not always led to greater contentment , but , on the contrary , to widespread bewilderment , fear , and resentment . 
While demonstrations of collective identity have not entirely disappeared , they are largely confined to football stadiums , where celebration ( and disappointment ) can quickly boil over in violence and resentment . 
Populist demagogues blame political , cultural , and commercial elites for the anxieties of the modern world . 
They are accused , not entirely without reason , of imposing mass immigration , economic crisis , and loss of national identity on ordinary citizens . 
But if the elites are hated for causing our modern malaise , the Muslims are envied for still having faith , for knowing who they are , for having something that is worth dying for . 
It is unimportant that many European Muslims are just as disenchanted and secular as their non-Muslim fellow-citizens . 
It is the perception that counts . 
Those soaring minarets , those black headscarves , are threatening because they rub salt in the wounds of those who feel the loss of their own faith . 
It is not surprising that anti-Muslim populism has found some of its most ferocious supporters among former leftists , for they , too , have lost their faith - in world revolution , or whatnot . 
Many of these leftists , before their turn to revolution , came from religious backgrounds . 
In their hostility to Islam , they like to talk about defending &quot; Enlightenment values , &quot; whereas in fact they lament the collapse of faith , whether religious or secular . 
There is , alas , no immediate cure for the kind of social ills exposed by the Swiss referendum . 
The Pope has an answer , of course . 
He would like people to return to the bosom of Rome . 
Evangelical preachers , too , have a recipe for salvation . 
Neo-conservatives , for their part , see the European malaise as a form of typical Old World decadence , a collective state of nihilism bred by welfare states and soft dependence on hard American power . 
Their answer is a revived Western world , led by the United States , engaged in an armed crusade for democracy . 
But , unless one is a Catholic , a born-again Christian , or a neo-con , none of these visions is promising . 
The best we can hope for is that liberal democracies will muddle through this period of unease - that demagogic temptations will be resisted , and violent impulses contained . 
After all , democracies have weathered worse crises in the past . 
That said , it would surely help if we had fewer referendums . 
For , contrary to what some believe , they do not strengthen democracy .
