A Dream for the Digital Age 
PRINCETON - Fifty years ago , Martin Luther King dreamed of an America that would one day deliver on its promise of equality for all of its citizens , black as well as white . 
Today , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has a dream , too : he wants to provide Internet access to the world &apos;s five billion people who do not now have it . 
Zuckerberg &apos;s vision may sound like a self-interested push to gain more Facebook users . 
But the world currently faces a growing technological divide , with implications for equality , liberty , and the right to pursue happiness that are no less momentous than the racial divide against which King preached . 
Around the world , more than two billion people live in the Digital Age . 
They can access a vast universe of information , communicate at little or no cost with their friends and family , and connect with others with whom they can cooperate in new ways . 
The other five billion are still stuck in the Paper Age in which my generation grew up . 
In those days , if you wanted to know something but did not own an expensive encyclopedia ( or your encyclopedia was no longer sufficiently up-to-date to tell you what you wanted to know ) , you had to go to a library and spend hours searching for what you needed . 
To contact friends or colleagues overseas , you had to write them a letter and wait at least two weeks for a reply . 
International phone calls were prohibitively expensive , and the idea of actually seeing someone while you talked to them was the stuff of science fiction . 
Internet.org , a global partnership launched by Zuckerberg last month , plans to bring the two-thirds of the world &apos;s population without Internet access into the Digital Age . 
The partnership consists of seven major information-technology companies , as well as non-profit organizations and local communities . 
Knowing that you cannot ask people to choose between buying food and buying data , the partnership will seek new , less expensive means of connecting computers , more data-efficient software , and new business models . 
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has suggested that Internet access is not a high priority for the poorest countries . 
It is more important , he says , to tackle problems like diarrhea and malaria . 
Yet his position seems curiously lacking in big-picture awareness of how the Internet could transform the lives of the very poor . 
For example , if farmers could use it to get more accurate predictions of favorable conditions for planting , or to obtain higher prices for their harvest , they would be better able to afford sanitation , so that their children do not get diarrhea , and bed nets to protect themselves and their families against malaria . 
A friend working to provide family-planning advice to poor Kenyans recently told me that so many women were coming to the clinic that she could not spend more than five minutes with each . 
These women have only one source of advice , and one opportunity to get it , but if they had access to the Internet , the information could be there for them whenever they wanted it . 
Moreover , online consultations would be possible , sparing women the need to travel to clinics . 
Internet access would also bypass the problem of illiteracy , building on the oral traditions that are strong in many rural cultures and enabling communities to create self-help groups and share their problems with peers in other villages . 
What is true for family planning is true for a very wide range of topics , especially those that are difficult to speak about , like homosexuality and domestic violence . 
The Internet is helping people to understand that they are not alone , and that they can learn from others &quot; experience . 
Enlarging our vision still more , it is not absurd to hope that putting the world &apos;s poor online would result in connections between them and more affluent people , leading to more assistance . 
Research shows that people are more likely to donate to a charity helping the hungry if they are given a photo and told the name and age of a girl like those the charity is aiding . 
If a mere photo and a few identifying details can do that , what might Skyping with the person do ? 
Providing universal Internet access is a project on a scale similar to sequencing the human genome , and , like the human-genome project , it will raise new risks and sensitive ethical issues . 
Online scammers will have access to a new and perhaps more gullible audience . 
Breaches of copyright will become even more widespread than they are today ( although they will cost the copyright owners very little , because the poor would be very unlikely to be able to buy books or other copyrighted material ) . 
Moreover , the distinctiveness of local cultures may be eroded , which has both a good and a bad side , for such cultures can restrict freedom and deny equality of opportunity . 
On the whole , though , it is reasonable to expect that giving poor people access to knowledge and the possibility of connecting with people anywhere in the world will be socially transforming in a very positive way .
