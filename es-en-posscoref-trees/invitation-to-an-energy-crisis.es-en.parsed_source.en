Invitation to an Energy Crisis 
DALLAS - As rising consumption and nationalism in OPEC countries pushes down their crude-oil exports and forces international oil companies to invest in high-cost areas with small reserves as global demand continues to grow , oil prices might ultimately shatter the record set in 2008 . 
In the short run , heightened volatility will be the rule , owing to economic , political , natural , and technical factors . 
One has only to examine the recent past to see why . 
While speculators can affect prices in the short run and increase price volatility , market fundamentals and government actions explain the spectacular rise in oil prices between 2003 and mid-2008 . 
During this period , world oil demand increased , mostly in developing countries , while production remained relatively flat from 2005 to 2008 . 
The only way to meet growing demand was to use OPEC &apos;s spare capacity and commercial inventories . 
Once spare capacity vanished and commercial inventories declined to critical levels relative to estimated future demand , oil prices started to break record after record . 
Let us consider some details . 
First , world crude-oil production declined by 266,000 barrels per day in 2006 and 460,000 b / d in 2007 . 
Meanwhile , world oil demand increased by 1.2 mb / d in 2006 and 937,000 b / d in 2007 . 
Second , the difference between actual output and what the markets expected magnified the impact of falling production . 
For example , forecasts at the end of 2006 predicted an increase in world oil production of 1.8 million b / d in 2007 , but production actually decreased by 460,000 b / d . 
The market factored in the missing increase and thus reacted to a decline of 2.26 million b / d , not the actual decline of 460,000 b / d . 
Third , OPEC &apos;s crude-oil production fell by about 280,000 b / d in 2006 and 381,000 b / d in 2007 , with a profound impact on prices . 
Most models , including those of the International Energy Agency , the US Energy Information Administration , and OPEC itself , employ behavioral variables to forecast world oil demand and non-OPEC production . 
However , they do not apply the same method to estimate OPEC production . 
Instead , they simply assume that OPEC will supply the difference between estimated world oil demand and non-OPEC supply , despite the fact that OPEC can no longer compensate for a decline in non-OPEC production or for higher-than-predicted demand . 
Fourth , lower production and increased domestic consumption drove down OPEC &apos;s net oil exports by about 1.8 million b / d in 2006 and 2007 , after increasing by about 4.8 million b / d between 2002 and 2005 . 
Indeed , top oil producers are joining the top oil consumers with annual oil consumption growth rates above 5 % . 
Fifth , in the long run , a weaker dollar decreases supply and increases demand . 
However , it seems that in the short run , the inverse relationship between oil prices and the dollar exists only under very specific circumstances , such as a crash in real-estate prices and volatile financial markets . 
Looking forward , in the short run , speculators will continue to fuel oil-price volatility as bullish and bearish factors steer them one way or the other . 
Economic recovery , a further decline in the dollar , low interest rates , weaker investment in 2009 , and various political factors are among the most frequently cited bullish factors , whereas weak and sluggish economic recovery , spare production capacity , and high inventories are among the most cited bearish factors . 
Market fundamentals will continue to determine the long-term trend in oil prices , and point to a tight market in which supply cannot keep pace with demand . 
As more poor countries join the club of emerging economies , and many subsidized renewable-energy projects fail in the developed and emerging economies , demand for oil will continue to grow . 
Oil exports of most oil-producing countries are expected to decline relative to their production as young populations , higher incomes , urbanization , and power shortages continue to boost domestic consumption . 
Moreover , as oil-consuming countries aim for energy independence , producing countries will try to shield themselves by building energy-intensive industries so they can export oil embedded in industrial products . 
If the dollar continues to decline , it will exacerbate the situation , reducing world oil supply and increasing demand in countries with appreciating currencies . 
When it comes to the price of oil , production does not matter . 
Exports do . 
The fear is that OPEC exports will decline at a time when the leaders of the major consuming countries fail to deliver the promised &quot; green &quot; economies . 
Under this scenario , we could be witnessing an energy crisis in the making .
