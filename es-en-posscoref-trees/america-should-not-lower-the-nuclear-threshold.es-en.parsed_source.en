America Should Not Lower the Nuclear Threshold 
President Bush has pushed stopping the spread of nuclear weapons to the top of the international agenda . 
Ironic , then , that America &apos;s nuclear weapons development program may promote the very proliferation it seeks to prevent , as US Senator Dianne Feinstein explains . 
With the world &apos;s focus on the debate over Iraq , the war on terror , and the Bush administration &apos;s doctrine of unilateral preemption , the American government &apos;s new emphasis on the utility of nuclear weapons has not received the attention it deserves . 
This is unfortunate , as this exploration of new uses for nuclear weapons represents a revolutionary shift in US national security policy . 
Today , the world faces unprecedented challenges at the nexus of terror and weapons of mass destruction . 
With both North Korea and Iran openly pursuing nuclear ambitions and a potential nuclear arms race in South Asia , it is critical that America provide leadership , in both word and in deed , to reduce the risks and the role of nuclear weapons throughout the world . 
Instead , the Bush administration seems intent on doing just the opposite . 
Many of the actions of the American administration , and much of the US government &apos;s rhetoric , may actually be increasing the threat from nuclear weapons rather than making the world safer . 
The Bush administration &apos;s January 2002 Nuclear Posture Review signaled a major change in US nuclear policy by advancing a new triad that integrates nuclear weapons with conventional strike options and blurring the line between the use of conventional and nuclear weapons . 
It also specified scenarios in which the US might use nuclear weapons first , even against non-nuclear states , and called for a new generation of US nuclear warheads , including low yield or so-called &quot; mini-nukes . &quot; 
The US has never had a no-first-strike policy , but it has likewise never had a policy such as that embodied in the Nuclear Policy Review . 
Today , under the terms of the ideas set out in that review , the US contemplates the first use of nuclear weapons , and seeks to integrate tactical battlefield nuclear weapons alongside conventional munitions . 
Despite efforts to downplay the significance of the Nuclear Posture Review since its publication , it remains , in my view , extremely provocative and dangerous . 
Earlier this year , at a hearing of the US Senate &apos;s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , I asked Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham , whose Department oversees America &apos;s research and development of nuclear weapons , whether the Bush administration wanted to develop new low-yield nuclear weapons . 
Secretary Abraham said it did not ; that his department was only studying adaptations of existing weapons . 
Yet , there should be no doubt that the Bush administration is beginning the research and development of new nuclear weapons . 
Just this year , a 10-year-old ban on the research and development of nuclear weapons below five kilotons - the bomb at Hiroshima was 15 kilotons - was eliminated . 
Pushed by the Bush administration , Congress authorized $ 21 million for the study and development of new nuclear weapons , including a 100-kiloton bunker buster , as well as tactical battlefield nuclear weapons . 
Moreover , the time to test readiness of the Nevada test site has been moved up from three years to two years , and funding has been provided to produce additional fissile material for new nuclear weapons . 
I argued and voted against these new nuclear initiatives in the US Senate earlier this year . 
Clearly , the nuclear door is being reopened . 
For , by taking the steps called for in the Nuclear Posture Review - specifically , developing &quot; new capabilities ... to defeat emerging threats , &quot; including &quot; extensive research and timely fielding of 
This approach is not in America &apos;s national interest , nor is it consistent with American traditions and values . 
A first-use of nuclear weapons by the US should be unthinkable , and responding to a non-nuclear attack with nuclear weapons violates a central tenet of just war and US military tradition . 
Indeed , nuclear options should not be considered as an extension of conventional options . 
Why ? 
Because this inevitably lowers the threshold for use . 
So , if the US develops nuclear weapons that blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear forces , the message this sends to the rest of the world must be considered . 
I believe it is critical that the US set a very high international standard for nuclear restraint . 
If America does not , it may very likely encourage others to develop their own standards and their own nuclear arsenals . 
That seems to be happening . 
Both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers , and the history of bloody warfare between them presents a major and ongoing security threat to South Asia . 
If either country adhered to the thinking embodied in the Bush administration &apos;s new nuclear policy , there would be little reason for each not to seek to integrate nuclear weapons even more deeply into their own contingency plans - and possibly use them . 
At a time when the US brands as &quot; evil &quot; certain countries based , in part , on their pursuit of nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction , it must be especially careful in how it considers its own options and contingencies regarding nuclear weapons . 
If the US is not careful , our own new nuclear posture could provoke the very nuclear-proliferation activities we are seeking to prevent .
