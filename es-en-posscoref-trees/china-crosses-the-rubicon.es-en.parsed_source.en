China Crosses the Rubicon 
LONDON - For two decades , Chinese diplomacy has been guided by the concept of the country &apos;s &quot; peaceful rise . &quot; 
Today , however , China needs a new strategic doctrine , because the most remarkable aspect of Sri Lanka &apos;s recent victory over the Tamil Tigers is not its overwhelming nature , but the fact that China provided President Mahinda Rajapaska with both the military supplies and diplomatic cover he needed to prosecute the war . 
Without that Chinese backing , Rajapaska &apos;s government would have had neither the wherewithal nor the will to ignore world opinion in its offensive against the Tigers . 
So , not only has China become central to every aspect of the global financial and economic system , it has now demonstrated its strategic effectiveness in a region traditionally outside its orbit . 
On Sri Lanka &apos;s beachfront battlefields , China &apos;s &quot; peaceful rise &quot; was completed . 
What will this change mean in practice in the world &apos;s hot spots like North Korea , Pakistan , and Central Asia ? 
Before the global financial crisis hit , China benefited mightily from the long boom along its eastern and southern rim , with only Burma and North Korea causing instability . 
China &apos;s west and south , however , have become sources of increasing worry . 
Given economic insecurity within China in the wake of the financial crisis and global recession , China &apos;s government finds insecurity in neighbouring territories more threatening than ever . 
Stabilizing its neighbourhood is one reason why China embraces the six-party talks with North Korea , has become a big investor in Pakistan ( while exploring ways to cooperate with President Barack Obama &apos;s special representative , Richard Holbrooke ) , signed on to a joint Asia / Europe summit declaration calling for the release from detention of Burmese opposition leader Daw Aung Suu Kyi , and intervened to help end Sri Lanka &apos;s 26-year civil war . 
The calculus behind China &apos;s emerging national security strategy is simple . 
Without peace and prosperity around China &apos;s long borders , there can be no peace , prosperity , and unity at home . 
China &apos;s intervention in Sri Lanka , and its visibly mounting displeasure with the North Korean and Burmese regimes , suggests that this calculus has quietly become central to the government &apos;s thinking . 
For example , though China said little in public about Russia &apos;s invasion and dismemberment of Georgia last summer , Russia is making a strategic mistake if it equates China &apos;s public silence with tacit acquiescence in the Kremlin &apos;s claim to &quot; privileged &quot; influence in the post-Soviet countries to China &apos;s west . 
Proof of China &apos;s displeasure was first seen at the 2008 summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( a regional grouping that includes former Soviet countries that share borders with China and Russia ) . 
Russian President Dmitri Medvedev pushed the SCO to recognize the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
The group &apos;s Central Asian members - Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan - would not have stood up to the Kremlin without China &apos;s support . 
At this year &apos;s just-concluded SCO summit , the pattern continued . 
The brief appearance of Iran &apos;s disputed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may have gained all the headlines , but China &apos;s announcement of a $ 10 billion fund to support the budgets of financially distressed ex-Soviet states , which followed hard on a $ 3 billion investment in Turkmenistan and a $ 10 billion investment in Kazakhstan , provides more evidence that China now wants to shape events across Eurasia . Vladimir Putin famously described the break-up of the Soviet Union as the greatest geo-political catastrophe of the twentieth century . From China &apos;s standpoint , however , the Soviet collapse was the greatest strategic gain imaginable . 
At a stroke , the empire that had gobbled up Chinese territories for centuries vanished . 
The Soviet military threat - once so severe that Chairman Mao invited President Richard Nixon to China to change the Cold War balance of power - was eliminated . 
China &apos;s new assertiveness suggests that it will not allow Russia to forge a de facto Soviet Reunion and thus undo the post-Cold War settlement , under which China &apos;s economy flourished and security increased . 
So far , China &apos;s rulers have regarded emerging strategic competition with India , Japan , Russia , and the United States as a jostling for influence in Central and South Asia . 
China &apos;s strategic imperatives in this competition are twofold : to ensure that no rival acquires a dangerous &quot; privileged influence &quot; in any of its border regions ; and to promote stability so that trade , and the sea lanes through which it passes ( hence China &apos;s interest in Sri Lanka and in combating Somali pirates ) , is protected . 
In the 1990s , China sought to mask its &quot; peaceful rise &quot; behind a policy of &quot; smile diplomacy &quot; designed to make certain that its neighbours did not fear it . 
China lowered trade barriers and offered soft loans and investments to help its southern neighbours . 
Today , China &apos;s government seeks to shape the diplomatic agenda in order to increase China &apos;s options while constricting those of potential adversaries . 
Instead of remaining diplomatically aloof , China is forging more relationships with its neighbours than any of its rivals . 
This informal web is being engineered not only to keep its rivals from coalescing or gaining privileged influence , but also to restrain the actions of China &apos;s local partners so as to dampen tension anywhere it might flare up . 
China &apos;s newfound assertiveness , rather than creating fear , should be seen as establishing the necessary conditions for comprehensive negotiations about the very basis of peaceful coexistence and stability in Asia : respect for all sides &quot; vital interests . 
In recent years , such an approach ran counter to America &apos;s foreign-policy predisposition of favouring universalist doctrines over a careful balancing of national interests . 
With the Obama administration embracing realism as its diplomatic lodestar , China may have found a willing interlocutor .
