Asia Exposed 
NEW HAVEN - Asian authorities were understandably smug in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 . 
Growth in the region slowed sharply , as might be expected of export-led economies confronted with the sharpest collapse in global trade since the 1930 &quot; s . 
But , with the notable exception of Japan , which suffered its deepest recession of the modern era , Asia came through an extraordinarily tough period in excellent shape . 
That was then . 
This time it is from Europe , where a raging sovereign-debt crisis threatens to turn a mild recession into something far worse : a possible Greek exit from the euro , which could trigger contagion across the eurozone . 
This is a big deal for Asia . 
Financial and trade linkages make Asia highly vulnerable to Europe &apos;s malaise . 
Owing to the former , the risks to Asia from a European banking crisis cannot be taken lightly . 
Lacking well-developed capital markets as an alternative source of credit , bank-funding channels are especially vital in Asia . 
Indeed , the Asian Development Bank estimates that European banks fund about 9 % of total domestic credit in developing Asia - three times the share of financing provided by banks based in the United States . 
The role of European banks is especially significant in Singapore and Hong Kong - the region &apos;s two major financial centers . 
That means that Asia is far more exposed to an offshore banking crisis today than it was in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers &quot; collapse in 2008 , which led to a near-meltdown of the US banking system . 
The transmission effects through trade linkages are just as worrying . 
Historically , the US was modern Asia &apos;s largest source of external demand . 
Seduced by China &apos;s spectacular growth , the region shifted from US- to China-centric export growth . 
That seemed like a good move . 
Combined shipments to the US and Europe fell to 24 % of developing Asia &apos;s total exports in 2010 - down sharply from 34 % in 1998-1999 . 
Meanwhile , over the same period , Asia &apos;s dependence on intraregional exports - trade flows within the region - expanded sharply , from 36 % of total exports in 1998 to 44 % in 2010 . 
These numbers seem to paint a comforting picture of an increasingly autonomous Asia that can better withstand the blows from the West &apos;s recurring crises . 
But research by the International Monetary Fund shows that , beneath the veneer , 60-65 % of all trade flows in the region can be classified as &quot; intermediate goods &quot; - components that are made in countries like Korea and Taiwan , assembled in China , and ultimately shipped out as finished goods to the West . 
With Europe and the US still accounting for the largest shares of China &apos;s end-market exports , there can be no escaping the tight linkages of Asia &apos;s China-centric supply chain to the ups and downs of demand in the major developed economies . 
Moreover , there is an important and worrisome twist to those linkages : China itself has tilted increasingly toward Europe as its major source of external demand . 
In 2007 , the European Union surpassed the US as China &apos;s largest export market . 
By 2010 , the EU accounted for 20 % of total Chinese exports , while the US share was just 18 % . 
In other words , a China-centric Asian supply chain has made a big bet on the grand European experiment - a bet that now appears to be backfiring . 
Indeed , in China , a now-familiar pattern is playing out yet again - another slowdown in domestic growth stemming from a crisis in the advanced economies of the West . 
And , as goes China , so will go the rest of an increasingly integrated Asia . 
The good news is that , so far , the downside has been much better contained than was the case in late 2008 and early 2009 . 
Back then , Chinese exports went from boom to bust in just seven months - from 26 % annual growth in July 2008 to a 27 % decline in February 2009 . 
This time , the annual export gain has slowed from 20 % in 2011 to 5 % in April 2012 - a significant deceleration , to be sure , but one that stops well short of the previous outright collapse . 
That could change in the event of a disorderly euro breakup , but , barring that outcome , there is reason to be more sanguine this time around . 
The bad news is that Asia seems to be learning little from repeated external demand shocks . 
In the end , internal demand is the only effective defense against external vulnerability . 
Yet the region has failed to construct that firewall . 
On the contrary , private consumption fell to a record-low 45 % of developing Asia &apos;s GDP in 2010 - down ten percentage points from 2002 . 
In these circumstances , immunity from external shocks - or &quot; decoupling , &quot; as it is often called - seems fanciful . 
As with most things in Asia nowadays , China holds the key to supplying Asia &apos;s missing consumer demand . 
The recently enacted 12th Five-Year Plan ( 2011-15 ) has all the right ingredients to produce the ultimate buffer between the dynamism of the East and the perils of a crisis-battered West . 
But , as the euro crisis causes China &apos;s economy to slow for the second time in three and a half years , there can be little doubt that implementation of the Plan &apos;s pro-consumption rebalancing is lagging . 
There are no oases of prosperity in a crisis-prone globalized world . 
That is equally true for Asia , the world &apos;s fastest-growing region . 
As Europe &apos;s crisis deepens , the twin channels of financial and trade linkages have placed Asia &apos;s economies in a vice . 
Rebalancing is the only way out for China and its partners in the Asian supply chain . 
Until that occurs , the vice now gripping Asia will only continue to tighten .
