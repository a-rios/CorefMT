Fraud , Fools , and Financial Markets 
NEW HAVEN - Adam Smith famously wrote of the &quot; invisible hand , &quot; by which individuals &quot; pursuit of self-interest in free , competitive markets advances the interest of society as a whole . 
And Smith was right : Free markets have generated unprecedented prosperity for individuals and societies alike . 
But , because we can be manipulated or deceived or even just passively tempted , free markets also persuade us to buy things that are good neither for us nor for society . 
This observation represents an important codicil to Smith &apos;s vision . 
And it is one that George Akerlof and I explore in our new book , Phishing for Phools : The Economics of Manipulation and Deception . 
Most of us have suffered &quot; phishing &quot; : unwanted emails and phone calls designed to defraud us . 
A &quot; phool &quot; is anyone who does not fully comprehend the ubiquity of phishing . 
A phool sees isolated examples of phishing , but does not appreciate the extent of professionalism devoted to it , nor how deeply this professionalism affects lives . 
Sadly , a lot of us have been phools - including Akerlof and me , which is why we wrote this book . 
Routine phishing can affect any market , but our most important observations concern financial markets - timely enough , given the massive boom in the equity and real-estate markets since 2009 , and the turmoil in global asset markets since last month . 
As too many optimists have learned to their detriment , asset prices are highly volatile , and a whole ocean of phishes is involved . 
Borrowers are lured into unsuitable mortgages ; firms are stripped of their assets ; accountants mislead investors ; financial advisers spin narratives of riches from nowhere ; and the media promote extravagant claims . 
But the losers in the downturns are not just those who have been duped . 
A chain of additional losses occurs when the inflated assets have been purchased with borrowed money . 
In that case , bankruptcies and fear of bankruptcy spawn an epidemic of further bankruptcies , reinforcing fear . 
Then credit dries up and the economy collapses . 
This vicious downward spiral for business confidence typically features phishes - for example , the victims of Bernard Madoff &apos;s Ponzi scheme - discovered only after the period of irrational exuberance has ended . 
Epidemics , in economics as much as in medicine , call for an immediate and drastic response . 
The response by the authorities to the Great Crash of 1929 was small and slow , and the world economy entered a &quot; Dark Age &quot; that lasted through the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Second World War . 
The 2007-2009 financial crisis portended a similar outcome , but this time the world &apos;s governments and central banks intervened promptly , in a coordinated fashion , and with an appropriately high volume of stimulus . 
The recovery has been weak ; but we are nowhere near a new Dark Age . 
For that we should be grateful . 
Yet some now argue that the fiscal and monetary authorities should not have responded so quickly or strongly when the 2007-2009 crisis erupted . 
They believe that the primary cause of the crisis was what economists call moral hazard : because risk-takers expected that the authorities would intervene to protect them when their bets went awry , they took even greater risks . 
By contrast , our view ( supported by plenty of data ) is that rapidly rising prices usually reflect irrational exuberance , aided and abetted by phishes . 
The irrationally exuberant were not thinking of the returns they would garner if the authorities intervened to maintain the economy and the flow of credit ( or , in extreme cases , moved to bail out their bank or enterprise ) . 
Such possibilities were a marginal consideration in the euphoria preceding the 2007-2009 crisis : those selling at inflated prices were making profits ; and buyers &quot; knew &quot; they were doing the right thing - even when they weren &apos;t . 
The reluctance to acknowledge the need for immediate intervention in a financial crisis is based on a school of economics that fails to account for the irrational exuberance that I have explored elsewhere , and that ignores the aggressive marketing and other realities of digital-age markets examined in Phishing for Phools . 
But adhering to an approach that overlooks these factors is akin to doing away with fire departments , on the grounds that without them people would be more careful - and so there would then be no fires . 
We found out many years ago , to the world &apos;s great regret , what happens when a financial epidemic is allowed to run its course . 
Our analysis indicates that not only are there endemic and natural forces that make the financial system highly volatile ; but also that swift , effective intervention is needed in the face of financial collapse . 
We need to give free rein to fiscal and monetary authorities to take aggressive steps when financial turmoil turns into financial crisis . 
One Dark Age is one too many .
