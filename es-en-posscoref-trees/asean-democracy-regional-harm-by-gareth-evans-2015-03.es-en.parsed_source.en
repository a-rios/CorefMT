Trashing the ASEAN Brand 
CANBERRA - Having a reputation for integrity and decency matters as much in international relations as in professional and personal life . 
States that are so regarded consistently punch above their weight - witness the Scandinavians . 
By contrast , those that never earn - or fritter away - such a reputation can seriously endanger their own interests , jeopardizing trade , tourism , foreign investment , political support in international forums and negotiations , and the security of their own nationals abroad . 
Three of Southeast Asia &apos;s most important states - Malaysia , Thailand , and now Indonesia - have brought trouble on themselves in this respect in recent months . 
All three are raising serious doubts , in different ways , about their commitment to the rule of law , the integrity of their judicial systems , and the quality of mercy in the administration of justice . 
In Malaysia , the country &apos;s highest court last month rejected opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim &apos;s appeal against a five-year prison sentence and a ban against running for public office for a further five years - a shocking and indefensible decision . 
Prime Minister Najib Razak &apos;s government was transparently vindictive in pursuing allegations of sodomy ( a crime rarely prosecuted in Malaysia ) against Anwar . 
The evidence against him was obviously inconclusive ; and the court &apos;s acceptance of it was manifestly craven . 
If the fiction is maintained that the court was merely doing its judicial duty as it saw it , decency could still prevail : Anwar could be granted executive clemency . 
But there is no sign that Najib &apos;s government will advise such action . 
Anwar &apos;s real crime was that his opposition coalition of conservative Muslim , secular , and Chinese parties was seriously challenging the six-decade supremacy of Najib &apos;s United Malays National Organization ( UMNO ) , losing the 2013 election only because of a transparent gerrymander . 
In Thailand , the biggest crime of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his supporters was to keep winning national elections with populist campaigns that threatened the interests of the country &apos;s long-established Bangkok-based elite . 
Serious wrongdoing , involving bribery and institutional corruption , no doubt occurred along the way ; but the scale of such offenses could hardly justify last year &apos;s military coup and the subsequent repression . 
Some of those in the army-installed National Reform Council and Constitutional Drafting Committee have a real interest in ensuring that Thailand &apos;s next constitution - the 20th since 1932 - will be genuinely democratic . 
Many do want to end , once and for all , the corrupt , vote-buying culture that has long afflicted Thai politics on both sides . 
But true reform can be achieved only in a spirit of reconciliation , and the military regime &apos;s crude impeachment of deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ( Thaksin &apos;s sister ) in January - on trumped-up charges that seemed flimsy even to many of her diehard opponents - has made that impossible . 
The law , once again , has been used for nakedly political ends . 
Indonesia &apos;s case is different from the other two , and less extreme , but also troubling for the country &apos;s reputation . 
The grassroots-driven victory of President Joko &quot; Jokowi &quot; Widodo last year triumphantly consolidated the country &apos;s democratic transition , and raised high expectations for human-rights and anti-corruption campaigners . 
But , domestically , confidence in Jokowi &apos;s capacity and will to tackle corruption has eroded with his nomination - only very belatedly withdrawn - of a suspiciously wealthy but politically well-connected candidate for National Police Chief . 
Internationally , concern has been growing about Jokowi &apos;s stated determination to allow - after a long moratorium - the executions of scores of convicted drug traffickers to proceed . 
His stance reflects no consideration of whether their individual cases might justify clemency , as well as apparent indifference to mounting evidence that sentencing in capital cases might have owed less to a case &apos;s merits than to the presence or absence of bribes . 
Two Australian drug traffickers have been scheduled for execution this month . 
While no one doubts that they were properly convicted ten years ago , their behavior since - and questions about the integrity of the judicial process that condemned them to die but allowed others to live - has made a compelling case for the exercise of mercy , for them and for others . 
What does not yet seem to have registered with Jokowi , or with enough of his fellow citizens , is the incongruity of refusing even to consider clemency for those on Indonesia &apos;s death row , while lobbying passionately for clemency for more than 200 Indonesians condemned to die elsewhere , notably in the Gulf . 
Decency can be credibly demanded of others only if one practices it oneself . 
It seems only a matter of time before Indonesians start feeling the pain of this inconsistency . 
Malaysia has earned worldwide condemnation for its handling of the Anwar affair , and Thailand has lost many international friends since its latest coup , reflected in a humiliating loss in its recent bid for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council . 
Thai diplomats fear another such defeat in their country &apos;s current attempt to win a seat on the UN Security Council . 
There are some larger regional consequences in all of this . 
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) has tenaciously fought for its place as the geopolitical hinge between East and South Asia , and an important player in Asia-Pacific economic and security diplomacy . 
In doing so , it has had to repeatedly finesse issues like Cambodia &apos;s authoritarian leadership , Myanmar &apos;s struggle with democratic transition , Vietnam &apos;s stubbornly anachronistic one-party state , and even impeccably incorruptible Singapore &apos;s regular misuse of defamation laws to neutralize political opponents . 
The question that ASEAN leaders must now ask themselves is just how much trashing of the Southeast Asian brand , by how many of its members simultaneously , the region can afford while still fully realizing its aspirations for economic growth and political influence . 
It is always tempting to claim that what happens behind sovereign borders is nobody else &apos;s business . 
But that is no longer true in today &apos;s interconnected world . 
Some states may be big and powerful enough to get away with behaving badly , but winning respect for behaving well is a much stronger foundation for economic and political success .
