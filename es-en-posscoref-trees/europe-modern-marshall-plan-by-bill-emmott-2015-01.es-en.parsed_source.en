A &quot; Merkel Plan &quot; for Europe LONDON - Ever since Europe &apos;s economic crisis erupted more than four years ago , politicians and pundits have clamored for a grand solution , often invoking the example of America &apos;s postwar Marshall Plan , which , starting in 1948 , helped to rebuild Western Europe &apos;s shattered , debt-ridden economies . 
But the political moment has never been ripe . 
That could be about to change . 
Europe &apos;s situation today bears some similarities to the 1940s . 
Burdened by the public debts resulting from past mistakes , eurozone governments know what they need to do but not how to do it . 
They mistrust each other too much to collaborate . 
Meanwhile , demand in most of the European Union is weak , ruling out the economic growth needed to repay debts and offer hope to the 25 million unemployed . 
Parochial suspicion has been the main obstacle to a grand solution . 
No country &apos;s taxpayers have wanted to feel that they are paying for others &quot; excesses : the single currency did not impose shared responsibility . 
So creditor countries , led by Germany , have sought to do the minimum necessary to keep the euro alive , while debtors have grumbled impotently about Germany &apos;s insistence on fiscal austerity . 
The two sides disagree about the nature of the European sickness , and when there is no agreement on the diagnosis , it is hard to agree on a cure . 
Yet a convergence may be at hand , owing to developments in Greek , Spanish , and British politics , as well as to the simple passage of time . 
Greeks look poised to elect on January 25 a government dominated by the far-left Syriza party , which once stood for repudiation of the euro but now pledges to negotiate a restructuring of Greece &apos;s debts . 
Spain &apos;s most popular party ahead of the general election due at the end of this year is Podemos , which was founded only in January 2014 and has views similar to Syriza &apos;s . 
And the United Kingdom &apos;s election in May will rock the European boat by focusing on the question of when Britain should hold a referendum on whether to leave the EU . 
These political rumbles worry creditor countries , which is reflected in the frequency of warnings from Germany that any new Greek government must adhere to existing agreements . 
That is a sure indicator that Germany fears that Syriza will not do so . 
The bargaining has begun . 
The passage of time ought to help with this bargaining . 
Germany &apos;s formula for the euro crisis has been to insist on fiscal belt-tightening and structural reforms to reduce future public spending on pensions and wages , make labor markets more flexible , and boost productivity , all in return for emergency loans . 
Since the crisis began , the main recipients - Greece , Ireland , Spain , and Portugal - have been following that formula . 
As a result , it is becoming possible , in political terms , to say that the debtors have taken their punishment and have made their economies more competitive . 
Economic growth has rebounded strongly in Ireland , mildly in Spain and Portugal , and meagerly in Greece . 
What is now holding back these and other European economies is weak demand in the eurozone as a whole . 
That is why a modern version of the Marshall Plan is needed . 
Politically , it would be smart if German Chancellor Angela Merkel were to take the initiative in proposing such a grand solution , rather than being forced into piecemeal , reluctant concessions by new governments in Greece , Spain , or elsewhere . 
It would be even smarter to share that initiative with the leaders of Europe &apos;s other big economies : French President Fran√ßois Hollande , who , following the terrorist attacks earlier this month , is perhaps especially receptive to efforts to promote unity and economic growth , and British Prime Minister David Cameron , who would welcome signs of European reform . 
A modern Marshall Plan should have three main components . 
First , sovereign debt in the eurozone would be restructured to ease the pain suffered by Greece and Spain . 
Second , a collectively financed public-investment program would focus on energy and other infrastructure . 
Third , a timetable for the completion of single-market liberalizing reforms - notably for service industries and the digital economy - would be established . 
In Germany , debt restructuring would be the most controversial component . 
But Germans should be reminded that , along with Marshall Plan funds for Western Europe , the other big boost to Germany &apos;s postwar economic recovery came from debt restructuring . 
The London Agreement of 1953 canceled 50 % of Germany &apos;s public debt and restructured the other half to give the country much longer to repay . 
Though a write-off of eurozone debts would be politically difficult , it would be possible to refinance a large proportion with longer maturity Eurobonds , which all eurozone countries would underwrite . 
What is crucial is that such a remedy is extended to all eurozone members , rather than singling out one country ( Greece ) . 
By including the other components of public investment and single-market completion , the Merkel Plan ( or , better , the Merkel-Hollande-Cameron Plan ) would be able to restart economic growth while opening countries to more trade and greater competition . 
This addresses one of the principal British complaints about the EU : that it has so far failed to complete the single market , a project partly initiated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s . 
Of course , a modern Marshall Plan would face a wall of skepticism and obstruction by national interest groups . 
But , by standing together , European officials could win that battle . 
And if it is not tried , tomorrow &apos;s Europeans may never forgive today &apos;s leaders .
