Austerity Is the Only Deal-Breaker 
ATHENS - A common fallacy pervades coverage by the world &apos;s media of the negotiations between the Greek government and its creditors . 
The fallacy , exemplified in a recent commentary by Philip Stephens of the Financial Times , is that , &quot; Athens is unable or unwilling - or both - to implement an economic reform program . &quot; 
Once this fallacy is presented as fact , it is only natural that coverage highlights how our government is , in Stephens &apos;s words , &quot; squandering the trust and goodwill of its eurozone partners . &quot; 
But the reality of the talks is very different . 
Our government is keen to implement an agenda that includes all of the economic reforms emphasized by European economic think tanks . 
Moreover , we are uniquely able to maintain the Greek public &apos;s support for a sound economic program . 
Consider what that means : an independent tax agency ; reasonable primary fiscal surpluses forever ; a sensible and ambitious privatization program , combined with a development agency that harnesses public assets to create investment flows ; genuine pension reform that ensures the social-security system &apos;s long-term sustainability ; liberalization of markets for goods and services , etc . 
So , if our government is willing to embrace the reforms that our partners expect , why have the negotiations not produced an agreement ? 
Where is the sticking point ? 
The problem is simple : Greece &apos;s creditors insist on even greater austerity for this year and beyond - an approach that would impede recovery , obstruct growth , worsen the debt-deflationary cycle , and , in the end , erode Greeks &quot; willingness and ability to see through the reform agenda that the country so desperately needs . 
Our government cannot - and will not - accept a cure that has proven itself over five long years to be worse than the disease . 
Our creditors &quot; insistence on greater austerity is subtle yet steadfast . 
It can be found in their demand that Greece maintain unsustainably high primary surpluses ( more than 2 % of GDP in 2016 and exceeding 2.5 % , or even 3 % , for every year thereafter ) . 
To achieve this , we are supposed to increase the overall burden of value-added tax on the private sector , cut already diminished pensions across the board ; and compensate for low privatization proceeds ( owing to depressed asset prices ) with &quot; equivalent &quot; fiscal consolidation measures . 
The view that Greece has not achieved sufficient fiscal consolidation is not just false ; it is patently absurd . 
The accompanying graph not only illustrates this ; it also succinctly addresses the question of why Greece has not done as well as , say , Spain , Portugal , Ireland , or Cyprus in the years since the 2008 financial crisis . 
Relative to the rest of the countries on the eurozone periphery , Greece was subjected to at least twice the austerity . 
There is nothing more to it than that . 
Following Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s recent election victory in the United Kingdom , my good friend Lord Norman Lamont , a former chancellor of the exchequer , remarked that the UK economy &apos;s recovery supports our government &apos;s position . 
Back in 2010 , he recalled , Greece and the UK faced fiscal deficits of more or less similar size ( relative to GDP ) . 
Greece returned to primary surpluses ( which exclude interest payments ) in 2014 , whereas the UK government consolidated much more gradually and has yet to return to surplus . 
At the same time , Greece has faced monetary contraction ( which has recently become monetary asphyxiation ) , in contrast to the UK , where the Bank of England has supported the government every step of the way . 
The result is that Greece is continuing to stagnate , whereas the UK has been growing strongly . 
Fair-minded observers of the four-month-long negotiations between Greece and its creditors cannot avoid a simple conclusion : The major sticking point , the only deal-breaker , is the creditors &quot; insistence on even more austerity , even at the expense of the reform agenda that our government is eager to pursue . 
Clearly , our creditors &quot; demand for more austerity has nothing to do with concerns about genuine reform or moving Greece onto a sustainable fiscal path . 
Their true motivation is a question best left to future historians - who , I have no doubt , will take much of the contemporary media coverage with a grain of salt .
