The Long March in Nepal 
KATMANDU - Confounding everyone except themselves , Nepal &apos;s hard-line Maoists have taken a commanding role following the country &apos;s landmark elections . 
The people of Nepal have more than one reason to celebrate . 
The first nationwide poll in nearly a decade passed off relatively well and was endorsed by Nepali officials as well as the hundreds of international election observers . 
According to former US President Jimmy Carter , the election was the most &quot; transformational &quot; of the many polls he has observed around the world . 
The high voter turnout , coupled with the relatively peaceful manner in which the election took place , is a testament to the Nepali people &apos;s desire to cement the peace process and contribute in determining the political future of the country . 
The Maoists , former rebels who until two years ago were waging a brutal &quot; people &apos;s &quot; war , will soon lead the next government in Nepal . 
The former rebels have received the maximum number of seats in the constituencies where counting is complete . 
Surprisingly , both local and international analysts had predicted them to finish third , behind the Nepali Congress ( NC ) and the United Marxist-Leninists ( UML ) , the two largest parties that have been at the helm since multi-party democracy was restored in Nepal in 1990 . 
While experts are busy trying to explain the Maoists &quot; unprecedented triumph , much hope rests on the newly elected members of the 601-seat Constituent Assembly . 
The Assembly &apos;s first responsibility will be to draft a new constitution that can help reunify Nepal &apos;s disparate communities . 
A second priority will be to decide the fate of Nepal &apos;s centuries-old monarchy . 
The Maoists ran on an anti-royalist platform , and it is widely anticipated that the first meeting of the Assembly will abolish the monarchy and declare Nepal a &quot; people &apos;s republic . &quot; 
But the king still has some support , though clearly far short of a majority . 
Nepal has had a long history of monarchy , spanning close to two and a half centuries , and bringing an end to this tradition might prove to be more difficult than expected . 
The Maoists &quot; willingness and ability to display a degree of sympathy and respect for their opponents will go a long way toward determining their success in office . 
It would certainly behoove the Assembly to give serious and immediate consideration to the country &apos;s deplorable socioeconomic conditions . 
Nepal is one of the world &apos;s poorest countries , ranking near the bottom even in the South Asian region . 
The incoming members of the Assembly therefore must address everyday issues - employment , healthcare , education , social justice , minority rights , security , etc . 
Suffice it to say that there Nepal faces a multitude of flashpoints , as well as a large number of detractors who would like to see this historic process derailed . 
The success or failure of the Constituent Assembly will rest on whether the presumptive winner , the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoists ) , will work collaboratively with the other parties rather than trying to push its own agenda exclusively . 
The main challenge for the Assembly is to forge onward , keeping in mind that the road ahead is full of seemingly insurmountable challenges . 
Nepal &apos;s earlier experiments with democratic governance were not very successful ; democratically elected governments ( in the late 1950 &quot; s and the 1990 &quot; s ) were unceremoniously replaced by prolonged autocratic rule . 
So , leaving responsibility solely to political leaders and policymakers this time would be a grave mistake . 
Every Nepali has a role to play to ensure that the country &apos;s dark political history does not repeat itself , and thus to help move the country in the right direction . 
Voting for change has sent a clear message ; making sure that Nepal &apos;s leaders follow the will of the people is an altogether different challenge . 
It is to be hoped that Nepal &apos;s newly elected Maoists have the wisdom to listen to their newly empowered electorate .
