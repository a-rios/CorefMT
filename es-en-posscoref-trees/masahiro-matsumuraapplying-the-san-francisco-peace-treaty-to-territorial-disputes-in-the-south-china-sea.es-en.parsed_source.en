From San Francisco to the South China Sea 
OSAKA - Territorial and maritime disputes among China , Taiwan , and several Southeast Asian countries are roiling the South China Sea region , with little prospect of resolution anytime soon . 
But the current uneasy status quo may be tenable , so long as the parties embrace serious confidence-building measures through multilateral forums while maintaining effective deterrence vis-à-vis China and a commitment not to use offensive force . 
Naturally , China is eager to exclude interference by extra-regional great powers , particularly the United States , preferring bilateral negotiations with weaker regional claimants that it can more easily dominate . 
Extra-regional powers , however , cite the United Nations Convention on the Law of Sea - specifically , the freedom of navigation and the right of innocent passage - to justify their involvement . 
Given that the South China Sea disputes stem from overlapping claims to &quot; exclusive economic zones , &quot; not open ocean , the UN convention is not entirely relevant . 
But another international agreement does provide some guidance for settling these disputes : the San Francisco Peace Treaty , which entered into force in 1952 and officially ended World War II in the Asia-Pacific region . 
Under the treaty , Japan renounced its sovereignty claims over the Spratly and the Paracel Islands , but did not reassign them to any single country . 
As a result , these islands remain legally under the collective custody of the treaty &apos;s 48 other parties - including two claimants to the islands , the Philippines and Vietnam . 
China - then in the third year of Mao Zedong &apos;s rule - was not even invited to participate in the peace conference . 
Although Mao &apos;s communists had clearly won the civil war and secured control of mainland China , the conference organizers disagreed about which government - Mao &apos;s People &apos;s Republic of China ( PRC ) in Beijing , or Chiang Kai-shek &apos;s Republic of China ( ROC ) in Taipei - truly represented China . 
As a result , the PRC denies that it is legally bound by the treaty . 
But the treaty applies to the PRC indirectly through the ROC-Japan bilateral peace treaty of 1952 , which was signed just hours before the San Francisco Treaty entered into effect and reaffirmed its terms - especially Japan &apos;s renunciation of Taiwan . 
Indeed , the San Francisco Treaty required that the ROC-Japan treaty be consistent with it , thereby preventing Japan from assigning in its treaty with the ROC any additional right or title to any country other than the parties to the San Francisco Treaty . 
As a result , Japan is unable to recognize Taiwan as part of PRC sovereign territory . 
To be sure , the San Francisco Treaty per se is not legally binding for the PRC . 
But , for Japan , the PRC has clearly succeeded the ROC in Taiwan , as demonstrated by the 1972 Japan-PRC Joint Communiqué , on the basis of which the bilateral Treaty of Peace and Friendship was concluded six years later . 
When Japan shifted its diplomatic recognition from the ROC to the PRC , it recognized the latter as the &quot; sole legal government of China . &quot; 
Given that Japan was not recognizing China as a new state - international recognition of the Chinese state had existed without interruption since the ROC government emerged in 1912 - the PRC effectively accepted the rights and obligations of the previous government . 
Moreover , Japan did not recognize Taiwan as part of China , on the grounds that doing so would infringe on its obligations under the San Francisco Treaty . 
While Japan fully &quot; understood &quot; and &quot; respected &quot; the PRC &apos;s declaration that Taiwan was an &quot; inalienable &quot; part of its territory , it did not recognize the claim in accordance with international law . 
The two countries simply agreed to disagree over Taiwan &apos;s legal status . 
In other words , Japan renounced Taiwan without reassigning it . 
To date , China has been silent about the implications of the San Francisco Treaty for its claims in the South China Sea . 
This may simply reflect a dearth of international legal expertise in this field or the state of China &apos;s segmented , stove-piped policy communities . 
But it could also stem from concerns that using the treaty &apos;s legal reasoning , which conflicts with China &apos;s stance on Taiwan , to resolve today &apos;s territorial disputes would undermine its credibility and weaken its position . 
If left unchecked , China may use the South China Sea disputes to gain effective hegemony over weaker claimants . 
All parties to the disputes , including China , can cite geographic and historical connections to the islands to back their claims , but none of them has solid legal title under the San Francisco Treaty . 
The US and other extra-regional powers should take advantage of this fact , invoking their latent collective custody of the Spratly and the Paracel Islands in accordance with the San Francisco Treaty , and internationalize separate bilateral diplomatic processes between China and regional claimants . 
The treaty &apos;s parties could even hold a conference to deliberate on the matter . 
Given that it would exclude China , such a discussion alone would be a game changer .
