Will America &apos;s Pain be China &apos;s Gain ? 
NEW YORK- In their efforts to pass a bailout plan for America &apos;s financial system , Bush administration officials invoked the specter of the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
But , for most Asians , economic Armageddon is far more recent . 
The Asian financial crisis of a decade ago brought banks , corporations and governments to their knees . 
The bonfire was sparked by the collapse of the Thai baht in the summer of 1997 . 
Contagion soon spread across East Asia , with the ripple effects of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as Russia and Brazil . 
The long-running &quot; economic miracles &quot; of South Korea and Hong Kong ended , as did surging growth in Indonesia and Thailand . 
The central lesson taken from that crisis was to maintain large foreign-exchange reserves . 
Back in the 1990 &quot; s , Asia &apos;s fast-growing economies maintained small reserves , despite booming exports and foreign investment . 
Once the tailspin began in 1997 , governments &quot; lack of reserves hampered their ability to rescue failed banks , forcing them to appeal to international institutions for relief . 
But the International Monetary Fund &apos;s bailout came with strings attached , including demands for more of the rapid capital market liberalization that induced the crisis in the first place . 
Indeed , what the West calls the &quot; Asian financial crisis &quot; is known in Asia as the &quot; IMF crisis . &quot; 
The political humiliation and economic frustration of dealing with IMF imperatives confirmed the central importance of maintaining large reserves , as an issue not just of currency stability , but also economic sovereignty . 
One Asian economy emerged from the 1997-1998 crisis relatively unscathed : China . 
There were many reasons for this , but foremost among them was that China had already amassed more than $ 100 billion in reserves , and refused to revalue its currency , when the crisis hit . 
Since then , China has aggressively pursued a fast-growth , export , and investment heavy model of economic development . 
By capping the exchange rate and producing far more than it consumes , China &apos;s reserves grew into a Leviathan , hitting the $ 1 trillion mark in 2005 . 
Even after China ( under pressure from US Treasury officials ) let the yuan partially float in 2005 , the Leviathan kept growing by about $ 200 billion annually . 
Over the past year and a half , China &apos;s reserves skyrocketed to $ 1.8 trillion , far and away the world &apos;s largest . 
The Chinese state probably hasn &apos;t sat on so much lucre since the halcyon days of the Qing Empire , when insatiable European demand for porcelain , tea and silk flooded the central coffers in Beijing with silver bullion . 
But the paradox is that today &apos;s reserves are not real wealth that can be pumped back into the domestic economy . 
Instead , China &apos;s reserves mostly underwrite America &apos;s debt . 
Even before Wall Street hit the skids , there was growing consensus in China that its reserves had grown far beyond what was necessary to avert another 1997-style crisis . 
Calls for a more diversified investment strategy intensified . 
Investing in US Treasuries , after all , was a sure loss-maker , given the gap between their modest yield and the steady appreciation of the yuan . 
With the creation one year ago of a $ 200 billion sovereign wealth fund , the China Investment Corporation , Beijing positioned itself for more equity investment ( although its early investments , in the Blackstone Group and Morgan Stanley , were widely criticized ) . 
Economist Andy Xie , formerly with Morgan Stanley , proposed last week that China trade its dollar assets for shares in US companies on a grand scale , challenging America to overcome its financial xenophobia in order to avert a disaster of undercapitalization . 
But many in China , from nationalist bloggers to social justice activists , advance a deeper critique of the Leviathan reserve . 
Why bind up Chinese capital to finance America &apos;s debt-consumption economy , they ask , when so many needs go unmet at home ? 
China was one of the world &apos;s most egalitarian societies as late as 1985 . 
Today , it suffers one of the world &apos;s biggest gaps between haves and have-nots . 
Chinese-style capitalism is flaunting its defiance of one Confucius &quot; basic teachings - don &apos;t worry about poverty , he warned , worry about inequality . 
China &apos;s physical infrastructure in booming central cities is undergoing radical modernization , but the social and environmental infrastructure is falling apart , especially in the interior and for the huge rural population . 
For years , the central government has talked about creating &quot; social harmony &quot; - with a &quot; new-type rural cooperative medical services system , &quot; by increasing spending on education to 4 % of GDP and eliminating school fees , and implementing &quot; sustainable development &quot; models . 
The promises are grand , but the actions have not measured up . 
And the economic costs of restricted access to healthcare and education , on top of the scarcity of clear air and potable water , will be crippling in the mid- and long-term . 
The challenge for China in the years to come is to divest itself of American debt , and begin investing in the health , education and environmental well-being of its own people . 
Growing the economy at an average annual rate of 10 % , it turns out , may have been the easy part .
