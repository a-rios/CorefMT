Public Versus Private France 
President Jacques Chirac &apos;s re-election incited a sigh of relief across France that is echoing around the world . 
But the scare Jean-Marie Le Pen threw into French politics will be for nought if the political class in Britain slips back into its old hauteur and complacency . 
France has always been a nation of sharp divisions . 
Once its divide marked the chasm between Left and Right . 
Today it marks the economy &apos;s division between its public and private sectors . 
Premier Lionel Jospin , who was humiliated by Le Pen in being denied a place in the final presidential run-off , had presided over a strong economy , with many new jobs created , more leisure due to the 35-hour week , and some liberal reforms such as privatization on a scale hitherto unseen in France . 
But despite all that , unemployment remained stubbornly high and a pervasive insecurity had set in . 
Jospin &apos;s program failed to diminish these twin ills primarily because French society is divided between a large public sector and a dynamic private sector , much of which is increasingly being driven outside the country because of high taxation and endless bureaucracy . 
Businesses that remain must bear the costs France &apos;s leviathan public sector . 
The fact that France has experienced high unemployment for over two decades , no matter who holds the reigns of power , is a clear sign that French economic policy is amiss . 
French unemployed are well off compared to their international counterparts , but the system is costly and inefficient and has shortcomings . 
Social benefits , for example , are paid only for a limited amount of time ; they are then replaced by a minimum living allowance , which represents an exclusion from society . 
In August 1945 , Jean Monnet told Charles de Gaulle that : &quot; you speak of grandeur but the French are small today . 
There will only be grandeur when the French assume a status that justifies grandeur ... There must be more production , more productivity ; &#91; we &#93; must transform the country from a material point of view . &quot; 
The General did not need convincing . 
He believed that the state had an &quot; ardent obligation &quot; to engage in economic planning . 
One of Monnet &apos;s first actions was to declare that modernization could not be attained while the French worked such short hours ; a 45-hour working week was the minimum that was necessary . 
French workers put in an average of 46 hours per week through the early 1960s . 
Since then , work-time has steadily declined . 
A 32-hour work week is now deemed something worth going on strike for . 
Monnet &apos;s effort to rebuild France by mobilizing business , unions and government authorities at all levels mutated into France &apos;s &quot; Great Organizational Myth &quot; - the idea that technocrats can allocate resources better than the market . 
French central planning attempted to blaze a new path between Communist centralisation and Vichy corporatism . 
Five decades on , the wheels of state are still mostly spinning in that muddy middle ground . 
The French state employs around five million people - nearly one-fourth of the working population , including at the local level . 
The salaries and pensions of these fonctionnaires represent about 40 % of the national budget . 
This trend is completely opposite that prevailing in other sectors . 
For example : the number of French farmers fell steadily over the last three decades , yet the number of Ministry of Agriculture bureaucrats doubled . 
Compare that bloat with the French private sector . 
EU single market provisions have forced French companies to compete without the crutch of traditional protectionist measures and state subsidies . 
The best French companies have cut costs ferociously , improving productivity and expanding production abroad . 
Cosmetic giant L &apos;Oreal , Danone , Michelin and Club Mediterranee are but a few of the highly competitive companies that are more global than French . 
Their achievement demonstrates the strength of the external side of the French economy , which is the main engine of French growth . 
But &quot; Private France &quot; - despite its dynamism - cannot continue to compete and innovate while carrying the dead weight of &quot; Public France &quot; on its shoulders . 
Many ill-managed public or semi-public enterprises only survive because they are saturated by state subsidies . 
The private sector &apos;s burden is not limited to state enterprises , but stems more generally from the vast share of national income ( 51 % ) that the state taxes and spends , with a large part of taxation falling on employment . 
Additional obstacles include a lack of labour flexibility , especially legal barriers to shedding labour . 
The more immediate explanation for the lack of reforms derives from the paradox of the strength of the French economy . 
The situation is not bad enough to incite demands for serious reform . 
Indeed , high living standards and high social expectations make it political suicide for any party or leader to propose even the short-term sacrifices serious reform will entail . 
So the strength of the French private sector has created the material basis for a welfare state that is truly parasitical : it weakens its host ( the private sector ) without killing it . 
Europe was thought by the French political class to be the solution . 
But Europe and the euro could are increasingly catalysts for public resentment . 
Jospin and Chirac have done nothing to implement the large liberalization program ( including energy , financial services and transport ) agreed among EU members in Lisbon two years ago , which means that the benefits of liberalization are denied France at a time when the public perceives the EU as imposing all sorts of restrictions on the French way of doing business . 
It is time for France to abandon the indulgence of French exceptionalism ( &apos; L &apos;Exception Francaise ) and start serious reforms that engage the French electorate . 
The shame of Le Pen &apos;s newfound prominence may yet prove beneficial if it forces the mainstream political establishment to heed popular concerns and address the country &apos;s problems .
