Our Post-Modern Crisis 
BERLIN - On the weekend of May 7-9 , the European Union gazed into the abyss of historical failure . 
The fate of the euro was at stake and with it European unification as a whole . 
Not since before the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 had Europe been in such grave political danger . 
On the surface , the matter at hand was the financial stabilization of Greece and of the Europe &apos;s common currency , but the real title of the play was &quot; Saving the Banks , Part II . &quot; 
If Greece had defaulted , not only would Portugal , Spain , and other weaker eurozone economies have been threatened , but Europe would have faced a run on its securities . 
That , in turn , would have triggered the collapse of supposedly &quot; too big to fail &quot; banks and insurance companies , not just in Europe , but worldwide . 
When the heads of the EU &apos;s member states met in Brussels to deal with the Greek crisis , the interbank market , which is decisive for the liquidity of financial institutions , had started to freeze , just like after the collapse of Lehmann Brothers in September 2008 . 
The world financial system again stood at the edge of a precipice . 
Only after joining forces in providing a â‚¬ 750 billion bailout package , did the eurozone &apos;s member states and the IMF prevent another systemic crash . 
But how many bailouts will the people of the Western democracies tolerate before the crisis of the global financial system turns into a crisis of Western democracy ? 
The answer is clear : not many more . 
The crisis has not yet manifested itself to most citizens of the West in the appalling , ground-shaking way of 1929 . 
So far , financial crisis still seems a rather more vague threat : people are afraid of inflation , stagnation , unemployment , and loss of assets and status . 
They don &apos;t yet think that the world as they know it is coming to an end . 
Moreover , the mood in the West swings between a realization that this crisis will not be resolved without fundamental commotions and changes , and hope that it will be resolved in the normal , cyclical way of other crises - Mexico , Asia , the Internet bubble , etc . - and that in the not-so-distant future things will start to pick up . 
This uncertain response partly explains Western governments &quot; lack of will to draw tangible conclusions from the systemic failure of the financial sector . 
It is also why governments give the impression that they don &apos;t know how to steer their societies through these troubled waters . 
Leaders talk about &quot; systemic risks &quot; and the necessity of bailouts , but at the same time let those responsible for two consecutive systemic failures maintain the same global casino that twice brought the world near collapse . 
Sixty years ago , a global crisis such as the one we are witnessing today would have had the potential to unleash another world war . 
Fortunately , this is no longer a realistic option . 
The reality of the atomic bomb precludes large-scale war between world powers ; governments intervene , upon global agreement , with large-scale bailouts ; and today &apos;s Western societies and emerging powers are much richer than those still devastated by World War I. In 2007 , global assets ( including stock , private and public debt , and bank deposits ) amounted to $ 194 trillion - 343 % of annual global GDP . 
Moreover , the failure of the global financial system comes at a time when power is shifting from West to East . 
Today , the hopes of the world economy rest with the emerging powers in east and south Asia , led by China and India . 
For all these reasons , the global crisis will not be devastating in the same way as the Great Depression was . 
Indeed , our current predicament has all of the hallmarks of a &quot; post-modern &quot; crisis . 
But we need to ask ourselves where and how the energies unleashed by this crisis will be discharged , because there can be no doubt that they will be discharged one way or another . 
After all , the evidence so far suggests that the crisis is here to stay for a long time , with unforeseen eruptions , such as the recent adversity in Greece and surrounding the euro , as well as inflation , stagnation , and populist rebellion . 
Indeed , there are good reasons for believing that the Tea Party movement in the United States , connected as it is with the economic disaster that followed Lehman &apos;s collapse , is one of the channels of the energy released by the crisis . 
Developments in Greece or Hungary make it easy to imagine failed European states if the EU unravels . 
The fact that the current global crisis is a post-modern one does not make it any less dangerous . 
Post-modern crises entail post-modern risks , resulting in disintegration and implosion of power vacuums , not the danger of classical wars . 
But , given European governments &quot; behavior , the urgent question presents itself : Do these governments have any inkling of what is at stake at the table where they sit playing roulette with history ?
