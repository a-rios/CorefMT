Getting Practical in Controlling Malaria 
Many international assistance programs fail because they are badly designed and / or too complicated . 
The result is that the poor don &apos;t get the help they need , and taxpayers in rich countries lose confidence in the use of their aid funds . 
A case in point has been malaria control . 
If rich countries adopt simpler and more practical strategies to help Africa fight malaria , they can save millions of Africans while building enthusiastic support among their citizens . 
Malaria is a killer disease transmitted by a specific species of mosquitoes . 
It depends on warm temperatures , and thus is largely a tropical malady . 
Africa turns out to be especially unlucky , because it has a combination of high temperatures and the mosquitos that are likely to transmit the disease . 
As a result , Africa accounts for 90 % of all malaria deaths in the world - including roughly two million children per year . 
Yet even in Africa , Malaria is largely preventable and completely treatable at low cost . 
Up until now , there has been far too little malaria control . 
Prevention is best accomplished by modern anti-malaria bed nets , which are treated with insecticide . 
These nets cover people while they sleep , and repel or kill the mosquitoes , which tend to bite during the night . 
The nets reduce the number of bites , and the amount of illness , but they do not eliminate them . 
If people get bitten despite the nets , they require treatment within a few hours of the onset of symptoms . 
There are two major obstacles to solving the malaria problem . 
First , Africa &apos;s poor cannot afford insecticide-treated bed nets and the correct medicines . 
Many end up taking cheap medicines that are not effective because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to them . 
Second , African villagers lack access to cars or trucks , so they have to walk several miles to reach a clinic . 
An infected child is often dead or comatose by the time a mother reaches a clinic . 
If rich-country governments thought practically about malaria and recognized that it is a full-scale emergency , they could support simple and practical solutions : bed nets and timely access to medicine . 
Rich countries would buy bed nets from companies that produce them and work with African governments to distribute them free of charge to every African household . 
And they would work with African governments to ensure that the correct medicines are available for quick use within each village . 
There are one billion people living in rich donor countries , and the total cost of comprehensive malaria control in Africa - giving bed nets at no cost to all Africans , and providing the right medicines within every village - is around $ 2.5 billion per year , or just $ 2.50 per citizen of the rich countries . 
But the rich countries have instead adopted failed strategies . 
Rather than giving away bed nets , rich-country organizations like the United States Agency for International Development try to sell them to the extreme poor , albeit at heavily discounted prices . 
This policy reflects a shortsighted ambition to promote markets rather than the direct and over-riding goals of saving lives and removing bottlenecks to long-term economic development . 
The tragic result has been extremely low use of nets throughout most of Africa , since impoverished people lack the purchasing power to buy nets . 
Second , donor governments have failed to promote simple ways to ensure the availability of medicines in villages across the continent . 
Rather than shipping medicines to each country on the basis of estimated needs , donor agencies have set up a complicated purchasing system that has led to years of delay in getting medicines to the villages . 
The pharmaceutical industry , led by Novartis , has been way ahead of donor agencies . 
Novartis has agreed to make these medicines available at the cost of production . 
But , despite Novartis &apos;s large production capacity , donor agencies have failed to order , buy , and ship the medicines in the required amounts . 
Malaria control now faces a period of increasing urgency , as well as renewed hope . 
Malaria is spreading , and new scientific evidence indicates that people infected with HIV are more likely to transmit it to others when they are also infected with malaria . 
But there is also a growing realization that malaria is a disaster that must be addressed . 
US President George W. Bush has launched an important new initiative to help 15 African countries to control malaria , and hosted an unprecedented White House summit in December to rally private-sector support . 
Similarly , the Chinese government , the World Bank , and the Islamic Development Bank have recently announced plans to scale up their contributions to the fight against malaria . 
A major new citizens &quot; initiative called Malaria No More is raising private funds to distribute anti-malaria nets . 
People across Africa have shown that they are ready to mobilize their efforts if we offer practical means to help them . 
The world &apos;s safety , including the safety of people living in rich countries , depends on the global community &apos;s ability to prove that it will come to the aid of all who are in desperate need . 
Aid can work wonders if it is practical and directed to those in need . 
Malaria control can demonstrate this world-saving lesson once again .
