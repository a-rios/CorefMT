First Things First : Americans , or Ethics ? 
In explaining why he was abandoning the Kyoto accord on global warming , President Bush said : &quot; We will not do anything that harms our economy , because first things first are the people who live in America . &quot; 
Those remarks should not have surprised anyone who followed the American election . 
In the second presidential debate , George W. Bush was asked what how he would use America &apos;s global power and influence . 
He said that he would use it to benefit all Americans . 
These remarks would not have surprised anyone who studied the speeches of the President &apos;s father . 
The first President Bush said much the same thing almost a decade ago , at the 1992 &quot; Earth Summit &quot; in Rio de Janeiro . 
When representatives of developing nations asked Bush senior to put the over-consumption of resources by the developed countries , especially the US , on the agenda he said that &quot; the American life-style is not up for negotiation &quot; - no matter what , or so it seemed to his audience , the costs to others might be . 
But it is not only the Bush administrations that put the interests of Americans first . 
In the Balkans , the Clinton-Gore administration made it clear that it was not prepared to risk the life of a single American in order to reduce the risk of civilian casualties . 
Observing this , Timothy Garton Ash wrote : &quot; It is a perverted moral code that will allow a million innocent civilians of another race to be made destitute because you are not prepared to risk the life of a single professional soldier of your own . &quot; 
In Kosovo restricting intervention to aerial bombardment made this strategy a total success : NATO forces suffered not a single casualty in combat , but approximately 300 Kosovar , 209 Serb and 3 Chinese civilians were killed . 
This approach to the duties of a national leader , stated bluntly and honestly , forces us to consider a fundamental ethical issue . 
To what extent should political leaders see their role narrowly , in terms of promoting the interests of their citizens , and to what extent should they be concerned with the welfare of people everywhere ? 
Mr Romano Prodi , President of the EU Commission , and a former Prime Minister of Italy , responded to President &apos;s Bush &apos;s most recent statement by saying that &quot; If one wants to be a world leader , one must know how to look after the entire earth and not only American industry . &quot; 
But the question is not only one for those who aspire to be world leaders . 
The leaders of smaller nations must also consider , in contexts like global warming , trade pacts , foreign aid and the treatment of refugees , to what extent they are prepared to consider the interests of &quot; outsiders . &quot; 
As Ash suggests , there is a strong ethical case for saying that it is wrong for leaders to give absolute priority to the interests of their own citizens . 
The value of the life of an innocent human being does not vary according to nationality . 
Even the Bush Administration put the lives of millions of HIV-infected Africans ahead of the economic interests of American pharmaceutical corporations when it reaffirmed former President Clinton = s executive order saying that the US would not prevent African nations licensing their own manufacturers to produce cheap copies of drugs that could save the lives of their citizens , even though American companies held the patents on those drugs . 
If American interests always come first , that decision - which was the right decision - would be difficult to explain . 
But , it might be said , the abstract ethical idea that all humans are entitled to equal consideration cannot govern the way we look at the duties of a political leader . 
Just as parents are expected to provide for the interests of their own children , rather than for the interests of strangers , in accepting the office of president of the United States , George W. Bush assumed a specific role that makes it his duty to protect and further the interests of Americans . 
Other countries have their leaders , who have similar roles in respect to the interests of their fellow-citizens . 
There is no world political community . 
So long as that situation prevails , we must have nation-states and the leaders of those nation-states must give preference to the interests of their citizens . 
There is some truth in this . 
Without it , unless electors suddenly to turn into altruists of a kind never before seen on a large scale , democracy could not function . 
American voters would not elect a president who gave no more weight to their interests than to the interests of people living in other countries . 
Perhaps , given the global nature of the problems we now face , this is an argument for a federalist world , rather than one divided into sovereign nation-states . 
But as long as that remains a lofty idea without political substance , our leaders will feel that they must give some degree of priority to the interests of their own citizens . 
&quot; Some degree , &quot; however , does not mean absolute priority . 
Parents may give preference to their children , but if buying new toys for your children comes at the cost of the lives of other children , that cannot be defended . 
Abandoning the Kyoto accord , many believe , will threaten the lives of tens or hundreds of millions of people living in countries too poor to protect them from the consequences of climate change and rising sea levels . 
That is why Europeans , and people in many other countries are incensed at the casual way in which America &apos;s President assumed that &quot; first things first are the people who live in America . &quot; 
It may be defensible for President Bush to give some preference to the economic interests of Americans , but to put them above the life-and-death interests of millions of human beings goes beyond what any ethical approach can justify .
