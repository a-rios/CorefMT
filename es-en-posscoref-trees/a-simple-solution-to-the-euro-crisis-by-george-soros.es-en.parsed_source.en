Germany &apos;s Choice 
FRANKFURT - The euro crisis has already transformed the European Union from a voluntary association of equal states into a creditor-debtor relationship from which there is no easy escape . 
The creditors stand to lose large sums should a member state exit the monetary union , yet debtors are subjected to policies that deepen their depression , aggravate their debt burden , and perpetuate their subordinate position . 
As a result , the crisis is now threatening to destroy the EU itself . 
That would be a tragedy of historic proportions , which only German leadership can prevent . 
The causes of the crisis cannot be properly understood without recognizing the euro &apos;s fatal flaw : By creating an independent central bank , member countries have become indebted in a currency that they do not control . 
At first , both the authorities and market participants treated all government bonds as if they were riskless , creating a perverse incentive for banks to load up on the weaker bonds . 
When the Greek crisis raised the specter of default , financial markets reacted with a vengeance , relegating all heavily indebted eurozone members to the status of a Third World country over-extended in a foreign currency . 
Subsequently , the heavily indebted member countries were treated as if they were solely responsible for their misfortunes , and the structural defect of the euro remained uncorrected . 
Once this is understood , the solution practically suggests itself . 
It can be summed up in one word : Eurobonds . 
If countries that abide by the EU &apos;s new Fiscal Compact were allowed to convert their entire stock of government debt into Eurobonds , the positive impact would be little short of the miraculous . 
The danger of default would disappear , as would risk premiums . 
Banks &quot; balance sheets would receive an immediate boost , as would the heavily indebted countries &quot; budgets . 
Italy , for example , would save up to 4 % of its GDP ; its budget would move into surplus ; and fiscal stimulus would replace austerity . 
As a result , its economy would grow , and its debt ratio would fall . 
Most of the seemingly intractable problems would vanish into thin air . 
It would be like waking from a nightmare . 
In accordance with the Fiscal Compact , member countries would be allowed to issue new Eurobonds only to replace maturing ones ; after five years , the debts outstanding would be gradually reduced to 60 % of GDP . 
If a member country ran up additional debts , it could borrow only in its own name . 
Admittedly , the Fiscal Compact needs some modifications to ensure that the penalties for noncompliance are automatic , prompt , and not too severe to be credible . 
A tighter Fiscal Compact would practically eliminate the risk of default . 
Thus , Eurobonds would not ruin Germany &apos;s credit rating . 
On the contrary , they would compare favorably with the bonds of the United States , the United Kingdom , and Japan . 
To be sure , Eurobonds are not a panacea . 
The boost derived from Eurobonds may not be sufficient to ensure recovery ; additional fiscal and / or monetary stimulus may be needed . 
More troubling , Eurobonds would not eliminate divergences in competitiveness . 
Individual countries would still need to undertake structural reforms . 
The EU would also need a banking union to make credit available on equal terms in every country . 
( The Cyprus rescue made the need more acute by making the field even more uneven . ) 
But Germany &apos;s acceptance of Eurobonds would transform the atmosphere and facilitate the needed reforms . 
Unfortunately , Germany remains adamantly opposed to Eurobonds . 
Since Chancellor Angela Merkel vetoed the idea , it has not been given any consideration . 
The German public does not recognize that agreeing to Eurobonds would be much less risky and costly than continuing to do only the minimum to preserve the euro . 
Germany has the right to reject Eurobonds . 
If Germany is opposed to Eurobonds , it should consider leaving the euro . 
Surprisingly , Eurobonds issued by a Germany-less Eurozone would still compare favorably with those of the US , UK , and Japanese bonds . 
The reason is simple . 
Because all of the accumulated debt is denominated in euros , it makes all the difference which country leaves the euro . 
If Germany left , the euro would depreciate . 
The debtor countries would regain their competitiveness . 
Their debt would diminish in real terms and , if they issued Eurobonds , the threat of default would disappear . 
Their debt would suddenly become sustainable . 
At the same time , most of the burden of adjustment would fall on the countries that left the euro . 
Their exports would become less competitive , and they would encounter heavy competition from the rump eurozone in their home markets . 
They would also incur losses on their claims and investments denominated in euros . 
By contrast , if Italy left the eurozone , its euro-denominated debt burden would become unsustainable and would have to be restructured , plunging the global financial system into chaos . 
So , if anyone must leave , it should be Germany , not Italy . 
There is a strong case for Germany to decide whether to accept Eurobonds or leave the eurozone , but it is less obvious which of the two alternatives would be better for the country . 
Only the German electorate is qualified to decide . 
If a referendum in Germany were held today , the supporters of a eurozone exit would win hands down . 
They would discover that the cost to Germany of authorizing Eurobonds has been greatly exaggerated , and the cost of leaving the euro understated . 
The trouble is that Germany has not been forced to choose . 
It can continue to do no more than the minimum to preserve the euro . 
This is clearly Merkel &apos;s preferred choice , at least until after the next election . 
Europe would be infinitely better off if Germany made a definitive choice between Eurobonds and a eurozone exit , regardless of the outcome ; indeed , Germany would be better off as well . 
The situation is deteriorating , and , in the longer term , it is bound to become unsustainable . 
A disorderly disintegration resulting in mutual recriminations and unsettled claims would leave Europe worse off than it was when it embarked on the bold experiment of unification . 
Surely that is not in Germany &apos;s interest .
