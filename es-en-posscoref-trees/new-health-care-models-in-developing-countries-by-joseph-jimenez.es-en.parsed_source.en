Health in Hard Places 
BASEL - When it comes to health care , all stakeholders - patients , service providers , pharmaceutical companies , and governments - know that something needs to change . 
For decades , health-care spending has increased faster than economic growth by an average of two percentage points in OECD countries . 
And , as the population ages and the incidence of chronic disease rises , the problem will only get worse if it is not addressed . 
We need new and better models - and effective strategies to adopt them . 
This is especially true in developing countries &quot; health-care systems , which often confront tighter resource constraints than health care in developed countries . 
Today , the world &apos;s largest socioeconomic group , often referred to as the &quot; bottom of the pyramid , &quot; comprises three billion people who live on less than $ 2.50 per day . 
Yet their demand for health care is significant . 
In low-income countries , nine million people , mostly children , die each year from infectious diseases , including malaria , diarrhea , and AIDS . 
This is unacceptable , especially given the availability of treatments for these diseases . 
I believe , however , that traditional corporate-responsibility efforts , such as donating medicines to patients who cannot afford health care , are no longer enough . 
They do not address the root cause of the problem , which is much deeper than a pricing issue . 
In order to have a lasting impact on health care and quality of life in the developing world , we need to focus on addressing the larger societal challenges that affect the overall healthcare ecosystem . 
Most important among these challenges are health education , infrastructure , and distribution networks . 
In order to ensure sustainable health systems , we need to help communities to build capabilities in these areas . 
And we need to do this in a way that does not seek simply to implement &quot; one-size-fits-all &quot; models . 
We need to tailor our approach in each market to fit local customs and health priorities . 
For example , in India , 830 million people live in rural areas , presenting immense challenges in terms of distribution of medicines . 
As a result , an estimated 65 % of the total population does not have access to adequate health care . 
Novartis has had some success in addressing this issue through our Arogya Parivar , or &quot; Healthy Family , &quot; program . 
Arogya Parivar is centered on recruiting and training residents of remote villages to become &quot; health educators , &quot; who , along with qualified doctors , organize &quot; health camps &quot; - mobile clinics that provide access to health screenings and a robust portfolio of treatment options . 
This includes select over-the-counter products , which we sell in smaller , more affordable packages , helping to keep patients &quot; weekly out-of-pocket costs low . 
Since the beginning of Arogya Parivar , we have improved access to medicine for 42 million patients in 33,000 villages . 
Similarly , in China , despite rapid urbanization , millions of people still live in nomadic communities , making it difficult to educate patients on critical health issues , particularly disease prevention . 
Novartis sought the most effective channel to reach these patients , and ultimately found that teaching children about health and hygiene in schools works best . 
We have been making progress in China &apos;s remote Xinjiang province through our Jian Kang Kuai Che , or &quot; Health Express &quot; initiative , which gives local health-care professionals access to training at urban hospitals through remote education sessions and consultations . 
Finally , in Africa , there are still countries like Zambia , where more than three-fifths of the population lives in rural areas , and many must walk or drive long distances for health care . 
Moreover , the quality of medicines available at health facilities varies greatly , and supplies are not reliable . 
That is why we have forged a partnership with the Zambian government to scale up a countrywide system of pharmacies in order to bring basic medicines to remote villages , and to build the country &apos;s health-care infrastructure . 
We can also expect that mobile health care will be able to make a positive impact on supply-chain management , education , and compliance in places like Africa . 
Through the SMS for Life program , an innovative public-private partnership led by Novartis , we use everyday technology , including mobile phones , text messages , and electronic-mapping technology to track weekly stock levels of malaria medicines at public-health facilities . 
This has helped us to maintain adequate stocks , broaden access to essential medicines , and , we hope , reduce the number of malaria deaths in developing countries &quot; rural areas . 
Each of these programs , or , as we call them , &quot; social ventures , &quot; provides societal benefits beyond improving access to health care or simply donating medicines . 
They strengthen local infrastructure , improve education , create jobs , and drive economic growth . 
This is the kind of change that we need in order to make a lasting impact on health-care systems worldwide . 
We need to think about more than drug pricing and donations , and consider how we can help communities to maintain a high quality of life after aid goes away . 
This implies a major shift in mindset - one that I believe we need to undergo for the sake of our world &apos;s long-term health .
