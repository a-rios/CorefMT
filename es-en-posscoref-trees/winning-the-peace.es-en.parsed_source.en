Winning the Peace 
Afghanistan &apos;s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency , warlords , the heroin trade , and a disappointed populace . 
Across an arc extending from Afghanistan to East Africa , violence now also surges in Iraq , Lebanon , Somalia , and beyond , to Sudan &apos;s Darfur region . 
Everywhere , politicians , generals , and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers , but everywhere something utterly different is needed . 
Stability will come only when economic opportunities exist , when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families , rather than seeking their fortune in violence . 
We are seeing again and again that a foreign army , whether NATO &apos;s in Afghanistan , America &apos;s in Iraq , Israel &apos;s in occupied Palestine , or Ethiopia &apos;s in Somalia , may win a battle , or even a war , but never the peace . 
Peace is about dignity and hope for the future . 
Military occupation saps dignity , and grinding poverty and economic disarray sap hope . 
Peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops , and the arrival of jobs , productive farms and factories , tourism , health care , and schools . 
Without these , military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes . 
The United States government has proven itself blind to these facts , but the international community also remains ill equipped to assist in the restoration of peace following conflicts in impoverished countries . 
Repeatedly , a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow-up . 
Despite grand promises of foreign aid , economic reconstruction , and development in Afghanistan , Iraq , Lebanon , and elsewhere , the actual record of international assistance to post-war reconstruction is gravely deficient . 
The scenario has become painfully familiar . 
A war ends . 
Pledges of billions of dollars are announced . 
A smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community , including the occupying power . 
Months pass . 
World Bank teams from Washington start to arrive . 
But actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed , perhaps for years . 
Crony businesses from the US and Europe , which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions , squander time , aid funds , and opportunities . 
Two or three years pass . 
The grand pronouncements become a pile of out-of-date World Bank studies . 
Recriminations fly , the occupying army remains , and a new insurgency spreads . 
Many factors contribute to this disarray , beginning with the shocking inability of the US , Europe , and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people . 
Their lack of empathy is deplorable , but there are conceptual problems as well . 
The international agencies involved in post-conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or restart economic development in a low-income setting . 
It &apos;s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict . 
In the first phase , during the war itself , aid is for humanitarian relief , focusing on food , water , emergency medicine , and refugee camps . 
In the second phase , at the war &apos;s end , aid remains mainly humanitarian relief , but now directed towards displaced people returning home , and to decommissioned soldiers . 
In the third phase , lasting three to five years , aid supports the first phase of post-war economic development , including restoration of schools , clinics , farms , factories , and ports . 
In the fourth phase , which can last a generation or more , assistance is directed to long-term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts . 
The international community , and the US in particular , is dreadful at the third stage . 
Once a conflict is over , aid agencies seem paralyzed . 
Instead of sending help , they send study groups . 
There is often a lag of years before moving from humanitarian relief to real economic development . 
By the time such help actually arrives , it is often too late : war has been re-ignited . 
In fact , it is possible to restart economic development through targeted &quot; quick-impact &quot; initiatives . 
Since the economies of most impoverished post-conflict countries are based on agriculture , restarting farm output is vital . 
Impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds , fertilizers , and low-cost equipment ( such as pumps for irrigation ) . 
When such aid is made available quickly , former soldiers will return to their farms , and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities . 
This type of aid does not require long studies , but quick action . 
Similar quick-impact measures should be undertaken to control disease . 
Small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly , within the first year of peace . 
Solar panels and wind turbines can provide off-grid power in isolated rural areas . 
Wells and cisterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water . 
These and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security , epidemic disease and health , income and utter poverty , and , most importantly , hope and despair . 
Yet the window of opportunity closes quickly . 
Quick-impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in Darfur . 
Sanctions , threats , and peacekeepers are only short-term measures , whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable , but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on . 
The same applies in Somalia . 
But the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post-conflict regions . 
Only by taking quick , meaningful action to fight hunger , poverty , and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace .
