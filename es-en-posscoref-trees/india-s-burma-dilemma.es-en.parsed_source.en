India &apos;s Burma Dilemma 
The world has been horrified by graphic images of the latest crackdown by Myanmar &apos;s military junta . 
The monks have retreated , and an eerie normalcy has returned to Yangon ( Rangoon ) , Myanmar &apos;s principal city and former capital . 
That crackdown continues under cover of darkness . 
When the sun sets in Myanmar , fear rises . 
Everyone listens half awake for the dreaded knock on the door . 
Any night , the military &apos;s agents can come for you , take you away , and make sure you are never heard from again . 
In recent nights , the junta &apos;s henchmen have burst into monasteries , lined up sleepy monks , and smashed their shaved heads against the walls , spattering them with blood . 
Scores of others , perhaps hundreds , have been carted off for interrogation , torture , or execution . 
The nighttime assault on a United Nations employee and her family made international news , but hundreds of less well connected Burmese have been similarly abused . 
For 45 years , Myanmar &apos;s people have been subjected to the junta &apos;s reign of terror . 
My father was born in Rangoon long before the 1962 coup that brought the current regime to power . 
Afterwards , many of my relatives , prosperous Indian merchants who had been settled in Myanmar for generations , abandoned homes and businesses in order to save their skins as chaos enveloped the city , later renamed Yangon . 
A relative who now lives in Bangkok , but who returned part-time to Yangon in response to overtures from Myanmar &apos;s cash-starved rulers , recalled those days : &quot; We lived through hell . 
We never knew when we woke up each morning what would happen . 
People were being denounced left and right . 
They could just come and take you away and take everything away from you . &quot; 
Those who couldn &apos;t leave Myanmar , or didn &apos;t want to , have lived with this fear ever since . 
The United States and Europe have issued strong statements condemning the crackdown and calling upon Myanmar &apos;s neighbors , especially India and China , to exert their influence on the regime . 
The response from both has been muted ( as it has from Thailand , which also has strong economic ties with Myanmar ) . 
China balks at interfering in the &quot; internal affairs &quot; of a neighbor from whom it gets precious natural gas and potential access to the sea . 
India , which &quot; normalized &quot; bilateral relations a few years ago , is reluctant to alienate Myanmar &apos;s military , with which it has worked closely to counter rebels in India &apos;s northeast who had been using the common border to tactical advantage . 
To this end , India has provided aid , including tanks and training , to Myanmar &apos;s military . 
But the main reason for India &apos;s good relations with Myanmar &apos;s ruling thugs is the country &apos;s vast and still largely unexploited energy reserves , which India desperately needs to fuel its economic boom . 
India has invested $ 150 million in a gas exploration deal off the Arakan coast of Myanmar , and India &apos;s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Gas Authority of India Ltd. have taken a 30 % stake in two offshore gas fields in direct competition with PetroChina , which has also been given a stake . 
India and China are simply doing what the US and European countries have done for so long : trump rhetoric about democracy and human rights with policies that serve their strategic and energy security interests . 
US relations with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are two examples , and America &apos;s Chevron and France &apos;s Total , two of the world &apos;s oil giants , continue to do a brisk business in Myanmar , thanks to loopholes in the sanctions . 
But the rise of India and China means that the time-tested posture of Western democracies toward emerging states to &quot; do as we say , not as we do &quot; will become less tenable . 
If the EU and the US want democratic India to act according to its stated moral values and not its vital national interests when these appear to conflict , they had better be prepared to do the same . 
Feeling the heat , including threats from some US senators to link America &apos;s nuclear deal with India to its actions in Myanmar , India has announced that it is asking for the release of Burmese democratic opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest .
