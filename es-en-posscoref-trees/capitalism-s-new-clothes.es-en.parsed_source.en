Capitalism &apos;s New Clothes 
MELBOURNE - Is the global financial crisis an opportunity to forge a new form of capitalism based on sound values ? 
So French President Nicholas Sarkozy and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair appear to think . 
At a symposium in Paris last month entitled &quot; New World , New Capitalism , &quot; Sarkozy described capitalism based on financial speculation as &quot; an immoral system &quot; that has &quot; perverted the logic of capitalism . &quot; 
He argued that capitalism needs to find new moral values and to accept a stronger role for governments . 
Blair called for a new financial order based on &quot; values other than the maximum short-term profit . &quot; 
It is surprising how readily politicians of all parties - even strong ideological defenders of the unregulated market - accepted the idea that the state should bail out banks and insurance companies when they got into trouble . 
With the exception of a small number of ideologically committed defenders of free enterprise , few were willing to take the risks inherent in letting major banks collapse . 
Who knows what the consequences would have been ? 
Many feared mass unemployment , a tidal wave of bankruptcies , millions of families evicted from their homes , the social safety net strained to the breaking point , and perhaps even riots and a resurgence of the political extremism that brought Hitler to power in Germany during the depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
The choice to save the banks from the financial consequences of their own errors indicates a shift in values away from belief in the wisdom of the market . 
Evidently , the market got some things - like the value of certain financial securities - horrendously wrong . 
It is no accident that the &quot; New World , New Capitalism &quot; symposium was held in France , where some critics have seen the global financial crisis as necessary and desirable precisely because it is producing this change in values . 
In the newspaper Le Figaro , a section on how to scale back one &apos;s expenses predicted a &quot; revolution in values &quot; and claimed that people will put family ahead of work . 
( Americans think the French , with their shorter working hours and longer summer vacations , already put family ahead of work . ) 
The French have always been less likely to go into debt - when they pay with plastic , they tend to use debit cards , drawing on funds they already have , rather than credit cards . 
Now they see the current crisis as a vindication of the value of not spending money that you don &apos;t have . 
That means , in many cases , less luxury spending - something that is hard to reconcile with the image of France as the country of fashion , perfume , and champagne . 
Richemont , the Swiss luxury goods company that owns the Cartier and Montblanc brands , has said that it is facing &quot; the toughest market conditions since its formation 20 years ago . &quot; 
But does this mark an enduring change in values , or just a temporary reduction , forced upon consumers by investment losses and greater economic uncertainty ? 
In his inauguration speech , American President Barack Obama said , &quot; The time has come to set aside childish things &quot; and instead to choose the noble idea that &quot; all are equal , all are free , and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness . &quot; 
It would be an excellent thing if the global financial crisis restored a proper sense of what is important . 
Could the crisis remind us that we buy luxury items more because of the status they bring than because of their intrinsic value ? 
Could it help us to appreciate that many things are more central to our happiness than our ability to spend money on fashion , expensive watches , and fine dining ? 
Could it even , as Obama suggests , make us more aware of the needs of those who are living in real poverty and are far worse off than we will ever be , financial crisis or no financial crisis ? 
The danger is that the potential for a real change in values will be co-opted , as has happened so often before , by those who see it as just another opportunity to make money . 
The designer Nathalie Rykiel is reportedly planning to show the new Sonia Rykiel collection in March not in the usual vast rented area , but in the smaller space of her own boutique . 
&quot; It &apos;s a desire for intimacy , to go back to values , &quot; she told the International Herald Tribune . 
&quot; We need to return to a smaller scale , one that touches people . 
We will be saying , &quot; Come to my house . 
Look at and feel the clothes . &quot; &quot; 
Ah yes , in a world in which ten million children die every year from avoidable , poverty-related causes , and greenhouse-gas emissions threaten to create hundreds of millions of climate refugees , we should be visiting Paris boutiques and feeling the clothes . 
If people were really concerned about defensible moral values , they wouldn &apos;t be buying designer clothes at all .
