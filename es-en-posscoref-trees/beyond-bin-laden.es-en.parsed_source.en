Beyond Bin Laden 
NEW YORK - The killing of Osama bin Laden by United States special forces constitutes a significant victory over global terrorism . 
But it is a milestone , not a turning point , in what remains an ongoing struggle with no foreseeable end . 
The significance of what was accomplished stems in part from Bin Laden &apos;s symbolic importance . 
He has been an icon , representing the ability to strike with success against the US and the West . That icon has now been destroyed . 
Another positive consequence is the demonstrated effect of counter-terrorism operations carried out by US soldiers . 
But any celebration needs to be tempered by certain realities . 
Bin Laden &apos;s demise , as welcome as it is , should in no way be equated with the demise of terrorism . 
Terrorism is a decentralized phenomenon - in its funding , planning , and execution . 
Removing Bin Laden does not end the terrorist threat . 
There are successors , starting with Ayman al-Zawahiri in Al Qaeda , as well as in autonomous groups operating out of Yemen , Somalia , and other countries . 
So terrorism will continue . 
Indeed , it could even grow somewhat worse in the short run , as there are sure to be those who will want to show that they can still strike against the West . 
The best parallel that I can think of when it comes to understanding terrorism and how to deal with it is disease . 
There are steps that can and should be taken to attack or neutralize certain types of viruses or bacteria ; to reduce vulnerability to infection ; and to reduce the consequences of infection if , despite all of our efforts , we become ill . 
Disease is not something that can be eliminated , but often it can be managed . 
There are obvious parallels with terrorism . 
As we have recently witnessed , terrorists can be attacked and stopped before they can cause harm ; individuals and countries can be defended ; and societies can take steps to bolster their resilience when they are successfully attacked , as on occasion they inevitably will be . 
These elements of a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy can reduce the threat to manageable , or at least tolerable , levels . 
But tolerable is not good enough when it comes to protecting innocent life . 
We want to do better . 
The answer is to be found in the realm of prevention . 
More must be done to interrupt the recruitment of terrorists , thereby reducing the threat before it materializes . 
Most terrorists today are young and male . 
It would help enormously in this regard if Arab and Muslim political leaders spoke out against the intentional killing of men , women , and children by anyone or any group for political purposes . 
There is also a pivotal role here for religious leaders , educators , and parents . 
Terrorism must be stripped of any legitimacy that it may be viewed as having . 
One potential positive development here stems from the political changes that we are seeing in many parts of the Middle East . 
There is a greater chance than before that young people will become more integrated in their own societies ( and less susceptible to the appeal of extremism ) if they enjoy greater political and economic opportunity . 
Pakistan will most likely prove critical in determining the future prevalence of terrorism . 
Unfortunately , while it is home to some of the world &apos;s most dangerous terrorists , it is decidedly less than a full partner in the struggle against it . 
Some parts of the Pakistani government are sympathetic to terrorism and unwilling to act against it ; other parts simply lack the capacity to act against it effectively . 
Capacity is much easier to provide than will . 
The outside world can and should continue to provide assistance to help Pakistan acquire the strength and skills required to tackle modern-day terrorists . 
But no amount of external assistance can compensate for a lack of motivation and commitment . 
Pakistani leaders must choose once and for all . 
It is not enough to be a limited partner in the struggle against terror ; 
There will be Pakistanis who protest against the recent American military action , arguing that it violated Pakistan &apos;s sovereignty . 
Pakistanis must understand that they will forfeit some of those rights if they do not meet their obligation to ensure that their territory is not used to shelter terrorists . 
If things do not change , the sort of independent military operation carried out by US soldiers will become less the exception than the rule . 
This is not nearly as desirable an outcome as Pakistan joining what should be a common international effort . 
At stake is not only assistance , but Pakistan &apos;s own future , for , in the absence of genuine commitment to counter-terrorism , it is only a matter of time before the country falls victim to the infection that it refuses to treat .
