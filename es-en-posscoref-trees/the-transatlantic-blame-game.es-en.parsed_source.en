The Transatlantic Blame Game 
As if the diplomatic spat over Iraq weren &apos;t bad enough , relations between America and Europe are being slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies . 
Indeed , the differences between the two sides &apos; economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades . 
At first glance , the depth of this &quot; policy gap &quot; seems surprising . 
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 has improved recently both in the US and Europe . 
Moreover , the US and Europe face a similar challenge : encouraging economic recovery . 
But their governments &apos; actions - or lack of action - make it seem as if neither side can see the problems faced by the other . 
When the Euro was introduced , most EU members - Germany , in particular - looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure . 
Thus , today &apos;s framework in Euro area , with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy , was not constructed to facilitate macroeconomic coordination with the US . 
But the perception of many American observers was different . 
They saw the central implication of the Euro as requiring Europe to junk its supposed role as a &quot; free rider &quot; in the international economy , one that left the US shouldering the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth . 
Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America . 
These two views were bound to conflict , and now they do . 
Tensions hidden during the long Clinton-era boom rose throughout 2001 , when America tried to address its economic downturn by rapidly easing its monetary and fiscal policies . 
As big budget deficits returned , so did European skepticism about the sustainability of America &apos;s mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar . 
American critics , meanwhile , saw the Euro area as overly cautious for cutting interest rates slowly and maintaining the fiscal constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact . 
Initially , the Europeans underestimated the slowdown they confronted . 
Subsequently , they were constrained by the limits to their fiscal reactions embodied in the Maastricht Treaty ; the large economies of Continental Europe had not done enough budgetary consolidation during the years of good growth . 
Both monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth , but Europe did not help much to redress America &apos;s external imbalance . 
Of course , the Euro area is so large a player that it can no longer leave responsibility for stimulating global growth to America . 
But US efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration : the issues confronting the European economies are different from those facing the US - as are perceptions about the challenges . 
In fact , the main reasons for the massive swing in US public finances - from surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4 % in 2003-04 - have little to do with stabilization . 
Aside from the costs of the Iraq war and other security concerns , along with lapses in earlier spending controls , US tax cuts have structural and distributional rather than short-term aims . 
A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the largest benefits upon the most affluent , whose spending is less sensitive to taxes . 
The cuts should sustain private demand this year and next , but at the cost of postponing improvements in private saving and indebtedness . 
Although the dollar has been depreciating for a year , continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5 % of GDP . 
As the deficit widens further , dollar depreciation will likely resume , despite laggardly performances by the world &apos;s other major economies . 
Will the US accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004 , and could Europe make a greater contribution to global growth ? 
Probably not . 
The counterpart to the US emphasis on self-reliance rather than direct public assistance is that employment must be maintained at high levels - regardless of the party in power - whereas most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8 % or more . 
So the US is likely to opt for growth . 
Despite three years of weak growth , the gap between potential and actual output in Continental Europe &apos;s largest economies is currently smaller than in the US . 
Income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable , given high rates in Europe &apos;s largest economies . 
But tax cuts that must soon be reversed - due mainly to demographic pressure on public pensions and healthcare - are unlikely to stimulate demand as consumers lose confidence in government &apos;s ability to control deficits . 
Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management , not inflation . 
The EU countries are finally accelerating their implementation of structural reforms , but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too entrenched , as illustrated by the recent conflicts over reforms of French pensions and the German labor market . 
Further dollar depreciation as well as slower US growth will undermine EU exports , the one relatively successful component of demand in Europe . 
The divergence in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in both Europe and the US for the next year or so . 
But the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation , potentially as divisive as the disputes over the Iraq war . 
If so , the ongoing Doha Round of international trade negotiations could be first to suffer . 
Protectionism will be harder to resist on both sides of the Atlantic . 
The US cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit , while complaints about loss of competitiveness will intensify in the EU . 
It strains the imagination to think that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly .
