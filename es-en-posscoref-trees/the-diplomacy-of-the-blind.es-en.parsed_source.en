The Diplomacy of the Blind 
PARIS - Why do revolutions so often take professional diplomats by surprise ? 
Is there something in their DNA that makes them prefer the status quo so much that , more often than not , they are taken aback by rapid changes , neither foreseeing them nor knowing how to respond once they begin ? 
What is happening today in the Arab world is a revolution that may turn out to be for the Middle East the equivalent of what the French Revolution was for Europe in 1789 : a profound and radical change that alters completely the situation that prevailed before . 
How many Bastilles will ultimately fall in the region , and at what pace , no one can say . 
The only recent analogy is the collapse of the Soviet bloc , followed by the demise of the Soviet Union itself , in 1989-1991 . 
Who saw that sudden and rapid transformation coming ? 
As the German Democratic Republic was about to disappear , some top French diplomats in Germany were still assuring their government in Paris that the Soviet Union would never accept German reunification , so there was nothing to worry about : life would go on nearly as usual . 
The specter of a united Germany was not to become a reality soon . 
We saw the same conservative instinct at work with the first reactions to the events in Tunisia , and then in Egypt . 
&quot; President Ben Ali is in control of the situation , &quot; some said . 
Or &quot; President Mubarak has our complete confidence . &quot; 
The United States managed to get it right , albeit very slowly , whereas many European countries erred on the side of the status quo for a much longer time , if not systematically , as they refused to see that the region could be evolving in a direction contrary to what they deemed to be in their strategic interest . 
Historical and geographic proximity , together with energy dependency and fear of massive immigration , paralyzed European diplomats . 
But there is something more fundamental underlying diplomats &quot; natural diffidence . 
They are very often right in their readings of a given situation - the US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks , for example , include a slew of masterful and penetrating analyses . 
But it is as if , owing to an excess of prudence , they cannot bring themselves to pursue their own arguments to their logical conclusions . 
Revolutionary ruptures upset diplomats &quot; familiar habits , both in terms of their personal contacts and , more importantly , in terms of their thinking . 
A fast-forward thrust into the unknown can be exhilarating , but it is also deeply frightening . 
In the name of &quot; realism , &quot; diplomats and foreign-policy strategists are naturally conservative . 
Indeed , it is no accident that Henry Kissinger &apos;s masterpiece , A World Restored , was devoted to the study of the recreation of the world order by the Vienna Congress after the rupture of the French Revolution , followed by the Napoleonic adventures . 
Is it more difficult to predict , and adjust to , the coming of a fundamental change , than to defend the present order , under the motto of &quot; the devil you know is always preferable to the devil you don &apos;t know ! &quot; 
But , beyond these mental habits lie more structural reasons for the conservatism of foreign policymakers and diplomats . 
By emphasizing the relations between states and governments over contacts with the opposition or civil societies ( when they exist in an identifiable form ) , traditional diplomacy has created for itself a handicap that is difficult to overcome . 
By requiring their diplomats to limit their contacts with &quot; alternative &quot; sources of information in a country , in order to avoid antagonizing despotic regimes , governments irremediably limit diplomats &quot; ability to see change coming , even when it is so close that nothing can be done . 
When regimes lose legitimacy in the eyes of their citizens , it is not reasonable to derive one &apos;s information mainly from that regime &apos;s servants and sycophants . 
In such cases , diplomats will too often merely report the regime &apos;s reassuring yet biased analysis . 
Diplomats , instead , should be judged by their ability to enter into a dialogue with all social actors : government representatives and business leaders , of course , but also representatives of civil society ( even if it exists only in embryonic form ) . 
With proper training and incentives , diplomats would be better equipped to anticipate change . 
Of course , not all Western foreign ministries are the same ; some do understand the need to nurture relationships with people outside the government - if not in opposition to it . 
But one thing is clear : the more traditional foreign ministries tend to be , the more difficult it is for them and their diplomats to grasp change . 
Needless to say , the ability to comprehend change has become indispensable at a time when the world is experiencing tectonic geopolitical shifts . 
The new Middle East that is emerging before us is probably both &quot; post-Western , &quot; given the rise of new powers , and &quot; post - Islamist , &quot; with the revolt led by young , technologically savvy people with no ties to political Islam whatsoever . 
By being late in perceiving change that they do not want to see coming , Western diplomats run the risk of losing on both levels : the regime and the people . 
Diplomats require openness and imagination in order to carry out their responsibilities . 
They should not abdicate these qualities when they are needed most .
