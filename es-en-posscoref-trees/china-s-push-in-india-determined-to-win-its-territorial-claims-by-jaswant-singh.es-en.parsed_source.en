The Invisible-Border War 
NEW DELHI - A half-century after the Sino-Indian War of 1962 , the border between China and India remains undefined and a constant source of friction between the world &apos;s two most populous countries . 
Following three weeks of fighting in 1962 , it was agreed to draw a Line of Actual Control ( LAC ) . 
But , five decades later , the map has yet to be delineated . 
As a result , both sides routinely send patrols up to the point where they believe the LAC should be - the latest episode being a three-week incursion by Chinese troops into Indian-held territory that began in April . 
Face-offs in the no-man &apos;s land that lies between where China and India each envisage the LAC are so common that the militaries of the two countries have developed a modus vivendi , whereby one side tells the other to withdraw peacefully . 
Both sides have routinely abided by the informal protocol that has evolved over the years . 
But not this time . 
In the area of Daulat Beg Oldie , near Depsang Plains , in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir , a patrol of about 15 People &apos;s Liberation Army soldiers crossed into Indian-held territory and set up camp for an extended stay . 
Stretching from the strategic Karakoram Pass , near Pakistan in the north , the LAC runs south , along the ridges of the eastern Himalayas to the ancient Buddhist monastery town of Tawang . 
After that , it traces the old McMahon Line drawn in 1914 - and rejected by China as an imperial dictate - to demarcate British India from what was then Tibet . 
The LAC then meanders until the point where India , China , and Burma meet . 
China &apos;s strategic interest in the line that separates India from a restive Tibet and the troublesome province of Xinjiang is straightforward . 
For India , Daulat Beg Oldie is an important outpost near the entrance to the Karakoram Pass and the Siachen Glacier region . 
So , was China &apos;s incursion into Indian territory an error by a local PLA commander ? 
Or was a more complex calculation in play ? 
The towering Karakoram Pass was part of the old silk route that connected Ladakh and Kashmir with Xinjiang - now , like Tibet , an &quot; autonomous region &quot; of China . 
As two observers recently described it , Daulat Beg Oldie was a kind of transfer point for goods to be loaded on to pack ponies &quot; for the cruel journey over the Saser La into the more hospitable Shyok river valley &quot; leading to &quot; Leh , Turtok , or Srinagar &#91; in Kashmir &#93; . &quot; 
India &apos;s parliament , not surprisingly , denounced the Chinese incursion in the harshest possible terms . 
The government , perplexed at first , tried unsuccessfully to make light of the presence of the PLA troops . 
A tent competition followed ; because China had pitched four , India pitched eight . 
The Financial Times quoted Sun Hongnian , a Chinese border expert : &quot; For India , every meter of road and every bunker in that area is a strategic win of territory &quot; that brings them &quot; closer to the main road on our side . &quot; 
The standoff came to an end on May 6 , as suddenly as it had started . 
India &apos;s foreign minister , having earlier termed the incursion a &quot; localized incident , &quot; had to change his tune under parliamentary pressure , and cautioned China that India might have to reconsider his projected visit to Beijing . 
Was all of this a Chinese effort to obtain , in Henry Kissinger &apos;s words , &quot; strategic deterrence &quot; ? 
Or was it a deliberate push toward realizing Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s proposal to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in South Africa in March ? 
Xi told Singh that he sought &quot; a fair , reasonable , and mutually acceptable settlement based on mutual understanding and accommodation , &quot; adding significantly , &quot; Let &apos;s settle the boundary framework agreement quickly . &quot; 
Was the Chinese incursion intended to serve as a sort of diplomatic accelerator ? 
India should take to heart former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd &apos;s prescient observation that &quot; China , a nation of foreign and security policy realists , respects strategic strength and is contemptuous of vacillation and weakness . &quot; 
After all , one of the lessons of the 1962 war was that a vacillating response to Chinese aggression is self-defeating , particularly in situations like that posed by the incursion at Daulat Beg Oldie . 
One thing seems clear from the recent incident : a new dispensation reigns in China , and will continue to guide policy for the next decade under Xi &apos;s leadership . 
The PLA troops in Daulat Beg Oldie are a reminder that China has no intention of allowing unresolved border issues to be swept under the rug . 
Indeed , almost simultaneously with the PLA incursion , scholars at an official Chinese think tank questioned Japanese sovereignty over Okinawa . 
Whether Xi &apos;s appeal to India to &quot; settle the boundary framework quickly &quot; was an exhortation or a warning , other Asian countries can no longer afford to ignore their own border disputes with China . 
As what happened in Daulat Beg Oldie demonstrates , China &apos;s new leaders are not interested in preserving the status quo .
