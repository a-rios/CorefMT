Libya &apos;s Shadow on Sovereign Wealth Funds 
NEW YORK - As Libya &apos;s citizens rebuild their lives and economy , undoing the corruption in the Libyan Investment Authority ( LIA ) , the sovereign wealth fund in which Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s regime allegedly stashed and misused Libya &apos;s oil wealth , is becoming a priority . 
The National Transitional Council is debating who should take over Libya &apos;s Central Bank and the LIA &apos;s assets - an especially important decision , given that oil production is not expected to return to pre-war levels for several years . 
Regardless of how the Libyan government eventually handles the LIA , all sovereign wealth funds - and their advisers and fundraisers - can learn several important lessons . 
Of course , no one should infer from the Libyan case that other SWFs across the board are riddled with corruption and conflicts of interest . 
The LIA has always been exceptional ; indeed , several indices that rank SWFs on transparency , accountability , and governance issues have traditionally given only Iran a lower ranking . 
Yet , while hard cases tend to make bad law and it is too early to judge , the LIA should be a wake-up call for corporations and funds both in the Middle East and around the globe . 
First , governments should better clarify the sources of funding behind each particular investment . 
Private funding that turns out to be public funding tied to the ruling family or government ministers presents different political and financial risks and should therefore be valued differently . 
Second , the Libyan crisis has crystallized the problem of corporate shares owned by sovereign governments . 
When the United States and the European Union decided to impose sanctions on the Libyan regime , including freezing shares owned by the LIA in European and American companies , many executives at these companies were surprised by how dramatically their firms were affected by the ownership structure . 
Clearly , the liquidity of the shares and the perception of a lack of diligence on the part of corporate managers matters mightily . 
Third , the LIA saga highlights SWFs &quot; potential cumulative effect on the stability of global markets . 
All SWFs can respond to global political events by quickly withdrawing funds invested abroad . 
As one of the WikiLeaks documents revealed , American diplomats lobbied the Libyan government during the financial crisis to keep funds in US banks , and to invest directly in a troubled US financial institution . 
In this case , the Libyans did not respond by withdrawing a large amount of funds , but that could happen in the future . 
Some argue that SWFs &quot; home governments and host countries have too many mutual interests - including the stability of the financial system and maintaining the US dollar as the world &apos;s reserve currency - to threaten global markets . 
That is true , on average and in normal times , but what happens if many SWFs , responding to sudden uncertainty and volatility , pull back at the same time for diplomatic or commercial reasons ? 
Individually rational behavior is often collectively suicidal . 
Finally , the Libyan case and the Dubai debt crisis of 2009 might increase suspicion in the developed world and lead to protectionism against SWFs , especially those from North Africa and the Gulf . 
The free flow of capital from these regions &quot; SWFs to corporations in the advanced countries is crucial in order to balance the global economy and provide liquidity to financial markets , especially given the prospect of another recession in the West . 
Both home and host states will have to make sure that the current conflict over the LIA will not impede this important process . 
But are we being fair by comparing the various regions &quot; SWFs and expecting them to adhere to Western standards ? 
The current efforts to restructure Libya &apos;s Central Bank and LIA will affect markets &quot; perceptions of other sovereign players in the region . 
Bahrain and Dubai come to mind . 
Although recent reports of the International Working Group of sovereign funds have indicated the difficulties in applying uniform governance standards , several measures are needed in order to bring Libya back to global capital markets . 
Despite the unique status of Libya &apos;s economy and political system today , scrutinizing the process of investment in foreign companies , as well as defining the nature of the relationships between the Libyan regime and fund management , is necessary to ensure healthy commercial relations between sovereigns and their portfolio investments . 
Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns , such as Libya-Italy relations , or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices . 
Both governments and corporations should internalize the message and learn from the Libyan example . 
The alternative may be too expensive for shareholders and citizens alike .
