The World in 2030 
CAMBRIDGE - What will the world look like two decades from now ? 
Obviously , nobody knows , but some things are more likely than others . 
Companies and governments have to make informed guesses , because some of their investments today will last longer than 20 years . 
In December , the United States National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) published its guess : Global Trends 2030 : Alternative Worlds . 
The NIC foresees a transformed world , in which &quot; no country - whether the US , China , or any other large country - will be a hegemonic power . &quot; 
This reflects four &quot; megatrends &quot; : individual empowerment and the growth of a global middle class ; diffusion of power from states to informal networks and coalitions ; demographic changes , owing to urbanization , migration , and aging ; and increased demand for food , water , and energy . 
Each trend is changing the world and &quot; largely reversing the historic rise of the West since 1750 , restoring Asia &apos;s weight in the global economy , and ushering in a new era of &quot; democratization &quot; at the international and domestic level . &quot; 
The US will remain &quot; first among equals &quot; in hard and soft power , but &quot; the &quot; unipolar moment &quot; is over . &quot; 
It is never safe , however , to project the future just by extrapolating current trends . 
Surprise is inevitable , so the NIC also identifies what it calls &quot; game-changers , &quot; or outcomes that could drive the major trends off course in surprising ways . 
First among such sources of uncertainty is the global economy : will volatility and imbalances lead to collapse , or will greater multipolarity underpin greater resilience ? 
Similarly , will governments and institutions be able to adapt fast enough to harness change , or will they be overwhelmed by it ? 
Moreover , while interstate conflict has been declining , intrastate conflict driven by youthful populations , identity politics , and scarce resources will continue to plague some regions like the Middle East , South Asia , and Africa . 
Then there is a set of questions concerning the impact of new technologies . 
Will they exacerbate conflict , or will they be developed and widely accessible in time to solve the problems caused by a growing population , rapid urbanization , and climate change ? 
The final game-changing issue is America &apos;s future role . 
In the NIC &apos;s view , the multi-faceted nature of US power suggests that even as China overtakes America economically - perhaps as early as the 2020 &quot; s - the US will most likely maintain global leadership alongside other great powers in 2030 . 
&quot; The potential for an overstretched US facing increased demands , &quot; the NIC argues , &quot; is greater than the risk of the US being replaced as the world &apos;s preeminent political leader . &quot; 
Is this good or bad for the world ? 
In the NIC &apos;s view , &quot; a collapse or sudden retreat of US power would most likely result in an extended period of global anarchy , &quot; with &quot; no stable international system and no leading power to replace the US . &quot; 
The NIC discussed earlier drafts of its report with intellectuals and officials in 20 countries , and reports that none of the world &apos;s emerging powers has a revisionist view of international order along the lines of Nazi Germany , Imperial Japan , or the Soviet Union . 
They benefit from the US-led world order , but are often irritated by American slights and unilateralism . 
One attraction of a multipolar world is less US dominance ; but the only thing worse than a US-supported international order would be no order at all . 
The question of America &apos;s role in helping to produce a more benign world in 2030 has important implications for President Barack Obama as he approaches his second term . 
The world faces a new set of transnational challenges , including climate change , transnational terrorism , cyber insecurity , and pandemics . 
All of these issues require cooperation to resolve . 
Obama &apos;s 2010 National Security Strategy argues that the US must think of power as positive-sum , not just zero-sum . 
In other words , there may be times when a more powerful China is good for the US ( and for the world ) . 
For example , the US should be eager to see China increase its ability to control its world-leading greenhouse-gas emissions . 
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has referred to the Obama administration &apos;s foreign policy as being based on &quot; smart power , &quot; which combines hard and soft power resources , and she argues that we should not talk about &quot; multipolarity , &quot; but about &quot; multi-partnerships . &quot; 
Likewise , the NIC report suggests that Americans must learn better how to exercise power with as well as over other states . 
To be sure , on issues arising from interstate military relations , understanding how to form alliances and balance power will remain crucial . 
Leadership on such issues will require cooperation , institutions , and the creation of public goods from which all can benefit and none can be excluded . 
The NIC report rightly concludes that there is no predetermined answer to what the world will look like in 2030 . 
Whether the future holds benign or malign scenarios depends in part on the policies that we adopt today .
