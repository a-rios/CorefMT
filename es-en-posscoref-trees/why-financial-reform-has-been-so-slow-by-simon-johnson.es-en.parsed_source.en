Banking Reform &apos;s Fear Factor 
WASHINGTON , DC - Nearly five years after the worst financial crisis since the 1930 &quot; s , and three years after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms in the United States , one question is on everyone &apos;s mind : Why have we made so little progress ? 
New rules have been promised , but very few have actually been implemented . 
There is not yet a &quot; Volcker Rule &quot; ( limiting proprietary trading by banks ) , the rules for derivatives are still a work-in-progress , and money-market funds remain unreformed . 
Even worse , our biggest banks have become even larger . 
There is no sign that they have abandoned the incentive structure that encourages excessive risk-taking . 
There are three possible explanations for what has gone wrong . 
One is that financial reform is inherently complicated . 
They are more than capable of writing and enforcing rules - that is , when this is what they are really asked to do . 
The second explanation focuses on conflict among agencies with overlapping jurisdictions , both within and across countries . 
Again , there is an element of truth to this ; but we have also seen a great deal of coordination even on the most complex topics - such as how much equity big banks should have , or how the potential failure of such a firm should be handled . 
That leaves the final explanation : those in charge of financial reform really did not want to make rapid progress . 
In both the US and Europe , government leaders are gripped by one overriding fear : that their economies will slip back into recession - or worse . 
The big banks play on this fear , arguing that financial reform will cause them to become unprofitable and make them unable to lend , or that there will be some other dire unintended consequence . 
There has been a veritable avalanche of lobbying on this point , which has resulted in top officials moving slowly , for fear of damaging the economy . 
But this is a grave mistake - based on a failure to understand how big banks can damage the economy . 
Higher equity-capital requirements , for example , require banks to fund themselves with relatively more equity and relatively less debt . 
This makes them safer , because they are more able to absorb losses , and less likely to become zombie banks ( which do not make sensible loans ) . 
The banks claim that higher capital requirements and other regulations will drive up the cost of credit . 
On the contrary , the biggest US banks are reporting very healthy profits for the last quarter . 
Unfortunately , a big part of these banks &quot; profits stems from trading securities - exactly the sort of high-risk activity that got them into trouble in the run-up to the 2008 global financial crisis . 
These are highly leveraged businesses , typically funding their balance sheets with no more than 5 % equity ( and thus 95 % debt ) . 
To understand why this is a problem , consider what happens when you buy a house with just 5 % down ( or less than 3 % down , which is a better analogy for some European banks ) . 
If house prices go up , you make a good return on your equity ( and a better return than if you had put 20 % down ) . 
Higher equity-capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy - they make financial crises ( and the zombie-syndrome ) less likely , less severe , or both . 
US banks are currently funded with more equity than was the case before the financial crisis , and they are doing fine . 
Nonetheless , we should still worry about their ability to blow themselves up in a novel and creative fashion - hence the need for the Volcker Rule , derivatives reform , and new rules for money-market funds . 
And equity-capital requirements for large , systemically important financial institutions remain too low . 
The latest indications are that US policymakers are finally starting to focus on this point . 
Many European banks , however , have less equity than their US counterparts , which creates an important source of vulnerability going forward . 
If there is to be a broad-based European recovery , the banks must raise more equity , thereby strengthening their ability to absorb potential losses . 
Unfortunately , there is little sign that European policymakers understand this point . 
Instead , senior officials in Europe think and talk like US policymakers did three years ago . 
They are wary of rocking the financial boat , so they go easy on financial reform and refuse to insist on more equity capital for banks . 
This is a mistake that they - and possibly all of us - may come to regret .
