Problem Solving in the Anthropocene 
STOCKHOLM - Take a deep breath . 
Savor it for a moment . 
Now consider this : None of our modern human ancestors ever breathed anything like it - and , the way things are going , nor will our descendants . 
Since the Industrial Revolution began , human activity has substantially changed the atmosphere &apos;s composition . 
Carbon-dioxide levels are higher today than they have been in at least 800,000 years . 
The amount of nitrogen and sulfur circulating through the Earth system has doubled . 
The ocean &apos;s pH is changing at an unprecedented rate , reaching levels of acidity that marine organisms have not experienced in the last 20 million years . 
Clearly , humans - who now occupy almost 40 % of the planet &apos;s ice-free land surface - are shaping many of the planet &apos;s fundamental processes . 
According to Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen , this shift is so profound that it amounts to the beginning of a new epoch : the Anthropocene . 
While some scientists believe that the Anthropocene actually began when humans started farming and domesticating animals , others ( including me ) consider it to be a more recent development . 
But , regardless of when the Anthropocene began , it is clear that humanity &apos;s impact on the planet increased substantially after World War II &apos;s end . 
Indeed , around 1950 , the world seems to have reached a tipping point , with practically every factor that heightens humanity &apos;s impact on the planet - population , GDP , fertilizer use , the proliferation of telephones , and paper consumption , to name only a few - beginning to increase rapidly . 
During this period , which the scientist Will Steffen dubbed the &quot; Great Acceleration , &quot; the human population became sufficiently large and connected , with high enough consumption , to become a major global force . 
In a 2009 study , scientists concluded that , by crossing any of nine &quot; planetary boundaries &quot; - climate change , biodiversity loss , disruption of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles , land use , freshwater extraction , ocean acidification , ozone depletion , atmospheric aerosol loading , and chemical pollution - humans would increase the risk of fundamentally changing the Earth system . 
Given that these boundaries are closely interlinked , allowing trends toward any of them to continue , especially at the current rate , would drive the environment into unknown territory , potentially causing serious damage to the systems that underpin human survival . 
In order to cope with the unique challenges of the Anthropocene , humans need a new approach to management and strategic decision-making . 
Developing successful strategies will require abandoning long-held assumptions that worked in the past , but that have become counterproductive myths today . 
One such myth is that it is best to tackle one problem at a time with straightforward , targeted solutions . 
While this approach may be appealing , it is inadequate to address today &apos;s most pressing issues . 
For example , producing and delivering nutritious food consistently to upwards of nine billion people by mid-century has implications for water and energy consumption , agricultural development and land use , the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles , and ocean acidification , not to mention biodiversity loss , such as through overfishing . 
Given this , the Green Revolution &apos;s narrow , production-focused approach cannot overcome food insecurity in the future , even though it produced truly impressive output increases in the past . 
The world needs an innovative , comprehensive strategy aimed at optimizing the entire food system - for example , by improving fertilizer and water use and food transportation and storage ; by ensuring that adequate nutrition is accessible and affordable for all ; and by changing communities &quot; eating habits to include less resource-intensive food . 
The trouble is that complexity can be overwhelming , so people often prefer to break down complex systems into individual components . 
Rather than consider , say , eradicating extreme poverty and averting global warming in tandem - and developing mutually reinforcing strategies to achieve these goals - proposed solutions focus on one or the other , undermining their effectiveness . 
Of course , addressing interconnected issues simultaneously carries its share of challenges . 
For one thing , no single person or group has enough knowledge or experience to solve all of the problems afflicting a complex system at once . 
But a wider community - including governments , businesses , researchers , philosophers , faith communities , and even poets and artists - could devise and implement holistic strategies . 
Success will depend on participants &quot; willingness to cooperate and their commitment to put evidence before ideology . 
Thus , the real challenge lies in marshaling such an inclusive community - something at which global leaders have not proved adept . 
A second major challenge is that resources are limited , making it impossible to solve all of the world &apos;s problems at once . 
In this context , the ability to prioritize effectively is essential . 
But , rather than emphasizing one problem over another , the top priority should be building resilience into all global systems . 
Mechanisms aimed at solving a problem in one system should not be allowed to compromise another system &apos;s resilience . 
Another challenge will be to devise new metrics to replace GDP as the leading measure of human well-being . 
Even Simon Kuznets , the main architect of the concept of GDP , recognized that it does not account for many of the factors affecting human well-being ; he argued that it should be used &quot; only with some qualifications . &quot; 
In the Anthropocene , GDP must be part of an array of metrics for assessing economic , natural , and social capital - that is , the value of the goods and services produced , as well as the dignity of the ecosystems and social structures that underpin this output . 
Navigating the Anthropocene effectively and ethically is perhaps the most daunting challenge that modern humans have faced . 
Overcoming it will require a smarter approach to strategic decision-making and a broader understanding of innovation . 
It is time for us to rise to the challenge .
