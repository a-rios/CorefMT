Reversing Europe &apos;s Renationalization 
NEW YORK - Far from abating , the euro crisis has taken a turn for the worse in recent months . 
The European Central Bank managed to relieve an incipient credit crunch through its long-term refinancing operation ( LTRO ) , which lent over a trillion euros to eurozone banks at one percent . 
This brought considerable relief to financial markets , and the resulting rally obscured underlying deterioration ; but that is unlikely to last much longer . 
The fundamental problems have not been resolved ; indeed , the gap between creditor and debtor countries continues to widen . 
The crisis has entered what may be a less volatile but potentially more lethal phase . 
At the onset of the crisis , the eurozone &apos;s breakup was inconceivable : the assets and liabilities denominated in the common currency were so intermingled that a breakup would cause an uncontrollable meltdown . 
But , as the crisis has progressed , the eurozone financial system has been progressively reoriented along national lines . 
This trend has gathered momentum in recent months . 
The LTRO enabled Spanish and Italian banks to engage in very profitable and low-risk arbitrage in their own countries &quot; bonds . 
And the preferential treatment received by the ECB on its Greek bonds will discourage other investors from holding sovereign debt . 
If this continues for a few more years , a eurozone breakup would become possible without a meltdown - the omelet could be unscrambled - but it would leave the creditor countries &quot; central banks holding large , difficult-to-enforce claims against the debtor countries &quot; central banks . 
The Bundesbank has become aware of the danger . 
This is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy : once the Bundesbank starts guarding against a breakup , everybody will have to do the same . 
Markets are beginning to reflect this . 
The Bundesbank is also tightening credit at home . 
This would be the right policy if Germany was a freestanding country , but the eurozone &apos;s heavily indebted member countries badly need stronger demand from Germany to avoid recession . 
Without it , the eurozone &apos;s &quot; fiscal compact , &quot; agreed last December , cannot possibly work . 
The heavily indebted countries will either fail to implement the necessary measures , or , if they do , they will fail to meet their targets , as collapsing growth drives down budget revenues . 
Either way , debt ratios will rise , and the competitiveness gap with Germany will widen . 
Whether or not the euro endures , Europe faces a long period of economic stagnation or worse . 
Other countries have gone through similar experiences . 
But the European Union is not a country , and it is unlikely to survive . 
The deflationary debt trap is threatening to destroy a still-incomplete political union . 
The only way to escape the trap is to recognize that current policies are counterproductive and change course . 
I cannot propose a cut-and-dried plan , but three observations stand out . 
First , the rules governing the eurozone have failed and need to be radically revised . 
Defending a status quo that is unworkable only makes matters worse . 
Second , the current situation is highly anomalous , and some exceptional measures are needed to restore normalcy . 
Finally , the new rules must allow for financial markets &quot; inherent instability . 
To be realistic , the current fiscal compact governing the eurozone must be taken as the starting point . 
Of course , some already-visible defects will need to be modified . 
Notably , the compact should count commercial as well as financial debts , and government budgets should distinguish between investments that pay and current spending . 
In order to avoid cheating , what qualifies as investment should be subject to approval by a European authority . 
Most importantly , some extraordinary measures need to be invented to bring conditions back to normal . 
The EU &apos;s fiscal charter compels member states annually to reduce their public debt by one-twentieth of the amount by which it exceeds 60 % of GDP . 
I propose that member states jointly reward good behavior by taking over that obligation . 
The member states have transferred their seignorage rights to the ECB , and the ECB is currently earning about € 25 billion ( $ 32.7 billion ) annually . 
The seignorage rights have been estimated by Willem Buiter of Citibank and Huw Pill of Goldman Sachs , working independently , to be worth between € 2-3 trillion , because they will yield more as the economy grows and interest rates return to normal . 
A Special Purpose Vehicle ( SPV ) owning the rights could use the ECB to finance the cost of acquiring the bonds without violating Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty . 
Should a country violate the fiscal compact , it would wholly or partly forfeit its reward and be obliged to pay interest on the debt owned by the SPV . 
That would impose tough fiscal discipline , indeed . 
By rewarding good behavior , the fiscal compact would no longer constitute a deflationary debt trap , and the outlook would radically improve . 
In addition , to narrow the competitiveness gap , all members should be able to refinance their existing debt at the same interest rate . 
But that would require greater fiscal integration , so it would have to be phased in gradually . 
The Bundesbank will never accept these proposals , but the European authorities ought to take them seriously . 
The future of Europe is a political issue , and thus is beyond the Bundesbank &apos;s competence to decide .
