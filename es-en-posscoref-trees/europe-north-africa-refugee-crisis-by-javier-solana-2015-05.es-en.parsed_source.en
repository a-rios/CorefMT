Europe &apos;s Refugee Amnesia 
BARCELONA - After World War I , when millions of European civilians were made refugees , forced out of their homelands by enemy occupation or deportation , an international regime was developed to coordinate effective responses and ease the suffering of those who had been uprooted . 
A century later , another refugee crisis is underway , and this time , it is Europe that has the power to provide safe haven to desperate people . 
Yet it has not risen to the occasion , with many of its responses failing to match the urgency of the situation . 
In just the first few months of 2015 , more than 38,000 people have attempted to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa . 
Some 1,800 people have died as a result - more than twice the number of such deaths in all of 2013 . 
Disappointingly , many Europeans have responded to this humanitarian crisis , which closely resembles the one that Europe endured a century ago , by opposing their countries &quot; acceptance of any more refugees . 
How quickly we forget our past . 
Today &apos;s sentiment has been fueled by populist parties positioning themselves as guardians of national identity . 
Europe , they argue , faces a mass influx that threatens to place even greater strain on its economies , labor markets , and cultures . 
One does not have to look back a century to see how dangerous the consequences of such rhetoric can be . 
But the populists &quot; narrative is not just inflammatory ; it is false . 
Although it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the drivers of displacement , data from the United Nations refugee agency show that at least half of those trying to reach Europe from North Africa are fleeing from war and persecution . 
The International Organization for Migration , together with Italy &apos;s navy , has determined that this year &apos;s migrants hail mainly from Eritrea , Gambia , Nigeria , Somalia , and Syria â€’ countries where conditions entitle their citizens to request asylum . 
In short , this is a crisis not of immigrants , but of refugees - and it is showing no sign of slowing . 
Indeed , with instability and violence plaguing much of North Africa and the Middle East , the decline in armed conflict since World War II seems to have slowed - and could even reverse . 
The international community is legally bound to protect those who are being forced to flee their homes by conflict and persecution . 
Given Europe &apos;s history and values - not to mention its proximity to some of the beleaguered populations - it has a special obligation to contribute to this effort . 
But Europe is not the only region that has been burdened by today &apos;s migration flows - or even the most affected . 
Nine out of ten refugees do not leave their region , fleeing to countries very close to or bordering their own . 
The Jordanian refugee camp Zaatari alone shelters more than 82,000 people ; if it were an official city , it would be among the country &apos;s most populous . 
Lebanon , a country of just 4.5 million people , has taken in an estimated 1,116,000 refugees - roughly equivalent to the population of Brussels . 
Given this , it is difficult to justify Europe &apos;s failure to agree on a system of relocation and resettlement for a total of , say , 20,000 refugees this year , distributed among 28 countries according to individual quotas . 
Indeed , many European countries have accepted very few refugees so far , making their inaction even more difficult to comprehend . 
Spain and Greece , for example , have each accepted only about 4,000 - a meager amount , when compared to Jordan or Lebanon . 
A quota-based agreement could help to disperse the burden across European countries . 
As it stands , major differences among countries &quot; asylum policies have meant major disparities in refugee numbers . 
Indeed , just four countries - France , Germany , Italy , and Sweden - accounted for two-thirds of all refugees accepted in Europe last year . 
When a network of human traffickers turns the Mediterranean into a mass grave , Europe cannot simply turn away . 
Instead of succumbing to destructive populism and dishonorable isolationism , Europe &apos;s leaders must commit to fulfilling their legal and moral responsibility to help the refugees - and , of course , to explain to their citizens why this is so important . 
Such an effort would require every European country - not just those situated on the Mediterranean - to contribute resources to support large-scale search-and-rescue operations . 
Border control cannot be the only - or even the primary - objective . 
Beyond helping to manage the crisis today , Europe must commit to helping fragile and conflict-affected countries overcome the challenges they face , improve their citizens &quot; wellbeing , and build thriving economies . 
To retain its moral and political authority , the European Union - perhaps the most compelling example of how cooperation can support peace and prosperity - must implicate itself beyond its frontiers in a sincere and determined way , reaching mutually beneficial agreements with its southern neighbors . 
Behind almost every request for asylum that an EU country receives is a human tragedy - a micro-history of violence , fear , and loss . 
The goal of the asylum-seekers is not to reach Europe ; it is simply to escape conflict and persecution . 
And they should be able to . 
Last century - in both world wars - Europeans were the ones fleeing from persecution . 
With the number of displaced people now at levels unseen since World War II , Europe has a responsibility to recall its history . 
And it should take the opportunity to respond to today &apos;s refugee crisis as it would have liked the world to respond to its suffering - and to prove that the EU &apos;s value extends far beyond its borders .
