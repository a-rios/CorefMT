Can Argentina &apos;s Success Last ? 
BUENOS AIRES - Argentina is a curious country . 
During the past eight years , the economy put up exceptional indicators : GDP grew almost 70 % ( nearly as dynamic as China ) and formal employment increased more than 30 % . 
The country &apos;s unprecedentedly solid fiscal results are accompanied by foreign-trade surpluses that are the envy of even the world &apos;s most fiscally solvent countries . 
All of this represents an utterly unexpected recovery from the vast public and private external indebtedness of just a decade ago . 
Indeed , Argentina &apos;s sharp rebound has generated a huge accumulation of foreign reserves for the country . 
Also surprising is the increase in Argentina &apos;s domestic savings rate , which has enabled self-financing of investment - which has doubled - and , paradoxically , capital outflows . 
Robust economic growth , driven by high international commodity prices , has underpinned record-high tax revenues and , after eight years of generally very prosperous trade , the country &apos;s corporate sector is in better health than ever before . 
Most economists predict a healthy 5 % annual growth rate in 2011 , together with positive fiscal and external results . 
Moreover , the international situation for Argentina is highly favorable , with excellent terms of trade guaranteeing strong performance for producers of raw materials . 
Brazil , with its burgeoning economy and strong currency , is Argentina &apos;s best partner , particularly for the automotive sector . 
But Argentina &apos;s economic landscape is more complex than the main economic indicators suggest . 
Since mid-2007 , expectations regarding long-term sustainability have been weakening . 
Indeed , the efficiency of public spending is doubtful , with scant positive results to show for it . 
Moreover , the international economic crisis and tight energy-supplies have taken a toll on confidence , as have tensions over the nationalization of pension funds and conflicts with soy producers , who oppose an increase in their already high taxes . 
In a country with one of the worst histories of economic crisis and volatility , fears of a new meltdown are growing , and investors have been dollarizing their portfolios in order to protect their capital . 
Over the past three years , $ 52 billion in capital has fled the country . 
The threat of crisis in 2011 has eased , but doubts about the longer term remain . 
Argentina requires a comprehensive program to demonstrate that , in addition to the ability to generate wealth that it has shown over the past eight years , it can sustain economic growth and not revert to the volatility of the past . 
The key economic-policy goals should be to rationalize public spending , rein in the growth in the money-supply in order to tame inflation , stem capital outflows , and address utility rates and subsidies . 
Argentina &apos;s high levels of social exclusion and poverty remain unsolved problems that must be addressed if long-term growth is to be sustained . 
Failure to address these important problems risks a continuing high rate of inflation , now running in excess of 20 % per year - one of the highest annual rates in the world , and well above the rate at which the Argentine peso is depreciating . 
This is eroding the external surplus , weakening domestic purchasing power , and causing investments to be postponed . 
A key priority must be to increase investment by creating a climate of trust . 
The financial sector is seven times smaller than the OECD average , and almost all companies rely on short-term loans . 
Opening negotiations with the Paris Club over the debts that the country renounced in 2002 , and appealing to the International Monetary Fund for technical assistance to give credibility and transparency to official statistics , would contribute to normalizing access to international credit markets . 
Moreover , in order to provide much-needed finance to local firms , Argentina needs some of the savings that have been sent abroad to return . 
Today , the macroeconomic , business , and international context is extremely favorable for Argentina - as it is for all countries with abundant natural resources , a strong capacity for enterprise and innovation , and a qualified labor force . 
But an overarching collective commitment is needed to take advantage of this opportunity , and to achieve inclusive development . 
In order to avoid the recurring crises of the past , Argentina must re-establish trust and implement a macroeconomic program to slow inflation , maintain fiscal balance , and promote investment , technological development , and education . 
Only then can Argentina achieve greater social equality and boost economic competitiveness . 
Argentina has been given yet another chance in the past eight years . 
This time , it had better make the most of it .
