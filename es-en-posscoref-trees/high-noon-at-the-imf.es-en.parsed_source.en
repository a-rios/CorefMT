High Noon at the IMF 
This month &apos;s International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) meetings in Washington will bring together the world &apos;s top finance ministers and central bankers at a critical juncture for the global economy . 
For starters , the roof is starting to collapse on the global housing bubble , as housing markets begin to freeze up not only in the United States , but also in many other countries , such as high-flying Spain . 
Moreover , money markets , especially in Europe , remain traumatized by the festering global credit crunch . 
Record-high food and energy prices , combined with sharply rising wages in China , are pushing up inflation in much of the world . 
Last , but not least , the US productivity boom is decelerating . 
These combined pressures will make it far more difficult for central banks to sustain the so-called &quot; Goldilocks &quot; economy ( &quot; just right &quot; inflation and growth ) . 
At the same time , the outside world will be looking especially carefully at what , if anything , officials plan to do if the dollar continues to sink . 
Though exchange rates are notoriously unpredictable , the best guess is that a slow unwinding of the massive US trade deficit will keep the dollar on a path of gradual long-term decline . 
But the fact that several Asian and emerging-market countries are resisting this decline by buying dollars is putting inordinate pressures on the more flexible currencies , such as the euro and the Canadian dollar , which are trading at record levels . 
( What are the Chinese planning to do with all their ever-growing $ 1.4 trillion in reserves ? 
Do they intend to give foreign athletes paper bags stuffed with dollars as a welcoming present at the Olympic village ? ) 
European leaders are arguing , with some justification , that their exporters are paying the price for America &apos;s huge trade imbalance with Asian and oil-exporting countries . 
If the US goes into recession , the acrimony will get a lot worse . 
The IMF &apos;s leadership tried to broker a deal over currencies at its April meeting , but without tangible results . 
Given that China &apos;s ruling Communists are holding their Party Congress at the same time as the current IMF meetings , a deal seems unlikely now , too . 
Yet , given clear inflationary pressures in countries like Saudi Arabia , Argentina , and Russia , and notable price spikes in China , the world just might have reached a moment when agreement can be reached . 
Let &apos;s hope so . 
There could be a real disaster if US growth woes turn today &apos;s mild downward pressures into something much more serious . 
The Federal Reserve would be forced to lower interest rates further , making the dollar even less attractive , and the concomitant shift in global demand away from the US , marked by a sharp decline in the US trade balance , would put still more pressure on the dollar . 
According to my own calculations in a series of research papers with Maurice Obstfeld , the trade-weighted dollar would likely fall by 20 % if a global demand shift ( say , due to a US housing recession ) were to cut the US trade deficit in half . 
In principle , such a depreciation against all of the world &apos;s currencies is manageable . 
But if emerging markets force Europe to take all the adjustment , the results would be catastrophic , pushing up the euro to $ 1.50 , $ 1.60 or beyond , with truly dire consequences for trade . 
Indeed , the US Congress has already produced a series of ominous bills aimed at retaliating against China and other countries that engage in one-way currency intervention . 
The leading Democratic US presidential candidates have indicated their support . 
Fortunately , the IMF recently asserted the right to take action if countries engage in sustained one-way currency intervention . 
But will incoming IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn be able to exercise this new power quickly enough to avert a crisis ? 
The IMF itself , of course , is in a deep crisis , with many questioning its mission and legitimacy . 
For better or for worse , however , current circumstances offer an opportunity . 
It would be unfortunate if the finance ministers merely sit around and beg Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank head Jean-Claude Trichet to rescue them with rate cuts . 
It would be even worse if European ministers , frustrated with gridlock over exchange rates , started sharing ideas for creatively managing their budgets to stimulate short-term demand , rather than long-term growth . 
For the past couple of years , finance ministers and central bank heads have had the luxury of using the IMF meetings to congratulate themselves on rapid global growth , regardless of how much they actually contributed to it . 
( Globalization and China were the biggest part of the story . ) 
This time needs to be different .
