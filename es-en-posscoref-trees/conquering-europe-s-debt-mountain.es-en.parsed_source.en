Conquering Europe &apos;s Debt Mountain 
BERLIN - The International Monetary Fund estimates that the crisis-induced net cost of financial-sector support provided by G-20 countries in 2009 amounted to 1.7 % of GDP ( $ 905 billion ) , while discretionary fiscal stimulus amounted to 2 % of GDP in both 2009 and 2010 . 
All the eurozone countries , except Luxembourg and Finland , reported fiscal deficits in excess of 3 % of GDP in 2009 , while Greece , Spain , and Ireland ran deficits of more than 10 % . 
Within a single year , eurozone governments &quot; general debt increased by almost 10 percentage points ( 78.7 % of GDP in 2009 , compared with 69.3 % in 2008 ) . 
As for Germany , the 2010 federal budget features a record-high deficit of well above € 50 billion . 
Public-sector debt will surpass € 1.7 trillion , approaching 80 % of GDP . 
Interest payments , which consume more than 10 % of Germany &apos;s federal budget , will grow along with the mounting debt burden - and even faster if interest rates rise . 
Yet the financial crisis and the ensuing recession go only so far towards explaining these high levels of indebtedness . 
The truth is that many European and G-20 countries have lived far beyond their means - including Germany , despite its reputation as a paragon of fiscal rectitude . 
Even in good times , governments have for too long been spending more than they received . 
Perhaps worse , some also spent more than they could easily repay , given their economies &quot; declining long-term growth potential because of the aging of their populations . 
Such profligacy has led to levels of debt that will become unsustainable if we do not act . 
This is why Germany decided in 2009 to enshrine strict fiscal rules in its constitution . 
The Schuldenbremse , or &quot; debt brake , &quot; requires the federal government to run a structural deficit of no more than 0.35 % of GDP by 2016 , while Germany &apos;s Länder will be banned from running structural deficits at all as of 2020 . 
The current federal government will certainly abide by these rules , which implies reducing the structural deficit to approximately € 10 billion by 2016 - a reduction of about € 7 billion a year . 
Welfare benefits account for more than half of Germany &apos;s federal spending this year . 
So there is little choice but to cut welfare spending , at least moderately . 
But this sort of fiscal consolidation can be achieved only if a majority perceives it as being socially equitable . 
Recipients of social and corporate welfare alike , as well as civil servants , must share the sacrifice . 
Thus , German corporations will have to contribute to fiscal consolidation through reductions in subsidies and additional taxes on major energy companies , airlines , and financial institutions . 
Similarly , civil servants must forego promised pay increases , and the government is looking for annual savings in the federal armed forces of up to € 3 billion through structural reforms . 
Germany &apos;s binding fiscal rules set a positive example for other eurozone countries . 
But all eurozone governments need to demonstrate their own commitment to fiscal consolidation in order to restore the confidence of markets - and of their own citizens . 
Recent studies show that once a government &apos;s debt burden reaches a threshold perceived to be unsustainable , more debt will only stunt , not stimulate , economic growth . 
Greece &apos;s debt crisis was a clear warning that European policymakers must not allow public debt to pile up indefinitely . 
The EU was right to react decisively to ensure the euro &apos;s stability by providing short-term assistance to Greece and establishing the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism . 
But , while the EFSF is a necessary step towards restoring confidence , the Greek crisis has revealed structural weaknesses of the European Monetary Union &apos;s fiscal-policy framework that cannot , and should not , be fixed by routinely throwing other countries &quot; money at the problem . 
Indeed , I consider the EFSF to be a stopgap measure while we remedy the fundamental shortcomings of the Stability and Growth Pact , whose fiscal rules lack both substantive and formal bite . 
This is why we need a more effective crisis-prevention and crisis-resolution framework for the eurozone , one that strengthens the Pact &apos;s preventive and corrective provisions . 
Sanctions for eurozone countries that seriously infringe EMU rules should take effect more quickly and with less political discretion , and also should be tougher . 
Germany and France have proposed stricter rules on borrowing and spending , backed by tough , semi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not comply . 
Countries that repeatedly ignore recommendations for reducing excessive deficits , and those that manipulate official statistics , should have their EU funds frozen and their voting rights suspended . 
Monetary union was intended to be neither a panacea for eurozone members nor a get-rich scheme for financial speculators . 
Nor was it meant to be a system of redistribution from richer to poorer countries via cheaper borrowing for governments by means of common Eurobonds or outright fiscal transfers . 
It won &apos;t succeed if some countries persistently run deficits and weaken their competitiveness at the expense of the euro &apos;s stability . 
EMU was designed to encourage structural reforms . 
Profligate members were supposed to be forced by the Stability and Growth Pact , as well as by their peers , to live within their means and thus strengthen their competiveness . 
Instead , Germany &apos;s former social-democratic government weakened the pact when doing so was politically convenient , while less competitive eurozone members allowed wages to rise and the public sector to become bloated , and then looked away as easy credit fueled both debt and asset bubbles . 
We cannot foster sustainable growth or preempt a sovereign-debt crisis in Europe ( or anywhere else ) by piling-up more debt . 
European countries need to reduce their deficits in a growth-friendly fashion , but reduce them they must . 
It can be done : Germany is reducing its debt burden to sustainable levels while strengthening its long-term growth prospects . 
Its course of pro-growth deficit reduction , together with its suggestions for strengthening Europe &apos;s fiscal framework , could serve as a blueprint for European economic governance .
