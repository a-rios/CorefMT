The Paradox of Identity Politics 
BARCELONA - The United Kingdom &apos;s recent general election provided a clear example of how the question of national identity is reshaping Europe &apos;s political landscape . 
The Scottish National Party , embodying a left-wing version of identity politics , wiped out Labour in Scotland , allowing the Conservatives to gain an absolute majority in Parliament . 
The government of Prime Minister David Cameron - who has focused on British identity , rather than the UK &apos;s common destiny with Europe - will undoubtedly hold a referendum on the UK &apos;s continued membership in the European Union , with unpredictable consequences . 
For decades , political debate in Europe focused largely on economic institutions and policies . 
Conservatives argued for a private sector-driven economy , unfettered markets , low taxes , reduced government spending , and limited public goods . 
Liberals and social democrats supported a private-ownership economy , markets , European integration , and increased trade , tempered by substantially redistributive taxes and transfers , a strong social safety net , and some public ownership in areas such as infrastructure and finance . 
In this bi-polar system , the parties differed on the nuances of economic policy , but broadly agreed on democratic values , the European project , and the need to adapt to and manage globalization , rather than reject it wholesale . 
Are the ghosts of the early and mid-twentieth century returning ? 
The question is particularly relevant for Europe , but it also has global significance . 
In the Middle East , for example , identity politics is manifesting itself in its most sinister form : a chaotic and violent clash between Sunni and Shia Muslims , exemplified by the rise of the Islamic State . 
Loyalty to a perceived identity can have innocuous and enriching components , such as , say , the promotion of a regional language . 
The problem with identity politics is that it places the &quot; in &quot; group at odds with the perceived &quot; other &quot; - an approach that can easily foster chauvinism , invidious discrimination , and open antagonism . 
One major reason for the resurgence of identity politics in Europe is globalization , which has limited the capacity of countries or peoples to control their economies . 
Indeed , the global economy has become so interconnected , and world markets so powerful , that there appears to be little scope for national policies to disrupt hyper-mobile capital flows . 
While globalization has helped to boost overall prosperity , it has been most beneficial for those who form the new global elite . 
Meanwhile , many people in Europe face greater economic insecurity , owing to new technologies or competition from lower-cost workers elsewhere . 
Unless they can upgrade their knowledge and skills - and , in some cases , move to a new industry or location - they face constrained economic opportunities . 
These disadvantaged groups are particularly large in the countries that were hit hardest by the recent global financial crisis and now struggle with high unemployment . 
But even people who are relatively prosperous are frustrated by some features of globalization . 
They may oppose the use of their taxes to &quot; subsidize &quot; poorer people who do not share their identity , such as immigrants , French-speaking Belgians , southern Italians , or Greeks . 
When it comes to trade protectionism , European integration , and economic globalization , those on the far right and the far left often share the same views . 
And , indeed , the National Front &apos;s economic program is rather similar to that of the Left Front ( an electoral bloc comprising the French Communist Party and the Left Party ) . 
Of course , when it comes to immigration and human rights , the internationalist ideological tradition of socialism prevents extreme nationalist and racist discourse on the far left . 
Meanwhile , the rise of identity-driven political movements presents a huge challenge for Europe &apos;s traditional political parties . 
Mainstream conservatives , widely perceived as being in thrall to the economic interests of the wealthy , must find ways to appear populist - but without sounding too much like their far-right competitors on immigration and human rights . 
Cameron has succeeded in this delicate balancing act - and has been rewarded by voters . 
Mainstream Republicans in the United States , pressured by the more extreme forces within their party , face a similar challenge . 
For center-left parties , the task is even more daunting . 
They must offer voters a realistic economic program that is market-friendly and open to international trade , while promising tangible benefits to the poorer 60-70 % of the population who are understandably frustrated with their lack of economic progress . 
If a left party &apos;s economic policy is perceived as a weak copy of the right &apos;s agenda , the poorest segments of the population will gravitate to chauvinist forces and their false promises of protection from the consequences of globalization . 
The upcoming elections in Spain , Turkey , Denmark , and Portugal - not to mention next year &apos;s US presidential election - will present their own versions of these challenges . 
The left , in particular , will have to defend the principles of equality and democracy , while finding ways to manage irreversible globalization , including through international cooperation . 
The great paradox is that if the rise of identity politics continues , governments will be even less able to address the problems that are fueling it .
