Keynes and Social Democracy Today 
LONDON - For decades , Keynesianism was associated with social democratic big-government policies . 
But John Maynard Keynes &apos;s relationship with social democracy is complex . 
Although he was an architect of core components of social democratic policy - particularly its emphasis on maintaining full employment - he did not subscribe to other key social democratic objectives , such as public ownership or massive expansion of the welfare state . 
In The General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money , Keynes ends by summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of the capitalist system . 
On one hand , capitalism offers the best safeguard of individual freedom , choice , and entrepreneurial initiative . 
On the other hand , unregulated markets fail to achieve two central goals of any civilized society : &quot; The outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes . &quot; 
This suggested an active role for government , which dovetailed with important strands of left-wing thought . 
Until The General Theory was published in 1936 , social democrats did not know how to go about achieving full employment . 
Their policies were directed at depriving capitalists of the ownership of the means of production . 
How this was to produce full employment was never worked out . 
There was an idea , originally derived from Ricardo and Marx , that the capitalist class needed a &quot; reserve army of the unemployed &quot; to maintain its profit share . 
If profits were eliminated , the need for that reserve army would disappear . 
Labor would be paid what it was worth , and everyone willing to work would be able to find a job . 
But , apart from the political impossibility of nationalizing the whole economy peacefully , this approach suffered from the fatal flaw of ignoring the role of aggregate demand . 
It assumed that demand would always be sufficient if profits were eliminated . 
Keynes demonstrated that the main cause of bouts of heavy and prolonged unemployment was not worker encroachment on profits , but the fluctuating prospects of private investment in an uncertain world . 
Nearly all unemployment in a cyclical downturn was the result of the failure of investment demand . 
Thus , the important thing was not to nationalize the capital stock , but to socialize investment . 
Industry could be safely left in private hands , provided the state guaranteed enough spending power in the economy to maintain a full-employment level of investment . 
This could be achieved by monetary and fiscal policy : low interest rates and large state investment programs . 
In short , Keynes aimed to achieve a key social democratic objective without changing the ownership of industry . 
Nevertheless , he did think that redistribution would help secure full employment . 
A greater tendency to consume would &quot; serve to increase at the same time the inducement to invest . &quot; 
And the low interest rates needed to maintain full employment would lead in time to the &quot; euthanasia of the rentier &quot; - of those who live off the rents of capital . 
Moderate re-distribution was the more politically radical implication of Keynes &apos;s economic theory , but the measures outlined above were also the limits of state intervention for him . 
As long as &quot; the state is able to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments &#91; i.e. , the capital base &#93; and the basic reward to those who own them , &quot; there is no &quot; obvious case &quot; for further involvement . 
The public was never to substitute for the private , but merely to complement it . 
Today , ideas about full employment and equality remain at the heart of social democracy . 
Whereas the front used to run between government and the owners of the means of production - the industrialists , the rentiers - now , it runs between governments and finance . 
Such measures as the efforts by the European Parliament to regulate the derivatives market or the British government &apos;s ban on short selling in the wake of the financial crisis or the demand to caps bankers &quot; bonuses are contemporary expressions of the wish to reduce the power of financial speculation to damage the economy . 
The new focus on the need to tame the power of finance is largely a consequence of globalization . 
Capital moves across borders more freely and more quickly than goods or people do . 
Yet , while large global firms habitually use their high concentration of financial resources to press for further de-regulation ( &quot; or we will go somewhere else &quot; ) , the crisis has turned their size into a liability . 
Being too big to fail simply means being too big . 
Keynes saw that &quot; it is the financial markets &quot; precariousness which creates no small part of our contemporary problem of securing sufficient investment . &quot; 
That rings truer today - more than 70 years later - than in his own day . 
Rather than securing investment for productive sectors of the economy , the financial industry has become adept at securing investment in itself . 
This , once again , calls for an activist government policy . 
Yet , as Keynes would have argued , it is important that the expansion of government involvement is informed by sound economics rather than political ideology , social democratic or otherwise . 
State intervention needs to bridge gaps that the private sector cannot reasonably be expected to do on its own . 
The current crisis has shown with utmost clarity that private markets are unable to self-regulate ; domestic regulation is therefore a key area in which government has a role to play . 
Similarly , time-inconsistency issues prevent large international firms from compartmentalizing their markets . 
Re-erecting barriers to capital flows in the form of international taxes , thereby cordoning off crises before they turn global , is therefore another task for government . 
Keynes &apos;s main contribution to social democracy , however , does not lie in the specifics of policy , but in his insistence that the state as ultimate protector of the public good has a duty to supplement and regulate market forces . 
If we need markets to stop the state from behaving badly , we need the state to stop markets from behaving badly . 
That means limiting their power , and their profits .
