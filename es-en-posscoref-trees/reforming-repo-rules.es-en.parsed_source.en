Reforming Repo Rules 
CAMBRIDGE - Sometimes , we just don &apos;t learn . 
After the financial crisis , the United States enacted the Dodd-Frank Act to overhaul American financial regulation , with the aim of reducing the risk of another financial meltdown . 
But it did nothing to reform &quot; repo &quot; lending - arguably the weakest link in the financial chain . 
And we have just seen another major financial firm collapse as a result . 
A repo , or repurchase agreement , is a sale of a security ( often a US Treasury obligation ) that the seller promises to buy back later - often the day following the original sale - at a slightly higher price . 
The repo buyer thus lends to the seller , with the difference between the immediate &quot; spot &quot; price of the obligation and the &quot; forward &quot; repurchase price representing the interest on the loan . 
These repo loans give firms - typically financial firms - access to vast pools of cheap financing ( often emanating from US money-market funds ) . 
It is a market measured in the trillions of dollars . 
MF Global , the global financial firm that filed for bankruptcy in October , is just the most recent noteworthy example of how repo lending can go wrong . 
Like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers before they failed , MF Global had huge short-term , repo-based debt . 
Bear failed in 2008 as its mounting real-estate losses prevented it from quickly rolling over its repo debt , which made up fully one-quarter of its balance sheet . 
Then , a year later , Lehman failed with one-third of its balance sheet in repo . 
Repo debt seems to have made up an astounding one-half of MF Global &apos;s balance sheet . 
The rules of the financial game privilege repo financing over other kinds , and Dodd-Frank did nothing to fix this . 
First , normal bankruptcy rules don &apos;t apply to repos . 
Second , much repo financing flows into large risk-taking financial firms like MF Global , Lehman , and Bear Stearns through money-market funds , which must invest very short-term , because their depositors want immediate liquidity . 
In the US , the usual bankruptcy rules allow regulators and courts to hold a bankrupt company &apos;s operations together long enough to determine if the firm is worth more dead than alive . 
The law stops creditors from grabbing assets after the company enters bankruptcy , and it recalls many payments made to favored creditors in the 90 days before bankruptcy was declared , so that all creditors facilitate the firm &apos;s survival . 
Repo creditors &quot; exemption from these rules privileges them over the failed firm &apos;s other creditors . 
The original rationale was that allowing repo creditors to cash out fast would reduce runs , contagion , and credit freezes . 
But the opposite seems to be the case : if the regular rules applied , repo players would be more careful . 
They would be wary of firms like MF Global with massive short-term liabilities and only a thin equity buffer to absorb losses . 
They would charge more , curtail some short-term lending , or both , and they would insist that firms like MF Global maintain a larger equity cushion . 
If they charged more , other capital sources - long-term debt and equity - would become more attractive . 
The result is that the economy gets too much overnight repo , and the rest of us pay a price for it , because favoring such short-term debt means that more financial firms like Bear , Lehman , and MF Global fail . 
True , failed firms &quot; creditors , owners , and managers bear the brunt of the losses initially . 
But when systemically vital firms overdose on repo , we all pay , first as taxpayers when the government bails them out , and then as we suffer from the resulting economic disruption and downturn . 
The second financial rule that privileges repos is that money-market funds must keep their portfolios extremely liquid , because their customers draw checks on their deposits . 
The cash therefore goes into short-term investments - often via repos to financial firms with risky investments . 
We cannot do without this short-term financing channel , but it need not be as big as it is . 
When shocks hit a fragile financial system , as in 2007 and 2008 , the government has reason to guarantee the money market funds , as US authorities did . 
These implicit government guarantees attract more money into these financial channels from nonguaranteed channels , and more &quot; hot money &quot; flows into firms like MF Global , Lehman , and Bear via repo . 
There is no easy way out of this problem , but we must try to find one . 
One improvement would be to reform the bankruptcy rules that favor repos . 
Another would be to increase financial institutions &quot; capital requirements . 
But these steps must be taken in tandem , because firms and creditors will try to circumvent capital requirements if they see attractive alternative sources of funds - like rule-exempt repo financing . 
There is another solution as well : repo users could be made to pay for their privileges and the costs that they impose on the rest of the economy . 
They could be charged a few basis points per annum in government fees in order to align repos &quot; private price with their social cost . 
Doing so could bring more market discipline to this part of the financial market without extensive regulation . 
The collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers exacerbated the US and global recession . 
MF Global &apos;s failure stands as a warning that only three years later , and even after the major Dodd-Frank financial reforms , the US still has not fixed key problems that brought them down .
