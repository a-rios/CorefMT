Turkey &apos;s New Course 
CHICAGO - Turkey has recently been at the forefront of international economic and political debates . 
On the one hand , despite the economic crisis engulfing neighboring Europe , Turkey remains the world &apos;s second-fastest growing economy , after China . 
On the other hand , there is almost no issue on the global agenda - from Iraq and Afghanistan to Somalia , Iran , and the Arab Spring , and from sustainable development to a dialogue among civilizations - on which Turkey is not playing a visible role . 
This is a rather new phenomenon . 
Until a decade ago , Turkey was regarded as no more than a staunch NATO ally . 
That began to change in 2002 , when an era of political stability dawned , giving rise to a vision for a stronger Turkey - and a firm commitment to realizing that vision . 
To this end , Turkey &apos;s governments since 2002 implemented bold economic reforms that paved the way for sustainable growth and provided a firewall against the financial crisis that hit in 2008 . 
As a result , in less than a decade , GDP has tripled , making Turkey the world &apos;s 16th largest economy . 
Moreover , the country benefits from strong public finances , prudent monetary policy , sustainable debt dynamics , a sound banking system , and well-functioning credit markets . 
At the same time , we expanded the scope of individual rights , which had long been subordinated to security concerns . 
We streamlined civil-military relations , guaranteed social and cultural rights , and attended to the problems of ethnic and religious minorities . 
These reforms transformed Turkey into a vibrant democracy and a more stable society , at peace with itself and able to view its external environment in a different light . 
Quite simply , we stopped viewing our geography and history as a curse or disadvantage . 
On the contrary , we began to regard our location at the crossroads of Europe , Asia , and the Middle East as an opportunity to interact simultaneously with multiple players . 
As a result , we began to reach out to countries in our neighborhood and beyond . 
We tried to expand political dialogue , enhance economic interdependence , and strengthen cultural and social understanding . 
And , while ten years is too short for a definitive assessment of such an ambitious policy , we have undoubtedly covered considerable ground . 
For example , we have quadrupled our trade volume just with our neighbors . 
On several occasions , we have also been instrumental in facilitating peace and reconciliation . 
But , what is more important , Turkey has become a model of success that many countries around us now seek to emulate . 
And yet , until a year or two ago , some political pundits were asking , &quot; Who lost Turkey ? &quot; or &quot; Whither Turkey ? &quot; - the assumption being that Turkey had shifted its foreign-policy axis away from the West . 
In fact , Turkey &apos;s external orientation has remained constant , because it rests on the values that we share with the free world . 
What has changed is our increased assertiveness in our efforts to ensure greater stability and human welfare in our region , evident in our advocacy of freedom , democracy , and accountability not only for ourselves , but also for others . 
This approach has been reflected in the Arab Spring , which Turkey ardently supported from the outset . 
We have not hesitated in siding with those fighting for their rights and dignity . 
Indeed , in countries like Tunisia , Egypt , Libya , and Yemen , which are now attempting to institutionalize change , Turkey is their most active partner , sharing our own experience and providing tangible assistance in the form of economic cooperation and political capacity building . 
In Syria , on the other hand , the revolution has not yet come to fruition , owing to the regime &apos;s brutal repression of its opponents . 
Every day , scores of people there die in pursuit of dignity . 
Turkey is doing all that it can to alleviate the Syrian people &apos;s suffering . 
Turkey &apos;s position on Iran &apos;s nuclear program has been similarly clear : we are categorically opposed to the presence of weapons of mass destruction in our region . 
Attempts to develop or acquire WMDs might well trigger a regional arms race , leading to further instability and threatening international peace and security . 
That is why we have always called for the establishment of a WMD-free zone in the Middle East , including both Iran and Israel . 
We support Iran &apos;s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . 
But Iran &apos;s program must be transparent , and its leaders must assure the international community of its non-military nature . 
The key is to close the confidence gap and pave the way for meaningful dialogue . 
In April , we hosted the inaugural round of revived talks between the international community and Iran . 
Let us be clear : there is no military solution to this problem . 
Military intervention would merely further complicate the issue , while creating new layers of conflict in our region and beyond . 
In this and other matters , Turkey strives to act as a &quot; virtuous power , &quot; which requires us to align our national interests with values such as justice , democracy , and human dignity , and to achieve our foreign-policy goals through mutual cooperation rather than coercion . 
Effective multilateralism is a key facet of this vision . 
Turkey served as a member of the United Nations Security Council in 2009-2010 , and is now seeking another term in 2015-2016 . 
Given the crucial importance of developments in our part of the world , Turkey &apos;s contribution to the Council &apos;s work promises to be highly valuable . 
In 2015 , moreover , we will assume the presidency of the G-20 , and we are committed to using our means and capabilities to make it a more effective organ of global governance . 
Turkey &apos;s internal transformation over the past decade has placed it in an ideal position to benefit the region - and thus the global community . 
While we have accomplished much already , more is required of us . 
Given the challenges of our neighborhood , and the region &apos;s central role in global affairs , Turkey will not refrain from taking on new responsibilities .
