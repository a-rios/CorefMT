Building the India-US Partnership 
WASHINGTON , DC - President Barack Obama &apos;s first presidential visit to India offers a unique opportunity to cement a global partnership with a rapidly emerging power . 
Set to become the world &apos;s third or fourth largest economy by 2030 , India could become America &apos;s most important strategic partner . 
In coming decades , a strong bilateral partnership will prove vital in managing the rise of China and promoting an Asian balance of power that is favorable to India , the United States , and Asia as a whole . 
India &apos;s success as a democracy also strengthens freedom globally and protects broader American interests . 
Yet , as many observers have noted , US-India relations have recently become listless and marked by drift . 
Both countries are to blame . 
Obama has understandably focused on competing priorities , including the troubled US economy and ongoing wars abroad . 
India &apos;s government has been similarly occupied with domestic political struggles and the challenge of sustaining economic growth amid rising pressure for redistribution . 
Moreover , Indian officials must still nurture the small , albeit growing , constituency that supports a rapidly transformed relationship with the US . 
This trip provides a great opportunity for both sides to reinvigorate a critical relationship . 
For its part , the Obama administration should take a number of steps to reaffirm its support for India &apos;s rise , its democratic achievements , and its struggle for security . 
Notably , the US should reaffirm its support for a larger Indian role in international organizations and help integrate India into the global non-proliferation regime . 
In this context , the Obama administration should endorse India &apos;s quest for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council . 
India , too , must do its part . 
It can expand defense cooperation beyond purchases of American-made military equipment by deepening its diplomatic engagement with the US to help find solutions to the difficult problems stemming from Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Iran . 
In short , India &apos;s government should look for ways to sustain America &apos;s interest in India during difficult times . 
Both countries should consolidate their cooperation in other areas already agreed upon : agriculture , education , health care , energy , and science and technology . 
Obama &apos;s trip offers an opportunity for taking stock , expanding initiatives that have matured , and announcing new projects that will provide global benefits . 
The latter include developing an international food security initiative , cooperating to increase vocational training in fragile states , expanding clean-energy research , investing in global disease-detection systems , and collaborating to explore shale-gas extraction . 
In addition , the US and India should create innovation partnerships , which would not only yield direct returns to both countries , but would also demonstrate how a strong bilateral relationship can improve the international system . 
The US and India should expand cooperation on other multilateral issues as well . 
The global economic crisis and new fears of US protectionism have motivated India to rethink its attitude toward the Doha Development Round . 
If Obama can weather domestic resistance to new international trade negotiations and modify America &apos;s current position on sectoral tariff reduction by developing countries , the US and India will have an opportunity to break the impasse that has stymied the Doha Round &apos;s successful conclusion . 
Ultimately , a strong US-Indian partnership is in both countries &quot; strategic interest . 
Their societies are already intertwined - and will be even more so in the future - by various personal , economic , and social links . 
Moreover , Obama should resist the urge to approach the bilateral relationship purely in transactional terms , but instead should seek to strengthen India &apos;s long-term capacity to be a productive partner with the US . 
In short , Obama ought not to ask , &quot; What will India do for us ? , &quot; but rather , &quot; Is a strong , democratic and independent India in America &apos;s national interest ? &quot; 
If the answer to this question is yes - as it should be - then the US should focus on how it can help India &apos;s power continue to grow . 
By reaffirming the US commitment to aid India &apos;s rise , and by emphasizing America &apos;s fellowship with India , Obama can help bring the two countries together on the basis of shared interests , and move their relationship forward significantly . 
That effort must start now .
