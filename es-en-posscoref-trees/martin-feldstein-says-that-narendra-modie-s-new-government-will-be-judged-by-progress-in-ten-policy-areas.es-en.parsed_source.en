New Hope for India 
CAMBRIDGE - India &apos;s recent general election could be the most important positive economic event of 2014 . 
Indian voters decisively rejected the Congress party , which had governed India virtually without interruption since it gained independence from Britain in 1947 . 
They are likely to be happy they did . 
Sonia Gandhi , the head of Congress and the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi , has been the power behind the throne since 1998 , turning Prime Minister Manmohan Singh into little more than a figurehead . 
Under her leadership , Congress has pursued a populist agenda that increased transfer payments and reduced India &apos;s annual economic-growth rate to less than 4 % in 2013 . 
GDP per capita is still only about $ 4,000 , less than half the level in China . 
The newly elected prime minister , Narendra Modi , campaigned on a platform that promises to deliver to India as a whole the rapid growth in employment and income that the state of Gujarat achieved when he was its chief minister . 
Under Modi &apos;s leadership , Gujarat became a business-friendly state that expanded economic activity , and attracted business investment from both Indian and overseas companies . 
A remarkable feature of the recent election is that Modi &apos;s Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) received an absolute majority in the national parliament , an almost unprecedented achievement in India . 
As a result , Modi will not have to compromise with the other national or regional parties to pursue his legislative agenda . 
Two key officials will help Modi manage his economic program . 
The new finance minister , Arun Jaitley , is an experienced political leader who served in ministerial positions in previous BJP governments . 
Jaitley is also known as a strategic thinker who is sympathetic to business interests . 
The head of the Reserve Bank of India ( the central bank ) will continue to be Raghuram Rajan , a distinguished economist who has already shown his desire to reduce India &apos;s near-double-digit annual inflation rate , and to reform some of the inherited counterproductive restrictions on the country &apos;s financial sector . 
The measures needed to stimulate economic growth will take time to implement and to produce results . 
But anyone who wants to see whether the new government is acting to achieve faster long-term growth should examine whether progress is being made in the following ten policy areas . 
Education . 
Although India has excellent institutions of higher education and technology , only a small share of the population can take advantage of the opportunities they offer , because primary and secondary education is so inadequate . 
Only 60 % of the adult population can read and write at an elementary level . 
Teachers themselves are poorly educated , and many are so unmotivated that they do not even show up at the schools where they are supposed to work . 
Infrastructure . 
India needs better roads and ports to enable efficient transport of products domestically and to the rest of the world . 
The recent expansion of private airlines and airports shows what private firms in this sector can accomplish . 
Fiscal consolidation . 
Large budget deficits are absorbing the national savings that should be used to expand business investment , and are increasing the national debt that will have to be financed by future taxes . 
Privatization . 
The enterprises owned by the Indian government in manufacturing and other sectors operate inefficiently and often produce losses that absorb national saving . 
Selling off these enterprises would contribute directly to accelerating the pace of economic growth . 
Removal of subsidies . 
Subsidized electricity and fuel leads to wasteful overconsumption and contributes to the fiscal deficit . 
Though these subsidies are politically difficult to eliminate , they should be replaced by cash transfers , which can now be done efficiently in India , owing to a remarkable new system of fingerprint-based cash transfers . 
Agricultural reform . 
In the current system , the government buys , warehouses , and distributes agricultural products . 
As a result , an enormous amount of goods are spoiled in storage , while production incentives are misdirected . 
Agricultural markets should be privatized . 
Property rights and zoning . 
Anyone who visits Mumbai or other major Indian cities sees how zoning restrictions cause misuse of urban land and limit modernization . 
Ambiguous property rights , especially to agricultural land , prevent industrialization in rural areas . 
Relaxing limits on foreign investment . 
Foreign firms are now barred from majority ownership of banks and insurance companies . 
Relaxing such restrictions would strengthen the financial sector and play an important role in economic growth . 
Tax reform . 
India &apos;s complex system of national and state sales taxes distorts domestic trade . 
Replacing these taxes with a national value-added tax and using revenue-sharing to the states has been long debated and should now be enacted . 
Corruption . 
Major cases of high-level corruption have undermined economic confidence and impeded official decision-making . 
The government should crack down on instances of high-level graft and use the new system of cash transfers to limit the scope of petty corruption . 
The Indian stock market is up about 20 % this year in anticipation of stronger growth and rising profits . 
Now it is up to Modi and the BJP to show that they can deliver on their campaign promises .
