Dethroning King Coal 
MELBOURNE - Earlier this year , the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached 400 parts per million ( ppm ) . 
The last time there was that much CO2 in our atmosphere was three million years ago , when sea levels were 24 meters higher than they are today . 
Now sea levels are rising again . 
Last September , Arctic sea ice covered the smallest area ever recorded . 
All but one of the ten warmest years since 1880 , when global records began to be kept , have occurred in the twenty-first century . 
Some climate scientists believe that 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is already enough to take us past the tipping point at which we risk a climate catastrophe that will turn billions of people into refugees . 
They say that we need to get the amount of atmospheric CO2 back down to 350 ppm . 
That figure lies behind the name taken by 350.org , a grassroots movement with volunteers in 188 countries trying to solve the problem of climate change . 
Other climate scientists are more optimistic : they argue that if we allow atmospheric CO2 to rise to 450 ppm , a level associated with a two-degree Celsius temperature rise , we have a 66.6 % chance of avoiding catastrophe . 
That still leaves a one-in-three chance of catastrophe - worse odds than playing Russian roulette . 
And we are forecast to surpass 450 ppm by 2038 . 
One thing is clear : if we are not to be totally reckless with our planet &apos;s climate , we cannot burn all the coal , oil , and natural gas that we have already located . 
About 80 % of it - especially the coal , which emits the most CO2 when burned - will have to stay in the ground . 
In June , US President Barack Obama told students at Georgetown University that he refused to condemn them and their children and grandchildren to &quot; a planet that &apos;s beyond fixing . &quot; 
Saying that climate change cannot wait for Congress to overcome its &quot; partisan gridlock , &quot; he announced measures using his executive power to limit CO2 emissions , first from new fossil-fuel power plants , and then from existing ones . 
Obama also called for an end to public financing of new coal plants overseas , unless they deploy carbon-capture technologies ( which are not yet economically viable ) , or else there is , he said , &quot; no other viable way for the poorest countries to generate electricity . &quot; 
According to Daniel Schrag , Director of Harvard University &apos;s Center for the Environment and a member of a presidential science panel that has helped to advise Obama on climate change , &quot; Politically , the White House is hesitant to say they &apos;re having a war on coal . 
On the other hand , a war on coal is exactly what &apos;s needed . &quot; 
Schrag is right . 
His university , like mine and many others , has a plan to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions . 
Yet most of them , including Schrag &apos;s and mine , continue to invest part of their multi-billion-dollar endowments in companies that extract and sell coal . 
But pressure on educational institutions to stop investing in fossil fuels is beginning to build . 
Student groups have formed on many campuses , and a handful of colleges and universities have already pledged to end their investment in fossil fuels . 
Several US cities , including San Francisco and Seattle , have agreed to do the same . 
Now financial institutions , too , are coming under fire for their involvement with fossil fuels . 
In June , I was part of a group of prominent Australians who signed an open letter to the heads of the country &apos;s biggest banks asking them to stop lending to new fossil-fuel extraction projects , and to sell their stakes in companies engaged in such activities . 
Speaking at Harvard earlier this year , former US Vice President Al Gore praised a student group that was pushing the university to sell its investments in fossil-fuel companies , and compared their activities to the divestment campaign in the 1980 &quot; s that helped to end South Africa &apos;s racist apartheid policy . 
How fair is that comparison ? 
The dividing lines may be less sharp than they were with apartheid , but our continued high level of greenhouse-gas emissions protects the interests of one group of humans - mainly affluent people who are alive today - at the cost of others . 
( Compared to most of the world &apos;s population , even the American and Australian coal miners who would lose their jobs if the industry shut down are affluent . ) 
Our behavior disregards most of the world &apos;s poor , and everyone who will live on this planet in centuries to come . 
Worldwide , the poor leave a very small carbon footprint , but they will suffer the most from climate change . 
Many live in hot places that are getting even hotter , and hundreds of millions of them are subsistence farmers who depend on rainfall to grow their crops . 
Rainfall patterns will vary , and the Asian monsoon will become less reliable . 
Those who live on this planet in future centuries will live in a hotter world , with higher sea levels , less arable land , and more extreme hurricanes , droughts , and floods . 
In these circumstances , to develop new coal projects is unethical , and to invest in them is to be complicit in this unethical activity . 
While this applies , to some extent , to all fossil fuels , the best way to begin to change our behavior is by reducing coal consumption . 
Replacing coal with natural gas does reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , even if natural gas itself is not sustainable in the long term . 
Right now , ending investment in the coal industry is the right thing to do .
