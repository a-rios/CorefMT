Stimulate or Die 
NEW YORK - As the green shoots of economic recovery that many people spied this spring have turned brown , questions are being raised as to whether the policy of jump-starting the economy through a massive fiscal stimulus has failed . 
Has Keynesian economics been proven wrong now that it has been put to the test ? 
That question , however , would make sense only if Keynesian economics had really been tried . 
Indeed , what is needed now is another dose of fiscal stimulus . 
If that does not happen , we can look forward to an even longer period in which the economy operates below capacity , with high unemployment . 
The Obama administration seems surprised and disappointed with high and rising joblessness . 
It should not be . 
All of this was predictable . 
The true measure of the success of the stimulus is not the actual level of unemployment , but what unemployment would have been without the stimulus . 
The Obama administration was always clear that it would create some three million jobs more than what would otherwise be the case . 
The problem is that the shock to the economy from the financial crisis was so bad that even Obama &apos;s seemingly huge fiscal stimulus has not been enough . 
But there is another problem : In the United States , only about a quarter of the almost $ 800 billion stimulus was designed to be spent this year , and getting it spent even on &quot; shovel ready &quot; projects has been slow going . 
Meanwhile , US states have been faced with massive revenue shortfalls , exceeding $ 200 billion . 
Most face constitutional requirements to run balanced budgets , which means that such states are now either raising taxes or cutting expenditures -a negative stimulus that offsets at least some of the Federal government &apos;s positive stimulus . 
At the same time , almost one-third of the stimulus was devoted to tax cuts , which Keynesian economics correctly predicted would be relatively ineffective . 
Households , burdened with debt while their retirement savings wither and job prospects remain dim , have spent only a fraction of the tax cuts . 
In the US and elsewhere , much attention was focused on fixing the banking system . 
Banks will not lend if the economy is in the doldrums , and American households will be particularly reluctant to borrow - at least in the profligate ways they borrowed prior to the crisis . 
The almighty American consumer was the engine of global growth , but it will most likely continue to sputter even after the banks are repaired . 
In the interim , some form of government stimulus will be required . 
Some worry about America &apos;s increasing national debt . 
It is a mistake to look only at a country &apos;s liabilities , and ignore its assets . 
Of course , that is an argument against badly designed bank bailouts , like the one in America , which has cost US taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars , much of it never to be recovered . 
The national debt has increased , with no offsetting asset placed on the government &apos;s balance sheet . 
A few ( not many ) worry that this bout of government spending will result in inflation . 
But the more immediate problem remains deflation , given high unemployment and excess capacity . 
If the economy recovers more robustly than I anticipate , spending can be canceled . 
Better yet , if much of the next round of stimulus is devoted to automatic stabilizers - such as compensating for the shortfall in state revenues - then if the economy does recover , the spending will not occur . 
There is little downside risk . 
Nevertheless , there is some concern that growing inflationary expectations might result in rising long-term interest rates , offsetting the benefits of the stimulus . 
Here , monetary authorities must be vigilant , and continue their &quot; non-standard &quot; interventions - managing both short-term and long-term interest rates . 
All policies entail risk . 
Not preparing for a second stimulus now risks a weaker economy - and the money not being there when it is needed . 
Stimulating an economy takes time , as the Obama administration &apos;s difficulties in spending what it has allocated show ; the full effect of these efforts may take a half-year or more to be felt . 
A weaker economy means more bankruptcies and home foreclosures and higher unemployment . 
Even putting aside the human suffering , this means , in turn , more problems for the financial system . 
If we try to save money now , we risk spending much more later . 
The Obama administration erred in asking for too small a stimulus , especially after making political compromises that caused it to be less effective than it could have been . 
It made another mistake in designing a bank bailout that gave too much money with too few restrictions on too favorable terms to those who caused the economic mess in the first place - a policy that has dampened taxpayers &quot; appetite for more spending . 
But that is politics . 
The economics is clear : the world needs all the advanced industrial countries to commit to another big round of real stimulus spending . 
This should be one of the central themes of the next G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh .
