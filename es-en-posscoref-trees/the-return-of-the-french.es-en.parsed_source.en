The Return of the French ? 
PARIS - How difficult is it to erase one &apos;s past as a colonial power ? 
Tunisia has been independent for 55 years , and Côte d &apos;Ivoire for 51 years , yet France is once more playing a decisive role in these countries . 
Naturally , many Africans are unconvinced that France is acting only to defend the lives of a few thousand of its citizens , rather than its economic and strategic interests , which are negligible for the former and null for the latter . 
The damage that slavery and colonialism inflicted in these countries has left a powerful legacy . 
And , though they have been handling their own business for decades , France still has a duty of friendship that forbids it to forget and requires it to adopt a certain mode of conduct . 
Côte d &apos;Ivoire enjoys large agricultural wealth ( along with gold , diamonds , and iron ) ; 
Tunisia possesses large phosphate deposits ; 
Libya has oil ; and all three have a relatively moderate climate . 
But none experienced economic takeoff at independence . 
Why ? 
The French historian and sociologist Emmanuel Todd has argued that , everywhere in the world , economic takeoff usually occurs 60-70 years after 50 % of the population achieves literacy . 
Moreover , the higher the average age of marriage for women , the faster literacy spreads . 
The more time a woman has had to live alone and acquire knowledge , the stronger her desire and capacity to pass it on to her children . 
Northern Germany and southern Scandinavia were the first regions to experience mass literacy , which was followed by faster economic development a few decades later . 
These are places where women &apos;s average age at marriage has been around 23 for some time . 
In the Arab world and most of Africa , women marry , on average , at around 15 . 
Tunisia , Egypt , and Libya are three clear cases of massive popular anger against economic underdevelopment and the dictatorships that were justifiably blamed for it . 
The major difference between the three is that in Tunisia and Egypt , economic development had gone far enough to give rise to a small trading and salaried middle class , which initiated the rebellions and whose members were sufficient in number to succeed - at least in deposing the dictators . 
Libya is entirely different . 
The anger there , fueled by misery and insufficient food , is popular , not bourgeois . 
The forces of resistance are too limited , while the military - a key tool of social advancement for the poor - remains in the hands of the dictatorship . 
The rebellion could not succeed by itself ; from the start , terrible and bloody repression was to be expected . 
Côte d &apos;Ivoire looks nothing like North Africa : its troubles are purely local , ethnic , and religious . 
The Republic &apos;s first president , Félix Houphouet-Boigny , was elected at independence in 1960 and remained in office until he died in 1993 - always careful to construct governments with representatives from all the tribes , and with a balance between southern Catholics and northern Muslims . 
Houphouet-Boigny &apos;s successor , Henri Konan Bédié , had neither his talent nor his courage . 
Bédié founded his power on the country &apos;s Catholics and his government on tribal membership . 
And he invented a legitimizing concept of Ivorian identity ( Ivoirité ) , which was largely meant to disqualify northern Muslims as foreigners , because their tribes extended into Mali and Burkina Faso . 
This policy ignited a latent conflict , with a military coup in 1999 putting General Robert Gueï in power . 
But Gueï lasted only three years , with his assassination in 2002 setting the country &apos;s conflicting sides on a path to civil war . 
In this tense climate , the northern candidate , Alassane Ouattara , a Muslim and former senior official at the International Monetary Fund , was denied the right to run in the 2005 presidential election . 
The winner , the southerner Laurent Gbagbo , then refused to concede his defeat by Ouattara in 2010 , leading to violent conflict and fear of a long and potentially genocidal civil war . 
In both Libya and Côte d &apos;Ivoire , massacres of civilians were foreseeable . 
In both cases , the question in Paris and other capitals was whether to intervene . 
And in both cases , France had an obvious interest in not intervening , in order to erase its colonial past ( more so in Côte d &apos;Ivoire than in Libya , where Italy had been the European colonizer ) . 
But tens of thousands of French citizens live in Côte d &apos;Ivoire . 
France had to protect them . 
In Libya , Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi &apos;s wanton violence brought the situation firmly under the purview of the United Nations Security Council and the UN &apos;s recently proclaimed &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; civilians threatened by their own governments . 
Libyan civilians are now under the protection of international law . 
Only an international decision could have accomplished this . 
Indeed , Lebanon &apos;s vote for military intervention in Libya not only enhances its legitimacy , but also raises the suspicion that even Iran condemns Qaddafi &apos;s brutality . 
Once the decision to intervene was taken , France , with the largest armed forces in the Mediterranean , alas became the most visible of the intervening countries - with few others capable of joining it , the United Kingdom , and the United States . 
Unfortunately , international solidarity for the armed protection of endangered populations does not yet really exist . 
The danger is that in much of Africa , former imperialists are suspected of being imperialists still , which could make the development of international law appear to be a mere power play . 
This is even clearer in Côte d &apos;Ivoire : it is the UN that explicitly demanded that France , the only foreign presence , implement the resolution that ratified Ouattara as the elected president and Gbagbo as the usurper . 
France did the job rather well , leaving , for example , the arrest of Gbagbo to Quattara &apos;s forces . 
Civil war was averted . 
It is , in fact , pure stupidity to believe that France is trying to restore its defunct empire . 
Defunct imperialisms no longer make sense . 
Today &apos;s real problems are vastly different from when colonial empires held sway , and they need to be dealt with in a non-imperialist fashion . 
So what is really needed nowadays is for the world public to become convinced of the need for an effective international watchdog for peace and human rights .
