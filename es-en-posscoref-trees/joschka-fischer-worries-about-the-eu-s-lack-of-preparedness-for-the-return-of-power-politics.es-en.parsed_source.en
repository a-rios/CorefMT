Europe &apos;s Blast from the Past 
BERLIN - If there is one historical episode that still makes most Europeans shiver , even after a century , it is the outbreak of World War I , the seminal European catastrophe , which began in the last days of July 1914 . 
In fact , exactly one hundred years later , after two World Wars and a Cold War , those shivers are more pronounced than ever . 
In view of Europe &apos;s bloody history , the states that established today &apos;s European Union opted for non-violence , the inviolability of borders , democracy , and the rule of law . 
They chose cooperation , even integration , instead of military confrontation , and economic development rather than power politics . 
In the East , President Vladimir Putin &apos;s Kremlin wants to change national borders by force and thus secure Russia &apos;s reemergence as an imperial world power . 
Meanwhile , chaos and violence - most pronounced in Syria , Iraq , and Gaza - threaten to engulf the entire Middle East , challenging the territorial integrity of states that are largely a result of the World War I peace settlement . 
Peaceful , postmodern Europe will find it difficult to cope with the challenges that the revival of power politics implies . 
The EU has more than doubled in size since 1989 , when communism in Central and Eastern Europe collapsed ; but EU Europe has not reached its final , politically integrated form . 
More important , it was not designed to meet the challenges of power politics ; 
Yet many Europeans believe that the EU and the West must not simply give free rein to Putin &apos;s rogue behavior . 
There is too much at stake in eastern Ukraine - the peace and order of the entire continent . 
The mostly European passengers of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , downed over rebel-controlled territory , paid for this insight with their lives . 
The timing of historically significant events usually is not a matter of choice . 
So the fundamental question in the aftermath of such events always concerns how quickly their consequences are correctly identified . 
It took an exceedingly long time for Europe &apos;s leaders to realize that all of the trust they had placed in Putin , and the tolerance they showed for his politics of violence and intimidation , has led only to further escalation and expansion of the crisis in Ukraine . 
Indeed , only after almost 300 civilians died aboard MH-17 was the EU prepared to impose the sort of economic sanctions that will have a meaningful impact on the Russian economy . 
In terms of the further development of a common European foreign and security policy , the significance of these common EU sanctions , adopted last week , should not be underestimated . 
After the EU finally masters the first step ( effective sanctions ) , the second step - an &quot; energy union &quot; that enables Europe to end its dependence on Russian energy supplies - must follow as soon as possible . 
With regard to the Middle East , the challenges to Europe &apos;s capacity for collective action will be even more difficult to overcome . 
The countries currently most affected by the region &apos;s turmoil - Iraq , Syria , Lebanon , Israel / Palestine , Egypt , and Libya - are likely to be joined soon by Jordan , Yemen , and the Gulf states . 
And the crisis is compounded by Iran &apos;s nuclear program and the competition - fueled by sectarian conflict - between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia for regional supremacy . 
A solution ( or solutions ) to the Middle East &apos;s travails is nowhere in sight . 
Today , only one outcome can be predicted with a high degree of confidence : further escalation of conflict , which will threaten to throw the entire region into chaos , leading to further violence and greater risk of contagion . 
There is , for example , a real danger that parts of the Middle East conflict will be exported to neighboring Europe . 
Whether the EU likes it or not , it will have to face these conflicts , because decisions about its internal and external security are likely to be made in the Middle East as much as they are in Brussels and national capitals . 
Europeans are living in a neighborhood that has become increasingly uncertain - a development that calls for the sort of strategic responses that no single European state can provide by itself . 
Further deepening of EU integration and reinvigoration of the common foreign and security policy dialogue are thus the order of the day . 
Unfortunately , a century after modern power politics unleashed a war that killed more than ten million of their forebears , many EU Europeans remain reluctant to prepare for the gathering storm . 
One must hope that this changes sooner rather than later : preparing is always better than shivering .
