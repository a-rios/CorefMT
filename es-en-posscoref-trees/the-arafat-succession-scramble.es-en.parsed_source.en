The Arafat Succession Scramble 
To understand what the Palestinian cause will look like without Yasir Arafat , consider the various titles that he currently holds . 
Arafat is Chairman of the PLO executive Committee , President of the Palestinian National Authority , Commander-in-chief of the Palestinian forces , and head of the Fatah movement . 
The PLO embodies Palestinian national aspirations for independence and statehood . 
It is the highest political body for all Palestinians , both those living in Palestine and the refugees and other Palestinians in the diaspora . 
Arafat &apos;s successor will need to juggle between negotiations with Israel , which will require concession on refugees &quot; &quot; right of return &quot; to Palestine , and the aspirations of more than three million Palestinians who wish to come back to the homes from which they were expelled in the wars of 1948 and 1967 . 
Arafat &apos;s successor as President of the Palestinian National Authority will be bound by the Oslo Accords , which created an interim government , now headed by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei , that is responsible for the day-to-day lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza . 
Palestinians will have to decide whether to make the position of PNA president a powerful one or merely symbolic , as it now is . 
The latter option would make Qurei an empowered prime minister , which is what many Palestinians and others want . 
The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces supposedly puts the various Palestinian military , security , and intelligence units under one leader , who is expected to ensure the rule of law . 
But these forces are now in disarray , with most uniformed Palestinian security agencies needing to be reorganized after four years of intensive effort by Israel to crush them . 
The key factor in internal security is local paramilitary units . 
These units , most of which are not controlled by the PNA &apos;s central leadership , are more loyal to grassroots figures than to uniformed PNA officers . 
Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs &quot; Brigades . 
Barghouti advocated and was trying to implement internal Fatah elections when the Israelis arrested him . 
As a street leader who was elected as the head of the Bir Zeit University student council , he gained legitimacy by being chosen by his peers . 
When the Oslo process began , he refused to accept any official position within the Palestinian Authority , choosing instead to remain close to the local Fatah cadres . 
Whoever fills Arafat &apos;s shoes will need to make sure that these brigades are satisfied that their status , demands , and leaders are respected . 
Indeed , the power struggle that will ensue in the post-Arafat era will ultimately center on Al Fatah , the backbone of the PLO . 
A worldwide assembly chooses Fatah &apos;s 100-member revolutionary council , which in turn elects a 20-member central committee , where most of the power struggle will take place . 
Many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the revolutionary council , or even holding the sixth general assembly ( which would be the first since 1988 ) . 
Events in recent months show that the Al Asqa Martyrs &quot; Brigades have forced even Arafat to take their demands into consideration . 
While much of the power struggle will take place within the nationalist camp , one must not overlook the Islamist camp led by Hamas and Islamic Jihad . 
Although the Islamists are unlikely to interfere in the post-Arafat power struggle , they will not sit idly by if the new leadership moves in what they consider the wrong direction . 
Of course , the new leadership will have to reach some agreement with the Islamists regarding the rules of the game , both domestically and vis-Ã -vis Israel . 
Without such an agreement , and if the new leadership cracks down hard on the Islamists , a violent civil war could erupt . 
Most importantly , in order to consolidate his leadership , the next Palestinian leader must make some hard decisions and show some tangible results quickly . 
The experience of the first Palestinian prime minister , who resigned largely because of his inability to deliver any improvements to his people - particularly personal and collective security , the rule of law , and an end to chaos in Palestinian areas - remains fresh in the public &apos;s memory . 
At the same time , a freeze on settlement activities , release of Palestinian political prisoners - including Marwan Barghouti - and the removal of the hundreds of checkpoints between Palestinian cities would revive a feeling of hope , without which no Palestinian leader can negotiate what the world wants : a peace settlement . 
The problem is that no Palestinian leader , no matter who he is , can deliver these changes . 
They represent a direct challenge to the Israeli occupiers , neighboring Arab countries , and the international community , led by the United States .
