The Morning After Israel &apos;s Vote 
TEL AVIV - &quot; The voters , &quot; said Binyamin Netanyahu in his strange victory speech , during Israel &apos;s bizarre post-election night , &quot; have spoken . &quot; And so they have , in a multiplicity of self-contradictory voices . 
Welcome to the mad world of Israeli parliamentary democracy . 
The world &apos;s most multifarious political system has just crashed-landed into a dead-end . 
A local joke claims that Israelis have more parties than voters . 
If other democracies boast Right , Center and Left , we have Jewish and Arab parties , secular and religious , peacenik and hard-line , socialist and free-market . 
Each group is finely divided among itself in a dynamic crisscross of creeds and interests , ideals and appetites . 
What is a paradise for political scientists is a nightmare for anyone trying to rule the country in earnest . 
Therein may lie a blessing in disguise , but the curses are more obvious . 
The greatest curse is Israel &apos;s inability to raise a leadership strong enough to make peace . 
Even weak prime ministers can wage war , but it takes a Menachem Begin or a Yitzhak Rabin to go the opposite way . 
Such leaders are thin on the ground , and the electoral system is partially to blame . 
Israel has lost its few capable leaders - Sharon alongside Begin and Rabin - to assorted calamities . 
Other prime ministers , who win elections by a whisker , end up with cat-and-dog coalitions . 
For years , this democracy hobbled on stilts , with big and small parties shooting up , crashing down , vanishing and reincarnating time and again . 
Few governments lived to their natural term of four years . 
Right and Left swapped seniority around a barely-existent central pole . 
Even Ariel Sharon &apos;s break from Likud and the establishment of Kadima , a genuine embodiment of moderate Middle Israel , did not undo the stalemate . 
Take the brand new political map : Tzipi Livni &apos;s Kadima with 28 Knesset seats , Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s Likud with 27 , both leaders giving triumphal orations during one dizzy night. ampquot ; Tzippyampquot ; claims victory for leading the largest party , ampquot ; Bibiampquot ; for heading the largest bloc . 
He has a point , of course : all six right-of-center parties , often at each other &apos;s throats , are behind his candidacy . 
But she has a point , too : Kadima won more seats than Likud , disproved prophecies of doom , and emerged as the only major party with an optimistic and peace-seeking message . 
This election &apos;s maverick , Russian-born , secular and hawkish Avigdor Lieberman , got 15 seats for his hardline Yisrael Beitenu party . 
In the wake of the Gaza war Lieberman deftly rode a hawkish tide , demanding &quot; declarations of loyalty &quot; from Israel &apos;s Arab citizens . 
He is now likely to act as kingmaker , propping the underperforming Netanyahu with a solid right-of-center bloc . 
Ehud Barak &apos;s Labor follows with a 13-seat low . 
Unless it teams up with Kadima , Likud , or both , Labor will head for soul-searching in the desert . 
It will not die any time soon : in the Israeli aviary both doves and hawks are capable phoenixes . 
If the numbers seem too small for the major players , here &apos;s the catch : Knesset &apos;s 120 seats will fill up smaller parties , each comprising anything from two to 11 fervent politicos . 
Arab parties are among them , as well as fractions of the far right and left . 
Thus have Knessets been comprised from Israel &apos;s beginning : the messier the merrier . Never before , however , have the major parties stalemated so neatly . 
So will Livni or Netanyahu be called by the President and charged with building a new government ? 
Shimon Peres , seasoned political wizard that he is , could give his largely ceremonial role a fresh edge by helping all sides out of the muddle . 
Peres could , for example , make both Livni and Netanyahu prime ministers , using a two-year rotation formula . 
Thus , Israel might scrabble out of the present political mud through job-sharing at the top . 
Alternatively , Livni could concede victory to Netanyahu despite her small electoral advantage , serve in his government , and pull her weight in favor of moderation . 
Livni , at last widely accepted as a leader worth her salt , spoke loudly of peace with the Palestinians in the last day of her campaign . 
She embodies the meager good news of this election : Middle Israel is alive and large , though not as effective as it could be . 
Tel Aviv , who voted Livni and Left of her , should finally be able to stand up to Jerusalem , who voted Netanyahu and Right of him . 
This election may sound a wake-up call to the moderates , and Livni is their tested leader . 
Even more important is the constitutional wake-up call . 
All three major leaders now agree on the need to revise the ramshackle political system . 
Even Israelis , they say , should be able to work in a two-party system . 
Okay , three parties . 
To be realistic , call it five . 
Israel must learn to speak in fewer political tongues . 
It &apos;s the only way out of a dangerous impasse at a dangerous historical moment . 
Its democracy would not grow weaker by becoming tidier : rather , it would grow up . 
Fewer choices are sometimes the hallmark of maturity , and not only in politics . 
Is it doable ? 
Yes . 
Plans for constitutional reform are already on the table . 
The bigger parties must ignore the vested interests of their junior partners , go back to the drawing board , and raise the Knesset entry-level substantially . 
Voters will learn to compromise , replacing tailor-made niche-parties with a couple of solid off-the-shelf options . 
Prime ministers will be able to rule full-term with comfortable majorities . 
Difficult decisions will at last be made rather than quirkily postponed : on the peace with the Palestinian and with Syria , on the economy , on social justice , on education . 
Only then would Israel be able to speak to the world , especially to its Arab neighbors , in a clear and practical voice . 
I hope , but cannot promise , that it would be the well-tempered voice of Middle Israel .
