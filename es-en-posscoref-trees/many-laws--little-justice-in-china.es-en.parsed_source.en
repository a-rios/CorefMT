Many Laws , Little Justice in China 
The image on the computer screen is shocking : a man , lying on a hospital bed , his head bandaged , with long trickles of blood running from the top of his scalp . 
The man , now sitting next to me , explains with a bit of understatement , &quot; Of course I must continue to have faith in the Chinese legal system , although I must admit that this incident has somewhat dampened my optimism . &quot; 
The &quot; incident &quot; occurred last December , as he and another attorney traveled to prepare the re-trial of a blind , self-taught legal activist . 
As the two lawyers were traveling on a bus , a gang of men , some of them wielding metal pipes , boarded it and brutally assaulted them . 
The injuries proved minor , but the incident embodies the paradox of China &apos;s legal system : over the past two decades , China has enacted hundreds of laws and elevated &quot; ruling the country according to law &quot; to ideological and constitutional prominence . 
Legal awareness in society has soared to unprecedented levels . 
Last week , China finally enshrined private property by passing the long-awaited property rights law , in what the government called &quot; significant progress in promoting rule of law in the country . &quot; 
Yet access to justice remains tightly constrained , courts are still controlled by the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , and lawyers involved in litigation against local state agencies remain highly vulnerable to retaliation by state and non-state actors . 
Reprisals range from suspension of lawyers &quot; licenses by the judicial bureaus to physical intimidation or assault by criminal elements . 
After their attackers left , the two lawyers made repeated calls to the police to report the incident , but police did nothing beyond take the call . 
Formal complaints to the justice ministry and the national bar association weren &apos;t even acknowledged , let alone answered . Ever since Deng Xiaoping ushered in the &quot; reform and opening &quot; era in 1978 , the Chinese leadership has seen the legal system as an instrument to carry out state policies . 
But as China &apos;s society progressively emancipated itself from direct state control - with the notable exception of sectors viewed by the CPC as crucial to maintaining its monopoly on power - citizens increasingly appealed to the law for protection against arbitrary administrative interference and to limit the bureaucracy &apos;s discretionary powers . 
In turn , the government encouraged the idea that ordinary citizens had legal rights as a way to ensure social stability , check petty corruption , and channel social grievances through a party-controlled mechanism . 
The new property rights law undoubtedly offers stronger protection to Chinese citizens , in particular homeowners , by equalizing the legal status of private and state property . 
Greater predictability and clarity in the property system is likely to bring economic benefits , reassure international investors , and signal the leadership &apos;s determination to pursue further economic reforms . 
Perhaps more importantly , the law indirectly consolidates , at least in theory , the concept of a private sphere in Chinese society : a physical and legal area protected from arbitrary state intervention that could potentially serve as a basis for demanding greater political participation . 
What the new law will not do , however , is address the most serious property rights disputes : land seizures and forced evictions for urban redevelopment . 
Most of these protests stem from acts by local officials that were already clearly illegal under existing Chinese law . 
The real problem is to make officials respect legality . 
With little oversight from the central government , and no independent judiciary or a free press to hold them accountable , local authorities in rural areas are often a law unto themselves . 
According to China &apos;s Ministry of Land Resources , there were more than 90,000 cases of illegal land transfers last year , yet there were precious few prosecutions . 
Local courts , whose judges are appointed and paid by the local government , often simply refuse to file cases that challenge official decisions . 
In the few cases where a court rules in favor of the plaintiffs , the judgments often remain un-enforced . 
When lawyers and legal activists try to help villagers or evicted residents to fight through the legal system , they often become victims of retaliation . 
Because people cannot get justice through the courts , unrest has skyrocketed nationwide in recent years : official statistics record more than 200 protests a day , four times the number a decade ago . 
The central authorities have recognized the link between abuses , unrest , and the need to develop legal services for preventing the escalation of disputes . 
Wen Jiabao , China &apos;s Premier , acknowledged last year that protests in the countryside were caused by &quot; some localities &#91; that &#93; are unlawfully occupying farmers &quot; land &quot; and promised &quot; effective legal services and legal aid so as to provide effective help to people who have difficulty filing lawsuits . &quot; 
But reality doesn &apos;t match official rhetoric . 
In the past year , three prominent lawyers and rights activists were arrested . 
Administrative restrictions on lawyers were tightened to discourage class action or multiple plaintiff suits - typically cases against arbitrary or corrupt government actions - and to facilitate local authorities &quot; intervention and control over cases . 
And the media were prohibited from reporting cases involving land disputes and forced evictions . 
The new property law won &apos;t be the breakthrough for rights protection that the government claims it is until it is matched by increased access to justice for ordinary citizens . 
The government is fortunate to have my lawyer friend &apos;s faith in the legal system , but now it must earn ordinary citizens &quot; trust by enacting reforms . 
Removing constraints on lawyers and ensuring that they are not attacked with impunity would be a good place to start .
