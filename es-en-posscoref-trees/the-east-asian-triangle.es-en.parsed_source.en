The East Asian Triangle 
Once again , North Korea &apos;s pursuit of nuclear weapons is threatening Asia &apos;s stability . 
Japan &apos;s new prime minister , Shinzo Abe , hastily arranged a summit in China with President Hu Jintao on the eve of North Korea &apos;s nuclear test , a meeting that saw both men agree that such a move was &quot; intolerable . &quot; 
The meeting is a welcome development . 
But Abe comes into office with a reputation as a stronger nationalist than his predecessor , Junichiro Koizumi , whose insistence on visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine ( where Class A war criminals from World War II are buried ) helped sour relations with China . 
For stability to be preserved , Sino-Japanese relations must improve . 
Although North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions are worrying and destabilizing , China &apos;s rise is the key strategic issue in East Asia . 
For three decades , its economy has grown by 8 % to 10 % annually . 
Yet Chinese leaders speak of China &apos;s &quot; peaceful rise &quot; and &quot; peaceful development . &quot; 
Some believe that China cannot rise peacefully , and will seek hegemony in East Asia , leading to conflict with the United States and Japan . 
Others point out that China has engaged in &quot; good neighbor &quot; policies since the 1990 &quot; s , settled border disputes , played a greater role in international institutions , and recognized the benefits of using soft power . 
A decade ago , I oversaw preparation of the US Pentagon &apos;s East Asian Strategy Report , which has guided American policy under the Clinton and Bush administrations . 
Back then , there was a debate between those who wanted to contain China &apos;s growing strength increased and those who urged China &apos;s integration into the international system . 
Containment was unfeasible , because , unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War , China &apos;s neighbors did not see it as a clear and present danger . 
Moreover , treating China as an enemy would ensure that it became one , thus unnecessarily ignoring the possibility of benign outcomes . 
The strategy we chose was to &quot; balance and integrate . &quot; 
The East Asian balance of power rested on the triangle of China , Japan , and the US . 
So integration was hedged by realism in case things went wrong . 
That strategy has largely worked . 
China &apos;s military power has increased , but its behavior has been more moderate than it was a decade ago . 
China is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to American preponderance that the Kaiser &apos;s Germany posed when it surpassed Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century . 
The key to military power in today &apos;s information age depends on the ability to integrate complex systems of space-based surveillance , high speed computers , and &quot; smart &quot; weapons . 
It is not likely that China ( or others ) will soon close that gap with the US . 
Of course , the fact that China is unlikely to compete with the US on a global basis does not mean that it could not challenge the US in East Asia , or that war over Taiwan is not possible . 
If Taiwan were to declare independence , it is likely that China would use force , regardless of the perceived economic or military costs . 
But it would be unlikely to win such a war , and prudent policy on all sides can make such a war unlikely . 
So what is the strategic problem today ? 
Stability in East Asia depends upon good relations between all three sides of the US-China-Japan triangle , but ties between China and Japan deteriorated in the Koizumi years . 
China permitted demonstrations , sometimes violent , against Japanese consulates in protest of changes in Japanese textbooks that softened descriptions of Japan &apos;s invasion in the 1930 &quot; s . 
After 22 million Chinese signed a petition against Japanese membership of the United Nations Security Council , Premier Wen Jiabao announced China &apos;s opposition to such a step . 
China also objected to Japanese statements about Taiwan . 
The most contentious issue , however , has been prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine , and , until Abe &apos;s visit , China had been reluctant to engage in any summit meetings with Japan so long as such visits continue . 
Although China has become Japan &apos;s largest partner in trade and foreign direct investment , nationalists in the two countries have fueled each other &apos;s extremism , while their governments play with fire . 
American interests rest on regional stability and continued growth in trade and investment . 
It reminds Asians of the repulsive Japan of the 1930 &quot; s rather than the attractive Japan of today . 
At the same time , the US can be cautious about involving Japan in Taiwan issues - a neuralgic point for China - while encouraging the development of Asian institutions that increase contacts and dampen conflict . 
Fortunately , there are signs that both China and Japan are seeking to back away from the impasse of recent years . 
While Abe has maintained his position on Yasukuni , his summit with Chinese President Hu Jintao was a promising step forward . 
Some Chinese analysts , for their part , recognize the danger in stimulating too much nationalism toward Japan . 
The US should quietly try to nudge these steps forward . 
The US-Japan alliance remains crucial to stability in East Asia , but it takes three sides to make a triangle .
