Iran &apos;s Rattling Saber 
WASHINGTON , DC - As the West ratchets up its economic pressure on Iran to halt its drive to develop nuclear weapons , the Islamic Republic &apos;s rulers are not sitting idly by . 
Since Iran lacks the soft power and the economic capacity to counter Western pressure , it is likely that its leaders will resort to threats , and even to force , to prevent the West from cracking down further , as the recent attack on the British embassy in Tehran shows . 
Iranian authorities claimed that angry &quot; students &quot; spontaneously stormed the embassy . 
While inside , they seized documents and set others alight , and took six embassy employees hostage . 
It was only much later that the crowd came under police control and the hostages were set free . 
The scene was quite familiar . 
In 1979 , the United States embassy was also attacked by angry &quot; students , &quot; fueling enmity between the two countries that continues to this day . 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was not aware of the students &quot; plan in 1979 . 
Iran today is not the revolutionary Iran of 1979 . 
Thirty-two years after the Islamic Republic was established , Iran &apos;s tactics are obvious to everyone . 
The so-called students are members of the Basij militia , which was ordered to attack the embassy , with the police only pretending to stop them . 
In the government &apos;s thinking , it does not have to accept responsibility for the attack , the attackers &quot; identity will remain a mystery , and no one will even be accused of or tried for breaking the law . 
The Fars News Agency , which is affiliated with Iran &apos;s powerful Revolutionary Guard has called the British embassy a &quot; lair of espionage &quot; - the same term used to describe the US embassy in 1979 . 
This is not the first time that a European or British embassy has been attacked by the Basij . 
In response to Iran &apos;s nuclear program and Iranian banks &quot; money-laundering activities , Britain sanctioned the Central Bank of Iran . 
As a result , Iran felt compelled to respond - and not solely with the assault on the British embassy : a few days prior to the attack , a majority in the Iranian parliament voted to downgrade the country &apos;s diplomatic relations with Britain . 
Reacting to mounting fear of Western military action against Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , Revolutionary Guard commanders recently sharpened their rhetoric against the US and Israel . 
Amir Ali Hajizadeh , commander of the Guard &apos;s Aerospace Division , said that , in the event of war , &quot; NATO &apos;s missile-defense installations will be attacked by Iran . &quot; 
Moreover , he threatened that Iran &apos;s armed forces would not remain quiet if &quot; economic and cultural pressures &quot; continued . 
Likewise , Yahya Rahim Safavi , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei &apos;s military adviser and a former commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Guard , appealed to Iranian officials not to confine their threats to words , but rather to respond with military action . 
He not only argued that Iran &apos;s strategy should be offensive rather than defensive , but also threatened that Tel Aviv would be attacked by Hamas and Hezbollah if Israel went to war with the Islamic Republic . 
Some experts argue that if covert operations against Iran &apos;s nuclear and military programs - such as the assassination of nuclear scientists and explosions at the Revolutionary Guard &apos;s missile arsenals - are already taking place , war has already begun . 
Indeed , Khamenei and Revolutionary Guard commanders believe that covert war will inevitably become overt if Israel and the West truly believe that Iran is approaching a dangerous point in its nuclear program . 
Khamenei recently stated that &quot; we should threaten &#91; the West and Israel &#93; in response to their threats , &quot; which prompted Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Brigadier General Mohammad Baqeri to conclude that Khamenei &apos;s remark meant &quot; revising &#91; Iran &apos;s &#93; defense strategy . &quot; 
Obviously , Revolutionary Guard commanders will not divulge what the new strategy is . 
Instead , they hope that their own covert action might stop the West from applying more sanctions and greater pressure . 
Thus , the West &apos;s main concerns should stem not from Iran &apos;s official responses , but from &quot; independent elements , &quot; like those that attacked the British embassy . 
Recently , the US accused an Iranian-American of being instructed by a member of the Quds Force ( a Revolutionary Guard unit tasked with carrying out foreign operations ) to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in Washington . 
Back in 2007 , Iranian forces captured a group of British sailors in the Persian Gulf , releasing them a few weeks later under strong pressure from the United Kingdom . 
With tensions much higher today , however , such acts - even if carried out by unknown or unofficial groups - can trigger war . 
Indeed , Iran might become so fearful of an overt war that it starts one itself .
