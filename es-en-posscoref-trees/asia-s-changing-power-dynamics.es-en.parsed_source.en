Asia &apos;s Changing Power Dynamics 
NEW DELHI - At a time when Asia is in transition , with the specter of a power imbalance looming large , it has become imperative to invest in institutionalized cooperation to reinforce the region &apos;s strategic stability . 
After all , not only is Asia becoming the pivot of global geopolitical change , but Asian challenges are also playing into international strategic challenges . 
Asia &apos;s changing power dynamics are reflected in China &apos;s increasingly assertive foreign policy , the new Japanese government &apos;s demand for an &quot; equal &quot; relationship with the United States , and the sharpening Sino-Indian rivalry , which has led to renewed Himalayan border tensions . 
All of this is highlighting America &apos;s own challenges , which are being exacerbated by its eroding global economic preeminence and involvement in two overseas wars . 
Such challenges dictate greater US-China cooperation to ensure continued large capital inflows from China , as well as Chinese political support on difficult issues ranging from North Korea and Burma to Pakistan and Iran . 
But , just when America &apos;s Sino-centric Asia policy became noticeable , Japan put the US on notice that it cannot indefinitely remain a faithful servant of American policies . 
Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama &apos;s government is seeking to realign foreign policy and rework a 2006 deal for the basing of US military personnel on Okinawa . 
It also announced an end to its eight-year-old Indian Ocean refueling mission in support of the US-led war in Afghanistan . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s resurrection of its long-dormant claim to the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh , and its needling of India over Kashmir ( one-fifth of which is under Chinese control ) , is testing the new US-India global strategic partnership . 
The US has chartered a course of tacit neutrality on the Arunachal Pradesh issue - to the delight of China , which aims to leave an international question mark hanging over the legitimacy of India &apos;s control of the Himalayan territory , which is almost three times as large as Taiwan . 
Indeed , the Obama administration has signaled its intent to abandon elements in its ties with India that could rile China , including a joint military exercise in Arunachal and any further joint naval maneuvers involving Japan or other parties , like Australia . 
Yet , the recent Australia-India security agreement , signed during Prime Minister Kevin Rudd &apos;s visit to New Delhi , symbolizes the role of common political values in helping to forge an expanding strategic constellation of Asian-Pacific countries . 
The Indo-Australian agreement received little attention , but such is its significance that it mirrors key elements of Australia &apos;s security accord with Japan - and that between India and Japan . 
All three of these accords , plus the 2005 US-India defense framework agreement , recognize a common commitment to democracy , freedom , human rights , and the rule of law , and obligate their signatories to work together to build security in Asia . 
An Asian geopolitical divide centered on political values would , of course , carry significant implications . 
Central to Asia &apos;s future is the strategic triangle made up of China , India , and Japan . 
Not since Japan rose to world-power status during the Meiji emperor &apos;s reign in the second half of the nineteenth century has another non-Western power emerged with such potential to alter the world order as China today . 
Indeed , as the US intelligence community &apos;s 2009 assessment predicted , China stands to affect global geopolitics more profoundly than any other country . 
China &apos;s ascent , however , is dividing Asia , and its future trajectory will depend on how its neighbors and other players , like the US , manage its rapidly accumulating power . 
At present , China &apos;s rising power helps validate American forward military deployments in East Asia . 
The China factor also is coming handy in America &apos;s efforts to win new allies in Asia . 
But , as the US-China relationship deepens in the coming years , the strains in some of America &apos;s existing partnerships could become pronounced . 
For example , building a stronger cooperative relationship with China is now taking precedence in US policy over the sale of advanced weaponry to Asian allies , lest the transfer of offensive arms provoke Chinese retaliation in another area . 
While the European community was built among democracies , the political systems in Asia are so varied - and some so opaque - that building inter-state trust is not easy . 
In Europe , the bloody wars of the past century have made armed conflict unthinkable today . 
But in Asia , the wars since 1950 failed to resolve disputes . 
And , while Europe has built institutions to underpin peace , Asia has yet to begin such a process in earnest . 
Never before have China , Japan , and India all been strong at the same time . 
Today , they need to find ways to reconcile their interests in Asia so that they can coexist peacefully and prosper . 
But there can be no denying that these three leading Asian powers and the US have different playbooks : America wants a uni-polar world but a multi-polar Asia ; 
China seeks a multi-polar world but a uni-polar Asia ; and Japan and India desire a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world .
