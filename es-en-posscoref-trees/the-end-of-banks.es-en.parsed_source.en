The End of Banks ? 
BARCELONA Â­ - Are banks doomed as a result of the current financial crisis ? 
The securitization of mortgages originally was seen as a triumph , because it shifted risk to financial markets , while taking deposits and making and monitoring loans - the purview of traditional banks - was regarded as narrow and old-fashioned . 
By contrast , modern banks would seek finance mainly in the interbank market and securitize their loan portfolios . 
In theory , such banks should be immune to runs , because the interbank market is supposed to be extremely efficient , and risk would be shifted to investors willing to bear it . 
Deposits would be replaced by mutual funds , which , as we know , are also immune to runs , and the risk of structured investment vehicles ( SIV &apos;s ) would be assessed accurately by rating agencies . 
All this financial engineering would avoid the obsolete capital requirements that burden banks &quot; operation . 
The current crisis killed off this optimistic scenario . 
The interbank market has almost collapsed , because banks do not trust each other in the same way that we tend not to trust an eager seller of a second-hand car . 
This is a textbook market failure . 
The origin of the problem is uncertainty about banks &quot; exposure to sub-prime mortgages , the risks of which have been carelessly assessed by rating agencies due to conflicts of interest . 
Northern Rock in the United Kingdom has been a victim of this modern banking strategy , as has Bear Stearns in the United States . 
Others may follow soon . 
Moreover , institutions that thought they had transferred risk to the market realized that the demise of sponsored SIV &apos;s would damage their reputations irreversibly . 
This implied that they had to rescue these SIV &apos;s . 
Alas , they failed to set aside enough capital for this unforeseen contingency , and external investors such as the sovereign wealth funds of China , Singapore , and the Middle East have had to come to the rescue . 
Finally , mutual funds are at risk as well , because their supposedly safe investments may sour and the insurance that backs them now appears shaky . 
The sub-prime contamination of money market funds would prove disastrous , with consequences far beyond what we have seen up to now . 
The supposed transfer of risk would turn out to have been a mirage . 
Are banks , markets , or regulators to blame ? 
The answer may indicate what future awaits banks . 
Some regulators were irresponsible for not anticipating the rational profit-maximizing behavior of institutions with a limited liability charter and of executives effectively protected from failure . 
After all , what should banks do when , instead of keeping sub-prime mortgages on their books , monitoring their performance , and incurring capital requirements , they can securitize them advantageously ( because the rating agencies have a stake in the business ) , avoid capital requirements , and profit from investors &quot; inexperience with such products . 
Indeed , even if things turned ugly and banks &quot; equity suffered , executives knew that their own generous bonuses and pension packages most likely would not . 
Given this , regulators should have thought twice before permitting off-balance sheet operations without any further provision . 
The fundamental question today is who monitors opaque loans , whether of the sub-prime or any other variety . 
Traditionally , the answer was banks ; in the securitized world , it remains a question . 
So , is there an alternative to the old-fashioned monitoring of loans by banks ? 
Perhaps if those securitized packages had been properly rated , the originating institution would be obliged to retain a share to signal to the market that risk was being controlled . 
And , clearly , the idea that capital requirements were not needed for banks &quot; off-balance sheet activities ( because the banks were not bearing the risk ) , was simply wrong . 
Appropriate regulation - including regulation of rating agencies - would most likely make traditional banks popular again . 
A reconsideration of banks &quot; limited liability charter would go even further in restoring credibility . 
The principle is simple : when your own money is at stake , you tend to be careful . 
But when you can play with others &quot; money and expect a very high reward for success and no punishment for failure , the incentives for irresponsible risk-taking become enormous .
