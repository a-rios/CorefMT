The Climate Pope 
STOCKHOLM - Pope Francis &apos;s just-released encyclical on the environment sends a powerful message not just to the world &apos;s 1.2 billion Catholics , but to the rest of the global population as well . 
Firmly rooted in science , the teaching document - the most significant from the Vatican in over a decade - recognizes the need for urgent action , as the world confronts potentially catastrophic climate change . 
In 2000 , the scientists Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer proposed that human activity , particularly in the developed world , was interfering at the planetary scale , with the fundamental forces of nature - the water , carbon , and nitrogen cycles , the ice sheets , biodiversity , the oceans , and the forests . 
The changes were so profound , they suggested , that geologists in the future would see a clear break from the previous geological era , the Holocene , to a new one , which they called the Anthropocene . 
Over the last 15 years , scientific evidence has reinforced the conclusion that human activity is fundamentally transforming the planet . 
The Vatican has already recognized this view explicitly , with the Pontifical Academy of Sciences referring to the Anthropocene in the proceedings of a meeting held in May 2014 . 
The Holocene , which began 11,700 years ago as the last Ice Age receded , has been a period of remarkable stability . 
After an age of drastic swings , average global temperatures settled in to a stable pattern within an extraordinarily narrow range of 1 째 Celsius . 
The relative stability of the climate and predictability of seasons facilitated the emergence of agriculture , which , in turn , enabled the creation of towns and cities . 
In other words , the Holocene &apos;s defining features are critical to support human civilization as we know it - a conclusion that the latest encyclical supports . 
Moreover , as recent evidence indicates , when large natural systems are placed under high levels of stress , they can reach tipping points , at which only a small adjustment is sufficient to trigger their collapse . 
It seems that many systems are already nearing that point . 
Last year , researchers working in Antarctica observed that major parts of the ice sheet appear to be collapsing irrevocably . 
On the other side of the planet , sea ice is on such a rapid downward spiral that , in just a few decades , the Arctic could be open ocean in the summer . 
This could drive global temperatures even higher , because the darker ocean absorbs solar heat , whereas white sea ice reflects it . 
In 2009 , my colleagues and I identified nine planetary boundaries relating to areas like climate , biodiversity , nitrogen and phosphorus use , and deforestation that , if respected , would enable us to preserve - or , at least avoid disrupting further - Holocene conditions . 
When we updated our analysis earlier this year , we concluded that we have already violated four of the nine boundaries . 
If we do not change our behavior quickly , we may well lose the environmental stability upon which our planet - and our lives - depends . 
This is the main message of the pope &apos;s encyclical . 
Protecting our planet is a moral imperative . 
As the Vatican has pointed out , the poor are disproportionately affected by the consequences of climate change ; for example , some of our activities threaten to undermine food production in the drier - and poorer - areas of the world . 
But we also face an economic imperative , because reliable access to natural resources is essential for human development and prosperity . 
And , in fact , increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters carry massive human and economic costs . 
As the encyclical makes clear , the future does not have to be bleak . 
We can take this opportunity to build a new future - one in which environmental sustainability supports human progress and dignity . 
It is business as usual that holds out the bleakest prospect for humanity . 
The most immediate priority is to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss , which is reaching mass-extinction levels . 
Global temperatures have risen almost 1 째 C in the last century , placing them at the Holocene boundary . 
If , as the recently published &quot; earth statement &quot; underlines , temperatures reach 2 째 C above pre-industrial levels , the results could be disastrous . 
Yet , if current emissions trends hold , temperatures are set to rise by more than 4 째 C from pre-industrial levels by the end of the century . 
According to Francis &apos;s encyclical , the world must work together to reverse this trend , by reconnecting with the biosphere and harmonizing their activities with nature . 
Taking a strong stance that aligns with our planetary-boundaries research , the encyclical underscores humanity &apos;s responsibility to sustain Holocene-era stability in support of world development . 
But some - such as the recently published &quot; Ecomodernist Manifesto &quot; - are less concerned with the environmental risks of the Anthropocene , preferring to rely on our technological capacity to adapt to changing conditions . 
To be sure , technological innovation and development will be vital in the shift to a more sustainable world , particularly by enabling the creation of a zero-emissions society by around 2050 . 
But it will not be enough to support good lifestyles for all citizens worldwide . 
The global transformation that is needed now must be based not on technological advancement , but on our collective values and convictions - especially our commitment to safeguard the planet &apos;s stability and resilience by protecting the global commons . 
In September , world leaders will meet to agree on new Sustainable Development Goals , which will guide global development efforts for the next 15 years . 
Unlike the new targets &quot; predecessors , the Millennium Development Goals , the SDGs will apply to all countries , and will include an explicit focus on environmental sustainability , in addition to human and economic development . 
In December , when world leaders meet again to hammer out a climate agreement , the quality of their work will , in many ways , determine the trajectory of the planet . 
The pope &apos;s declaration echoes the draft text for the SDGs : &quot; the future of humanity and of our planet lies in our hands . &quot; 
This is more than mere rhetoric ; it represents a shift to a new paradigm , in which humans are the driving force behind planetary developments , and thus have a new responsibility of stewardship . 
Our choices have never been more important .
