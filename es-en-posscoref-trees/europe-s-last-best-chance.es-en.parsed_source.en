Europe &apos;s Last Best Chance 
STANFORD - The resignations of Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have highlighted how Greece , Italy , and many other countries obscured for too long their bloated public sectors &quot; long-standing problems with unsustainable social-welfare benefits . 
Indeed , for many of these countries , meaningful reform has now become unavoidable . 
The social-insurance systems in Europe , as in the United States , Japan , and elsewhere , were designed under vastly different economic and demographic circumstances - more rapid economic growth , rising populations , and lower life expectancy - from those prevailing today . 
Governments ( the focus is on Greece and Italy at the moment , but they are not alone ) have promised too much , to too many , for too long . 
My 1986 book Too Many Promises pointed to the same problem with America &apos;s social-welfare system . 
This fundamental problem has now manifested itself in these countries &quot; unsustainable debt dynamics . 
Euro membership , which temporarily enabled massive borrowing at low interest rates , merely aggravated it . 
Reforming social-welfare benefits is the only permanent solution to Europe &apos;s crisis . 
One hopes that , with the help of national governments , the European Central Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and the European Financial Stability Facility , the holes in the sovereign-debt-funding dike will be temporarily plugged , and that European banks will be recapitalized . 
But this will work only if structural reforms make these economies far more competitive . 
They must both lower the tax burden and reduce bloated transfer payments . 
Too many people are collecting benefits relative to those working and paying taxes . 
Meanwhile , the bond market &apos;s concern over fiscal deficits and debt dynamics is driving these countries &quot; borrowing costs higher . 
Short-term and long-term policies are therefore closely related ; unless temporary stopgaps are combined with fundamental long-term structural reform , another disaster like the current one - or worse - will become inevitable . 
There are three fundamental factors that determine the evolution of a country &apos;s sovereign debt : its rate of economic growth ; its borrowing costs ; and its primary budget position ( the budget balance net of interest payments ) . 
A country with a balanced primary budget collects enough revenue to pay its current expenses but not the interest on its outstanding debt . 
Higher interest rates , slower growth , and a weaker primary budget position all raise the debt-ratio trajectory . 
Italy is now paying 7 % interest annually on its sovereign debt , while its economy is growing at only 1 % . 
Thus , Italy needs sustained , large primary surpluses , much faster growth , and / or far lower interest rates to avoid a debt restructuring . 
A credible path to sufficient primary surpluses would lower interest rates . 
In the long run , if primary surpluses are achieved by controlling spending , the increase in national saving will promote investment and growth , whereas higher tax rates would work in the opposite direction . 
Successful post-World War II fiscal consolidation in OECD countries averaged $ 5- $ 6 in spending cuts per $ 1 of tax hikes . 
Some experts , such as former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet , argue that fiscal consolidation would be expansionary . 
Specifically , it would boost confidence , which would lower interest rates and offset any direct effect on demand , as occurred in Ireland and Denmark in the 1980 &quot; s . 
But that is less likely now , as many countries are undertaking fiscal consolidation simultaneously , non-sovereign interest rates are already low , and monetary union prevents the most troubled countries in the eurozone - Portugal , Italy , Ireland , Greece , and Spain - from devaluing their way to competitiveness . 
Substantial primary surpluses will be needed for many years in order to stabilize the debt ratio and gradually reduce it to the economic safety zone of less than 60 % of GDP ( Italy and Greece are over 100 % ) . 
A credible long-term program of reforms must be implemented now , while temporary emergency measures - bond purchases by the EFSF , IMF , and the ECB - provide breathing room . 
If the primary surpluses are insufficient , temporary measures will only postpone the inevitable debt debacle . 
Even more fundamental arithmetic lies at the core of the debt quandary . 
The tax rate required to fund social-welfare benefits depends on three factors : the dependency ratio ( the ratio of recipients to taxpayers ) ; the replacement rate ( the ratio of benefits to average wages ) ; and the economic-growth rate ( roughly , productivity plus population growth ) . 
In other words , the more generous and widespread the government benefits , the higher the required tax rate . 
This core problem will increasingly affect even the Northern European countries , notwithstanding their current appearance of economic strength and fiscal soundness . 
In Europe &apos;s highly taxed economies , better tax compliance or selective revenue measures can produce only a small amount of additional tax revenue without undermining growth . 
Spending cuts are the only way to improve the budget position significantly . 
But that course will be difficult . 
In many European countries , the government pays benefits to a majority of the population . 
A key question is whether incoming Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos and his new Italian counterpart , Mario Monti , both highly regarded economists , have the leadership skills to navigate these treacherous waters . 
Their examples will test whether other European democracies with heavily benefit-dependent populations can rein in the welfare state &apos;s excesses . 
It is not an impossible challenge . 
Canada has staged a substantial retreat from the welfare state &apos;s worst excesses , as center-left and center-right governments alike reduced the share of government spending as a proportion of GDP by eight percentage points in recent years . 
Several European countries are considering raising their remarkably low retirement ages , or have already done so . 
Given demographic trends , this may well be Europe &apos;s last chance to build a firmer foundation for future prosperity . 
Winston Churchill once famously said of America that you can count on it to do the right thing once it has exhausted all other alternatives . 
Let us hope that his dictum proves correct for Europe as well .
