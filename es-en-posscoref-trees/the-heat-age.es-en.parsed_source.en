The Heat Age 
BERLIN - This April was the hottest April on record , globally , for at least 130 years , according to the worldwide temperature records maintained by NASA and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . 
The past twelve months was the hottest 12-month period since measurements began . 
That is what the data from weather stations and ships show . 
But if you prefer satellite data , the picture is similar . 
Satellite data have this March the hottest March on record , with April ranking second-hottest ; the surface data have it the other way round , with March the second-hottest and April the hottest . 
Of course , more important , scientifically , are the long-term trends . 
For the past 30 years - that &apos;s how long the satellite measurements have been taken - the trend is clearly upward and similar in magnitude in all the available data sets . 
Should you still have doubts that the planet is heating up , look at the shrinking mountain glaciers around the world , or the declining sea-ice cover on the Arctic Ocean , which in recent summers has been little more than half its size in the 1970 &quot; s . 
What is causing this climatic warming ? 
Physics tells us : if you want to know why it is getting warmer , seek the source of heat . 
( That &apos;s a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics : energy is always conserved . ) 
We thus have to look at the heat balance of our planet to understand the reason for the warming . 
That is surprisingly simple : there is only one source of heat coming in , and that is radiation from the sun ( which is largely visible light , or what physicists call short-wave radiation ) . 
And there is only one form of heat leaving the planet , and that is radiative heat ( which is invisible , or what physicists call long-wave radiation ) . 
They are essentially the same physical phenomenon ; the difference in wavelength comes only from the sun being much hotter than Earth . 
So , could changes in solar radiation explain the warming of the planet ? 
Measurements of incoming solar radiation show that it has not increased in the past 50 years - in fact , the record even shows a small decrease . 
But the record &apos;s predominant feature is the recurrence of solar radiation cycles lasting about 11 years ( called Schwabe cycles , after the astronomer who discovered them in 1843 ) . 
In the past few years , we &apos;ve been in the deepest and longest minimum of a Schwabe cycle since satellite measurements began . 
That &apos;s right : while global temperatures are at a record high , the sun has been at its dimmest in decades . 
Changes in solar activity clearly cannot explain global warming . 
But that leaves another factor affecting incoming solar radiation : how much gets reflected back into space by ice , snow , clouds , desert sand , and other bright , mirror-like surfaces . 
Indeed , a part of the observed warming is due to less reflection , as snow and ice cover has shrunk . 
This allows more solar heat to be taken up in the climate system , which is one reason why the Arctic has warmed at a faster rate than other parts of the world . 
But shrinking snow and ice cover is itself a result of warming , so reduced reflection of solar rays is not the primary cause of warming . 
Rather , it is a feedback that amplifies warming . 
Humans have altered the brightness of the Earth - as seen from space - in more direct ways . 
But converting forest to farmland ( which is brighter than forest ) and adding smog particles to the atmosphere ( which reflect sunlight ) have increased the reflection of solar radiation , thus tending to offset some of the global warming that would otherwise have occurred . 
So we are left with the second part of the planetary heat budget : radiative heat escaping to space . 
That can be changed by adding heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere - the so-called greenhouse gases , which absorb long-wave radiation on its way out and send some of it back towards the surface . 
The importance of this &quot; greenhouse effect &quot; has been known in science since the nineteenth century , when Joseph Fourier coined the term . 
Perhaps nobody has described it more succinctly than the British physicist John Tyndall , who was the first to measure the effect in his laboratory in 1859 for a number of gases , including CO2 . 
He wrote : &quot; The atmosphere admits of the entrance of solar heat , but checks its exit ; and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet . &quot; 
We know from measurements that greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth &apos;s atmosphere . 
Carbon-dioxide levels are one-third higher now than at any time in the past million years , owing to our industrial emissions . 
We can calculate how much this has changed the Earth &apos;s heat balance . 
Voilà : just the amount to explain the observed warming . 
That is one of several reasons why hardly any serious climate scientist doubts that greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming . 
In fact , this warming was predicted before it was observed . 
The rise in CO2 levels has been known since 1960 . 
In 1975 the American climatologist Wallace Broecker published a paper in the journal Science , entitled &quot; Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming ? &quot; 
There he correctly predicted &quot; that the present cooling trend will , within a decade or so , give way to a pronounced warming induced by carbon dioxide , &quot; and that &quot; by early in the next century &#91; CO2 &#93; will have driven the mean planetary temperature beyond the limits experienced during the last 1,000 years . &quot; 
He predicted an overall twentieth-century global warming of 0.8 ºC . 
He was right on all counts . 
Many are lining up to oppose the science of global warming . 
But the laws of physics don &apos;t surrender to opposition : for the past 35 years , global warming has unfolded as predicted by science . 
It will most likely continue to do so until we stop it by cutting CO2 emissions .
