China &apos;s Bad Bet Against America 
CAMBRIDGE - Chinese-American relations are , once again , in a downswing . 
China objected to President Barack Obama &apos;s receiving the Dalai Lama in the White House , as well as to the administration &apos;s arms sales to Taiwan . 
There was ample precedent for both American decisions , but some Chinese leaders expected Obama to be more sensitive to what China sees as its &quot; core interests &quot; in national unity . 
Things were not supposed to turn out this way . 
A year ago , the Obama administration made major efforts to reach out to China . 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to &quot; being in the same boat , &quot; and that China and the United States would &quot; rise and fall together . &quot; 
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said he spent more time consulting his Chinese counterparts than those in any other country . 
Some observers even referred to a US-Chinese &quot; G2 &quot; that would manage the world economy . 
The G2 idea was always foolish . 
Europe has a larger economy than both the US and China , and Japan &apos;s economy is currently about the same size as China &apos;s . 
Their participation in the solution of global problems will be essential . 
Nonetheless , growing US-Chinese cooperation within the G20 last year was a positive sign of bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation . 
Whatever the concerns regarding the recent events related to the Dalai Lama and Taiwan , it is important to note that the deterioration in US-Chinese relations began beforehand . 
Many American congressmen , for example , complain that American jobs are being destroyed by China &apos;s intervention in currency markets to maintain an artificially low value for the yuan . 
A second issue was China &apos;s decision not to cooperate at the United Nations conference on global climate change in Copenhagen last December . 
Not only did China resist measures that had been under negotiation for the preceding year , but Prime Minister Wen Jiabao &apos;s decision to send a low-level official to meet with and point a finger at Obama was downright insulting . 
China behaved similarly when the five permanent members of the UN Security Council ( plus Germany ) met to discuss sanctions against Iran for violations of its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
Again , China sent a low-ranking official . 
What happened to those promising early signs of cooperation ? 
Two reasons for the change in Chinese behavior - seemingly inconsistent at first glance , but in fact perhaps mutually reinforcing - seem possible . 
First , a political transition is expected in 2012 , and , in a period of rising nationalism , no Chinese leader wants to look softer than his rivals . 
In addition , China may be approaching an economic transition . 
Some Chinese argue that anything less than 8 % growth would be inadequate to ensure sufficient job creation and fend off social instability . 
If China responds to entreaties to revalue the yuan , it may need to look tough on other issues to appease nationalist sentiment . 
The second cause of China &apos;s recent behavior could be hubris and overconfidence . 
China is justly proud of its success in emerging from the world recession with a high rate of economic growth . 
It blames the US for producing the recession , and now holds some $ 2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves . 
Many Chinese believe that this represents a shift in the global balance of power , and that China should be less deferential to other countries , including the US . 
Certain Chinese scholars are now writing about the decline of the US , with one identifying the year 2000 as the peak of American power . 
This overconfidence in foreign policy , combined with insecurity in domestic affairs , may combine to explain the change in Chinese behavior in the latter part of 2009 . 
If so , China is making a serious miscalculation . 
First , the US is not in decline . 
Americans and others have been predicting decline regularly over the years : after the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 ; again when Nixon closed the gold window in 1971 ; and when the American rust-belt economy seemed to be overtaken by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980 &quot; s . 
But when one looks at the underlying strength of the American economy , it is not surprising that the World Economic Forum ranks the US second ( just behind Switzerland ) among the most competitive , while China ranks some 30 places below . 
Second , the fact that China holds so many dollars is not a true source of power , because the interdependence in the economic relationship is symmetrical . 
True , if China dumped its dollars on world markets , it could bring the American economy to its knees , but in doing so it would bring itself to its ankles . 
China would not only lose the value of its dollar reserves , but would suffer major unemployment . When interdependence is balanced , it does not constitute a source of power . 
Third , despite Chinese complaints , the dollar is likely to remain the major global reserve currency , owing to the depth and breadth of America &apos;s capital markets , which China cannot match without making the yuan fully convertible and reforming its banking system . 
Finally , China has miscalculated by violating the wisdom of Deng Xiaoping , who advised that China should proceed cautiously and &quot; keep its light under a basket . &quot; 
As a senior Asian statesman told me recently , Deng would never have made this mistake . 
If Deng were in charge today , he would lead China back to the cooperative relations with the US that marked early 2009 .
