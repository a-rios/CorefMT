Savable Africa 
The G-8 Summit in Scotland in early July will bring together the political leaders of the richest countries to consider the plight of the poorest countries . 
So far , President George W. Bush has resisted Prime Minister Tony Blair &apos;s call for a doubling of aid to Africa by 2010 . 
This is a tragic mistake , one that results from a misunderstanding of the challenges facing Africa and of America &apos;s responsibilities . 
American policy is based overwhelmingly on the idea that Africa can lift itself out of extreme poverty through its own efforts , that aid is largely misused because of corruption , and that the United States already gives generous amounts . 
This is wrong on all counts : Africa is trapped in poverty , many countries are well poised to use aid effectively , and America &apos;s contribution is tiny relative to Africa &apos;s needs , America &apos;s promises , and America &apos;s wealth . 
Africa suffers simultaneously from three challenges that trap it in poverty . 
First , Africa does not grow enough food . 
Unlike Asia , Africa did not have a Green Revolution in food production . 
In 1965 , India averaged 854 kilograms of grain per hectare in use , while Sub-Saharan Africa averaged almost the same , 773 kilograms per hectare . 
But , by 2000 , India was producing 2,293 kilograms per hectare , while Africa was producing only 1,118 . 
Second , Africa suffers from disease unlike any other part of the world . 
Africa &apos;s AIDS pandemic is well known ; its malaria pandemic , which will claim three million lives and a billion illnesses this year , is not . 
India controlled malaria after the 1960 &quot; s , while Africa did not , one reason being that Africa &apos;s malaria-bearing mosquitoes are particularly adept at transmitting the disease . 
Third , Africa is economically isolated , owing to very poor infrastructure , large over-land distances , and many landlocked countries . 
These geographical barriers keep much of Africa , especially rural Africa , out of the mainstream of international trade . 
Without the benefits of trade , much of rural Africa struggles at subsistence levels . 
Bush might think that America is doing a lot to help overcome these problems , but the truth is that US aid is minimal . 
Blair &apos;s Africa Commission , as well as the UN Millennium Project , found that Africa needs about $ 50 billion per year in aid by 2010 . 
America &apos;s fair share of the total is about $ 15 billion per year . 
This tragically small sum amounts to just three cents for every $ 100 of US gross national product , which is less than two days of US military spending . 
Not only is US aid a tiny fraction of what it should be , but American explanations for the lack of aid are wrong . 
But impoverished and slow-growing African countries like Ghana , Senegal , Mali , Benin , and Malawi are ranked as having less corruption than fast-growing Asian countries like Vietnam , Bangladesh , and Indonesia . 
Indeed , America &apos;s own Millennium Challenge Account has already recognized such African countries for their strong governance . 
Good governance surely will help in Africa and elsewhere , but corruption should not be used as an excuse not to help Africa . 
On hunger , the key is to help Africa achieve its own Green Revolution . 
Rich countries should help African farmers use improved seed varieties , more fertilizer , and better water management , such as small-scale irrigation . 
The techniques are known , but Africa &apos;s farmers are too poor to get started . 
With increased help to African farmers to grow more food ( as opposed to shipping food aid from the US ) , it would be possible to double or even triple crop yields . 
On disease , malaria could be controlled by 2008 using proven , low-cost methods . 
But , again , Africa cannot afford them . 
The best estimates show that Africa needs about 300 million bed nets , and that the cost per net ( including shipping ) is around $ 10 , for a sum of $ 3 billion . 
In addition , Africa needs help with anti-malaria medicines , diagnostic equipment , and training of community health workers . 
On economic isolation , Africa needs help with the basics - roads and ports - but there is also an opportunity to &quot; leapfrog &quot; technology . 
Cell phones and Internet connectivity could reach all of Africa at low cost , ending the economic isolation of hundreds of millions of people . 
Some reasonable estimates put the cost at around $ 1 billion for an Africa-wide fiber-optic network that could bring Internet connectivity and telephone service across the continent &apos;s villages and cities . 
Africa is ready to break out of poverty if the US and other rich countries help . 
Europe appears poised to do more , while the US appears to be the main obstacle . 
The G-8 Summit provides an opportunity for the US , which will spend $ 500 billion on its military this year , to make a lasting - and certainly more cost-effective - contribution to global security by saving millions of lives in Africa and helping its people escape extreme poverty .
