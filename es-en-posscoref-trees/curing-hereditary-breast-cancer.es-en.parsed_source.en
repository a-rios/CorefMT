Curing Hereditary Breast Cancer 
In developed countries , breast cancer affects about one in ten women , and in many of these countries the disease is on the increase . 
But , whatever the reason ( or reasons ) for the rise in their occurrence , we also know that between 5 % and 10 % of breast cancers are due to an inherited defect that affects the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes . 
Women carrying a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have roughly an 80 % risk of developing breast cancer . 
A mutation in these genes also leads to an increased risk of developing ovarian tumors . 
When the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were discovered more than a decade ago , there were high hopes for novel and targeted therapies . 
Disappointingly , no new treatments have yet arisen . 
As a result , many women with a high level of mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes face the tragic choice of having their breasts and ovaries surgically removed to pre-empt cancer . 
Recently , my research group , along with researchers in London , provided some real hope for carriers of mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes . 
Both research teams describe how the use of a chemical inhibitor can kill tumor cells that have either a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene defect causing hereditary breast cancer . 
This new treatment targets only the tumor cells and is unlikely to affect other healthy cells in the body . 
The discovery could also work to prevent hereditary breast cancer cells from growing into tumors . 
The chemical inhibitors used in this treatment target the enzyme polymerase ( PARP1 ) , which is normally involved in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks - a common form of spontaneous DNA lesions . 
Chemical inhibition of the PARP1 protein results in reduced occurrence of these single-strand break repairs . 
Unrepaired single-strand breaks are not very toxic to cells . 
However , these breaks disrupt and damage the DNA when they are copied as DNA replicates . 
The damage arising when copying the DNA is repaired with recombination , involving the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins . 
But cells with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are unable to undergo recombination and are therefore much more sensitive to an increased level of unrepaired single-strand breaks . 
The normal cells of women carrying the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations can still recombine , because they retain one functional allele - or alternative form - of the gene . 
Only those cells losing this remaining functional allele of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene will become tumors . 
Thus , only the tumor cells will have a non-functional recombination pathway and rely completely on PARP to repair single-strand breaks before copying the DNA . 
In our research , we exploit this requirement to specifically target the BRCA1 or BRCA2-defective cancer cells with inhibitors of PARP . 
This treatment is unlikely to cause many side effects ; prolonged treatments with PARP inhibitors are well tolerated in mice . 
We have shown that PARP inhibitors are effective at killing BRCA2-defective breast cancer cells , and that the tumors they cause can fully regress and disappear following treatment with a PARP inhibitor . 
The next step is to investigate how efficient this treatment is in human patients . 
We are now initiating clinical trials to determine how efficient these PARP inhibitors are in the treatment of metastasized breast tumors . 
But caution is in order . 
BRCA1 and BRCA2-defective tumors are characterized by a high degree of genetic instability . 
It is possible that highly metastasized breast tumors might have acquired additional genetic changes causing resistance to treatment with PARP inhibitors . 
Therefore , we suggest that PARP inhibitors might be more useful in the prophylactic treatment of women carrying the gene responsible for this form of inherited breast cancer . 
The reason is simple : cells that have recently lost the functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele and that will later grow into tumors will also be unable to undergo recombination . 
This means that early cancerous cells should be sensitive to PARP inhibitors . 
However , unlike fully developed tumors , they are not likely to have acquired many genetic changes and are therefore unlikely to have gained resistance to PARP inhibitors . 
Treating women carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with PARP inhibitors to kill cancer cells before they grow into tumors is a new and hopeful concept in cancer prevention . 
However , the usefulness of this treatment relies on the fact that PARP1 inhibitors are completely non-toxic to humans . 
It will also take longer to validate a PARP inhibitor for use as a prophylactic treatment , because the treatment cannot be proven effective in a short time . 
Thus , while the use of PARP inhibitors to treat established tumors may be feasible within a few years , we could have to wait at least a decade before a prophylactic treatment for inherited breast cancer is widely available .
