Missiles , Oil , and Europe Re-Divided 
As if things weren &apos;t bad enough for Europe after the French and Dutch &quot; No &quot; to the European Union Constitution , a new divisive issue now threatens to strain Europe &apos;s cohesion . 
The United States wants to establish an anti-missile defense system that is supposed to protect America and parts of Europe against missiles from the Middle East . 
The American missiles are to be stationed in Poland , with a radar system to be set up in the Czech Republic . 
Russia is up in arms about the US plan . 
A month ago , Russian President Vladimir Putin made a fiery speech against the project during the Munich Conference on Security Policy . 
The US representatives were perplexed ; the Europeans were shocked . 
Now the US says it has reached agreement with Poland and the Czech Republic to study the concrete details of the stationing of the necessary defense systems . 
Once again , Europe is shocked : the two great powers of the Cold War seem not to be taking Brussels seriously . 
Are we threatened with a new arms race between Russia and the US , with Europe once again the theater of their rivalry ? 
Indeed , is a new Cold War looming ? 
There is no reason to panic about America &apos;s proposed anti-missile defense system . 
Nor can the political climate , old differences , and the by-no-means new power rivalry between Russia and the US justify pessimism . 
No doubt , Russia has regained strength from high oil and gas prices , and it is reclaiming its position as an independent global actor . 
Putin &apos;s policies are popular in Russia , which of course does not make them right . 
But , in criticizing Putin , the West should be mindful of his domestic support . 
Russia &apos;s return to the world stage means that new and old rivalries will develop and may even intensify in the future . 
But we are light years away from a new Cold War . 
There is now no longer any ideological hostility between Russia and the West . 
Estrangement ? 
Yes . 
But hostility ? 
No . 
Eleven defensive US missiles in Poland will not threaten Russia &apos;s security . 
And they will not mark the beginning of a new arms race . 
But it is also hard to understand , why the US needs this decision now . 
Timing ? 
Priorities ? 
The US policy seems unreasonable . 
The threat from Iran , against which the missiles are to defend , is still far away and can be avoided by diplomatic means . 
In fact , the West needs Russia &apos;s cooperation on almost every important international issue of the day , be it North Korea , Iran , Iraq , the Middle East , South Caucasus , Central Asia , Kosovo , Darfur , climate change , energy security , or nuclear non-proliferation . 
For some time now , American policy towards Russia has been anything but consistent . 
Apparently , the US can &apos;t decide whether to treat Russia as a rival power or a difficult partner . 
It would be in America &apos;s interest , with Iraq , Iran , and the broader Middle East as its foreign-policy priorities , to pursue the partnership option . 
Europe &apos;s policy towards Russia is in even worse shape . 
Indeed , it increasingly resembles a chicken farm after a fox has broken in . 
And now , with the US announcement that it will build the anti-missile defense system on a bilateral basis with Poland and the Czech Republic , there is also a hawk circling overhead . 
Confusion and panic are spreading in Europe . 
What is most frightening about all this is not the American anti-missile project or Putin &apos;s rhetorical muscle-flexing , but rather the increasingly dramatic European weakness that the episode has exposed . 
The EU has been working for a decade on a common foreign and security policy . 
So how can discussion of an issue as crucial as the establishment of an American anti-missile defense system in Europe be ignored at the EU level , with no attempt being made to find a joint European position ? 
An anti-missile defense system in Europe is a European , not a bilateral , issue . 
However important NATO may be , it would be a dramatic admission of its own helplessness and insignificance if the EU were to remain silent on this crucial issue for Europe &apos;s future . 
Europe &apos;s weakness becomes even more obvious given that it is not at all clear whether the American missile defense system will ever work . 
This doubtful project is not worth a serious division of Europe ! 
But bilateral treatment of the issue threatens to do just that : to divide Europe along the same fault lines as did the war in Iraq . 
All the while , Moscow is playing a game of &quot; divide and rule &quot; by exploiting Europe &apos;s dependence on Russian oil and gas supplies . 
As the EU &apos;s Russia policy is blocked by the Polish government &apos;s intransigence , Russia blithely continues to sign more bilateral treaties with individual EU member states , most recently with Greece and Bulgaria . 
The only effective answer that Europeans can give to the Kremlin is to adopt a common energy policy that will hinder any further division of Europe . 
This will not be easy to achieve , but the EU has accomplished more difficult tasks in the past . 
The EU must develop a common position with respect to all significant , strategic issues in its foreign relations . 
Otherwise , Europe will be at the mercy of the interests of others . 
No European country - not even the Big Three ( France , Great Britain , and Germany ) - can any longer assert its central foreign policy interests alone , outside of the common European framework . 
So any weakening of the EU in its foreign relations entails a corresponding weakening of the member states &quot; individual interests . 
Everyone agrees to a &quot; Europe of Common Values . &quot; 
What we need now is a &quot; Europe of Common Interests . &quot; 
Objectively , it is already a reality . 
Subjectively , the only remaining question is this : how long will it take before Europe &apos;s governments finally start taking it into account ?
