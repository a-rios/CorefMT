Labor &apos;s Digital Displacement 
MILAN - Digital technologies are once again transforming global value chains and , with them , the structure of the global economy . 
What do businesses , citizens , and policymakers need to know as they scramble to keep up ? 
Digitally enabled supply chains initially increased efficiency and dramatically shortened lead times . 
Economic activity ( production , research , design , etc . ) moved to any accessible country or region that had relatively inexpensive labor and human capital . 
With only a slight lag , complexity became manageable , and global supply chains &quot; linear model ( something produced in country A is consumed in country B ) gave way to a more complex model with more fragmented but more efficient supply networks . 
Meanwhile , a dramatic shift occurred on the demand side , as emerging economies grew and became middle-income countries . 
Developing country producers , who in an earlier era accounted for a relatively small fraction of global demand , became major consumers . 
Global supply networks shifted again , accommodating fragmentation and dispersion on both the supply and demand sides of their structure , a process sometimes called technologically enabled atomization : the division of supply networks into finer and finer parts , breaking the bonds of proximity and the resulting transaction-cost constraints that previously prevailed . 
For example , many services related to intermediate and final demand require knowledge , expertise , information , and communication for their delivery . 
What they do not require is geographical nearness or the physical movement of goods . 
They represent a large share of the global economy , and they are gravitating rapidly toward the tradable sector , with increasingly powerful digital and information technology chasing imperfectly mobile human resources and new rapidly growing markets . 
In the course of this transformation , millions of people joined the global economy , with wide-ranging consequences - many of which remain challenging - for poverty , prices , wages , and income distributions . 
Now comes a second , potentially even more powerful , wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks . 
This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors - think of ATMs , online banking , enterprise resource planning , customer relationship management , mobile payment systems , and much more . 
This revolution is spreading to the production of goods , where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor . 
It is important to understand the economics of these technologies . 
The vast majority of the cost comes at the start , in the design of hardware ( like sensors ) and , more important , in creating the software that produces the capability to carry out various tasks . 
Once this is achieved , the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low ( and declines as scale rises ) , and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero . 
With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing , the incentives to invest are compelling . 
In other words , unlike the preceding wave of digital technology , which motivated firms to gain access to and deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world , the driving force in this round is cost reduction via the replacement of labor . 
This transformation has important side effects . 
For physical goods , there are costs associated with logistics and lead times , owing to inventories and poor forecasts of the market . 
With digital capital-intensive technology , however , production will inevitably move toward the final market , wherever it is . 
This re-localization constitutes a major shift in the structure of global supply networks . 
An extreme form of this may be coming in the form of 3D printing , a technology that makes it possible to produce an astonishingly wide and growing range of products by printing them one layer at a time . 
Examples include buildings , athletic shoes , designer lamps , aircraft wings , and much more . 
As the costs of this technology decline , it is easy to imagine that production will become extremely local and customized . 
Moreover , production may occur in response to actual demand , not anticipated or forecast demand . 
In some sense , this represents the ultimate compression of supply chains , as firms produce to final demand with minimal delay . 
Meanwhile , the impact of robotics ( another technology with digital foundations ) , is not confined to production . 
Though self-driving cars and drones are the most attention-getting examples , the impact on logistics is no less transformative . 
Computers and robotic cranes that schedule and move containers around and load ships now control the Port of Singapore , one of the most efficient in the world . 
Developing countries in the early stages of growth need to understand these trends . 
Re-localization will be seen everywhere , including lower-income countries . 
Production will not vanish ; it will just be less labor intensive . 
All countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital that supports their deployment and expansion . 
The retail sector , too , is being transformed . 
Online retail and supporting logistics is expanding in a wide range of advanced and developing economies . 
In China , where the expansion is occurring extremely quickly , estimates suggest that only part of the expansion is at the expense of traditional retail . 
In fact , online retail appears to be accelerating the expansion of the overall consumer market . 
Knowledgeable participants expect the new retail model to be an integrated form of online and physical retail , each modified by the presence of the other . 
The integration of sourcing with logistics and retail will become the third leg of the stool . 
The world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital , not goods , services , and traditional capital . 
Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets , policies , investments ( especially in human capital ) , and quite possibly models of employment and distribution . 
No one knows fully how all of this will play out . 
But attempting to understand where the technological forces and trends are leading us is a good place to start .
