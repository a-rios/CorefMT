The Limits of China &apos;s Consumer Revolution 
SHANGHAI - China &apos;s economy is at a crossroads . 
As 2013 begins , foreign and domestic observers alike are asking which path the country &apos;s economic development should take in the next decade . 
How can China ensure stable and sustainable growth in the face of significant internal and external challenges , including slowing medium- and long-term growth , rising labor costs , and growing inflationary pressure ? 
After the global economic crisis weakened external demand , which sustained China &apos;s unprecedented economic growth for three decades , the authorities agreed that internal demand , especially domestic consumption , must become the country &apos;s new growth engine . 
At the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s congress in November , China &apos;s leaders declared their intention to double per capita income by 2020 , unleashing 64 trillion renminbi ( $ 10.2 trillion ) of purchasing power . 
Indeed , with roughly 130 million middle-class consumers , China &apos;s domestic market holds significant potential . 
The Boston Consulting Group estimates that , with an average annual GDP growth rate of 7 % in China and 2 % in the United States , Chinese domestic consumption will rise to half of America &apos;s by 2015 , and 80 % in 2020 ( assuming that the renminbi appreciates at an average rate of 3 % against the US dollar over the next few years ) . 
Moreover , the current-account surplus plummeted from more than 10 % of GDP in 2007 to 2.8 % in 2011 , reflecting China &apos;s decreasing reliance on exports to drive economic growth . 
In 2010 , China &apos;s imports ranked second in the world , and are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 27 % in 2011-2015 , outpacing export growth by five percentage points . 
As a result , the total value of imports is expected to exceed $ 10 trillion in only two years , providing lucrative investment opportunities and broader markets to foreign investors . 
This potential is not lost on multinational companies . 
A survey conducted in May 2012 by China &apos;s State Council Development Research Center asked 394 Chinese and foreign companies about their future strategic orientation in China . 
The respondents most often viewed China not only as a market opportunity , a research-and-development base , and an export base , but also as a high-end manufacturing base , a regional-headquarters site , and a service base . 
The results also reflected China &apos;s declining attractiveness as a base for product assembly , low-cost manufacturing , and parts production . 
In fact , while the US and other developed countries have sought to bring manufacturing home ( &quot; reshoring &quot; ) , they have been establishing innovation facilities in China . 
Multinational companies have created nearly 1,000 R D centers in China , including 194 in 2010 alone , enabling them to develop products for the local market . 
More than 1,400 foreign-funded R D institutions are currently operating in China , and data from China &apos;s Ministry of Commerce indicate that 480 of the world &apos;s top 500 companies have established local subsidiaries . 
But China cannot rely on consumption as its only growth engine . 
History has shown that a one-dimensional development model cannot ensure sustainable competitiveness , just as no single market can sustain global demand . 
Given this , China must continue to develop its manufacturing sector . 
China is the world &apos;s top manufacturing country by output . 
But , while it accounts for 19.8 % of total global manufacturing , it receives less than 3 % of the world &apos;s manufacturing R D investment . 
As a result , China &apos;s innovative capacity remains relatively low , with its high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries unable to compete globally . 
On average , China &apos;s industrial enterprises are relatively small , and , although its industrial labor productivity ( real manufacturing value added per employee ) has improved over the last decade , it remains much lower than that of developed countries - just 4.4 % of America &apos;s and Japan &apos;s productivity , and 5.6 % of Germany &apos;s . 
And the &quot; pauperization &quot; phenomenon - in which companies must adjust their commercial strategies to cope with an impoverished consumer base - is increasingly affecting traditional industries , further undermining China &apos;s capacity for sustainable development . 
Moreover , the quality of Chinese-manufactured products continues to lag behind that of developed countries &quot; manufactured goods . 
Whereas one unit of intermediate input in developed countries typically generates one unit or more of added value , in China the ratio is only 0.56 . 
As China &apos;s &quot; demographic dividend &quot; disappears , its low-end labor market is shrinking , driving up its once rock-bottom labor costs and diminishing its rate of return on capital . 
Over the next decade , as Chinese workers demand higher salaries , basic benefits , and improved working conditions , the country may well lose the comparative advantage that has driven its manufacturing boom . 
While manufacturing wages remain significantly lower in China than in the US , the rapidly narrowing gap is already fueling American reshoring . 
Given that Chinese wages are rising at an annual rate of 15-20 % , productivity-adjusted wage rates in low-cost US states are expected to exceed those in some coastal regions of China by only 40 % in 2015 . 
Add to that reduced energy costs in the US , owing to the country &apos;s shale-gas revolution , as well as the global supply chain &apos;s complexity , and China &apos;s cost advantages will soon be negligible . 
Meanwhile , other emerging economies - including Vietnam , India , Mexico , and Eastern European countries - are vying for China &apos;s position as the world &apos;s factory . 
These lower-cost alternatives are fast becoming developed-country investors &quot; preferred destinations . 
Although the enormous potential of China &apos;s consumer market can provide a new impetus for economic growth , the country &apos;s economic transformation cannot succeed unless it upgrades its manufacturing sector . 
China &apos;s leaders must begin by increasing investment in science and technology , focusing their efforts on parlaying key technological breakthroughs into higher-value-added production . 
Only by combining growing Chinese consumption with enhanced Chinese manufacturing will the country be able to develop a new comparative advantage , which is the key to sustainable growth over the next decade .
