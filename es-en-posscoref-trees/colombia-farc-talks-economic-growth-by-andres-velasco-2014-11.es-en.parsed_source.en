The Two Colombias 
BOGOTÁ - In Medellín , Colombia &apos;s second-largest city , you can listen to an impressive presentation by the mayor &apos;s office about emerging industrial parks and new technology firms . 
Then , a glance at your smartphone reveals that guerrillas have kidnapped an army general , and that negotiations to end a decades-long civil war with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , Latin America &apos;s oldest guerrilla group , are at a standstill . 
Colombia is the only country in Latin America where you can attend seminars at world-class universities , learn about mushrooming multinationals , and chat with supremely competent policymakers , all the while knowing that citizens are confronting one another with machetes and bazookas just a few dozen miles away . 
In this sense , Colombia is two countries , which have been at war with each other for far too long . 
On the one hand , there is the Colombia of rapid economic growth and booming foreign investment , of refurbished cities and innovative social policies . 
On the other hand , there is the Colombia of Gabriel García Márquez &apos;s fictional Colonel Aureliano Buendía , who started 17 civil wars - and lost all of them . 
The bad news is that the struggle between the two Colombias has taken a tremendous human toll , with many citizens having suffered through poverty , warfare , and human-rights violations for most , if not all , of their lives . 
The good news is that the modern Colombia , the country of peace and progress , is winning . 
The fruits of that victory can be seen in places like Medellín , which , just 20 years ago , was synonymous with drug cartels and violence . 
Today , mayors and city planners from all over the world , eager to learn about urban renewal , flock to Medellín , which boasts public libraries that take culture to hillside shanties and gleaming cable cars that haul residents to and from work every day . 
It is difficult to think of a city that has undergone as dramatic a transformation as Medellín in recent years ( though Dubai and Shanghai may be in the running ) . 
The country as a whole has also experienced significant economic progress . 
Since the 2008 financial crisis , Colombia , along with Peru , has been South America &apos;s top economic performer . 
As growth slows throughout the region , owing to falling commodity prices and the end of quantitative easing in the United States , Colombia &apos;s economy is actually accelerating . 
The International Monetary Fund expects growth to reach a respectable 4.8 % this year and 4.5 % in 2015 . 
To be sure , the sharp drop in world oil prices is bad for Colombia , which in recent years has become a major hydrocarbons producer . 
But strong budget rules , similar to Chile &apos;s , keep fiscal policy well anchored . 
And the government has indicated that , if the need arises , it is prepared to raise taxes to achieve its goal of gradually reducing public debt and improving public services . 
The business community , despite some initial reluctance , seems willing to go along . 
Colombia remains a highly unequal society , with the Gini coefficient , a common measure of inequality , hovering around 0.5 - in the same range as Brazil and Chile . 
The problem has many causes , one of which is a poorly functioning labor market that forces many Colombians to accept informal work or no work at all . 
But the government does not shy away from talk of redistribution . 
Indeed , it has already initiated transfers ( such as pension increases for poor retirees ) , and its policies have contributed to five consecutive years of declining unemployment . 
As Finance Minister Mauricio Cárdenas observed in a spirited speech to a banking convention last week in Medellín , though President Juan Manuel Santos &quot; administration is historically rooted in Colombia &apos;s center-right political forces , its fiscal prudence and activist social policy qualify it as an adherent of the social-democratic &quot; third way . &quot; 
In the coming years , two factors could propel Colombia &apos;s continued development . 
One is the Pacific Alliance , which also includes Mexico , Peru , and Chile . 
Firms learn to export new products by selling them in regional markets . 
Fortunately , with the consolidation of a free-trade bloc among the Pacific Rim countries - home to 215 million people and accounting for 37 % of Latin America &apos;s GDP - this is changing . 
The second factor - which has yet to arrive - is peace , in the form of a definite cessation of hostilities with FARC . 
This is not the first time that talks have been suspended , and it might not be the last . 
But never before have negotiations progressed so far , reaching substantial agreements in several areas . 
Nothing is more important than building a Colombia where citizens no longer fear being caught in a hail of bullets or being dragged from their homes in the middle of the night . 
At the same time , one should not underestimate the economic dividend of peace , which economists in Bogotá have estimated could boost GDP growth by as much as one percentage point annually for a decade or more . 
A quarter-century ago , a safe and prosperous Colombia seemed impossible . 
Yet it is now within reach . 
At a time of intensifying political conflict and painfully few success stories , Colombians are giving the world reason for hope .
