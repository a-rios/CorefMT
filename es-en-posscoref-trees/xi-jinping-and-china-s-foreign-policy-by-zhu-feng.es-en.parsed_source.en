The World According to Xi 
BEIJING - On November 15 Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the CCP &apos;s Central Military Commission , giving him supreme authority over China &apos;s armed forces . 
Next March , he will become President of China as well . 
How does China &apos;s new leader see the world , and how will he handle the country &apos;s foreign policy ? 
Do his style and preferences differ significantly from those of his predecessor , Hu Jintao ? 
The answers will determine China &apos;s relations with the world , and vice versa , for the next decade . 
China &apos;s leaders approach power in a very different way than do political leaders in , say , the United States . 
American politicians must sell their ideas and values to voters ; 
Indeed , with the notable exceptions of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping , China &apos;s leaders have seldom imposed their own personalities upon Chinese diplomacy . 
In this sense , Xi &apos;s leadership style will most likely continue in the tradition of his predecessors . 
Nevertheless , Xi &apos;s outlook and worldview are surely different from Hu &apos;s . 
For starters , Xi is part of a generation raised and educated mostly in China &apos;s reform era , which has been a decisive influence in their lives . 
China opened itself to the world in 1978 , when Xi and his contemporaries were young men eager to understand the world outside China . 
They are a generation inspired by Deng &apos;s realistic approach to shattering the walls that radical leftists had built around China , and one that believes that knowledge can change the destiny of the country and its people . 
When this generation assumes the mantle of leadership , its members will turn their passion and curiosity about knowledge and innovation into real work . 
They are surely willing to learn from the wider world as they seek to promote China &apos;s national interests abroad and encourage gradual change at home . 
Xi may address Chinese diplomacy &apos;s thorniest issues - particularly Sino-US relations - with more realism and flexibility than in recent years . 
His visit to the US in February 2012 was widely regarded as a sequel to Deng &apos;s visit in January 1979 . 
Xi talked to President Barack Obama and visited the Pentagon . 
He gave a luncheon speech and saw old friends from his brief stay in Iowa as a young man . 
He showed interest in American culture , just as Deng did in 1979 . 
He ate chocolate and watched NBA games . 
Most important , instead of spending countless hours drearily discussing political and strategic topics , he spoke directly and vigorously about the current state of Sino-US relations . 
&quot; The Pacific Ocean is wide enough to accommodate the two major countries of China and the US , &quot; he declared . 
Unhappy with America &apos;s &quot; pivot &quot; to Asia , Xi remained calm , but emphasized that &quot; one cannot rely too much on military power regarding Asia-Pacific diplomacy . &quot; 
Similarly , Xi tried to avoid major arguments on human rights , saying simply , &quot; There &apos;s no best , only better . &quot; 
In essence , he sought to demonstrate that however many questions , arguments , and even potential conflicts exist between China and the US , both countries &quot; leaders should address them with an attitude of cooperation and sincerity . 
Leaders should not become entangled in details that fuel suspicion of their counterparts &quot; motives , lest they lose sight of the bigger picture . 
Xi &apos;s confidence extends to China &apos;s domestic politics . 
His generation is more certain of reform than previous leadership cohorts were , owing less to official ideology than to the country &apos;s enormous achievements in the last three decades . 
In practice , Xi may well prove to be a nationalist ; certainly , his generation , like the founding fathers of the People &apos;s Republic , dreams of turning China into a stronger , more prosperous country . 
The country &apos;s new leaders want the world &apos;s applause , but they are more eager for domestic ovations . 
Like previous Chinese leaders , Xi firmly believes that the world should respect China &apos;s authority to manage its own affairs . 
Thus , he is willing to show diplomatic muscle if China is challenged on a core area of concern . 
His speech in Mexico in 2009 demonstrated this . 
&quot; Some foreigners with full bellies and nothing better to do engage in finger-pointing at us , &quot; he said . 
&quot; First , China does not export revolution ; second , it does not export famine and poverty ; and , third , it does not mess around with you . 
So what else is there to say ? &quot; 
Xi understands that the world expects not only a better China , but also a China that is committed to constructing a better world . 
He will be a tough and strong-minded leader , but one who understands the world in a pragmatic way and knows how to work well with his foreign counterparts . 
Indeed , his 2012 visit to the US left two impressions . 
First , he is a leader at ease both in front of and away from the television cameras . 
Second , he is not afraid to have a little fun . 
With those simple touches of humanity , Xi could bring a revolution to China &apos;s diplomacy .
