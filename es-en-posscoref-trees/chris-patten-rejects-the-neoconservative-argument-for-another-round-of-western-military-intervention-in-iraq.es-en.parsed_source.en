Organizing Middle East Peace 
LONDON - In Bertolt Brecht &apos;s great anti-war play , &quot; Mother Courage and Her Children , &quot; one of the characters says , &quot; You know what the trouble with peace is ? 
No organization . &quot; 
The play is set during Europe &apos;s Thirty Years &quot; War , which devastated Europe in the first half of the seventeenth century , ending only with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 . 
The war began as a religious struggle between Protestants and Catholics , but rapidly morphed into a long-running fight between rival countries and dynasties , principally between the Habsburgs and the Holy Roman Empire on one side and Cardinal Richelieu &apos;s France on the other . 
Not surprisingly , some have compared today &apos;s Sunni-Shia conflict , which is consuming swaths of Mesopotamia and Western Asia , to that war , which caused death on a massive scale , plagues , economic destruction , and social turmoil marked , for example , by a wave of witch hunting . 
There had in fact been a peace settlement a half-century before the fighting broke out - an effort to organize peace . 
Emperor Charles V engineered the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 , which was based on an agreement that sovereign states could choose for themselves which version of Christianity to adopt . 
When that treaty fell apart , the killing started . 
What was the &quot; organized peace &quot; that preceded the current bloody turmoil in Iraq , Syria , and elsewhere ? 
The answer depends on how far back one goes . 
As the Ottoman Empire crumbled , the Western powers launched a self-aggrandizing project to redraw the region &apos;s map , installing regimes , creating dependencies , establishing spheres of influence , and securing access to increasingly important supplies of oil . 
Then came a persistent tendency to judge the behavior of states across the Maghreb and the Levant by whether or not they would make diplomatic ( or other ) trouble over Israel &apos;s attitude toward Palestine and the latter &apos;s claim to viable statehood . 
There have also been explicit interventions , from the covert removal of Iran &apos;s democratically elected prime minister , Mohammad Mossadegh , to the more recent military intervention in Iraq , which led to a quarter-million Iraqi deaths . 
But Western countries have been reluctant to face up to the region &apos;s underlying realities , set out in a 2002 report by the United Nations Development Program . 
The Arab scholars and policymakers who drafted the report drew attention to the connections between authoritarian government , economic weakness , high unemployment , and excessively confessional politics . 
The more dictatorial politics in the region became , the more young men - denied both jobs and freedom of expression - turned to extremist and violent Islamism , the perversion of a great faith . 
So here we are today , with the obvious but inadequate answer to the question , &quot; Well , what would you do about it ? &quot; being the Irish farmer &apos;s reply to a traveler &apos;s request for directions : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t start from here . &quot; 
Alas , that is no answer at all , though it may be a useful riposte to those - like former US Vice President Dick Cheney - who advocate a replay of the recent past . 
Denying reality , American and British neoconservatives apparently believe that recent events justify their view that their war of choice in Iraq would have been a great success had there only been more of it . 
But the neocons are not entirely misguided . 
The United States , former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice rightly argued , for too long had pursued &quot; stability at the expense of democracy &quot; ; as a result , it had &quot; achieved neither . &quot; 
That is a powerful argument for not abandoning a long-term commitment to the sort of pluralist values embraced by - among others - the authors of the 2002 report . 
The West has been inconsistent in its application of these principles , has occasionally tried to impose them by force ( with disastrous consequences ) , and has failed to use effectively the money and mechanisms devised to support them . 
Consider , for example , the miserable results of the European Union &apos;s trade and cooperation agreements around the Mediterranean . 
The West must use all of its diplomatic resources to broker an understanding between Iran and Saudi Arabia , the main sponsors of , respectively , Shia and Sunni armed struggle . 
It is not remotely in either country &apos;s interest to see their own region go up in flames . 
These two countries need to start repairing their relations , a prospect ( recently set back ) which seemed a real possibility back in May . 
With American and Turkish help , Iraq should be steered in the direction of a federal state , which recognizes the aspirations of Kurds , Sunni , and Shia . 
In Syria , President Bashar al-Assad remains in office but hardly in power . 
His army is probably winning , but the fighting continues . 
At the moment , the best outlook appears to be that described by the Roman historian Tacitus - &quot; they make a desert , they call it peace . &quot; 
The time is long since past when outsiders could have considered an effective military intervention . 
Finally , we should not ignore the continuing toxicity of the unresolved Israel-Palestine conflict , which continues to feed political extremism and raises serious questions about the West &apos;s commitment to human rights . 
Countries outside of the region face an additional task : the need to discourage young men from going to fight in Islam &apos;s civil war . 
That is a problem for my own country , where it seems that we have not done a good job instilling in some communities an understanding and acceptance of the values that often brought these young men &apos;s parents to the United Kingdom in the first place . 
The agenda for real and lasting peace is long and complex . 
Plans need to be organized , and they will take years to implement . 
Unless we start now , the fires will spread - fanned by politics and religion - and it will not only be Nineveh that is consumed by them .
