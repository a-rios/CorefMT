The Rising Cost of Nature 
A fundamental global trend nowadays is growing natural resource scarcity . 
Oil and natural gas prices have soared in recent years . 
This past year , food prices have also skyrocketed , causing hardships among the poor and large shifts in income between countries and between rural and urban areas . 
The most basic reason for the rise in natural resource prices is strong growth , especially in China and India , which is hitting against the physical limits of land , timber , oil and gas reserves , and water supplies . 
Thus , wherever nature &apos;s goods and services are traded in markets ( as with energy and food ) , prices are rising . 
When they are not traded in markets ( as with clean air ) , the result is pollution and depletion rather than higher prices . 
There are many reasons for the dramatic increase in world food prices , but the starting point is increased food consumption , again strongly powered by China &apos;s economic growth . 
China &apos;s population is eating more , notably more meat , which in turn requires the importation of higher volumes of animal feed made from soybeans and maize . 
Moreover , rising world energy prices has made food production more costly , since it requires large energy inputs for transport , farming , and fertilizers . 
At the same time , rising energy prices create a strong incentive for farmers to switch from food production to fuel production . 
Indeed , in the United States , two billion bushels of maize production out of a total harvest of 12 billion bushels in the 2006-2007 marketing year are being converted into ethanol . 
This is forecast to rise to 3.5 billion bushels in the coming 2007-2008 marketing year , and more than 70 new ethanol plants are under construction , which will double the amount of maize consumed for ethanol production . 
The squeeze on maize supplies for food will only intensify . 
The situation is exacerbated by another basic constraint : climate change . 
During the past two years , a rash of climate-related disasters have hit global wheat supplies . 
Total wheat production fell from 622 million metric tons in the 2005-2006 planting season to an estimated 593 million metric tons in 2006-2007 . 
Each market impacts the others . 
With wheat markets tightening , more land is used for wheat planting , reducing maize or soybean production . 
And , with more maize and soybeans being used for fuels rather than food , the food supply tightens even more . 
The triple threat of rising world demand , conversion of food into fuel , and climate shocks have conspired to push world food prices much higher than anticipated even a couple of years ago . 
So far , there has been no global leadership to start addressing the many implications of these changes . 
One implication , for example , is that the heavy subsidies given in the US for fuel production from maize and soybeans are misguided . 
Another is that the world needs a much more serious cooperative effort to develop long-term environmentally sound technologies to substitute for scarce oil and gas and for fuels produced from farmland . 
Moreover , there is an urgent imperative to raise food productivity in poor countries , especially in Africa , which needs its own &quot; Green Revolution &quot; to double or triple its food production in the coming few years . 
Otherwise , the world &apos;s extreme poor will be hardest hit by the combination of rising world food prices and long-term climate change . 
While commodity prices for food and energy will rise and fall , the underlying crises will likely intensify in the coming years . 
As a result , sustainable development will rise to the top of the world &apos;s agenda . 
We will need leaders who are knowledgeable about the challenges and who are prepared to work cooperatively toward global solutions .
