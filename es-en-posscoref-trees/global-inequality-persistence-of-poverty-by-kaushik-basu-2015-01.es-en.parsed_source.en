The State of Global Poverty 
WASHINGTON , DC - The economic geography of the world is changing . 
The eurozone faces the specter of another round of stagnation ; 
Japan has slipped into recession ; and the United States , despite relatively strong performance in the latter part of 2014 , has raised concerns worldwide with its exit from quantitative easing . 
Meanwhile , emerging economies have continued to perform well . 
India and Indonesia are growing at more than 5 % per year ; 
Malaysia at 6 % ; and China by more than 7 % . 
The scale of the global change can be seen when purchasing power parity ( PPP ) - a measure of the total amount of goods and services that a dollar can buy in each country - is taken into account . 
According to the figures for 2011 , released last year , India is now the world &apos;s third largest economy in terms of PPP-adjusted GDP , ahead of Germany and Japan . 
The data also revealed that China would overtake the US as the world &apos;s largest economy in PPP terms sometime in 2014 - a shift that , according to our estimates , occurred on October 10th . 
Despite this progress , a large proportion of people in developing countries remain desperately poor . 
Globally , the poverty line is defined as a daily income of $ 1.25 , adjusted for PPP - a line that many criticize as shockingly low . 
But what is truly shocking is that nearly one billion people - including more than 80 % of the populations of the Democratic Republic of Congo , Madagascar , Liberia , and Burundi - live below it . 
One reason global poverty has been so intractable is that it remains largely out of sight for those who are not living it , safely somebody else &apos;s problem . 
The fact that most participants in discussions about global poverty - the readers of this commentary included - know few , if any , people who live below the poverty line is an indication of the extent of the world &apos;s economic segregation . 
If poverty were communicable , its incidence would be far lower by now . 
Fortunately , a chorus of voices , not just from civil-society groups , but also from international organizations , has given rise to a global movement to end poverty . 
There is now a growing consensus that global poverty is not just a problem of the poor . 
Though moral outrage is important , it is not enough when it comes to crafting policy . 
Policymakers need data and , equally important , the ability to analyze it . 
The first task is to distinguish between what is feasible and what is not . 
For example , some have proposed including the provision of employment for all adults in the Millennium Development Goals &quot; successor framework , which is to be unveiled this year . 
This is an impossible target . 
All economies of any reasonable size will have some unemployment . 
In fact , a limited amount of unemployment can help to promote development . 
To declare &quot; employment &quot; a right is to divest the word &quot; right &quot; of its meaning . 
Next , there must be recognition that economies are complex and interconnected . 
Consider , for example , a government policy in which subsidies , funded with newly printed money , are handed out to residents of 1,000 villages . 
This will not necessarily be a boon for the economy as a whole . 
Injecting money might improve the living standards in the villages receiving the funds , but doing so may well drive up the cost of food throughout the country , causing residents of non-subsidized villages to fall into poverty . 
The macroeconomic impact of micro-interventions is an important reason why poverty has persisted , despite well-meaning interventions to combat it . 
Another reason poverty endures is persistent - and , in many places , widening - inequality . 
The current level of global inequality is unconscionable . 
To be sure , there will always be a certain amount of inequality in the world ; in fact , as with unemployment , a limited amount is desirable as a driver of competition and growth . 
But the deep and pervasive inequality that exists today can only be condemned . 
According to some back-of-the-envelope calculations , the wealth of the world &apos;s 50 richest people totals $ 1.5 trillion , equivalent to 175 % of Indonesia &apos;s GDP , or a little more than Japan &apos;s foreign-exchange reserves . 
If one assumes that this wealth yields 8 % per year , the annual income of the world &apos;s 50 wealthiest people is close to the total income of the poorest one billion - in other words , those living below the poverty line . 
This is a collective failure . 
As 2015 begins , we must consider policies and interventions to curb such extreme inequality . 
We must do this not only out of a sense of justice , but also because , in a world afflicted with such extreme disparities , its poorest residents lose their voice , even when they have the right to vote . 
Extreme inequality is , ultimately , an assault on democracy .
