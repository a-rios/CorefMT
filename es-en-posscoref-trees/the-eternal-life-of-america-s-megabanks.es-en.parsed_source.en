The Eternal Life of America &apos;s Megabanks 
WASHINGTON , DC - The world economy faces a major problem : the largest banks in the United States remain &quot; too big to fail , &quot; meaning that if one or more of them were in serious trouble , they would be saved by government action - because the consequences of inaction are just too scary . 
This problem is widely acknowledged , not just by officials but by bankers themselves . 
In fact , there is near unanimity that fixing it is a top policy priority . 
Even Jamie Dimon , the powerful head of the very large JP Morgan Chase , emphasizes that &quot; too big to fail &quot; must end . 
Unfortunately , the Obama administration &apos;s proposed approach to ending &quot; too big to fail &quot; - now taken up by the US Congress - will not work . 
The current center of legislative attention is Senator Christopher Dodd &apos;s financial reform bill , which has passed out of the Senate Banking Committee and will presumably soon be debated on the Senate floor . 
Dodd &apos;s bill would create a &quot; resolution authority , &quot; meaning a government agency with the legal power to take over and close down failing financial institutions . 
The bill &apos;s proponents argue that this approach builds on the success of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , which has a long track record of closing down small- and medium-sized banks in the US with minimal disruption and no losses for depositors . 
In this context , &quot; resolution &quot; means that a bank &apos;s managers are fired , shareholders are wiped out , and unsecured creditors can suffer losses . 
Essentially , this is a form of bankruptcy , but with more administrative discretion ( and presumably more protection for depositors ) than would be possible in a court-supervised process . 
Applying this process to large banks and to financial institutions that are not formally banks - and that do not have insured retail deposits - sounds fine on paper . 
But in practice there is an insurmountable difficulty with this approach . 
Think about the critical moment of decision - when a megabank , like JP Morgan Chase ( with a balance sheet of roughly $ 2 trillion ) , may be on the brink of failure . 
You are a senior decision maker - perhaps the Secretary of the Treasury or a key adviser to the US president - for this is the level at which the plug must be pulled . 
You have Senator Dodd &apos;s Resolution Authority and you enter the decisive meeting determined not to save the troubled bank - or , at worst , to save it with a substantial &quot; haircut &quot; ( i.e. , losses ) for unsecured creditors . 
Then someone reminds you that JP Morgan Chase is a complex global financial institution . 
The Dodd Authority allows the US government only to determine the terms of an official takeover within the US . 
The consequences of this combination of uncoordinated responses would be widespread , scary , and bordering on chaos . 
The existence of a US resolution authority does not help contain the damage or limit the panic arising from a big global bank in trouble . 
The failure of such a bank could be managed in a more orderly fashion by using a cross-border resolution authority . 
But there is no such mechanism in place , and there is no chance that one will be created in the near future . 
Responsible policymakers in other G-20 countries are very clear on this point : no one will agree ex ante to a specific way of handling the failure of any global bank . 
At the moment when JP Morgan Chase - or any of America &apos;s six largest banks - fails , the choice will be just like that of September 2008 : do you rescue the bank in question or do you let it fail , and face likely chaos in markets and a potential re-run of the Great Depression ? 
What will the president decide ? 
He or she may have promised , even in public , that creditors would face losses , but on the edge of the precipice , which way will you , the beleaguered adviser , urge the president to go ? 
Will you really argue that the president should leap over the edge , thereby plunging millions of people - their jobs , their homes , and their families - into a financial abyss ? 
Or will you pull back and find some ingenious way to save the bank and protect its creditors using public money or the Federal Reserve or some other emergency power ? 
You will , in all likelihood , step back . 
When the chips are down , it is far less scary to save a megabank than to let it go . 
And of course the credit markets know this , so they lend more cheaply to JP Morgan Chase and other megabanks than to smaller banks that really can fail . 
This enables the bigger banks to get bigger . 
And the bigger they are , the safer creditors become - you see where this goes . 
Senator Dodd &apos;s bill , as currently drafted , will not end &quot; too big to fail . &quot; 
As you can infer from the title of my new book , 13 Bankers : The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown ( co-authored with James Kwak ) , the global consequences will be dire .
