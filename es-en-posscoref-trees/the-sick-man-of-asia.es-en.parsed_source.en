The Sick Man of Asia 
Japan is sick , but once again people are becoming hopeful that it may at long last recover , mostly because a committed reformer named Heizo Takenaka now seems to be running the economic policy . 
But what policymakers and pundits fail to recognise - or refuse to recognise - is that economic policies per se will not reinvigorate Japan . 
Japan &apos;s crisis is systemic , not cyclical . 
Debt , deflation and other maladies are purely symptoms of Japan &apos;s disease . 
The causes are a combination of institutional sclerosis , social anomie and gerontocratic governance . 
For several decades after WWII the Japanese system worked remarkably well , not only in generating growth , but in providing high levels of education , long life expectancy , security , and other welfare benefits to its citizens . 
This system rested on three pillars : a cohesive political-industrial establishment , the mobilisation of resources to achieve national economic ends and America &apos;s defensive shield . 
Almost immediately after defeat in WWII , Japan metamorphosed from being America &apos;s enemy into its pampered protégé . 
This was &quot; real geopolitik &quot; in action . 
The Cold War , the rise of Maoist China , the Korean War all made Japan indispensable to America . 
Not only did the US provide military protection to Japan - allowing Japan to concentrate on industrial goals - but it also provided vast economic assistance , including massive technology transfers and , most important , opening up its market to Japanese exports while allowing Japan to protect its home market . 
Japan developed an &quot; outward looking protectionist &quot; strategy and structure . 
Unlike India or Brazil , which opted for inward-looking protectionism , select sectors of Japanese industry actively participated in international markets . 
Far ranging efforts were deployed to obtain technology transfers . 
The domestic market however was protected by a combination of industrial policy , cartels and a &quot; Buy Japanese &quot; mentality . 
As a &quot; catch-up &quot; strategy , it worked fantastically well . 
By the mid-1980s Japan had more than caught up . 
The September 1985 New York Plaza Hotel meeting of US , European , and Japan &apos;s finance ministers - a meeting where the yen was considerably re-valued - symbolized a new era , and should have set in motion new policies in Japan . 
The problem was that alongside its outward-looking protectionist policy , Japan &apos;s establishment - the national bureaucracy , the ruling Liberal Democratic Party , business , universities , and the media - had fostered a corresponding ideological orthodoxy . 
Instead of evolving as an open , liberal society , Japan had developed a dirigiste closed mercantilist nationalism . 
This was reflected in an aggressive industrial machismo - exports and outward investments reflect virility , in contrast to inward investments and imports - and in various forms of chauvinism , illustrated by the book , The Japan That Can Say &apos; No &apos; , ( 1988 ) co-authored by the current Governor of Tokyo , Shintaro Ishihara , and Sony founder Akio Morita . 
By the late 1980s the world was changing fast , but Japan refused to change . 
The country became characterized by immobility and atavism . 
Japanese institutions were archaic and pursued mistaken economic strategies and structures . 
But the illiberal nationalist ideological ethos that defined Japanese society brooked no genuine debate , let alone heterodox positions . 
Indeed , among Japan &apos;s most moribund institutions are its universities and media . 
Not only was there no new leadership , but the seniority system and the omnipresence of &quot; senior advisors &quot; continued to prevail throughout Japanese institutions . 
This ossification was driven by the rigid , conservative and gerontocratic nature of governance . 
So even as the Japanese tidal wave appeared poised to overwhelm the world economy in the late 1980s - remember &quot; Japan Inc &quot; ? - the country was nearing collapse at home . 
Collapse it did , in 1991 . 
But instead of reacting and adjusting , Japan went into denial and wasted a decade ( and beyond ) spinning its wheels in the sand . 
Policymakers , business leaders , academics and journalists refused to recognize the depth of their country &apos;s problems . 
A day of reckoning came with the Kobe earthquake on 17 January 1995 . 
As thousands died , the government froze , proving itself incapable of mounting an efficient rescue operation and displaying its ludicrous machismo by refusing the assistance of the US 7 th Fleet . 
It was then that the Japanese people realized that &quot; the emperor &quot; ( specifically the government ) had no clothes . 
Today &apos;s deflation arises from the state of anomie in which Japan was plunged in the mid-1990s and from which it has not recovered . 
The Japanese have no confidence in the future because the establishment has lost all credibility and legitimacy . 
Yet that establishment remains doggedly entrenched in power , its mooted reforms little more than cosmetic : &quot; re-arranging of deck chairs on the Titanic-Maru . &quot; 
Strange to say , but the situation may get dramatically worse , not only economically , but also socially . 
The long-suffering Japanese tend to be more patient and disciplined than , say , Argentineans , but when social eruptions have occurred in Japanese history , they have been very violent . 
There is also a strong extremist political minority and a not-too-difficult to tap latent national chauvinism . 
But a different scenario is possible : a reinvigorated , open post-industrial , globally-oriented Japanese society can be established on liberal political foundations . 
Realizing such a scenario will require thorough institutional renewal , rejuvenation of leadership at all levels , a radical change in national &quot; mindset , &quot; and the opening up of Japan &apos;s economy and society to foreign influences and participation . 
The potential is there ; there is a young generation of Japanese who harbour such a vision . 
They need every encouragement , for today &apos;s trends are frightening for Japan , for Asia , and for the world .
