Scary Pictures 
PRAGUE - Campaigners on important but complex issues , annoyed by the length of time required for public deliberations , often react by exaggerating their claims , hoping to force a single solution to the forefront of public debate . 
Last month , there were two examples of this in a single week . 
On September 19 , the French researcher Gilles-Eric Séralini attempted to fuel public opposition to genetically modified foods by showing the public how GM corn , with and without the pesticide Roundup , caused huge tumors and early death in 200 rats that had consumed it over two years . 
Supplying an abundance of pictures of rats with tumors the size of ping-pong balls , Séralini certainly captured the public &apos;s attention . 
France &apos;s health , ecology , and agriculture ministers promised a prompt investigation and threatened to ban imports of Monsanto &apos;s GM corn to the European Union . 
Russia actually did block imports of Monsanto corn . 
But Séralini &apos;s research posed many problematic issues . 
For starters , the Sprague-Dawley strain of rats that he used is naturally prone to tumors . 
Studies of Sprague-Dawley rats show that 88-96 % of those that serve as experimental controls develop tumors before they reach two years of age . 
If the public had seen the similarly grotesque tumors that grow on untreated rats , officials most likely would not have acted so hastily . 
Séralini used only 20 rats as a control group to be fed ordinary corn with no Roundup . 
Of these , five died within two years , which is unusual , because studies of thousands of untreated Sprague-Dawley rats show that about half should have died in that period . 
Using his low death rate as a base , Séralini claimed - with no statistical analysis - that the higher death rate ( just below 40 % ) for the remaining 180 rats fed with GM corn and Roundup was suspicious . 
Moreover , Séralini &apos;s results contradict the latest meta-study of 24 long-term studies ( up to two years and five generations ) , which found that the data do &quot; not suggest any health hazards &quot; and display &quot; no statistically significant differences &quot; between GM and conventional food . 
Oddly , Séralini permitted access to his paper to only a select group of reporters , and demanded that they sign a confidentiality agreement preventing them from interviewing other experts about the research before publication . 
The European Food Safety Authority , for example , has now concluded that the &quot; design , reporting , and analysis of the study , as outlined in the paper , are inadequate . &quot; 
The study was partly funded by CRIIGEN , a group that campaigns against biotechnology . 
CRIIGEN &apos;s scientific board is headed by none other than Séralini , who has also just released a book ( in French ) and a documentary film decrying GM food . 
They enable farmers to produce higher yields with fewer inputs ( such as pesticides ) , so that more food can be produced from existing farmland . 
That , in turn , implies less human encroachment into natural ecosystems , enabling greater biodiversity . 
The Séralini fiasco was only a week old when , on September 26 , the Climate Vulnerability Forum , a group of countries led by Bangladesh , launched the second edition of its Global Vulnerability Monitor . 
Headlines about the launch were truly alarming : Over the next 18 years , global warming would kill 100 million people and cost the economy upwards of $ 6.7 trillion annually . 
These public messages were highly misleading - and clearly intended to shock and disturb . 
The vast majority of deaths discussed in the report did not actually result from global warming . 
Outdoor air pollution - caused by fossil-fuel combustion , not by global warming - contributed to 30 % of all deaths cited in the study . 
In total , the study exaggerated more than 12-fold the number of deaths that could possibly be attributed to climate change , and it more than quadrupled the potential economic costs , simply to grab attention . 
But it will be used as a cudgel by those who claim that electric cars or solar panels - technologies that will make only a marginal contribution , given their huge incremental costs - are the solution to climate change . 
The technologies that can really make a difference quickly and at lower cost are scrubbers that clean smokestack emissions , catalytic converters that reduce tailpipe emissions , and many others . 
By focusing purely on cutting CO2 , we neglect to help many more people , much faster , and less expensively . 
If the Global Vulnerability Monitor &apos;s recommendation to cut back on fossil fuels were taken seriously , the result would be slower economic growth and continued reliance on dung , cardboard , and other low-grade fuels , thereby prolonging the suffering that results from indoor air pollution . 
When confronted with their exaggerations , the authors claimed that &quot; if you reduce hazardous air pollution , it is difficult to not also reduce warming emissions . &quot; 
When scare tactics replace scientific debate , whether about GM crops or climate change , nothing good can come of it . 
We all deserve better .
