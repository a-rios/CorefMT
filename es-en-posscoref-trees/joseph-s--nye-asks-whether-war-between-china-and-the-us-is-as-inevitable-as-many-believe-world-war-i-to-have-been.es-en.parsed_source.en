1914 Revisited ? 
CAMBRIDGE - This year marks the hundredth anniversary of a transformative event of modern history . 
World War I killed some 20 million people and ground up a generation of Europe &apos;s youth . 
It also fundamentally changed the international order in Europe and beyond . 
Indeed , WWI destroyed not only lives , but also three empires in Europe - those of Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Russia - and , with the collapse of Ottoman rule , a fourth on its fringe . 
Until the Great War , the global balance of power was centered in Europe ; after it , the United States and Japan emerged as great powers . 
The war also ushered in the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 , prepared the way for fascism , and intensified and broadened the ideological battles that wracked the twentieth century . 
How could such a catastrophe happen ? 
Shortly after the war broke out , when German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg was asked to explain what happened , he answered , &quot; Oh , if I only knew ! &quot; 
Perhaps in the interest of self-exoneration , he came to regard the war as inevitable . 
Similarly , the British Foreign Minister , Sir Edward Grey , argued that he had &quot; come to think that no human individual could have prevented it . &quot; 
The question we face today is whether it could happen again . 
Margaret MacMillan , author of the interesting new book The War that Ended Peace , argues that , &quot; it is tempting - and sobering - to compare today &apos;s relationship between China and the US with that between Germany and Britain a century ago . &quot; After drawing a similar comparison , The Economist concludes that &quot; the most troubling similarity between 1914 and now is complacency . &quot; 
And some political scientists , such as John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago , have argued that , &quot; to put it bluntly : China cannot rise peacefully . &quot; 
But historical analogies , though sometimes useful for precautionary purposes , become dangerous when they convey a sense of historical inevitability . 
WWI was not inevitable . 
But it was also made more probable by Germany &apos;s fearful response to Russia &apos;s rising power , as well as myriad other factors , including human errors . 
But the gap in overall power between the US and China today is greater than that between Germany and Britain in 1914 . 
Drawing contemporary lessons from 1914 requires dispelling the many myths have been created about WWI . 
For example , the claim that it was a deliberate preventive war by Germany is belied by the evidence showing that key elites did not believe this . 
Nor was WWI a purely accidental war , as others maintain : Austria went to war deliberately , to fend off the threat of rising Slavic nationalism . 
There were miscalculations over the war &apos;s length and depth , but that is not the same as an accidental war . 
But the naval arms race was over by 1912 , and Britain had won . 
While there was concern in Europe about the growing strength of armies , the view that the war was precipitated directly by the arms race is facile . 
Today &apos;s world is different from the world of 1914 in several important ways . 
One is that nuclear weapons give political leaders the equivalent of a crystal ball that shows what their world would look like after escalation . 
Perhaps if the Emperor , the Kaiser , and the Czar had had a crystal ball showing their empires destroyed and their thrones lost in 1918 , they would have been more prudent in 1914 . 
Certainly , the crystal-ball effect had a strong influence on US and Soviet leaders during the Cuban missile crisis . 
It would likely have a similar influence on US and Chinese leaders today . 
Another difference is that the ideology of war is much weaker nowadays . 
In 1914 , war really was thought to be inevitable , a fatalistic view reinforced by the Social Darwinist argument that war should be welcomed , because it would &quot; clear the air &quot; like a good summer storm . 
As Winston Churchill wrote in The World Crisis : 
&quot; There was a strange temper in the air . 
Unsatisfied by material prosperity , the nations turned fiercely toward strife , internal or external . 
National passions , unduly exalted in the decline of religion , burned beneath the surface of nearly every land with fierce , if shrouded , fires . 
Almost one might think the world wished to suffer . 
To be sure , nationalism is growing in China today , while the US launched two wars after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . 
China aspires to play a larger role in its region , and the US has regional allies to whose defense it is committed . 
Miscalculations are always possible , but the risk can be minimized by the right policy choices . 
Indeed , on many issues - for example , energy , climate change , and financial stability - China and the US have strong incentives to cooperate . 
Moreover , whereas Germany in 1914 was pressing hard on Britain &apos;s heels ( and had surpassed it in terms of industrial strength ) , the US remains decades ahead of China in overall military , economic , and soft-power resources . 
Too adventuresome a policy would jeopardize China &apos;s gains at home and abroad . 
In other words , the US has more time to manage its relations with a rising power than Britain did a century ago . 
Whether the US and China will manage their relationship well is another question . 
But how they do so will be dictated by human choice , not some ironclad historical law . 
Among the lessons to be learned from the events of 1914 is to be wary of analysts wielding historical analogies , particularly if they have a whiff of inevitability . 
War is never inevitable , though the belief that it is can become one of its causes .
