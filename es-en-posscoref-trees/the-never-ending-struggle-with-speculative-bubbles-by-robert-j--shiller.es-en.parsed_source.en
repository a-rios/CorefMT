Bubbles Forever 
NEW HAVEN - You might think that we have been living in a post-bubble world since the collapse in 2006 of the biggest-ever worldwide real-estate bubble and the end of a major worldwide stock-market bubble the following year . 
But talk of bubbles keeps reappearing - new or continuing housing bubbles in many countries , a new global stock-market bubble , a long-term bond-market bubble in the United States and other countries , an oil-price bubble , a gold bubble , and so on . 
Nevertheless , I was not expecting a bubble story when I visited Colombia last month . 
But , once again , people there told me about an ongoing real-estate bubble , and my driver showed me around the seaside resort town of Cartagena , pointing out , with a tone of amazement , several homes that had recently sold for millions of dollars . 
The Banco de la República , Colombia &apos;s central bank , maintains a home price index for three main cities - Bogotá , Medellín , and Cali . 
The index has risen 69 % in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms since 2004 , with most of the increase coming after 2007 . 
That rate of price growth recalls the US experience , with the S &amp; P / Case-Shiller Ten-City Home Price Index for the US rising 131 % in real terms from its bottom in 1997 to its peak in 2006 . 
This raises the question : just what is a speculative bubble ? 
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a bubble as &quot; anything fragile , unsubstantial , empty , or worthless ; a deceptive show . 
From 17th c. onwards often applied to delusive commercial or financial schemes . &quot; 
The problem is that words like &quot; show &quot; and &quot; scheme &quot; suggest a deliberate creation , rather than a widespread social phenomenon that is not directed by any impresario . 
Maybe the word bubble is used too carelessly . 
Eugene Fama certainly thinks so . 
Fama , the most important proponent of the &quot; efficient markets hypothesis , &quot; denies that bubbles exist . 
As he put it in a 2010 interview with John Cassidy for The New Yorker , &quot; I don &apos;t even know what a bubble means . 
These words have become popular . 
I don &apos;t think they have any meaning . &quot; 
In the second edition of my book Irrational Exuberance , I tried to give a better definition of a bubble . 
A &quot; speculative bubble , &quot; I wrote then , is &quot; a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm , which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person , in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increase . &quot; 
This attracts &quot; a larger and larger class of investors , who , despite doubts about the real value of the investment , are drawn to it partly through envy of others &quot; successes and partly through a gambler &apos;s excitement . &quot; 
That seems to be the core of the meaning of the word as it is most consistently used . 
Implicit in this definition is a suggestion about why it is so difficult for &quot; smart money &quot; to profit by betting against bubbles : the psychological contagion promotes a mindset that justifies the price increases , so that participation in the bubble might be called almost rational . 
But it is not rational . 
The story in every country is different , reflecting its own news , which does not always jibe with news in other countries . 
For example , the current story in Colombia appears to be that the country &apos;s government , now under the well-regarded management of President Juan Manuel Santos , has brought down inflation and interest rates to developed-country levels , while all but eliminating the threat posed by the FARC rebels , thereby injecting new vitality into the Colombian economy . 
That is a good enough story to drive a housing bubble . 
Because bubbles are essentially social-psychological phenomena , they are , by their very nature , difficult to control . 
Regulatory action since the financial crisis might diminish bubbles in the future . 
But public fear of bubbles may also enhance psychological contagion , fueling even more self-fulfilling prophecies . 
One problem with the word bubble is that it creates a mental picture of an expanding soap bubble , which is destined to pop suddenly and irrevocably . 
But speculative bubbles are not so easily ended ; indeed , they may deflate somewhat , as the story changes , and then reflate . 
It would seem more accurate to refer to these episodes as speculative epidemics . 
We know from influenza that a new epidemic can suddenly appear just as an older one is fading , if a new form of the virus appears , or if some environmental factor increases the contagion rate . 
Similarly , a new speculative bubble can appear anywhere if a new story about the economy appears , and if it has enough narrative strength to spark a new contagion of investor thinking . 
This is what happened in the bull market of the 1920 &quot; s in the US , with the peak in 1929 . 
We have distorted that history by thinking of bubbles as a period of dramatic price growth , followed by a sudden turning point and a major and definitive crash . 
In fact , a major boom in real stock prices in the US after &quot; Black Tuesday &quot; brought them halfway back to 1929 levels by 1930 . 
This was followed by a second crash , another boom from 1932 to 1937 , and a third crash . 
Speculative bubbles do not end like a short story , novel , or play . 
There is no final denouement that brings all the strands of a narrative into an impressive final conclusion . 
In the real world , we never know when the story is over .
