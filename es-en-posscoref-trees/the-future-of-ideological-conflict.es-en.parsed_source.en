The Future of Ideological Conflict 
WARWICK - The just-concluded French presidential election seemed to suggest that the old left-right divisions are as potent as they have ever been - and certainly in their birthplace . 
But are they ? 
The modern political spectrum is an artifact of the seating arrangements at the French National Assembly after the revolution of 1789 . 
To the right of the Assembly &apos;s president sat the supporters of King and Church , while to the left sat their opponents , whose only point of agreement was the need for institutional reform . 
The distinction capitalized on long-standing cultural associations of right- and left-handedness with , respectively , trust and suspicion - in this case , of the status quo . 
In retrospect , it is remarkable that this distinction managed to define partisan political allegiances for more than 200 years , absorbing both the great reactionary and radical movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . 
But the decline in voter turnout in most of today &apos;s democracies suggests that this way of conceptualizing ideological differences may have become obsolete . 
Some have even argued that ideologies and parties are irrelevant in an increasingly fragmented political landscape . 
But one division that looms on the horizon could reinvent the right-left distinction for the twenty-first century : precautionary versus &quot; proactionary &quot; attitudes toward risk as principles of policymaking . 
In social psychological terms , precautionary policymakers set their regulatory focus on the prevention of worst outcomes , whereas proactionary policymakers seek the promotion of the best available opportunities . 
The precautionary principle is the better known of the two , and increasingly figures in environmental and health legislation . 
It is normally understood as the Hippocratic Oath applied to the global ecology : above all , do no harm . 
By contrast , the proactionary principle is associated with self-styled futurists , for whom being &quot; human &quot; is defined by our capacity to keep ahead of the game when taking calculated risks , whether by benefiting from success or learning from failure . 
The difference between the two principles is most clearly apparent in their implications for the relationship between science and technology . 
Precautionary policymakers invoke scientific uncertainty to curb technological innovation , whereas their proactionary counterparts encourage innovation as an extension of scientific hypothesis testing . 
They also differ subtly over their conception of humans . 
Precautionary types aspire to a &quot; sustainable &quot; humanity , which invariably means bringing fewer of us into existence , with each of us making less of an impact on the planet . 
Those with a proactionary bent are happy to increase the planet &apos;s human population indefinitely as nothing more or less than a series of experiments in living , regardless of outcomes . 
Not surprisingly , conventional political and business leaders are not entirely comfortable with either group . 
After all , precautionary policymakers would have business value conservation over growth , while the proactionary camp would have the state encourage people to transcend current norms rather than adhere to them . 
A precautionary firm would look like a miniature version of today &apos;s regulatory state , whereas a proactionary state would operate like a venture capitalist writ large . 
But perhaps most conspicuously absent from both precautionary and proactionary thinking is the old welfare-state ideal - that we might procreate at will in a world where our offspring are assured a secure existence . 
For all of their substantial disagreements , both sides dismiss this prospect as a twentieth-century fantasy that was only temporarily realized in Northern Europe for a few decades after World War II . 
Lurking behind this dismissal is a sense that humanity itself is undergoing a massive transformation in its self-understanding . 
Precautionary types would reacquaint us with our humble animal origins , from which we have strayed for much too long , whereas exponents of the proactionary principle would expedite our departure from our evolutionary past . 
To be sure , the precautionary and proactionary principles remain relatively marginal to mainstream political discourse . 
But they have the potential to shift the ideological axis by 90 degrees . 
The right is currently divided into traditionalists and libertarians ; the left into communitarians and technocrats . 
In the future , I suggest , the traditionalists and the communitarians will form the precautionary pole of the political spectrum , while the libertarians and technocrats will form the proactionary pole . 
These will be the new right and left - or , rather , down and up . 
One group will be grounded in the earth , while the other looks toward the heavens .
