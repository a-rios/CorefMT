From Gaza to Where ? 
CANBERRA - The wisest words on the Second Gaza War may have come from an Israeli living in a kibbutz near the Gaza border . 
&quot; If you want to defend me ... Don &apos;t send the Israel Defense Forces for us in order to &quot; win , &quot; &quot; Michal Vasser wrote in Haaretz on November 15 . 
&quot; Start thinking about the long term and not just about the next election . 
Try to negotiate until white smoke comes up through the chimney . 
Hold out a hand to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas . 
Stop with the &quot; pinpoint assassinations &quot; and look into the civilians &quot; eyes on the other side as well . &quot; 
Israel is , of course , entitled to defend itself from rocket attacks . 
The chances of a comprehensive and sustainable two-state settlement now being negotiated with Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s West Bank-based Palestinian Authority ( PA ) - and of its acceptance , albeit grudgingly , by Gaza &apos;s Hamas after a popular vote - may be slim and receding . 
The immediate priority is to calm and stabilize the situation in Gaza . 
How is peace fostered if the elimination or dramatic diminution of Hamas &apos;s capability leaves Gaza in the hands of even more militant groups , and gives Islamists throughout the region another recruitment tool ? 
How is Israel &apos;s national security served when , by its action in Gaza and inaction with Abbas , it jeopardizes its longstanding and hard-won peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan ( both now looking very fragile indeed in the aftermath of the Arab Spring ) ? 
How can Israel &apos;s preferred Palestinian leaders , Abbas and PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , be left with any credible capacity to negotiate if talks cannot begin until , as Israel insists , they retreat on their minimum condition of a settlement freeze in the Occupied Territories ? 
For all that Israel downplays its significance , the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 still offers a critically important deal : full normalization of relations by the entire Arab world in exchange for a comprehensive peace settlement . 
How long can this Arab League position be sustained with peace talks going nowhere ? 
Another big question for Israel is whether it can accept the consequences if a two-state solution disappears completely from the agenda . 
Israel , as founding father David Ben-Gurion warned , can be a Jewish state , it can be a democratic state , and it can be a state occupying the whole of historical Israel ; but it cannot be all three . 
According to the CIA World Factbook , Jews currently outnumber non-Jews , by 6.4 million to 5.6 million , in the total area of historical Palestine . 
With Gaza still smoldering , yet another burning question is waiting in the wings . 
What are Israel and its supporters supposed to gain by bitterly resisting the United Nations General Assembly resolution recognizing Palestine as a non-member &quot; observer state &quot; ( with a status like the Vatican ) , which now seems bound to be introduced , and passed by a huge international majority , on or around November 29 ? 
The text of the draft resolution now in circulation contains no offensive language . 
It makes clear both that full UN membership remains to be determined and that final-status issues like borders , refugees , Jerusalem , and security all remain to be negotiated . 
True , passage of this resolution might give Palestine some standing that it now lacks to seek prosecutions in the International Criminal Court for alleged violations of international law . 
Palestinian statehood has always been an indispensable requirement of Israel &apos;s own long-term peace and security , and it is overwhelmingly in Israel &apos;s interest to defuse rather than further inflame the issue . 
In short , Israel should treat the UN vote not as an excuse for renewed confrontation , but as an opportunity for a fresh start to serious negotiations . 
The US reaction is key : Rather than punishing the PA , and maybe the UN as well , it should use the resolution to propose the kind of diplomatic circuit-breaker for which the world has long been hoping . 
Of course , to put on the table a comprehensive settlement plan that addresses all of the final-status issues , with compromises that all sides could be persuaded and pressured to accept , would require statesmanship . 
Unhappily , that quality has been agonizingly absent from Middle East diplomacy for almost as long as anyone can remember .
