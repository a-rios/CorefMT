Time for America to Turn South 
Whatever John Kerry does about Latin America if he is elected President of the United States in November , the election could initiate a sea-change in US-Latin American relations - even or perhaps mainly if George W. Bush is reelected . 
Kerry has never shown much interest in the region , while Bush has largely ignored it since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
But the unlikely nature of a shift in relations does not make it any less necessary . 
The need for change in America &apos;s policy toward the rest of the hemisphere is two-fold . 
First , never in recent times has anti-American sentiment run so strong and deep in Latin America . 
Poll after poll shows that Latins feel more negatively about the US than at any time since the 1960 &apos;s . 
In contrast to that era , popular hostility is not really motivated by US actions in or toward Latin America ; but today &apos;s anti-Americanism still complicates life greatly for democratic leaders in the hemisphere , and for America itself . 
Second , and more importantly , the substantive issues of conflict on the US-Latin American agenda are heating up . 
They will not go away by themselves , and failure to address them will probably only make them worse . 
The list of problems facing Latin America is long , but the salient themes are easily distinguishable . 
First and foremost is economic growth , which for the past few years - indeed , for the past two decades - has been dismal . 
In countries where trade and investment is concentrated in ties with the US , this is a central issue in the bilateral relationship . 
At this stage , we know that free-trade agreements are useful , but are not silver bullets . 
The US has a much larger role to play than simply promoting trade liberalization in the region . 
The US must help these countries build up their infrastructure , educational and legal systems , competitiveness , and transparency . 
In all these areas , a pro-active policy of American support is crucial . 
Why should the US bother ? 
Why should it care whether Latin American countries closely linked to it by trade , investment , tourism , and retirees do better or worse , grow or stagnate , become more competitive or lose ground globally ? 
There are many reasons for the US to pay greater attention to Latin America , but three stand out . 
First , and perhaps least self-evident , is energy . 
Countries like Mexico , Venezuela , and Colombia supply up to 40 % of US oil imports , and could easily replace unstable suppliers in the Middle East . 
Second , America has a strong security interest in the region . 
Access to the US from many countries in Latin America is much easier than from Europe or Asia , owing to the volume of traffic , the number of flights , the comparative laxity of exit controls , and the porousness of borders . 
If the US , as its leaders clearly believe , will be threatened for years to come by terrorist groups , the latter will inevitably conclude , as millions have done before , that the easiest way into the US is through Latin America . 
Cooperation on security matters is desirable for America , and indispensable for the countries of the region . 
The consequences of a new terrorist outrage originating from any nation south of the US-Mexican border would be devastating for that country , let alone for the victims of such an attack . 
But the most significant issue coming to the fore in hemispheric relations is immigration . 
Traditionally a Mexican , Central American , and Caribbean matter , it has now reached Brazil , Colombia , Venezuela , Ecuador , and beyond . 
Every flight from Sao Paulo to Mexico City carries dozens of low-income Brazilians , who have already paid their pollero , or &quot; people-smuggler , &quot; to route them on from the Mexican capital to the northern border . 
The New York Times recently published an exceptional description of Ecuadorian polleros transporting their human cargo to the coasts of Guatemala and then onward through Mexico to the US . 
Colombian displaced persons and Venezuela &apos;s middle class are fleeing to Miami . 
Most dramatically , more Mexicans than ever before are risking their lives and paying up to $ 3,000 to enter the &quot; promised land . &quot; 
Last year , I visited the main jumping-off point on the US-Mexican border : El Sasabe on the Sonora-Arizona border . 
In the month of May , before the summer &apos;s searing and deadly heat , local authorities estimated a daily average of 1,000 migrants attempting to cross . 
Another visit this year generated a new estimate : from 1,500 to 1,800 crossings every day . 
America cannot stem this tide by closing its borders ; but it can regulate the tide by legalizing and humanizing it , and by helping to create conditions in Latin America where life-threatening emigration is not the only way out . 
A first-term Kerry administration or a second-term Bush presidency must make this a high foreign policy priority . 
All of these issues are crucial to the US : jobs , immigration , security , energy . 
But Latin America is deeply troubled ; it needs decisive , bold leadership at home and imaginative , unwavering support abroad . 
Bush or Kerry - both can deliver the foreign support . 
It is in America &apos;s interest that they do .
