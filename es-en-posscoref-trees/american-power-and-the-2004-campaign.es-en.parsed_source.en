American Power and the 2004 Campaign 
America &apos;s presidential election campaign is heating up , and with it the debate about American power . 
A year ago , after the blitz victory in the four-week Iraq War , many people thought the issue was settled . 
It is hard to recall , but a little over a decade ago , conventional wisdom - both inside and outside the US - held that America was in decline . 
In 1992 , the winner of the New Hampshire primary election argued that &quot; the Cold War is over - and Japan won . &quot; 
When I published Bound to Lead in 1990 , I predicted the continuing rise of American power . 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union , some analysts described the resulting world as unipolar and saw few constraints on American power . 
This is misleading . 
Power in a global information age is distributed among countries in a pattern that resembles a complex three-dimensional chess game . 
On the top chessboard , military power is largely unipolar . 
The US is the only country with large state of the art air , naval , and ground forces capable of global deployment - thus , the quick victory in Iraq last year . 
On this economic board , other countries often balance American power . 
The bottom chessboard is the realm of transnational relations that cross borders beyond government control . 
At the benign end of the spectrum , this realm includes actors as diverse as bankers electronically transferring huge sums ; at the other end are terrorists transferring weapons or hackers disrupting Internet operations . 
On this bottom board , power is widely dispersed , and it makes no sense to speak of unipolarity , multipolarity , or hegemony . 
Those who recommend a unilateral American foreign policy based on such traditional descriptions of American power are relying on a woefully inadequate analysis . 
Many of the real challenges to American power are coming not on the upper military board , on which the unilateralists concentrate , but on the lower transnational board . 
Ironically , the temptation to go it alone may ultimately weaken the US in this domain . 
Why is this true ? 
Today &apos;s information revolution and the type of globalization that accompanies it are transforming and shrinking the world . 
At the beginning of the 21st century , these two forces increased American power , particularly the ability to influence others through attractive , or what I call &quot; soft &quot; power . 
But with time , technological gains will spread to other countries and peoples , diminishing America &apos;s relative pre-eminence . 
But in a decade or two , Chinese may become the language of the largest number of Internet users . 
It will not dethrone English as a lingua franca , but at some point , the Asian market will loom larger than the American market . 
Many organizations will have soft power of their own as they attract citizens into coalitions that cut across national boundaries . 
The terrorist attacks on New York , Washington , and now Madrid are terrible symptoms of the deep changes already occurring . 
Technology has been diffusing power away from governments , and empowering individuals and groups to play roles in world politics - including wreaking massive destruction - that were once reserved to governments . 
Privatization has been the leitmotif in economic policy in recent years , but in politics the privatization of war is terrorism . 
Moreover , as globalization shrinks distance , events in faraway places - like Afghanistan - have a greater impact on everyone &apos;s lives . 
The world has moved from the Cold War to the Global Information Age , but the dominant foreign policy paradigms have not kept pace . 
Today &apos;s growing global networks of interdependence are putting new items on national and international agendas ; 
International financial stability is vital to prosperity , but the US needs the cooperation of others to ensure it . 
In a world where borders are becoming more porous than ever to everything from drugs to infectious diseases to terrorism , Americans will be forced to work with other countries beyond their borders . 
Because of its leading edge in the information revolution , and its vast investment in traditional power resources , the US will remain the world &apos;s single most powerful country well into this new century . 
While potential coalitions to check American power may be created , it is unlikely that they will become firm alliances unless the US handles its hard coercive power in an overbearing unilateral manner that undermines its &quot; soft &quot; or attractive power .
