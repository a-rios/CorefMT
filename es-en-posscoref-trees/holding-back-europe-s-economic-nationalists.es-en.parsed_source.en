Holding Back Europe &apos;s Economic Nationalists 
PARIS - The German and French governments have been scrambling to save their automobile and truck industries though big fiscal injections , making it clear that , within much of the European Union , industrial policy has returned with a vengeance . 
But , throughout last year , French , German , and other EU leaders worked against rather than with each other when putting their policies in place . 
As a result , some European industries got undue protection , while others were squeezed out of the market . 
The lesson is clear : European governments must work together when implementing industrial policy . 
But they also need to do much more to promote innovation and competitiveness . 
The French and German governments intervened last year with capital injections to replace deserting shareholders . 
They buttressed weakening demand by subsidizing sales , stimulating research into cleaner technologies , and protecting jobs . 
These recovery schemes put national interests first , using the argument that taxpayers &quot; money must be used to defend the nation &apos;s companies and workers . 
The French authorities have now taken this approach a step further with the creation of a Fonds strat√©gique d &apos;investissement ( FSI ) , which aims to protect domestic capital from the predatory designs of foreign investors . 
This wholesale return to the industrial policies of yesteryear , and governments &quot; reluctance to let even uncompetitive companies fail , should be cause for widespread concern . 
Judging by governments &quot; reactions to the crisis , one could be forgiven for thinking that market regulators and competition authorities should take the lead when an economy is stable , and that industrial policies should be implemented in times of emergency . 
Unfortunately , European governments did not respond to the crisis with common policies , nor did they seize the opportunity to strengthen the powers of eurozone authorities . 
Instead , each EU member state opted to fend for itself . 
The member states &quot; common arsenal of interventionist tools - deposit guarantees , re-capitalization of banks , guarantees for inter-bank loans , and purchases of toxic assets - seemed to give credence to the notion of European unity . 
But the reality turned out to be very different ; member states &quot; interventionist measures have in fact created distortions and irregularities up and down the Continent . 
On bank re-capitalizations , some countries adopted the more punitive approach of quasi-nationalization , while others lent public bailout funds on very advantageous terms , linking re-capitalization to the development of credit or the restriction of dividends . 
The net result was a hodgepodge of fragmented and re-nationalized financial systems . 
National competition authorities in countries like Britain were silenced . 
France and the Benelux countries had to bail out Fortis and Dexia , owing to the lack of any European mechanism for saving integrated financial companies . 
To try and ease the harm that all this assistance was doing to EU competitiveness , the European Commission &apos;s Directorate General for Competition warned that it had little option but to block state aids - but then quickly capitulated to vociferous national protests . 
Europe should have used its regulatory power and managed the conflict between systemic and competitive risk that all this emergency public funding was generating , but the competition watchdog &apos;s contradictory request that companies receiving funding should reduce credit to their clients made this well nigh impossible . 
The Commission &apos;s handling of the GM Europe issue was an excellent example of industrial intervention . 
Initially , the Commission gave the German government free rein , but instead of assisting Opel , Berlin sought to protect German jobs by supporting Magna , the prospective Canadian-Russian buyer , even though this placed Opel &apos;s Belgian and British workforces at risk of job losses . 
The Commission &apos;s competition lawyers announced that they would look into all national clauses , but GM &apos;s recovery and the slow implementation of the German scheme ended up undermining the Magna solution . 
Then , after last October &apos;s German elections , the incoming government withdrew support from Magna . 
Thus , the Commission was able - even before it was officially asked to intervene - to preempt measures that were contrary to single-market logic . 
The difficulties that EU governments face in managing the financial crisis are raising serious questions about whether national industrial policy and the Union &apos;s competition rules can co-exist . 
They probably can , but only if Europeans give up the political directives of yesteryear and instead promote innovation and more competitive environmental policies . 
The global economic crisis , together with the growth of emerging markets , is putting Europe &apos;s longstanding overcapacity problems firmly in the spotlight . 
To prevent the EU &apos;s single market from going bust , national policymakers must implement industrial restructuring policies in tandem . 
This is particularly true of the automobile sector . 
The Davignon &quot; manifest crisis &quot; cartels , which once helped manage the European steel industry &apos;s decline , urgently need to be revived . 
If the European authorities do not move to address overcapacity in the automotive sector , we will surely see a revival of protectionism .
