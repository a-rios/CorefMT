The Children &apos;s Revolution 
LONDON - Two tragic and haunting images have emerged this year : hooded Islamic State executioners holding their knives to the necks of innocent victims , and masked medical workers bravely fighting an uphill battle against an Ebola outbreak for which the world was not prepared . 
These children have joined the ranks of 25 million displaced boys and girls worldwide - a number equivalent to the population of a midsize European country and the largest in the 70 years since the end of World War II . 
Images of vulnerable , desolate refugee children - likely to be displaced for a decade or more - have become so common that the world seems unable to comprehend what it is seeing . 
But the plight of child refugees is only one reason why a new approach to children &apos;s rights is needed . 
This year , an estimated 15 million school-age girls will become child brides , forced into marriage against their will . 
Some 14 million boys and girls below the age of 14 are child laborers , many forced to work in the most hazardous of conditions . 
In the 1950s , the fight against colonialism dominated world politics . 
In the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s , great civil-rights battles were waged against racial discrimination and apartheid , followed by struggles to advance the rights of the disabled and sexual minorities . 
It is our generation &apos;s task to tackle the civil-rights movement &apos;s unfinished business , by ending the exploitation of children , especially girls , and ensuring compulsory universal education . 
To mark the 25th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) , I , along with this year &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize winner , Kailash Satyarthi , and the head of the United Kingdom &apos;s Overseas Development Institute , Kevin Watkins , am calling on the world community to offer practical support to the burgeoning civil-rights struggle of young people . 
We can do more to end child labor , child marriage , child trafficking , and discrimination against girls , by not only demanding the proper policing of domestic laws , but also by establishing a new International Children &apos;s Court , buttressed by a credible reporting and sanctions system . 
Violations of children &apos;s rights are now so rampant that there simply is no alternative . 
Indeed , though no human-rights treaty has been more widely ratified than the CRC , which requires governments to report on their compliance once every five years , its work lacks adequate resources and enforcement . 
Only one in seven countries submit compliance reports on time , and one-third do not submit even a year late . 
Meanwhile , the scantly funded offices that manage the information have a two-year backlog . 
Another promising initiative - the &quot; optional protocol on communications , &quot; aimed at enabling children and their advocates , for the first time , to bring cases before the UN Human Rights Committee - has been similarly weakened by a lack of strong support , authority , and resources . 
Indeed , only 14 countries have ratified the protocol since it was agreed in 2011 . 
Moreover , states are not legally bound to change the policies or laws that are deemed to be violating their international human-rights obligations . 
So there is a case not only for an International Children &apos;s Court , but also for children and their representatives to be granted the right to petition it . 
Such a court should have the capacity to receive and investigate individual complaints , the power to monitor independently the enforcement of laws , and the resources to devote to investigations into relevant areas , including child labor , child marriage , child slavery , genital mutilation , and child rape . 
Over time , a reporting system could be implemented to facilitate an examination of the impact of health and education policies on the world &apos;s most marginalized boys and girls . 
Such research could provide compelling evidence to support compulsory universal education as the ideal mechanism not just for ending educational exclusion , but also for bringing an end to child labor and trafficking , early marriage , and discrimination against girls . 
Another advance could follow , based on Gra√ßa Machel &apos;s victory a decade ago in convincing the UN Security Council to implement a system for reporting violence against children in conflict zones . 
At the time , it was agreed that a Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict , whose work is backed by the threat of sanctions , would also be established . 
Today , a similar post - underpinned by the same system of reporting and sanctions - should be created to focus on children &apos;s other rights . 
Next month , Satyarthi and the girls &quot; -rights leader Malala Yousafzai will receive this year &apos;s Nobel Peace Prize , reminding the world that a children &apos;s-rights struggle is underway - one that is increasingly being led by young people . 
Indeed , frustrated with adults &quot; failure to discharge what should be their duties toward children , young people are forming child-marriage-free zones , launching anti-slavery groups , and organizing education-rights campaigns . 
Such initiatives - including Bangladesh &apos;s 20 child marriage-free zones , Nepal &apos;s Kamlari Forum , and Ethiopia &apos;s Yellow Movement of university students - may not yet be trending on Twitter and Facebook , but they are engaging millions of young people worldwide . 
Now , the Global March Against Child Labor and A World at School have come together to support the # UpForSchool petition , which links the universal provision of education to ending child exploitation . 
Over the next several months , youth groups in 190 countries will be collecting , it is hoped , a record number of signatures . 
But we must do more than read and sign the petition . 
We must recognize that today &apos;s movement to ensure children &apos;s rights is the civil-rights struggle of our generation - and do whatever it takes to support it .
