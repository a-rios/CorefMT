The Bankrupt Theology of Financial Deregulation 
GENEVA - Now that the global financial crisis is abating , it is time to take stock of our mistakes and ensure that they are not repeated . 
Beyond regulatory improvements , preventing payment incentives from rewarding reckless risk taking , and building Chinese walls between originators of securities and rating agencies , we need to discover what made this crisis so difficult to predict . 
The International Monetary Fund is our global watchdog , and many believe that it failed to foresee the crisis because it was distracted or looking in the wrong places . 
I disagree . 
The problem is that the IMF was unable to interpret the evidence with which it was confronted . 
I served on the IMF Board in June 2006 when it discussed its annual review of the United States . 
The staff &quot; saw &quot; the relaxation of lending standards in the US mortgage market , but noted that &quot; borrowers at risk of significant mortgage payment increases remained a small minority , concentrated mostly among higher-income households that were aware of the attendant risks . &quot; 
A few months later , in September 2006 , just ten months before the sub-prime mortgage crisis became apparent to all , the Global Financial Stability Report ( GFSR ) , one of the IMF &apos;s flagship publications , stated that &quot; &#91; m &#93; ajor financial institutions in mature ... markets &#91; were &#93; ... healthy , having remained profitable and well capitalized . &quot; 
Moreover , &quot; the financial sectors in many countries &quot; were supposedly &quot; in a strong position to cope with any cyclical challenges and further market corrections to come . &quot; 
The IMF &apos;s radar started blinking only in April 2007 , virtually when the problem was already hitting its windshield , but still with little sense of urgency . 
Clearly the Fund &apos;s surveillance of the US economy was ineffective , and its multilateral surveillance of financial markets no better . 
Admittedly , the IMF was not alone in failing to interpret the underlying facts that triggered the crisis , but that is little consolation . 
Before the crisis , the IMF &apos;s best-known function - lending to countries with balance-of-payment problems - was becoming irrelevant . 
Many emerging markets preferred to self-insure by accumulating reserves rather than borrow from the Fund . 
Ironically , this was leading the IMF to focus on its supervisory role . 
So , in searching for the causes of the IMF &apos;s failure , we can rule out distraction by more urgent matters . 
The Fund normally expects that problems come from the usual suspects - economically volatile developing countries - but this time the crisis was developing a few miles away from its headquarters . 
Perhaps this proximity was at the root of the IMF &apos;s failure to interpret the evidence right under its nose . 
If so , it is a failure that raises two key questions . 
First , is the Fund &apos;s governance structure suited to exercising arms-length surveillance of its main shareholders ? 
And , second , did ideological blinders prevent the IMF from acknowledging that deregulation could contribute to a disastrous outcome ? 
It is inconceivable that the Fund , with its qualified and dedicated staff , would have failed so miserably in detecting and calling attention to the vulnerabilities piling up in the US mortgage market had they occurred in a developing country . 
But power in the IMF currently follows the logic of its lending role . 
The more money a country puts into the pool of resources , the more influence it gets . 
I , for one , am not happy with the way in which &quot; quotas &quot; to the IMF are calculated , but I have to admit that exchanging money for votes is a perfectly adequate governing structure for a lending institution . 
But it is not adequate for an institution that is meant to exercise arms-length surveillance of its members - particularly its most influential member , whose domestic policies have global systemic implications . 
That &quot; money-for-influence &quot; governance structure indirectly impairs the Fund &apos;s capacity to criticize its most important members &quot; economies ( let alone police compliance with their obligations ) . 
And , as I have witnessed several times , if the IMF staff ever do become too candid in their criticism of powerful members , the target governments use their leverage to water down the public communiqu√©s issued by the Board . 
Let us now consider the second question - whether the Fund suffered from a mindset that blinded it to the causes of what was happening . 
As early as August 2005 , Raghuram Rajan , the IMF &apos;s Economic Counselor ( chief economist ) at the time , was warning of weaknesses in the US financial markets . 
Rajan saw that something potentially dangerous was happening , warning that competition forces were pushing financial markets &quot; to flirt continuously with the limits of illiquidity &quot; and concealing risks from investors in order to outperform competitors . 
Perhaps most revealingly , though , Rajan nonetheless optimistically argued that &quot; &#91; d &#93; eregulation has removed artificial barriers preventing entry of new firms , and has encouraged competition between products , institutions , markets , and jurisdictions . &quot; In other words , he clearly believed that regulation created &quot; artificial barriers , &quot; and that &quot; competition between jurisdictions &quot; - that is , between regulators - was to be welcomed . 
Such beliefs come naturally to those committed to the view that markets perform better without regulation , and Rajan &apos;s statement is a good illustration of the IMF &apos;s creed at the time . 
And it was this boundless faith in markets &quot; self-regulatory capacity that appears to be at the root of the Fund &apos;s failure to find what it was not looking for . 
There are now encouraging signs of change at the IMF , but this should not reassure us . 
As the political economist Fred Block has noted , &quot; societies invariably draw back from the brink of full-scale experimentation with market self-regulation . &quot; 
Unfortunately , this also makes self-regulation a faith that is very difficult to dispel , because its priests can always claim that its failures result not from theological bankruptcy , but from insufficient orthodoxy .
