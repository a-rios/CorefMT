Argentina before the Law 
MADRID - Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner &apos;s decision to renationalize the energy company YPF has raised a virtual tsunami of political diatribes , threats from unexpected places and players , heated commentary from journalists worldwide , and public outrage in Argentina , Spain , and many other countries . 
So now Argentina will face international law . 
In addition to Repsol , the Spanish energy company that held a majority stake in YPF , Spain and the European Union ( which , under the Lisbon Treaty , has acquired authority regarding investment matters in third countries ) will fight the seizure with every legal tool that they can muster . 
Argentina stands to lose economically by its actions as well . 
Given Fernández &apos;s contempt for her country &apos;s largest foreign investor , the renationalized YPF will find it difficult to find a new partner in international markets . 
Indeed , given Fernández &apos;s arbitrary action , the Chinese firms that were negotiating with Repsol for a stake in YPF are likely to have second thoughts . 
In the end , a solution must be found that is acceptable to all . 
So allowing tempers to cool and rhetoric to soften is now a high priority , and there is no better way to do that than by switching on the legal machinery . 
Repsol &apos;s announcement that it will seek international arbitration before the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID ) is a useful first step . 
But Repsol &apos;s willingness to go to arbitration raises several questions for members of the general public , most of whom are unfamiliar with the workings of international law ( which are sometimes incomprehensible even to experts ) . 
What does it mean to resort to the ICSID ? 
How effective are its decisions when rendered against states ? 
The ICSID was established in 1965 as a part of the World Bank by the Convention on Differences Relative to Investments between States and Nationals of Other States , in response to the proliferation of requests for the Bank president &apos;s ad hoc mediation in investment controversies . 
Its greatest virtue is that it offers two means of resolving controversies , conciliation and arbitration , in a process that places states and investors on an equal footing . 
Historically , ICSID arbitration has enjoyed a high degree of acceptance by all parties to disputes . 
Undoubtedly , in addition to formal means of implementation , the impressive shadow of the World Bank , with its powerful influence over developing countries &quot; access to international markets , plays a key role . 
Over the past 15 years , since the first case was registered against a Latin American state ( Costa Rica ) in 1996 , the number of investment arbitrations submitted to the ICSID from the region , mainly by foreign investors , has soared . 
Argentina is , by far , the leading cause of the regional surge in investment disputes , accounting for roughly 25 % of all ICSID cases , 50 % of those originating in Latin America , and twice as many as any other country . 
Indeed , since 1996 , Chile has been a party in only three cases , and Peru in fewer than 10 . 
Of course , it would be best if the dispute between Repsol and Argentina could be resolved by negotiation . 
So , once again , Argentina will stand out among that small group of countries that are reluctant to comply with legal custom , if not with legal findings . 
Argentine leaders &quot; addiction to demagogic and populist behavior is one reason for the country &apos;s exceptionalism in this regard . 
So , once again , that behavior must be censured , not only by other leaders , but also in legal proceedings . 
Only rigorous adherence to law can discourage the populist temptation to seek shortcuts to solving problems . 
Investments and loans are two sides of the same coin ; they flow only to where they are offered the security of a legal framework that prevents political leaders from exercising power arbitrarily . 
Because autarky is not an option - not even for North Korea - capricious decisions such as the renationalization of YPF cause immeasurably greater harm to the states that adopt them . 
It is no coincidence that the world &apos;s most prosperous countries are those with the strongest institutions , the most predictable business climate , and a reputation for upholding the rule of law .
