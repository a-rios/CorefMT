Global Warming &apos;s Upside-Down Narrative 
NEW YORK - When politicians around the world tell the story of global warming , they cast it as humanity &apos;s greatest challenge . 
But they also promise that it is a challenge that they can meet at low cost , while improving the world in countless other ways . 
We now know that is nonsense . 
Political heavyweights from US Secretary of State John Kerry to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon call climate change &quot; the greatest challenge of our generation . &quot; 
If we fail to address it , Kerry says , the costs will be &quot; catastrophic . &quot; 
Indeed , this has been the standard assertion of politicians since the so-called Stern Review commissioned by the British government in 2006 . 
That report famously valued the damage caused by global warming at 5-20 % of GDP - a major disruption &quot; on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the twentieth century . &quot; 
Tackling climate change , we are told , would carry a much lower cost . 
The president of the European Commission promised that while the European Union &apos;s climate policies are &quot; not cost-free , &quot; they would amount to just 0.5 % of GDP . 
Indeed , politicians of all stripes have reiterated the Stern Review &apos;s finding that global warming can be curtailed by policies costing just 1 % of world GDP . 
Climate policies , moreover , are said to help in many other ways . 
US President Barack Obama promised that policies to combat global warming would create five million new green jobs . 
The EU claimed that green energy would help &quot; improve the EU &apos;s security of energy supply . &quot; 
With the completion of the latest report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , we can now see that this narrative is mostly wrong . 
The first installment of the IPCC report showed that there is indeed a climate problem - emissions of greenhouse gases , especially CO â‚‚ , lead to higher temperatures , which will eventually become a net problem for the world . 
This result was highly publicized . 
But the report also showed that global warming has dramatically slowed or entirely stopped in the last decade and a half . 
Almost all climate models are running far too hot , meaning that the real challenge of global warming has been exaggerated . 
Germany and other governments called for the reference to the slowdown to be deleted . 
The second IPCC installment showed that the temperature rise that we are expected to see sometime around 2055-2080 will create a net cost of 0.2-2 % of GDP - the equivalent of less than one year of recession . 
So , while the IPCC clearly establishes that global warming is a problem , the cost is obviously much less than that of the twentieth century &apos;s two world wars and the Great Depression . 
Again , not surprisingly , politicians tried to have this finding deleted . 
British officials found the peer-reviewed estimate &quot; completely meaningless , &quot; and , along with Belgium , Norway , Japan , and the US , wanted it rewritten or stricken . 
One academic speculated that governments possibly felt &quot; a little embarrassed &quot; that their previous exaggerated claims would be undercut by the UN . 
The third installment of the IPCC report showed that strong climate policies would be more expensive than claimed as well - costing upwards of 4 % of GDP in 2030 , 6 % in 2050 , and 11 % by 2100 . 
And the real cost will likely be much higher , because these numbers assume smart policies , instantly enacted , with key technologies magically available . 
Again , politicians tried to delete or change references to these high costs . 
British officials explained that they wanted such cost estimates cut because they &quot; would give a boost to those who doubt action is needed . &quot; 
Green jobs have been created only with heavy subsidies , costing a similar number of jobs elsewhere . 
Indeed , each extra job created cost more than $ 11 million in the US . 
And facile claims that renewable sources can boost energy security look a lot less convincing after the crisis in Ukraine ; 
Europe now understands that only large and stable energy supplies matter . 
Climate change has been portrayed as a huge catastrophe costing as much as 20 % of world GDP , though brave politicians could counter it at a cost of just 1 % of GDP . 
The reality is just the opposite : We now know that the damage cost will be perhaps 2 % of world GDP , whereas climate policies can end up costing more than 11 % of GDP . 
What makes this story all the more amazing is that experts have known almost all of these facts for a long time . 
The Stern Review was produced by bureaucrats and never subjected to peer review . 
Economists knew that the damage costs had been extensively massaged , and that the estimates were outliers compared to the academic literature . 
The unfathomably low projections for policy costs were artifacts of ignoring most liabilities , again contradicting the academic literature . 
The media , eager for breathless headlines , share the blame with politicians for this state of affairs . 
Following the release of the Stern Review , one British newspaper reportedly wrote : &quot; Act now or the world we know will be lost forever . &quot; 
Being accurate is less sexy , but much more informative . 
We live in a world where one in six deaths are caused by easily curable infectious diseases ; one in eight deaths stem from air pollution , mostly from cooking indoors with dung and twigs ; and billions of people live in abject poverty , with no electricity and little food . 
We ought never to have entertained the notion that the world &apos;s greatest challenge could be to reduce temperature rises in our generation by a fraction of a degree . 
The solution is to stop applauding politicians who warn of catastrophe and promote poor policies . 
Instead of subsidizing inefficient solar and wind power with little benefit , we need to invest in long-term green innovation . 
And we need to give more attention to all of the other problems . 
This is perhaps less entertaining , but it will do much more good .
