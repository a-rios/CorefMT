In Praise of Euroskepticism 
BRUSSELS  -  
It has only sketchy economic policies toward Russia ; ambitions , but no game plan , to become a player in the Middle East ; and , despite its original leadership on the Kyoto Protocol , no successor program on climate change . 
And the biggest question of all - how to engage with China , India , and other giants of the future - has received virtually no attention from EU-level policymakers . 
These issues require attention now , and an integral part of the EU &apos;s search for new global strategies should be to invite , rather than avoid , criticism of its activities . 
If the EU is to lift its gaze from its navel to the horizon , it must reconcile the very different views that exist across Europe of its place in the world and its own best interests . 
That means engaging with those shades of political opinion that the European Commission and the European Parliament consider &quot; Euroskeptical . &quot; 
The counter-pressure , of course , is that EU officialdom feels unloved and unappreciated . 
There is an almost embattled culture among many senior officials , who fear that fanning the flames of dissent among Europe &apos;s voters could one day knock European unity off course . 
They worry that politicians and journalists who oppose their strategies for closer political and economic union could yet tip the balance of public opinion against the EU . 
Euroskeptic politicians elected to the European Parliament are often treated with the disdain that true believers reserve for the infidel . 
Yet it is ludicrous to think that Euroskeptics represent a silent majority that could rise up and destroy the EU . Popular support for the European project has barely faltered over the last 25 years , and has even begun to strengthen of late . 
At the beginning of the 1980 &quot; s , when Europe was faltering and the media catchword was &quot; Eurosclerosis , &quot; 50 % of people polled for the Eurobarometer surveys viewed membership as positive for their country . 
About 19 % said its effects were negative , and the rest didn &apos;t know . 
Today , overall support for the EU stands at 57 % , and the share of people unhappy with it has dropped to 15 % . 
There are now no EU countries where Euroskeptics are in the majority , and the widespread impression that citizens in Western and Eastern Europe alike are turning their backs on the EU is wrong . The reality is that even though voters may find the EU remote , most appreciate the need for Europe to unite in a world where China , India , and other fast-developing countries are set to challenge it . 
Reassured by this groundswell of support , the Eurocrats should be fostering a much more pluralistic approach to EU policymaking and debate . 
The Commission should be organizing public debates that give equal prominence to dissenting views . 
Eurocrats must learn that Euroskepticism is fundamentally healthy , because it invites closer examination of the policy options open to Europe , and thus increases the involvement of ordinary people in the EU &apos;s policymaking process . 
And greater involvement quickly leads to better understanding of the issues at stake , and the reasons why some policies have been adopted that challenge or even override the sovereign powers of individual countries . 
For half a century , Europe &apos;s integrationists have sought unquestioning acceptance of their efforts . 
That demand must be abandoned . 
It will probably take several generations before a workable EU-wide political system emerges , but the first step is for the EU to encourage people to have their say , however uncomfortable that may be .
