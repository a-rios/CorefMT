Is Traditional Banking Unbreakable ? 
NEW YORK - It is a rare industry nowadays that is not at risk of being upended by digital technology . 
Amazon , having swept away bookshops , is now laying siege to the rest of the retail sector . 
In transportation , Uber is outrunning traditional taxi companies , while Airbnb is undermining the foundations of the hotel industry . 
Meanwhile , smartphones are transforming how we communicate and revolutionizing the way we discover and patronize businesses . 
So it is no surprise that banking and financial-services companies are not safe from the immense transformations wrought by technological innovation . 
Indeed , for the last decade , digital startups have been penetrating areas traditionally dominated by the financial industry . 
But there is reason to believe that finance will prove resilient . 
Today , money can be sent to the other side of a country - or the world - simply by tapping an app , without ever interacting with a traditional financial-services company . 
Migrants &quot; remittances alone , which the World Bank estimates will total $ 586 billion this year , represent a tremendous growth opportunity for companies competing with banks to move money . 
Meanwhile , would-be disrupters are offering opportunities to save and invest - the very heart of traditional banking institutions &quot; operations . 
Startups such as Acorns - an app that automatically allocates a proportion of everyday purchases to a pre-selected investment portfolio - are making rapid inroads into a very competitive marketplace . 
Acorns , launched in 2014 , already manages more than 650,000 investment accounts . 
The company - and others like it - are not just moving into the market ; the simplified investment and savings processes they offer are expanding and transforming it . 
According to research by the digital ad agency Fractl , approximately 85 % of millennials are saving a portion of their paycheck - a larger percentage than their predecessors . 
Lending , too , is being transformed by technology . 
Crowdsourced funding and peer-to-peer lending schemes give borrowers the opportunity to circumvent many of the hurdles of traditional banking - including , in some cases , collateral requirements and credit ratings . 
According to the research firm Massolution , the crowdfunding market has grown exponentially , from $ 880 million in 2010 to $ 16.2 billion in 2014 . 
Global crowdfunding volumes are expected to double this year , surpassing $ 34 billion . 
In 2016 , crowdfunding is expected to provide more funding than traditional venture capital . 
Even financial services traditionally characterized by face-to-face dealings with clients , such as investment banking advisory services , have been affected . 
When Google conducted its initial public offering in 2004 , it chose to bypass the investment banking industry , which traditionally underwrites the process of taking a company public . 
Instead , the company opted for an electronic auction in which anyone could participate . 
Other companies - like the financial research firm Morningstar - have followed suit . 
While these attempts to revolutionize the equity capital markets have yet to gain widespread traction , their very existence is evidence of the opportunities for disruption in this sector . 
But it would be premature to conclude that traditional banking has yielded to new financial platforms . 
Many of the new entrants have benefited from advantages that would be difficult to maintain were they to scale up in size and importance . 
Traditional banking is subject to intense oversight , and regulations have only become more onerous in recent years , as regulatory authorities reacted to the 2008 global financial crisis by tightening rules on leveraging ratios and know-your-customer requirements . 
Many upstarts in the sector have carved out a competitive advantage by avoiding thresholds beyond which they would face substantial regulatory scrutiny and requirements . 
This places a significant constraint on the size and type of financial transactions these new companies can offer . 
By steering clear of services that might draw the scrutiny of financial authorities , digital startups face a natural limit to the size of their market . 
Indeed , this arrangement - albeit informal - can be viewed as the way regulators manage the systemic risk posed by new entrants . 
As the digital revolution evolves , much of the financial terrain in which technology companies are making the deepest inroads will come into much sharper regulatory focus . 
This will favor the established players . 
As a result , the digital revolution &apos;s assault on the traditional banking industry is by no means overwhelming . 
In finance , at least , technology firms should not be viewed simply as a threat , but as a source of productivity-boosting innovation .
