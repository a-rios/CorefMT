Europe &apos;s Lapse of Reason 
NEW YORK - At long last , the United States is showing signs of recovery from the crisis that erupted at the end of President George W. Bush &apos;s administration , when the near-implosion of its financial system sent shock waves around the world . 
But it is not a strong recovery ; at best , the gap between where the economy would have been and where it is today is not widening . 
If it is closing , it is doing so very slowly ; the damage wrought by the crisis appears to be long term . 
Then again , it could be worse . 
Across the Atlantic , there are few signs of even a modest US-style recovery : The gap between where Europe is and where it would have been in the absence of the crisis continues to grow . 
In most European Union countries , per capita GDP is less than it was before the crisis . 
A lost half-decade is quickly turning into a whole one . 
Behind the cold statistics , lives are being ruined , dreams are being dashed , and families are falling apart ( or not being formed ) as stagnation - depression in some places - runs on year after year . 
The EU has highly talented , highly educated people . 
Its member countries have strong legal frameworks and well-functioning societies . 
Before the crisis , most even had well-functioning economies . 
In some places , productivity per hour - or the rate of its growth - was among the highest in the world . 
But Europe is not a victim . 
Yes , America mismanaged its economy ; but , no , the US did not somehow manage to impose the brunt of the global fallout on Europe . 
The EU &apos;s malaise is self-inflicted , owing to an unprecedented succession of bad economic decisions , beginning with the creation of the euro . 
Though intended to unite Europe , in the end the euro has divided it ; and , in the absence of the political will to create the institutions that would enable a single currency to work , the damage is not being undone . 
The current mess stems partly from adherence to a long-discredited belief in well-functioning markets without imperfections of information and competition . 
Hubris has also played a role . 
How else to explain the fact that , year after year , European officials &quot; forecasts of their policies &quot; consequences have been consistently wrong ? 
These forecasts have been wrong not because EU countries failed to implement the prescribed policies , but because the models upon which those policies relied were so badly flawed . 
In Greece , for example , measures intended to lower the debt burden have in fact left the country more burdened than it was in 2010 : the debt-to-GDP ratio has increased , owing to the bruising impact of fiscal austerity on output . 
At least the International Monetary Fund has owned up to these intellectual and policy failures . 
Europe &apos;s leaders remain convinced that structural reform must be their top priority . 
But the problems they point to were apparent in the years before the crisis , and they were not stopping growth then . 
What Europe needs more than structural reform within member countries is reform of the structure of the eurozone itself , and a reversal of austerity policies , which have failed time and again to reignite economic growth . 
Those who thought that the euro could not survive have been repeatedly proven wrong . 
But the critics have been right about one thing : unless the structure of the eurozone is reformed , and austerity reversed , Europe will not recover . 
The drama in Europe is far from over . 
One of the EU &apos;s strengths is the vitality of its democracies . 
But the euro took away from citizens - especially in the crisis countries - any say over their economic destiny . 
Repeatedly , voters have thrown out incumbents , dissatisfied with the direction of the economy - only to have the new government continue on the same course dictated from Brussels , Frankfurt , and Berlin . 
But for how long can this continue ? 
And how will voters react ? 
Throughout Europe , we have seen the alarming growth of extreme nationalist parties , running counter to the Enlightenment values that have made Europe so successful . 
In some places , large separatist movements are rising . 
Now Greece is posing yet another test for Europe . 
The decline in the Greek economy since the start of the crisis is in many ways worse than that which confronted America during the Great Depression of the 1930s . 
Youth unemployment is over 50 % . 
Prime Minister Antonis Samaras &apos;s government has failed , and now , owing to the parliament &apos;s inability to choose a new Greek president , an early general election will be held on January 25 . 
The left opposition Syriza party , which is committed to renegotiating the terms of Greece &apos;s EU bailout , is ahead in opinion polls . 
If Syriza wins but does not take power , a principal reason will be fear of how the EU will respond . 
Fear is not the noblest of emotions , and it will not give rise to the kind of national consensus that Greece needs in order to move forward . 
The issue is not Greece . 
It is Europe . 
If Europe does not change its ways - if it does not reform the eurozone and repeal austerity - a popular backlash will become inevitable . 
Greece may stay the course this time . 
But this economic madness cannot continue forever . 
Democracy will not permit it . 
But how much more pain will Europe have to endure before reason is restored ?
