Why Turkey is Thriving 
NEW YORK - A recent visit to Turkey reminded me of its enormous economic successes during the last decade . 
The economy has grown rapidly , inequality is declining , and innovation is on the rise . 
Turkey &apos;s achievements are all the more remarkable when one considers its neighborhood . 
Its neighbors to the west , Cyprus and Greece , are at the epicenter of the eurozone crisis . 
To the southeast is war-torn Syria , which has already disgorged almost 400,000 refugees into Turkey . 
To the east lie Iraq and Iran . 
And to the northeast lie Armenia and Georgia . 
If there is a more complicated neighborhood in the world , it would be difficult to find it . 
Yet Turkey has made remarkable strides in the midst of regional upheavals . 
After a sharp downturn in 1999-2001 , the economy grew by 5 % per year on average from 2002 to 2012 . 
It has remained at peace , despite regional wars . 
Its banks avoided the boom-bust cycle of the past decade , having learned from the banking collapse in 2000-2001 . 
Inequality has been falling . 
And the government has won three consecutive general elections , each time with a greater share of the popular vote . 
There is nothing flashy about Turkey &apos;s rise , which has been based on fundamentals , rather than bubbles or resource discoveries . 
Indeed , Turkey lacks its neighbors &quot; oil and gas resources , but it compensates for this with the competitiveness of its industry and services . 
Tourism alone attracted more than 36 million visitors in 2012 , making Turkey one of the world &apos;s top destinations . 
Even a short stay in Ankara allows one to see these underlying strengths . 
The airport , highways , and other infrastructure are first class , and a high-speed intercity rail network links Ankara with other parts of the country . 
Much of the advanced engineering is homegrown . 
Turkish construction firms are internationally competitive and increasingly win bids throughout the Middle East and Africa . 
Turkey &apos;s universities are rising as well . 
Ankara has become a hub of higher education , attracting students from Africa and Asia . 
Many top programs are in English , ensuring that Turkey will attract an increasing number of international students . 
And the country &apos;s universities are increasingly spinning off high-tech companies in avionics , information technology , and advanced electronics , among other areas . 
To its credit , Turkey has begun to invest heavily in sustainable technologies . 
The country is rich in wind , geothermal , and other renewable energy , and will most likely become a global exporter of advanced green innovations . 
Waste-treatment facilities are not typically tourist attractions , but Ankara &apos;s novel integrated urban waste-management system has rightly attracted global attention . 
Until a few years ago , the waste was dumped into a fetid , stinking , noxious landfill . 
The private waste-management company ITC receives thousands of tons of solid municipal waste each day . 
The organic waste is processed in a fermentation plant , producing compost and methane , which is used to produce electricity in a 25-megawatt power plant . 
The electricity is returned to the city &apos;s power grid , while the heat exhaust is piped to the facility &apos;s greenhouses , which produce tomatoes , strawberries , and orchids . 
Turkey &apos;s diversified , innovative base of industry , construction , and services serves it well in a world in which market opportunities are shifting from the United States and Western Europe to Africa , Eastern Europe , the Middle East , and Asia . 
Turkey has been deft in seizing these new opportunities , with exports increasingly headed south and east to the emerging economies , rather than west to high-income markets . 
This trend will continue , as Africa and Asia become robust markets for Turkey &apos;s construction firms , information technology , and green innovations . 
So , how did Turkey do it ? 
Most important , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his economics team , led by Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan , have stuck to basics and looked to the long term . 
Erdoğan came to power in 2003 , after years of short-term instability and banking crises . 
The International Monetary Fund had been called in for an emergency rescue . 
Smart diplomacy has also helped . 
Turkey has remained a staunchly moderate voice in a region of extremes . 
It has kept an open door and balanced diplomacy ( to the extent possible ) with the major powers in its neighborhood . 
No doubt , Turkey &apos;s ability to continue on a rapid growth trajectory remains uncertain . 
Any combination of crises - the eurozone , Syria , Iraq , Iran , or world oil prices - could create instability . 
Another global financial crisis could disrupt short-term capital inflows . 
A dangerous neighborhood means inescapable risks , though Turkey has demonstrated a remarkable capacity during the last decade to surmount them . 
Moreover , the challenge of raising educational quality and attainment , especially of girls and women , remains a priority . 
Fortunately , the government has clearly acknowledged the education challenge and is pursuing it through school reforms , increased investments , and the introduction of new information technologies in the classroom . 
Turkey &apos;s successes have deep roots in governmental capacity and its people &apos;s skills , reflecting decades of investment and centuries of history dating back to Ottoman times . 
Other countries cannot simply copy these achievements ; but they can still learn the main lesson that is too often forgotten in a world of &quot; stimulus , &quot; bubbles , and short-term thinking .
