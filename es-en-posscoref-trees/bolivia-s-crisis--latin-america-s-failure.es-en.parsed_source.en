Bolivia &apos;s Crisis , Latin America &apos;s Failure 
Bolivia is not a typical Latin American country by any definition . 
But for Haiti , it is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere , and it is even less stable , with a history of more than two hundred coups since independence . 
In a region with a strong indigenous past but a scattered and isolated present , Bolivia is , alongside Guatemala , perhaps the only country in Latin America where indigenous peoples make up a majority of the population . 
Its topography and ethnic distribution are generating autonomist and even secessionist forces that threaten national unity in more menacing ways than anywhere else . 
And , of course , it is , with Paraguay , the only land-locked nation on the sub-continent . 
So it would be highly imprudent to extrapolate Bolivia &apos;s current crisis to the rest of Latin America . 
It is far too simple to generalize : institutions elsewhere are much stronger , poverty - and particularly extreme poverty - have been diminishing , and the battle over natural resources has been largely settled . 
Even in places like Venezuela , with both huge oil reserves and a traditional-minded nationalist government , the status quo allowing for foreign investment in energy resources has survived nearly eight years of President Hugo Chavez . 
While the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries , from Chiapas to &quot; Araucania , &quot; from Amazonia to Ayacucho , nowhere in Latin America have they posed a genuine threat to national integrity . 
So Bolivia is not a premonitory crisis ; nor does the hoary old &quot; domino theory , &quot; to which both Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara subscribed in the case of Bolivia , seem valid or even half-way reasonable . 
Yet Bolivia &apos;s current crisis does point to the &quot; democratic deficit &quot; that plagues Latin America today . 
Elected leaders have fallen for one reason or another in Bolivia , Ecuador , and Haiti . 
Democracy is either defective or missing in Cuba , Mexico , and Nicaragua , and it is threatened by one cause or another in Venezuela and Colombia . 
None of these cases are identical to the others ; they include varying degrees of danger , harm , or reconciliation . 
The question is what can be done about this state of affairs , which contrasts starkly with the encouraging outlook that prevailed just a few years back . 
At the last Organization of American States assembly in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , the United States delegation took a good idea from others and , by its support , essentially sank it . 
The story began a couple of years ago , when former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and the United Nations Development Program were charged with drafting the Latin American Democracy Report . 
They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help generate action before matters got out of control , as in Bolivia today . 
Caputo and the UN team then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take up the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues . 
He did , but the initiative did not get very far . 
In fact , The UNDP / Latin America Democracy Report , published in 2004 , barely mentioned it . 
The US and the new Chilean Secretary General of the OAS , Jose Miguel Insulza , resurrected the plan during the OAS meeting in Florida , but it was shot down by Latin Americans &quot; reasonable fears that the idea was directed against Venezuela , mingled with Latin Americans &quot; anachronistic fears of violating the sacrosanct principle of non-intervention . 
Despite the continent &apos;s failure to agree on the principle , the idea of an early-warning system deserves attention . 
Today there may be little that the hemispheric community can do about the situation in Bolivia , and yet it is fraught with danger for everyone . 
Evo Morales , the leader of the opposition and of the coca-leaf growers , may be an honest , if misguided , democratic leader , but are his followers untainted by authoritarian desires ? 
Hugo Chavez may not be financing Morales and Bolivia &apos;s other dissidents , but are Venezuela and Cuba really not tempted to meddle in the country where Che Guevara died leading a guerrilla war nearly 40 years ago ? 
Bolivia &apos;s Santa Cruz business community may not carry out its threat to secede , but will they prefer to share their region &apos;s oil and gas reserves with the indigenous highland peoples rather than with Brazilian industrialists from SÃ£o Paulo ? 
Before events reached these extremes , it might have been a good idea for the OAS ( not the US ) to get involved . 
The region continues to need that involvement - on time , on message , and on a proper democratic platform , one that is distinct from both traditional US intervention and Latin America &apos;s traditional indifference .
