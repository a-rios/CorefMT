Scarcity in an Age of Plenty 
NEW YORK - Around the world , protests against soaring food and fuel prices are mounting . 
The poor - and even the middle classes - are seeing their incomes squeezed as the global economy enters a slowdown . 
Politicians want to respond to their constituents &quot; legitimate concerns , but do not know what to do . 
In the United States , both Hillary Clinton and John McCain took the easy way out , and supported a suspension of the gasoline tax , at least for the summer . 
Only Barack Obama stood his ground and rejected the proposal , which would have merely increased demand for gasoline - and thereby offset the effect of the tax cut . 
But if Clinton and McCain were wrong , what should be done ? 
One cannot simply ignore the pleas of those who are suffering . 
In the US , real middle-class incomes have not yet recovered to the levels attained before the last recession in 1991 . 
When George Bush was elected , he claimed that tax cuts for the rich would cure all the economy &apos;s ailments . 
The benefits of tax-cut-fueled growth would trickle down to all - policies that have become fashionable in Europe and elsewhere , but that have failed . 
Tax cuts were supposed to stimulate savings , but household savings in the US have plummeted to zero . 
They were supposed to stimulate employment , but labor force participation is lower than in the 1990 &quot; s . What growth did occur benefited only the few at the top . 
Productivity grew , for a while , but it wasn &apos;t because of Wall Street financial innovations . 
The financial products being created didn &apos;t manage risk ; they enhanced risk . 
They were so non-transparent and complex that neither Wall Street nor the ratings agencies could properly assess them . 
Meanwhile , the financial sector failed to create products that would help ordinary people manage the risks they faced , including the risks of home ownership . 
Millions of Americans will likely lose their homes and , with them , their life savings . 
At the core of America &apos;s success is technology , symbolized by Silicon Valley . 
The irony is that the scientists making the advances that enable technology-based growth , and the venture capital firms that finance it were not the ones reaping the biggest rewards in the heyday of the real estate bubble . 
These real investments are overshadowed by the games that have been absorbing most participants in financial markets . 
The world needs to rethink the sources of growth . 
If the foundations of economic growth lie in advances in science and technology , not in speculation in real estate or financial markets , then tax systems must be realigned . 
Why should those who make their income by gambling in Wall Street &apos;s casinos be taxed at a lower rate than those who earn their money in other ways . 
Capital gains should be taxed at least at as high a rate as ordinary income . 
( Such returns will , in any case , get a substantial benefit because the tax is not imposed until the gain is realized . ) 
In addition , there should be a windfall profits tax on oil and gas companies . 
Given the huge increase in inequality in most countries , higher taxes for those who have done well - to help those who have lost ground from globalization and technological change - are in order , and could also ameliorate the strains imposed by soaring food and energy prices . 
Countries , like the US , with food stamp programs clearly need to increase the value of these subsidies in order to ensure that nutrition standards do not deteriorate . 
Those countries without such programs might think about instituting them . 
Two factors set off today &apos;s crisis : the Iraq war contributed to the run-up in oil prices , including through increased instability in the Middle East , the low cost provider of oil , while bio-fuels have meant that food and energy markets are increasingly integrated . 
Although the focus on renewable energy sources is welcome , policies that distort food supply are not . America &apos;s subsidies for corn-based ethanol contribute more to the coffers of ethanol producers than they do to curtailing global warming . 
Huge agriculture subsidies in the US and the European Union have weakened agriculture in the developing world , where too little international assistance was directed at improving agriculture productivity . 
Development aid for agriculture has fallen from a high of 17 % of total aid to just 3 % today , with some international donors demanding that fertilizer subsidies be eliminated , making it even more difficult for cash-strapped farmers to compete . 
Rich countries must reduce , if not eliminate , distortional agriculture and energy policies , and help those in the poorest countries improve their capacity to produce food . 
But this is just a start : we have treated our most precious resources - clean water and air - as if they were free . 
Only new patterns of consumption and production - a new economic model - can address that most fundamental resource problem .
