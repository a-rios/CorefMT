The Revolt Of The States 
BUENOS AIRES : Ceaseless change seems to be at the heart of today &apos;s global civilization . 
Because of this , countries that consider their domestic realities as sacrosanct find themselves unable to assimilate change or foresee its direction . 
To them , change appears as something irrational , even as a catastrophe . 
As we saw in the anti-IMF protests in Prague recently , and last year &apos;s street protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle , such fears are spreading far and wide . 
People increasingly see change not as something that enhances their freedom and dignity but as a force encouraging avarice and unfairness . 
By concentrating wealth narrowly , globalization produces more threats than opportunities . 
The difficulty in transferring knowledge and new technologies from the center to the periphery , for example , widens economic disparity and subjugates some countries to a new form of colonialism . 
Seeing this , many people fear a new dominant class intolerably manipulating globalization for its betterment . 
By limiting prospects for growth for many people , today &apos;s international economic order is inconsistent with the ideals of the great democratic revolution of our century , which says that no inhabitant of the world should be left behind . 
For those peoples and countries now marginalized from the process of technological development , production , and exchange I believe that only one viable option exists : a new assertion of themselves as independent states , regionally integrated in as many ways as possible . 
Only with independence does the confidence for greater participation come , and greater participation means improved governance , both in the international order and domestically . 
Ungovernablity arises from attempts to maintain control over people and places who are marginalized from participating in decisions that determine their daily lives . 
Citizens and countries alike become &quot; ungovernable &quot; when they see themselves as passive instruments of decisions taken by a closed elite that rules by transforming them into a mute &quot; mass . &quot; 
For free individuals - free citizens , free states - are the real protagonists of governance . 
Without full and equal responsibility there can be no lasting governance . 
This is what market fundamentalists , management consultants , and technocrats fail to understand . 
Countries , citizens , users , consumers , producers , workers , entrepreneurs , professionals cannot be left out of the decisions that hold significant consequences for their lives and goals , indeed for the very values of society . 
People in the United States and Western Europe recognize how continuity in their democratic systems enhanced their prosperity . 
By contrast , we in Latin America and Eastern Europe know that democracy has trouble surviving in times of crisis , poverty , and isolation . 
Preserving democratic values is hard when large sectors cannot integrate with the global market , when misery obliterates human dignity and a lack of options makes freedom meaningless . 
It is a bitter paradox , indeed , that the developed democracies use the power of globalization to punish us commercially by discriminating against our citizens and exports . 
In individual states protection of the weak is attained by equal application of the rule of law . 
This must also be made true in international relations . 
But to create an international order based on law and not force - economic force having replaced military might - it is necessary to strengthen and spread multilateralism into political fields as well in economic ones . 
Only the cooperation of free and equal nations can bring this about . 
Related to this is the fact that nowadays economic development depends less on a particular country and more on regional integration , which can serve to avoid the negative effects of those financial speculations boosted by globalization . 
So the world needs , in its regions , to facilitate integration on the basis of a general economic democratization : currency compatibility , free trade , shared legal rules and most of all a common will to fix the rules of the game according to a region &apos;s entire interests . 
Only such equal cooperation can secure the solid political basis for integration . 
So long as a country is subordinated to the uncontrollable force of globalization , its future is in foreign hands . 
But in agreeing to open regional economies to imports , poor and developing countries must be allowed some means to protect their new industries . 
There is justice in this , particularly given the hypocrisy of those countries who proclaim their faith in free trade while every day praying at the altar of protectionism . 
Everyone acknowledges that the market requires rules in order to avoid deformations such as monopolies and oligopolies . 
But monopolies of wealth are just as pernicious . 
The State should not abandon its redistributive role ; neither can the State surrender to the market its role in development . 
Indeed , quality housing and schooling , pensions and unemployment insurance , a modern health system and family social services must not be the fruits of an established democracy but a condition for democracy &apos;s consolidation and survival . 
For any program based on selfishness and injustice must generate strong forces of social dissolution and instability . 
The great challenge is to increase equality , and for this the State , which globalization claims to have overthrown , is vital . 
Only it can establish progressive taxes , adequate regulation of privatized public services , support to small and medium size companies , more efficiency in the public spending and a significant improvement in the education and health systems . 
It is the State &apos;s undeniable obligation to guarantee the benefits of social security to all the inhabitants of a country . 
Marxists used to agitate that the workers of the world unite . 
They never did , but we are now seeing a globalization of solidarity , of support for cooperative regional patterns and the need to rethink international agencies , and the impracticality of isolation . 
Without such solidarity , we are marching towards a world with no center , no authority , no order ; a world ruled by a globalized Mafia &quot; where what is official and what is clandestine will meet . &quot; 
The logic of power in that future world will be unforgiving toward those who give up on their will to self-determination . 
To maintain that will , we must fight the fear of going against the prevailing political orthodoxy of an inevitable globalization . 
The only fish that always swims with the current is a dead fish .
