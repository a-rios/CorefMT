An Accidental Currency War ? 
LAGUNA BEACH - Six and a half years after the global financial crisis , central banks in emerging and developed economies alike are continuing to pursue unprecedentedly activist - and unpredictable - monetary policy . 
How much road remains in this extraordinary journey ? 
In the last month alone , Australia , India , Mexico , and others have cut interest rates . 
Even the most stability-obsessed countries have made unexpected moves . 
Beyond cutting interest rates , Switzerland suddenly abandoned its policy of partly pegging the franc &apos;s value to that of the euro . 
A few days later , Singapore unexpectedly altered its exchange-rate regime , too . 
More consequential , the European Central Bank has committed to a large and relatively open-ended program of large-scale asset purchases . 
The ECB acted despite a growing chorus of warnings that monetary stimulus is not sufficient to promote durable growth , and that it encourages excessive risk-taking in financial markets , which could ultimately threaten economic stability and prosperity ( as it did in 2008 ) . 
Even the US Federal Reserve , which is presiding over an economy that is performing far better than its developed-world counterparts , has reiterated the need for &quot; patience &quot; when it comes to raising interest rates . 
This new round of central-bank activism reflects persistent concerns about economic growth . 
Despite a once-unthinkable amount of monetary stimulus , global output remains well below potential , with the potential itself at risk of being suppressed . 
Making matters worse , weak demand and debt overhangs are fueling concerns about deflation in the eurozone and Japan . 
Anticipating falling prices , households could postpone their consumption decisions , and companies could defer investment , pushing the economy into a downward spiral from which it would be very difficult to escape . 
If weak demand and high debt were the only factors in play , the latest round of monetary stimulus would be analytically straightforward . 
But they are not . 
For starters , central banks cannot deliver the structural components - for example , infrastructure investments , better-functioning labor markets , and pro-growth budget reforms - needed to drive robust and sustained recovery . 
Nor can they resolve the aggregate-demand imbalance - that is , the disparity between the ability and the willingness of households , companies , and governments to spend . 
It is little wonder , then , that monetary-policy instruments have become increasingly unreliable in generating economic growth , steady inflation , and financial stability . 
Central banks have been forced onto a policy path that is far from ideal - not least because they increasingly risk inciting some of the zero-sum elements of an undeclared currency war . 
With the notable exception of the Fed , central banks fear the impact of an appreciating currency on domestic companies &apos; competitiveness too much not to intervene ; indeed , an increasing number of them are working actively to weaken their currencies . 
The &quot; divergence &quot; of economic performance and monetary policy among three of the world &apos;s most systemically important economies - the eurozone , Japan , and the United States - has added another layer of confusion for the rest of the world , with particularly significant implications for small , open economies . 
Indeed , the surprising actions taken by Singapore and Switzerland were a direct response to this divergence , as was Denmark &apos;s decision to halt all sales of government securities , in order to push interest rates lower and counter upward pressure on the krone . 
Of course , not all currencies can depreciate against one another at the same time . 
The first condition is America &apos;s continued willingness to tolerate a sharp appreciation of the dollar &apos;s exchange rate . 
Still , as long as the US maintains its pace of overall growth and job creation - a feasible outcome , given the relatively small contribution of foreign economic activity to the country &apos;s GDP - these developments are unlikely to trigger a political response for quite a while . 
Indeed , America &apos;s intricate trade relations with the rest of the world - which place households and companies on both sides of the production and consumption equation - make it particularly difficult to stimulate significant political support for protectionism there . 
The second condition for broad-based currency depreciation is financial markets &apos; willingness to assume and maintain risk postures that are not yet validated by the economy &apos;s fundamentals . 
With central banks - the de facto best friend of financial markets these days - pushing for increasingly large financial risk-taking ( as a means of stimulating productive economic risk-taking ) , this is no easy feat . 
But , given the danger that this poses , one hopes that they succeed . 
In any case , central banks will have to back off eventually . 
The question is how hard the global economy &apos;s addiction to partial monetary-policy fixes will be to break - and whether a slide into a currency war could accelerate the timetable .
