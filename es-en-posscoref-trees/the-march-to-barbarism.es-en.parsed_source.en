The March to Barbarism 
One consequence of the Iraq war is to expose ( once again ) the false divide between &quot; civilized &quot; and &quot; barbarous &quot; nations . 
The United States seems as capable of barbarism as anyone else , as the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison make clear . 
Much of the time the barbarism in Iraq goes unrecorded , as when American tanks sweep into Iraqi neighborhoods and kill dozens of innocents in the name of fighting &quot; insurgents . &quot; 
But barbarism is found in many quarters , as the grisly beheading of an American hostage made clear . 
Every society , under certain conditions , is vulnerable to a descent into barbarism . 
False . 
Germany was destabilized by defeat in World War I , a harsh peace in 1919 , hyperinflation in the 1920 &apos;s , and the Great Depression of the 1930 &apos;s , but was otherwise not uniquely barbarous . 
On the contrary , in the early part of the twentieth century , Germany was one of the world &apos;s richest countries , with enviably high education levels and scientific prowess . 
Hannah Arendt was closer to the mark when she wrote about the &quot; banality of evil , &quot; not its uniqueness . 
There seem to be two common characteristics of the descent into barbarism . 
The first is the relentless human tendency to classify the world as &quot; us &quot; versus &quot; them , &quot; and then to reduce &quot; them &quot; to sub-human status . 
Such classifications probably evolved because they strengthened the cohesion of the &quot; in &quot; group , facilitating cooperation by harnessing hatred for those outside . 
Hatred and violence against &quot; others &quot; seem to be manifested most powerfully as the result of fear : they are survival reactions . 
The descent into barbarism generally occurs in the midst of economic crisis or when localized violence has already flared . 
Fear leads one group to coalesce in order to protect itself , perhaps by attacking a competing group . 
This pattern was evident in Yugoslavia &apos;s wars of the 1990 &apos;s , where ethnic communities that had lived together more or less peacefully became enmeshed in civil war in the midst of a deep economic crisis . 
Similarly , Israelis and Palestinians have both engaged in barbaric acts in a tragic interplay of mutual fear that empowers extremists in both communities . 
There is no glory on either side of the Israel-Palestine debacle . 
American reactions to the Abu Ghraib torture scenes , followed by the beheading of the American hostage Nicholas Berg , show clearly the route to barbarism in a supposedly civilized country . 
In May 2004 , The New York Times polled readers in a city in the US heartland , Oswego , Illinois . 
One retired businessman said , &quot; Let &apos;s kill them all . 
Let &apos;s wipe them off the face of the earth . &quot; 
A Nazi leader would not have said it differently . 
A tow truck driver said that the beheading &quot; just affirms what I thought before . 
We &apos;re not being tough enough . 
This is something that we &apos;ve got to do . 
We should attack our enemies directly and not back off till we succeed . &quot; 
A third respondent said something similar . 
&quot; There was so much outrage about the prisoner abuse , which I certainly don &apos;t approve of , but this was much worse , &quot; she said , referring to the Berg murder . 
&quot; What it tells me is that we can &apos;t let this kind of evil put down roots . 
We have to fight it decisively right now , or else we &apos;ll never be able to stamp it out . &quot; 
Barbarous thinking comes easily , and right-wingers fuel the fervor , as when Rush Limbaugh said on his radio program &quot; They &apos;re the ones who are perverted . 
They &apos;re the ones who are dangerous . 
They &apos;re the ones who are subhuman . 
They &apos;re the ones who are human debris , not the United States of America and not our soldiers and our prison guards . &quot; 
I am not saying that the US is more depraved than other countries . 
What I am saying is that human society , even in the twenty-first century , is capable of sliding into barbaric thinking and action , no matter the level of &quot; development . &quot; 
The idea that any nation is morally superior , or that it has been divinely chosen as a leader of nations , is dangerous . 
Once we recognize how vulnerable all of the world is to this kind of descent into violence , the importance of international law and international institutions such as the United Nations become all the more obvious . 
The UN successfully resisted the powerful pressures of the US to condone a war with Iraq despite repeated US claims , now known to be false , that Iraq was in possession of weapons of mass destruction . 
The UN process worked . 
It was US policy that failed . 
The events at Abu Ghraib underscore why international rules such as the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of combatants are so vital . 
By putting itself above the law , America allowed itself to succumb to barbaric behavior . 
Similarly , these events prove why the new International Criminal Court ( ICC ) is vital . 
The US strongly resisted the jurisdiction of the ICC , but American abuses at Abu Ghraib show why the US , should be subject to international law . 
Perhaps that lesson - the need to subject even the most powerful country to international law - will be one benefit of the otherwise disastrous war that the US launched in Iraq . 
If this lesson is learned , the world will be far safer . 
America itself will be safer , in part because it will be less likely in the future to unleash a spiral of violence fueled by its own irrational fears and misunderstandings of the world .
