Nigeria &apos;s Sick Man Democracy 
How sick is Nigerian president Umaru Yar &apos;Adua ? 
In May , he admitted during a live television broadcast that he suffers from a kidney ailment , but sought to quell rumors that he was terminally ill by insisting that fears for his health are greatly exaggerated and politically motivated . 
There are plenty of world leaders in less-than-perfect health . 
But the stakes are especially high in Nigeria , where Yar &apos;Adua embodies the country &apos;s delicate political balance . 
With the fall of Nigeria &apos;s dictatorship and the introduction of democracy in 1999 , governors in the mainly Muslim northern provinces believed they had struck a deal with their southern counterparts on a regional rotation of the country &apos;s presidency . 
In 2007 , arguing that it was their turn to choose a chief executive , they bitterly opposed a bid by then-President Olusegun Obasanjo , a southerner and a Christian , to rewrite Nigeria &apos;s constitution in hopes of winning a third term . 
Southern governors countered that the north had controlled the country through more than three decades of authoritarian rule and that a southerner should hold the presidency for years to come . 
Tensions mounted . 
Once it became clear that his gambit would fail , Obasanjo found a compromise : he named a man he trusted , Yar &apos;Adua , a little-known northern governor and devout Muslim , as his preferred successor . 
In April 2007 , Yar &apos;Adua won a disputed landslide presidential victory . 
Western and African observers charged that widespread vote-rigging had tainted the official result , and Nigeria &apos;s Supreme Court has yet to rule on challenges to the election &apos;s legality . 
But Yar &apos;Adua shrugged off charges of electoral fraud , and in the first days of his presidency , he drew praise , both at home and abroad , for promises to tackle corruption and pursue an agreement with militia groups in the oil-rich , violence-plagued Niger Delta region . 
In reaching out to armed groups like the Movement for Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) , one of his primary assets has been his vice president , Goodluck Jonathan , a native of the area . 
Pacifying the Delta is vitally important , because Nigeria , the world &apos;s eighth-largest oil producer , earns 86 % of its export revenue from oil . 
Attacks on pipelines have recently intensified ahead of a planned summit meeting between the government and various militia leaders , as small groups of militants stage attacks on oil infrastructure in the Delta to establish their relevance and win a potentially lucrative seat at the negotiating table . 
The summit is likely to generate an agreement and positive media coverage , but northern Muslim members of parliament could complicate efforts to implement the deal . 
The Nigerian government could use some good news . 
Electricity shortages have intensified on Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s watch , producing blackouts in many areas of the country and darkening the foreign investment climate . 
Rising food and energy prices pushed inflation up to 9.7 % in May , from 8.2 % in April . 
Corruption investigations launched by Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s government have uncovered broader and deeper problems than many knew existed . 
A battle between the president and legislature over control of federal spending has not been fully resolved . 
For foreign investors , the greatest near-term concern may be a broad range of attacks from parliament and some of Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s economic advisors on Charles Soludo , the central bank governor , who is widely credited for Nigeria &apos;s improved economic performance in the past several years . 
Under Obasanjo , Soludo initiated much needed banking reforms and argued strenuously that Nigeria should pay its foreign debt . 
But Soludo &apos;s recent decision to create a sovereign wealth fund has ignited a firestorm . 
Lawmakers complain they weren &apos;t consulted . 
Northern Muslims wonder why Soludo , a southern Christian , believes the government should horde excess cash that could be spent to relieve poverty among their constituents . 
A favorite of the West , Soludo may not survive the year . 
With so many challenges ahead , Nigeria can ill afford an ailing president . 
Yar &apos;Adua insists that he &apos;s fine and that his trips to Germany for medical treatment , during the election campaign last year and again this April , have been unfairly politicized . 
But there are plenty of unanswered questions about his kidney condition and rumors that he may even have Churg-Strauss Syndrome , a life-threatening autoimmune disease . 
The true state of his health may matter less than public fears that he &apos;s hiding something . 
Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s health worries are creating risks to Nigeria &apos;s stability that run far beyond questions about the Niger Delta or any single political issue . 
If Yar &apos;Adua were to die in office , his vice president would succeed him - returning the presidency to a southern Christian . 
Nigeria &apos;s northern Muslims are highly unlikely to accept that result without protest . 
There is no reason to believe that Goodluck Jonathan will preemptively resign , and removing him from office if he assumes the presidency might well stoke unprecedented violence in the Delta . 
Given the political friction and violence generated by last year &apos;s election campaign , new balloting would prove a less-than-appealing prospect . 
Only Umaru Yar &apos;Adua &apos;s doctors know for sure how sick he is .
