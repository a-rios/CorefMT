The Origin of Life 
According to modern science &apos;s version of Genesis  -  less colorful than the biblical story , but no less wonderful  -  Earth was born , together with the Sun and the other planets , in a whirlwind of gas and dust , some 4.5 billion years ago , a little more than nine billion years after the Big Bang . 
A half-billion years later , our planet had recovered sufficiently from the pangs of its violent birth to become physically capable of harboring life . 
After less than another half-billion years , it did indeed harbor life , in particular an entity , called the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) , that gave rise through evolution to all known living creatures , including microbes of various kinds , plants , fungi , animals , and humans . 
Primitive organisms arose from nonliving matter in what were probably hot , sulfurous , metal-laden , volcanic waters . 
This unsavory brew was likely &quot; spiced &quot; with abundant small organic molecules such as amino acids , sugars , nitrogenous bases , and other typical components of biological constituents . 
One of the most astonishing discoveries of the last decades , revealed by exploration of space , nearby celestial objects , and especially meteorites that fell to Earth , is that many of the chemical building blocks of life form spontaneously throughout the universe . 
Organic chemistry , so named because it was believed to be a prerogative of living organisms , has turned out to be the most widespread and banal chemistry : the chemistry of carbon . 
How this &quot; cosmic chemistry &quot; gave rise to the first living cells is not known in detail , but the process may be summed up in two words . 
The first is chemistry , the essence of life . 
Living beings continually manufacture their own constituents from small inorganic and organic building blocks , with the help of catalysts called enzymes and of energy derived from sunlight , mineral sources , or foodstuffs made by other organisms . 
Something similar happened in the origin of life , but along pathways , by the action of catalysts , and with sources of energy that remain to be identified . 
Enormous research efforts have already been devoted to this problem . 
Much has been learned , but no solution is in sight . 
All that can be said is that the processes involved must , being chemical , have been highly deterministic and reproducible , that is , bound to occur under prevailing conditions . 
If chemistry admitted even a small element of chance , there could be no chemical laboratories , no chemical factories . 
The second key word is replicability , the ability of certain information-bearing molecules to induce the making of ( complementary ) copies of themselves by the machineries responsible for the synthesis of their kind . 
This function , fulfilled mostly by DNA today , was probably first carried out by RNA , a close relative of DNA . 
In the beginning , replication concerned only RNA molecules . 
Soon , RNA molecules became involved in the synthesis of proteins according to RNA-supplied blueprints , so that replication extended to proteins , by way of RNA ( eventually DNA ) . 
In turn , replication came to affect , by way of proteins , increasingly complex objects , up to cells and multi-cellular organisms . 
Replication allowed the endless reproduction of the same entities , generation after generation , which is the basis of genetic continuity . 
Furthermore , because of the inevitable failures in the fidelity of the process , replication necessarily led also to variation ( in replicable form ) , hence to competition among variant lineages for available resources . 
The necessary outcome , as first divined by Charles Darwin , was the selection of those lineages most apt to survive and , especially , produce progeny under existing conditions . 
This process became added to chemistry as soon as replicability appeared , operating first on molecules and , subsequently , on increasingly complex assemblages , until the present day . 
With replication , chance made its appearance , by way of the variations , or mutations , that were offered to the screening action of natural selection . 
According to all we know , these variations are strictly accidental , totally devoid of any intentionality or foresight - hence the widespread notion that the history of life was ruled by contingency . 
But this view ignores the possibility that the array of choices offered by chance to natural selection may be sufficiently extensive to allow an optimal or near-optimal solution to emerge , in which case the process is actually close to obligatory and reproducible under the prevailing conditions . 
Indeed , there are strong reasons to believe that optimizing selection may have occurred in the origin and evolution of life more often than is generally assumed . 
This implies that life , to the extent that it is the product of deterministic chemistry and of optimizing selection , is likely to arise , in a form similar to life as we know it , wherever conditions mimic those that surrounded its birth on Earth , thus justifying today &apos;s interest in extraterrestrial life . 
But this optimizing selection during evolution is nothing like proof of intelligent design . 
Irrespective of the arguments put forward in support of ID , which have been abundantly refuted , let it simply be stated that a theory based on an a priori declaration that things are not naturally explainable is not a scientific theory . 
By definition , the science is based on the idea that the object of study is naturally explainable . 
Why look for an explanation otherwise ? 
What is truly wonderful is how much of nature , including the fundamental features of life , has already proven to be explainable .
