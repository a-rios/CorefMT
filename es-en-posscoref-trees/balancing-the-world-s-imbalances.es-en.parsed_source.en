Balancing the World &apos;s Imbalances 
Good times - and these are good times for the global economy - are rarely the moment for concrete initiatives to deal with difficult problems . 
It is against this backdrop that I find welcome this weekend &apos;s announcement by a group of major economies acknowledging their shared responsibility for the orderly resolution of global imbalances while sustaining robust growth . 
For the past year , China , the euro zone , Japan , Saudi Arabia , and the United States have been discussing these plans among themselves and with the IMF . 
Behind the somewhat forbidding label of &quot; multilateral consultation &quot; are discussions that are the first of their kind , and that have proved to be a promising tool for dealing with an issue of global importance . 
These five economies are relevant to global imbalances in different ways : either on account of their current account deficits or surpluses , or because they represent a very large share of world output . 
They all agree that resolving these imbalances is in each of their interests . 
But they also recognize that it is a multilateral challenge and a shared responsibility for them all . 
Over the last year , partly reflecting past policies in these countries , the imbalances have shown signs of stabilizing and , indeed , even of improving slightly . 
But these countries must signal that policies will continue to ensure a progressive and orderly reduction in imbalances together with sustained growth . 
Otherwise , the global economy will remain at risk from renewed protectionist pressures and economic or political events that might trigger a disorderly resolution of the imbalances and undermine growth . 
The five economies spelled out their policy plans in considerable detail to the semi-annual meeting of the IMF &apos;s membership , which gave them a warm welcome . 
This is the first time such plans have been presented together . 
As Gordon Brown , the chairman of the Fund &apos;s International Monetary and Financial Committee , noted , these plans are fully in line with the medium-term approach to solving imbalances that the Fund &apos;s membership has consistently supported : 
China has elevated the reduction of external imbalances to a major national objective in 2007 . 
It intends to boost domestic demand and is committed to moving gradually toward greater exchange rate flexibility . 
Euro-zone countries reaffirmed their intention to press ahead with structural reforms across a broad front , in product , labor , and financial markets . 
Japan plans to accelerate labor market reforms , strengthen competition , and advance fiscal consolidation to sustain domestic confidence . 
Saudi Arabia is boosting its spending on social and infrastructure investments substantially , as well as expanding oil sector capacity . 
And the US is taking steps to balance its budget , boost private savings , and enhance energy efficiency . 
The US also intends to strengthen capital market competitiveness and ensure that it remains an attractive environment for foreign investment . 
Just as global imbalances were not built up overnight , nor will they be solved quickly . 
The aim of multilateral consultation was not to seek to solve imbalances in one fell swoop , but rather to solidify agreement on a medium-term approach that could reduce imbalances gradually over time . 
The policies outlined by the participants will , when implemented , constitute a step in that direction . 
Publication of their plans sends an additional signal of their commitment and provides a valuable roadmap with which to assess progress , and thus help build confidence that all countries are working to reduce imbalances . 
The IMF , for its part , will monitor these plans regularly as part of our responsibility to provide policy analysis and advice . 
The countries have made it clear that their future policy plans will continue to be consistent with the strategy called for by the IMF &apos;s membership . 
The five participants and the rest of our members , as well as we at the Fund , all agree that this has been a fruitful exercise . 
An indicator of success is that a second multilateral consultation , aimed at fostering dialogue on how financial globalization and innovation influence growth and stability , is under consideration . 
Like the first round of talks , this consultation would occur between a group of economies that have special relevance to the issue .
