Argentina &apos;s Iranian Tango 
BUENOS AIRES - A controversial agreement between Iran and Argentina to investigate jointly a terrorist attack against a Jewish organization in Buenos Aires in 1994 , which killed 85 people , has opened an intense debate about Iranian influence in Latin America . 
This is unusual , because Latin American leaders often ignore events that fuel global tensions , regardless of their repercussions on the continent &apos;s politics . 
For decades , Cuban and Soviet support for guerrilla movements - and backing by the United States for Latin America &apos;s anticommunist military regimes - was rarely part of regional explanations for the insurgent violence and state terrorism that plagued the continent even after the Cold War &apos;s end . 
Today , the growing strength of the region &apos;s democracies is helping to heal the wounds of that violence , but the difficulty of incorporating global factors into national political analysis continues . 
Links with Iran - and their costs - are no exception . 
A couple of years ago , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Venezuela , Nicaragua , Ecuador , and Cuba . 
These four countries &quot; governments , which claim to be progressive , received - without a hint of concern - a leader who denies the Holocaust ; beat , jailed , repressed , and killed protesters who objected to the fraudulent election that brought him a second term in office ; and flaunts his contempt for individual liberties , with gay Iranians particularly vulnerable . 
Why do some leftists find Iran &apos;s reactionary , homophobic president so seductive ? 
Are they enthusiastic simply because he opposes the US ? 
Does being anti-American excuse all sins and justify all friendships ? 
Maybe the answer is simpler : often , it is not shared ideas and values that bring individuals together , but rather power and money . 
Some time ago , I asked a Latin-American leader what was behind his country &apos;s Iranian romance ; he refused to answer . 
After insisting , he finally rubbed his index finger and thumb together - an almost universal sign for money . 
Whatever the reason , it is again being ignored that every time issues affecting US security arise in Latin America , the region becomes inflamed . 
In this context , the surprising agreement between Argentina and Iran to &quot; advance &quot; the investigation of the attack against the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina ( AMIA ) will have no judicial value , though the arrangement &apos;s symbolic importance cannot be ignored . 
Some years ago , after a complicated investigation , Argentine investigators identified several members of the Iranian government as the main suspects behind the attack on the AMIA . 
Iran has always denied responsibility and strongly opposed any criminal investigation of the suspects . 
More recently , the government of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner entered into secret negotiations with Iran . 
The talks ended with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the two countries to form a &quot; truth commission , &quot; made up of international legal experts , to analyze all of the documentation related to the killings . 
The Argentine government claims that the agreement will unblock the investigation of the suspects in the attack on the AMIA . 
But the memorandum does no such thing . 
Indeed , the text reads : &quot; Nothing in this agreement can prejudice the rights of the individuals guaranteed by the law . &quot; 
Under Iranian law , citizens can be forced to appear only before a competent Iranian court on the basis of firm evidence , undermining the quasi-judicial character of the Commission of Truth and effectively ending any realistic prospect of judicial proceedings . 
Fernández described the agreement as &quot; historic . &quot; 
And perhaps she is right , as the agreement will certainly leave a historic stain on Argentina . 
Inexplicably , both governments have committed themselves to having their parliaments ratify the memorandum , which would elevate it to the status of an international treaty - thus making it impossible to change by a simple administrative measure . 
The Argentine people and their future governments will be bound by a text that precludes the pursuit of justice . 
Curiously , neither the agreement &apos;s advocates nor its opponents in Argentina have asked why Ahmadinejad suddenly wanted to discuss the murder of 85 people , mostly Jews . 
But last October , Ahmadinejad told the FARS news agency : &quot; Only when the matter of these investigations is cleared up will conditions be right for expanding the links between Iran and Argentina . &quot; 
This is the clearest feature of this tangled affair : the Argentine government wants to increase bilateral trade , while Ahmadinejad wants to be cleared of suspicion in a case that is damaging Iran &apos;s standing across Latin America . 
If Iranians were indeed behind the attack , the agreement grants them impunity . 
Only real judicial proceedings can prove their guilt or innocence .
