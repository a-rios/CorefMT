Narrative Power in Turkey 
ISTANBUL - At the end of March , a retrial finally resulted in the acquittal of more than 200 Turkish military officers who had been convicted of plotting a coup in 2003 against the then-newly elected Islamist government . 
The defendants had been given long prison sentences after the first trial concluded in September 2012 , even though the evidence against them was clearly forged . 
By the time the retrial ended , most observers recognized that the original proceedings had been a sham . 
But , until recently , the &quot; Sledgehammer &quot; case - named after the fictitious coup plot - was widely viewed as heralding the long-overdue democratic subjugation of Turkey &apos;s meddlesome military to its elected government . 
Liberal intellectuals and Western observers applauded the prosecution and hailed it as one of the greatest achievements of the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , who had since come to power . 
Now that the case has been shown for what it was - a thuggish government &apos;s attempt to weaken its rivals and consolidate its hold on power - the question is why so many well-intentioned observers got their analysis so terribly wrong . 
My father-in-law was the alleged mastermind of the Sledgehammer plot , so my wife and I found ourselves moonlighting as forensic detectives and political activists . 
In my five years investigating this bizarre saga , I learned to appreciate the power of narratives . 
What proved most effective for the government was not brute force , but tales of nefarious activities by Turkey &apos;s secular and military elites , which were contrasted to Erdoğan &apos;s supposed commitment to establishing a democratic ( albeit Islamist-tinged ) state through a reconstituted judiciary . 
Grotesque exaggerations based on half-truths , these tales gave Erdoğan and his allies the maneuvering room within which to make the political regime more , not less , authoritarian . 
One ally in particular was crucial . 
The Gülen movement - made up of the followers of the Pennsylvania-based Turkish imam Fethullah Gülen - did the heavy political lifting . 
The Gülen movement oversaw Sledgehammer and similar trials via its followers in the police and the judiciary , and used its extensive media outlets to craft and disseminate the narrative - built from countless stories of military plots and other malfeasance - on which these cases rested . 
Its representatives in the United States and Europe lobbied Western politicians and opinion leaders incessantly to vouch for Erdoğan &apos;s democratic credentials . 
At the same time , the Gülen movement invested heavily and shrewdly in cultivating Turkey &apos;s Western-oriented intelligentsia . 
Thus , despite Gülen &apos;s own embarrassing history of anti-Semitic and anti-Western sermons , his followers managed to establish themselves by the 2000s as a civil-society movement that shared Turkish liberals &quot; values and aspirations . 
Gülenists provided resources and networks to Turkey &apos;s liberals , who then lent the movement legitimacy and credibility in the West . 
When American and European politicians , reporters , and human rights specialists looked for insight on Turkey , they turned to the Gülenists &quot; liberal beneficiaries , who fed them the established narratives . 
What made these intellectuals willing allies of Erdoğan and the Gülenists was their view that the military &apos;s control of state institutions - &quot; military tutelage &quot; - posed the greatest obstacle to democracy in Turkey . 
For Turkey &apos;s liberals , the weakening of the military &apos;s political influence became an end in itself . 
It allowed them to overlook ( or downplay ) the growing list of rights violations and judicial manipulations . 
And it allowed the Gülenists to play them - for example , by ensuring that damaging leaks from the military ( the most egregious of which were fabricated ) would be published in liberal outlets first . 
The Erdoğan government adopted legislation that lent credence to its false narrative . 
Unfortunately , as in development economics , mimicking advanced-country regulations and institutions rarely produces the desired results . 
Form does not guarantee function . 
So it was with the Erdoğan government &apos;s &quot; pro-European &quot; reforms , which served mainly to provide political cover for strengthening the Gülenists &quot; hold over the judiciary . 
Fooled by appearances , the European Commission continued to assert , year after year , that the military show trials were an opportunity to strengthen the rule of law . 
Until recently , the military was widely regarded as Turkish society &apos;s most powerful and cohesive institution . 
The generals had never been shy about intervening in politics when they felt it necessary . 
But a well-honed narrative can be mightier than the sword . 
The Sledgehammer case and other allegations , false as they were , immobilized the military . 
Under intense attack by pro-government media , the general staff failed to mount even the slightest public effort on the accused officers &quot; behalf , even refusing to release an internal report that left no doubt that the defendants had been framed . 
The top brass did not want to look like they were &quot; aiding the putschists . &quot; 
Once the narrative was established , even its targets succumbed to it . 
Western observers and the bulk of domestic liberals did not give up on Erdoğan until his government &apos;s heavy-handed tactics during the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul in the summer of 2013 . 
He then broke clumsily with the Gülen movement after its acolytes in the judiciary launched a corruption probe against him and his inner circle . 
Without his Gülenist allies , Erdoğan &apos;s message has become oriented exclusively to a domestic audience , and features heavy doses of populist-religious-nationalist symbolism . 
Meanwhile , the Gülenists , ever in search of the narrative upper hand , have been presenting themselves to Western audiences as Erdoğan &apos;s victims rather than as his collaborators . 
False narratives eventually become unsustainable ( with the Internet and social media hastening their demise ) . 
But , as in Turkey , a collapsed narrative can leave much debris .
