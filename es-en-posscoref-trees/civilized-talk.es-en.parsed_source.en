Civilized Talk 
PARIS - What does it mean to be &quot; civilized &quot; ? 
Obviously , being highly educated , wearing a tie , eating with a fork , or cutting one &apos;s nails weekly is not enough . 
We all know that being &quot; civilized &quot; in this formal way doesn &apos;t prevent people from behaving like barbarians . 
Everywhere and at all times , being civilized means being able to recognize and accept the humanity of others , despite their different modes of living . 
That may seem like an obvious point , but it is not universally accepted . 
The idea of dialogue between civilizations usually gets a good press , but it is also sometimes mocked . 
The conclusion of Elie Barnavi &apos;s recent essay Les religions meurtrières ( &quot; Murderous religions &quot; ) is entitled &quot; Against the dialogue of civilizations . &quot; 
His argument is implacable : &quot; There is civilization on one hand and barbarism on the other . 
There is no possible dialogue between them . &quot; 
But if you look at this line of argument more closely , the flaw in Barnavi &apos;s argument is immediately apparent . 
The meaning of the words civilization and culture is very different when they are used in singular and plural forms . 
Cultures ( plural ) are the modes of living embraced by various human groups , and comprise all that their members have in common : language , religion , family structures , diet , dress , and so on . 
In this sense , &quot; culture &quot; is a descriptive category , without any value judgment . 
Civilization ( singular ) is , on the contrary , an evaluative moral category : the opposite of barbarism . 
So a dialogue between cultures is not only beneficial , but essential to civilization . 
No civilization is possible without it . 
Contrary to what proponents of the idea of a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; claim , encounters between different cultures usually take place easily and peacefully , because we are psychologically prepared for them . 
Everyone is the product of several cultures , even if one has never left his home country , because culture is not only national . 
All of us carry within us the culture of our sex , age group , wealth , class , and job . 
This plurality of cultures usually does not present any problems for us , because shifting from one cultural code to another is a universal human faculty . 
After all , we don &apos;t talk in the same way to every person we meet during the day . 
Moreover , cultures related to a given territory are never really &quot; pure . &quot; 
As far back as you can go in the history of a country like France , you will find meetings between different tribes and ethnic groups , and thus different cultures : Gallics , Franks , Romans , and many others . 
Everywhere we look ( except , perhaps , in New Guinea &apos;s deep valleys , where obscure tribes may remain isolated from one another ) , there are only mixed cultures . 
But , while some cultures are proud of their plurality , others try to hide it . 
The concept of a dialogue between cultures is sometimes strained , or seems only a pious hope , because we ask it to do the impossible : solve inflamed political conflicts . 
Dialogue , as benevolent as it may be , can &apos;t resolve questions related to people &apos;s freedom of movement , or to the sharing of territory or natural resources . 
Politics and culture don &apos;t work on the same level : the former governs action , the latter influences mentalities ; the former deals with emergencies , the latter can require generations to produce any result . 
We should work for this type of dialogue by beginning with simple and modest initiatives . 
We need more translations of the ideas and literatures of other countries , more long stays abroad for university students , more teaching of foreign languages and encouragement of study about other cultures , and more confrontation between national memories ( say , between France and Algeria ) . 
Some measures of this type already exist in the European Union , but they should be introduced elsewhere : North Africa , the Middle East , India , China , Japan , and Latin America . 
The best way to initiate a dialogue is to disregard clichés and generalities , and instead to promote gatherings between human beings . 
For the moment , politics has claimed paramount status . 
Yet , from another point of view , dialogue prevails over war and the stubborn defense of what one believes to be his identity , because it brings us closer to the vocation of humanity . 
The novelist André Schwarz-Bart used to tell this story : A chief rabbi was once asked why the stork , which is called Hassada ( affectionate ) in Hebrew because it loves its own kind , is classified among unclean animals . 
&quot; Because , &quot; the rabbi replied , &quot; it gives its love only to its own kind . &quot;
