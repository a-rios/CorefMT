The Silver Fox of Dictatorship and Democracy 
MOSCOW - Throughout his years in power , Eduard Shevardnadze was known as the &quot; silver fox , &quot; a man who seemed to glide effortlessly from leader of Soviet Georgia and Kremlin Politburo member to Mikhail Gorbachev &apos;s reform-minded foreign minister , before reemerging as post-Soviet Georgia &apos;s pro-Western president , ironically opposing Gorbachev . 
He regarded himself as a hero who liberated Georgia from Russia &apos;s tight embrace . 
He was also one of the most corrupt politicians his country ever saw . 
By the end of his life , Shevardnadze had become a political pariah in Georgia , the West , and Russia , where he was viewed as an architect of the Soviet Union &apos;s dissolution . 
Yet , even if he was largely forgotten after the Rose Revolution of 2003 , when he was ousted by his one-time protégé , Mikheil Saakashvili , his cunning and skill at manipulating political forces still enabled him to manage his legacy to his advantage . 
The staunchly pro-American Saakashvili launched successful economic reforms and an all-out assault on police corruption , though he , too , eventually was accused of taking bribes and indulging autocratic impulses . 
Having come to power in the revolt that overthrew the corrupt Shevardnadze , he resorted to the same Soviet-style techniques - intimidating and discrediting opponents , dispersing dissenters by force - to keep his opponents at bay . 
The question Georgians have been asking ever since is whether Shevardnadze was really overthrown at all . 
Knowing the extent of his unpopularity in 2003 , many believe that he was ready to leave power but needed a successor who would ensure that his legacy ( and his wealth ) survived . 
To be sure , Saakashvili became famous as Georgia &apos;s justice minister for submitting corruption charges against the Shevardnadze family , and early in his presidency was able to reclaim for the state $ 15 million dollars of the Shevardnadze fortune . 
But Saakashvili &apos;s government never touched Shevardnadze and his family . 
Regardless of whether this theory is true , its persistence lies at the core of Shevardnadze &apos;s legacy . 
Throughout his career , he was known to play all sides , at times threatening his resignation , only to stay on - or accusing enemies of assassination plots , only to stay alive . 
In the 1970s , he would flatter Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev with spectacular displays of fealty to the Kremlin , only to meet with protesting Georgian students in support of their right , in opposition to the Kremlin &apos;s wishes , to speak Georgian , not Russian , as a state language . 
Everything at which Georgians excelled under Shevardnadze in the Soviet era - entrepreneurship , education , and culture - was greatly neglected by him in the 1990s . 
Similarly , whereas tens of thousands of functionaries were indicted for corruption or lost their jobs under his leadership in the 1970s , the post-Soviet Shevardnadze of the 1990s reportedly joked that he should have arrested himself , but that he deserved his wealth for his priceless political contribution . 
In 1999 , during the New York celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , I myself heard Shevardnadze assert that Georgia had given the twentieth century two historic figures : &quot; One who erected the Iron Curtain &#91; Joseph Stalin &#93; , and one who tore it down &quot; - meaning himself . 
Surely , Shevardnadze &apos;s political skills were worthy of another great Soviet politician from the Caucasus , the Armenian Anastas Mikoyan , once Stalin &apos;s trusted trade minister and later Nikita Khrushchev &apos;s fellow anti-Stalinist and deputy prime minister . 
Mikoyan , as one joke had it , left the Kremlin one day in heavy rain and refused to share a colleague &apos;s umbrella . 
&quot; It &apos;s ok , &quot; he said , &quot; I will walk between the raindrops . &quot; 
Likewise , Shevardnadze resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Georgia in the 1980s , ostensibly in protest against Soviet rule , only to be appointed Soviet Foreign Minister by Gorbachev . 
Having gained the trust of Western leaders and overseen the dismantling of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe , he then resigned in 1990 , declaring that Russia - under Gorbachev - was returning to dictatorship . 
That pose as democracy &apos;s guardian earned Shevardnadze independent Georgia &apos;s presidency at a time when the country was vulnerable to civil war . 
He held the post for 11 years . 
Was Shevardnadze ever honest ? 
Was he a democrat or a despot ? 
The reality of the times was that he was both . 
His death brings closer the end of the Gorbachev generation of reform communists , those who - like Shevardnadze and the late Boris Yeltsin - presented a stark contrast in the late 1980s to the dour Brezhnev-era hard-liners , spurring ( mostly inadvertently ) the collapse of the Soviet empire and the long transition to democracy . 
As Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s corrupt and authoritarian rule demonstrates every day , that transition is far from finished . 
Yet there is some good news . 
Last year , Georgia elected its new president , Giorgi Margvelashvili , through a peaceful and legitimate process ; earlier this summer , the country signed a European Union Association Agreement , implying closer connections to the West . 
None of this would have been possible without Shevardnadze &apos;s decades-long career of cunning , yet brave , political triangulation .
