Emerging Markets and Global Financial Reform 
BERKELEY - It is fitting that the upcoming G-20 summit is being held in Pittsburg , an old industrial center of an advanced industrial country , for the advanced countries have been allowed to set the agenda for strengthening financial systems . 
Other than schadenfreude , emerging markets have brought little to the table . 
The United States is emphasizing higher capital requirements . 
The Europeans are pushing for reform of compensation practices in the financial sector . 
While both proposals have merit , whether they will be enough to stabilize our dangerously unstable financial systems is at best dubious . 
What emerging markets can add to this agenda is , to put it charitably , unclear . 
They have said little about how they would reform financial systems . 
They can argue that this is not their problem - that the crisis of the last two years has been centered in the advanced economies , and that it is these countries &quot; financial systems that need to be fixed . 
But the agenda set at Pittsburgh will shape , for better or worse , not just the US and European financial systems , but also the global financial system . 
Financial markets are too integrated - and will remain so , like it or not - for whatever rules are established not to profoundly affect emerging markets . 
The first priority should be international banks . 
Until now , the international regime , led by the IMF and OECD , has pushed countries to allow foreign banks to enter their markets . 
It would be understandable if emerging markets , having seen deep problems in the conduct of foreign banks , now insist on domestic ownership and control of financial institutions . 
But a blanket policy would be a mistake . 
Contrary to concerns that foreign banks would cut and run at the first sign of trouble , in the current crisis they maintained a remarkable degree of support for their subsidiaries in emerging markets . 
Other things being equal , cross-border lending fell less in countries with significant foreign-bank presence than in emerging markets where foreign ownership of banks was not dominant . 
If anything , domestic banks with shallower pockets were more likely to cut back in the crisis . 
Some will say that Baltic and Southeast European countries were fortunate that responsible Swedish and Austrian banks , rather than their toxic US and British counterparts , had entered their markets . 
The home country must put a cap on leverage , limit acceptable liquidity and funding practices , and have a resolution regime for winding up complex financial institutions . 
Otherwise , emerging markets should be able to say that banks from that country will not be allowed to enter . 
The second priority should be defining a strict emerging-market standard for regulating foreign banks after they are allowed in . 
Other positive aspects notwithstanding , the presence of foreign banks is associated with currency mismatches . 
In Central and Eastern Europe , foreign banks extended euro- and Swiss franc-denominated corporate , home , and car loans to firms and households with incomes in local currency , which added to corporate and household financial distress when local currencies tanked . 
Austrian , Italian , and Swiss regulators , seeing that their banks &quot; assets and liabilities were in their own currencies , looked the other way . 
The implication is that emerging markets , while encouraging foreign banks &quot; entry , should at the same time strictly regulate such banks &quot; local lending practices . 
Finally , emerging markets need to redouble their efforts to build bond markets , but on a local basis . 
Countries with more developed bond markets experienced less negative fallout from the crisis , since their large firms retained access to non-bank sources of finance . 
But opening those markets to foreign investors , which has been the dominant strategy for developing them , was a mixed blessing . 
South Korea , the Asian country with the largest share of foreign investment in its securities market , also experienced the sharpest price and exchange-rate declines as those investors , mainly hedge funds , were forced to deleverage and repatriate their funds . 
Encouraging participation by foreign investors is a quick way to jump-start local bond market activity . 
Regulations limiting foreign participation to prudent levels should be part of the new international regime . 
The next chair of the G-20 will be South Korea . 
Emerging markets should start preparing now to ask it for the floor .
