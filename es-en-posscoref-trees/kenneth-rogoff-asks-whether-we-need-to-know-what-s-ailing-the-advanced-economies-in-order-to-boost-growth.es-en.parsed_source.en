What &apos;s the Problem With Advanced Economies ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Is today &apos;s slow growth in advanced economies a continuation of long-term secular decline , or does it reflect the normal aftermath of a deep systemic financial crisis ? 
More important , do we need to answer that question definitively in order to boost the pace of economic recovery ? 
At a recent International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) conference , former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers argued that today &apos;s growth blues have deep roots that pre-date the global financial crisis . 
Summers placed particular emphasis on the need for more infrastructure investment , a sentiment that most economists wholeheartedly share , especially if one is referring to genuinely productive investment . 
Others also certainly worry about secular decline , though most have emphasized the supply side rather than the demand side . 
The economist Jeffrey Sachs , for example , has argued that the US economy needs to confront a plethora of structural impediments to sustained growth , including offshoring , skill mismatches , and decaying infrastructure . 
The Internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and the legendary chess champion Garry Kasparov have suggested that the malaise runs even deeper , as has the economist Robert Gordon . 
They argue that the technology engine that has driven mankind from one economic plateau to the next over the past 200 years is running out of steam . 
Simply put , the Internet may be cool , but it is hardly as essential as running water , electrification , or the internal combustion engine . 
The Gordon-Kasparov-Thiel thesis is extremely interesting , though I have challenged their negative conclusions , both in print and in a debate at Oxford . 
Personally , I think the greater risk is that the pace of technological progress will accelerate too much for societies to adapt , though the experience so far has basically been positive . 
Certainly , today &apos;s advanced economies urgently need to address all kinds of technological , social , and political deficiencies . 
Nevertheless , the subpar growth of the past half-decade still bears all the hallmarks of a typical sluggish recovery from a deep systemic financial crisis , as Carmen Reinhart and I documented in our 2009 book This Time is Different . 
Of course , structural reform is essential after a financial crisis , as are policies to maintain aggregate demand while the economy heals . 
To my mind , the biggest failure of post-2008 economic policy has consisted in governments &quot; inability to find creative ways to write down unsustainable debts , for example in US mortgage markets , and in Europe &apos;s periphery . 
This includes the failure to issue public debt where necessary to facilitate restructuring , particularly if overall economy-wide ( or eurozone-wide ) debt could be reduced in the same operation . 
But Summers is certainly right that productive infrastructure investment is the low-hanging fruit . 
Of course , governments should be concerned about the long-term trajectory of public debt , all politically charged and polemical nonsense to the contrary . 
But productive infrastructure investment that generates long-term growth pays for itself , so there need not be any conflict between short-term stabilization and risks to long-term debt sustainability . 
With today &apos;s ultra-low interest rates and high unemployment , public investment is cheap and plenty of projects offer high returns : fixing bridges and roads , updating badly outmoded electricity grids , and improving mass-transportation systems , to take just a few notable examples . 
I appreciate that there are those who take on faith that Keynesian multipliers are much bigger than one , implying that even wasteful government spending is productive . 
But , given thin empirical evidence and legitimate concerns about undermining trust in the effectiveness of government , and with so many options for the productive use of resources , this seems like a titanic ideological distraction . 
It is also far from clear why virtually all infrastructure needs to be publicly financed . 
The government needs to help with rights of way before construction , and with strong regulation to protect the public interest afterwards . 
In his first term in office , US President Barack Obama suggested the creation of an infrastructure bank to help promote public-private partnerships . 
It is still a good idea , particularly if the bank maintained a professional staff to help guide public choice on costs and benefits ( including environmental costs and benefits ) . 
Even if Keynesian multipliers are truly at the upper end of consensus , mobilizing private capital for investment has most of the advantages of issuing public debt . 
One qualification is in order . 
Some commentators have suggested that the root cause of secular decline , as well as the main explanation of ultra-low interest rates , is low fertility throughout the advanced world . 
If true , the case for any kind of investment , public or private , would be more mixed ; there must be labor to use the capital . 
The important point is that the case for expanding productive infrastructure investment does not rest on one narrow ideological viewpoint or economic theory . 
Whether Summers is right about secular stagnation in advanced economies , or whether we are still mainly suffering the aftermath of the financial crisis , it is time to break the political gridlock and restore growth .
