The Kremlin Two Step 
Moscow - Westerners often see Russian politics in terms of a high-level struggle between liberals and conservatives : Ligachev and Yakovlev under Gorbachev ; reformers and nationalists under Yeltsin ; siloviki and economic liberals under Putin . 
They also view Russia in terms of a tradition whereby every new tsar partly repudiates the legacy of his predecessor , creating a political thaw at the beginning of a new reign . 
Khrushchev &apos;s de-Stalinization is Exhibit A. 
Both methods were used to describe the Putin-Medvedev relationship - to understand its nature and dynamic , and what it portends for Russia . 
But observers remain puzzled . 
To dismiss Medvedev as a mere Putin puppet , a constitutional bridge between Putin &apos;s second and third presidential terms , would be both unfair and wrong . 
Russia &apos;s third president has a broader role and a distinct function . 
Conversely , portraying Putin as &quot; a man from the past , &quot; and Medvedev as &quot; a hope for the future , &quot; exaggerates the differences between them and omits the more important factors that unite them . 
A better analytical model is needed . 
For all the apparent freshness of Medvedev &apos;s recent pronouncements , including his now famous article &quot; Go Russia ! &quot; - which sounded a clarion call for modernization and liberalism - he is borrowing massively from Putin &apos;s vocabulary of 2000 . 
This suggests that the issue of modernization , which lay dormant throughout the fat years of high oil prices , is back on the Kremlin agenda . 
In 2008 , Medvedev was installed in the Kremlin as part of &quot; Putin &apos;s plan , &quot; the substantive part of which was known as &quot; Strategy 2020 , &quot; a blueprint for continued economic growth and diversification . 
The intervening crisis only made the Kremlin modify and sharpen its plan . 
And Medvedev is a key agent in its execution . 
Putin chose Medvedev carefully , and not only for his unquestionable loyalty , vitally important as that is . 
He is certainly conservative , but he is also a self-described modernizer . 
As such , he might be compared to Pyotr Stolypin , another conservative prime minister who famously asked for 20 years of peace and quiet - mostly from liberals and revolutionaries - to transform Russia . 
Stolypin never got the chance - a revolutionary assassinated him in 1911 - and neither did Russia , which stumbled into World War I , leading directly to the collapse of the monarchy and the Bolshevik revolution . 
Putin wants to finish the job , and much works in his favor . 
He is the tsar . 
He has both money - the government &apos;s budget and the oligarchs &quot; fortunes - and the coercive power of the state firmly in his hand . 
He is the arbiter at the top and the trouble-shooter in social conflicts below . 
His most precious resource is his personal popularity , which a flavor of consent to his authoritarian regime . 
But none of that is good enough . 
The 75 % of Russians who make up the Putin majority are essentially passive , and seek only the preservation of a paternalistic state . 
Putin can sit on their support , but cannot ride forward with it . 
The best and brightest are not there . 
Enter Medvedev . 
His Internet-surfing , compassionate , and generally liberal image helps recruit a key constituency - those beyond the reach of Putin himself - to the Putin plan . 
Whether the plan succeeds is another matter . 
Conservative modernization is a gamble . 
To modernize Russia , one must break the stranglehold of corruption , establish accountability , and free the media . 
Either they give priority to the survival of the current system and accept Russia &apos;s steady marginalization , or they start opening up the system , putting its survival at risk . 
Given the weight of geopolitical factors in Russian decision-making , it is difficult to foretell which path they will choose . 
Putin is no King Lear . 
He understands leadership and control , and does not plan to retire . 
But Medvedev , today &apos;s front-office guy , is more of a junior partner than a simple salesperson . 
He may yet grow in stature and influence , and eventually inherit the store . 
One thing is clear , though : he does not like raw meat and the taste of blood . 
Thus , Putin &apos;s governing pact with Medvedev , his trademark creation , is likely to remain in force . 
Both members need each other . 
So the real issue is not whether the noises that Putin and Medvedev make suggest real divergence , and a potential for rivalry , but whether there is daylight at the end of the tandem . 
Or , to put it differently , whether they choose modernization or marginalization .
