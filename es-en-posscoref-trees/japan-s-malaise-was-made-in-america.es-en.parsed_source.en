Japan \ u0027s Malaise Was Made In America 
The long bureaucratic struggle over whom to name as the next Governor of the Bank of Japan is over . 
Prime Minister Koizumi has chosen a career BOJ insider , Toshihiko Fukui , a man who is unlikely to rock the boat . 
The BOJ &apos;s hidebound policies are usually blamed for Japan &apos;s deflation . 
That guilt is real , argues Deepak Lal , but there is another culprit : American economic policy toward Japan . 
It is now widely recognized that an unintended consequence of the &quot; Asian &quot; economic model was an increasingly inefficient allocation of capital . 
Japan &apos;s chronic slump is a case in point . 
Artificially low domestic interest rates in the late 1980s promoted capital-intensive investment , driving down the rate of return on capital from an average of around 12 % in 1952-1973 to less than 2 % in 1996 . 
But what still needs to be explained is the timing of Japan &apos;s boom and bust over the last 15 years , as well as the reasons for the duration of the country &apos;s ongoing slump . 
In their excellent book Dollar and Yen , Ronald McKinnon and Kenici Ohno provide an answer : the recurrence of endaka fukyo , a &quot; strong yen recession , &quot; which the authors attribute to a &quot; strong yen syndrome &quot; rooted in persistent trade frictions between the US and Japan . 
Ever since Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and exchange rates were floated worldwide , the US has sought to tackle its chronic bilateral trade deficit with Japan by pushing for a strong yen . 
Real and threatened action against Japanese exports forced Japan to comply rather than risk a trade war , with the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) delivering the requisite appreciation through tight monetary policy . 
Thus , while liberalization of Japan &apos;s capital market in the early 1980s tied Japanese and US interest-rate movements , Japanese interest rates were discounted by the expected rate of currency appreciation . 
As long as US interest rates were high , Japanese interest rates remained fairly positive , allowing the BOJ to moderate the effects of the yen &apos;s appreciation by easing domestic monetary policy . 
But this ended after 1985 , as the so-called &quot; Plaza Accord &quot; - agreed by the central banks of France , Germany , the UK , the US , and Japan - weakened the dollar by 30 % . 
Massive yen appreciation led to a Japanese recession in 1985-86 , and the BOJ lowered interest rates to near zero . 
Even with the tradable sector suffering due to the strong yen , capital-market liberalization meant that the capitalized value of future income streams , particularly from land , soared , as the interest rate at which they were discounted fell . 
This was the start of the great Japanese asset-price bubble . 
As the yen &apos;s strength undermined foreign demand for Japanese output , rising asset values turned domestic demand into the engine of the economy , and Japan rapidly grew out of the recession . 
The BOJ hailed this outcome , since it gave the tradable sector time to adjust to the stronger yen . 
The Japanese government also was happy ; having just restored fiscal balance after the oil-price shocks of the 1970 &apos;s , it was spared the need to run Keynesian-type deficits to deal with the post-1985 endaka fukyo . 
But all bubbles burst . 
By the end of the decade , the BOJ was worried by a massive appreciation in land and stock prices . 
Before long , monetary tightening accompanied renewed trade friction with the US , prompting more yen appreciation and another recession . 
It was only in 1995-96 that the US eased its position and allowed the yen to depreciate against the dollar . 
But the respite was short-lived . 
As US pressure for a strong yen resumed , Japan &apos;s economy plunged into its second endaka fukyo of the 1990s , from which it has yet to emerge . 
Successive stimulus packages failed , leaving behind a massive build-up of public debt . 
Fiscal stability , meanwhile , is already threatened by the growing pension and health-care costs implied by a rapidly aging population . 
Another asset price bubble is out of the question ; the last one left most of the domestic financial system virtually insolvent . 
So Japan &apos;s future prospects ultimately depend on the US abandoning its strong-yen policy . 
The US &apos;s policy is , in fact , economically indefensible . 
In a world of integrated capital markets and floating exchange rates , the trade balance between any two countries reflects the difference between their domestic investment and savings . 
The US has saved less than it invests for two decades , while Japan has done the reverse . 
Japan &apos;s bilateral trade surplus is nearly the same size as its savings in the US . 
As long as America borrows Japanese savings to fuel its domestic investment , a trade deficit is inevitable . 
A strong yen can not prevent this . 
When Japan &apos;s asset-price bubble burst in 1990-91 , Japanese investors pulled out of the US-leading to a credit crunch and the mild recession that torpedoed President Bush &apos;s re-election hopes in 1992 . 
But pitifully low domestic returns on capital soon spurred Japanese investors to resume foreign lending , fueling the massive investment boom of the Clinton-era &quot; new economy . &quot; 
Japan has hardly benefited . 
Although Japan is now the world &apos;s largest creditor nation and the US its largest debtor , its foreign-trade and capital flows are still largely denominated in dollars . 
Unlike past creditor nations - Great Britain in the 19th century and the US for most of the 20th - Japanese investors have borne the exchange-rate risk involved in foreign lending . 
With the dollar depreciating against the yen , the returns on their foreign investments in the 1980-90s were virtually wiped out . 
So pity the millions of aging Japanese who bailed out the world economy - America , in particular - and now have nothing to show for it .
