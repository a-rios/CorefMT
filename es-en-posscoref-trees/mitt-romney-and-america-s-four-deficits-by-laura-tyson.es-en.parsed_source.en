Mitt Romney and America &apos;s Four Deficits 
BERKELEY - The United States is beset by four deficits : a fiscal deficit , a jobs deficit , a deficit in public investment , and an opportunity deficit . 
The budget proposals put forward by presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate , Paul Ryan , could reduce the fiscal deficit , but would exacerbate the other three . 
To be sure , Romney and Ryan have failed to provide specifics about how they would reduce the fiscal deficit , relying on &quot; trust me &quot; assertions . 
But the overarching direction of their proposals is clear : more tax cuts , disproportionately benefiting those at the top , coupled with significantly lower non-defense discretionary spending , disproportionately hurting everybody else - and weakening the economy &apos;s growth prospects . 
Despite 30 months of private-sector job growth , the US still confronts a large jobs deficit . 
The unemployment rate remains more than two percentage points above the &quot; normal &quot; rate ( when the economy is operating near capacity ) . 
Moreover , the labor-force participation rate remains near historic lows . 
More than 11 million additional jobs are needed to return the US to its pre-recession employment level . 
At the current pace of recovery , that is more than eight years away . 
In the meantime , persistent high unemployment reduces the economy &apos;s growth potential by robbing today &apos;s workers of skills and experience . 
When weak aggregate demand causes the economy to operate far below its potential , cuts in government spending enlarge the jobs deficit . 
Indeed , in his recent speech in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that such cuts significantly inhibit job creation . 
Without revealing which programs he would reduce , Romney promises to slash federal spending by more than $ 500 billion in 2016 , capping it at 20 % of GDP thereafter . 
He also promises an immediate 5 % cut in non-defense discretionary spending in 2013 , on top of the huge cuts already scheduled to take effect . 
And he has ruled out additional temporary fiscal measures aimed at job creation , like President Barack Obama &apos;s proposals for additional grants to states and additional infrastructure spending . 
Romney acknowledges that large spending cuts , along with the scheduled expiration of tax cuts at the end of this year , could throw the economy back into recession in 2013 . 
But he vows to steer the economy from the fiscal cliff by extending the tax cuts enacted under George W. Bush , doubling down with a further 20 % across-the-board cut in income-tax rates and cutting the corporate rate from 35 % to 25 % . 
With the possible exception of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts , these changes would take considerable time to implement . 
Even when enacted , their near-term effects on job creation would be minimal . 
An across-the-board reduction in tax rates performs poorly in terms of budgetary effectiveness ( the number of jobs created per dollar of foregone revenue ) . 
Payroll-tax relief and spending on programs like food stamps and unemployment compensation are much more effective . 
Romney overstates his tax proposals &quot; long-term growth effects as well . 
Reducing individual tax rates and taxes on savings and investment at best fosters modest increases in employment , work effort , and income . 
Despite the Bush-era tax cuts , the 2001-2007 expansion was the worst of the post-war period in terms of investment , employment , wage , and GDP growth . 
Job creation and growth were much stronger following President Bill Clinton &apos;s tax increases in the 1990 &quot; s . 
Moreover , if all of Romney &apos;s additional tax cuts were financed in a revenue-neutral way , as he promises , only the composition of taxes would change ; the overall tax share of GDP would not . 
There is no evidence that this would significantly boost growth , as Romney claims . 
Based on what Romney has told us , we can conclude that his plan would exacerbate the public-investment deficit as well . 
Romney &apos;s vow to cap federal spending at 20 % of GDP by 2016 , while maintaining defense spending at 4 % of GDP and leaving both Social Security and Medicare unchanged for those 55 or older , implies exempting more than 50 % of government spending from cuts for the next decade . 
So , to hit the 20 % cap , spending on everything else would have to be slashed by an average of roughly 40 % by 2016 and 57 % by 2022 . 
Everything else includes government investments in three major areas on which growth and high-wage jobs depend : education , infrastructure , and research . 
These areas account for less than 8 % of federal spending , and their share has been declining steadily . 
Under Romney , it would plummet to new lows . 
Everything else also includes spending on programs that help low-income families , like food stamps , student grants , and Medicaid . 
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities finds that almost two-thirds of the Ryan budget &apos;s spending cuts would come from such programs . 
Romney offers few specifics , but simple arithmetic shows that his plan would require even deeper cuts in these programs than Ryan &apos;s plan would . 
Meanwhile , Romney &apos;s plan would actually increase taxes on middle-income families . 
His plan would pay for lower income-tax rates by eliminating tax deductions like those for charitable giving and mortgages , while maintaining tax preferences for saving and investment . 
But there are not enough tax breaks for the rich to cover another 20 % reduction in their income-tax rate . 
That is why the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that Romney &apos;s plan would cut overall taxes for households with incomes above $ 200,000 , but would require an average annual tax increase of at least $ 2,000 for households with incomes between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 . 
Romney &apos;s budget plan would also make the federal tax-and-transfer system considerably less progressive , thereby worsening income inequality , which is already at its highest level since the Great Depression . 
Rising income inequality fuels a growing opportunity deficit for children born into poor and middle-income families , reflected in disparities in educational attainment by family background , and a decline in intergenerational mobility . 
Under Romney , the opportunity deficit would widen , robbing the country of future talent and productivity . 
Romney has provided few details about his deficit-reduction plan . 
But , based on what he has revealed , we know that it would increase the jobs deficit , the investment deficit , and the opportunity deficit , with negative consequences for future growth and prosperity .
