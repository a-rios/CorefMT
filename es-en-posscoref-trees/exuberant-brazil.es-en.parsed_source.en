Exuberant Brazil 
Brazil &apos;s stock market , as measured by the inflation-corrected Bovespa index , has more than quadrupled in value since President Luis Inácio Lula da Silva &apos;s first election victory in October 2002 , and is now at almost twice the peak achieved in 2000 . 
In comparison , the inflation-corrected Shanghai Composite only doubled during this period , while the American stock market , as measured by the inflation-corrected Standard and Poor &apos;s 500 , increased only 50 % . 
Indeed , the United States has never experienced a fourfold increase in stock prices in less than five years , even during the late 1990 &quot; s bubble . 
Given that Lula is an avowed leftist who counts Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro among his friends , Brazil &apos;s performance is all the more surprising . 
How could he manage to preside over such a spectacular stock-market boom ? 
Are Brazilians too exuberant ? 
Might it be time for foreign investors to pull their money out ? 
Stock-market movements are certainly hard to explain , but there are reasons to believe that Brazilians might be rationally exuberant . 
Corporate earnings in Brazil have gone up roughly as fast as stock prices . 
With the price / earnings ratio remaining stable and moderate , the stock-market boom does not appear to reflect merely investor psychology . 
On the contrary , the real question is why the increase in stock prices has not outpaced growth in corporate earnings . 
After all , in the 1990 &quot; s , the US stock-market surge ( as in many countries ) was fueled by record-high price / earnings ratios . 
In 1998 , the price-earnings ratio in the US was 24 , compared to a historical average of around 15 . 
By contrast , the run-up in stock prices in Brazil started from a very different point , with the price-earnings ration as low as six in 1998 . 
When a stock-market boom reaches historic proportions , a story always develops to rationalize it . 
The news media typically present reasons to justify the view that the economy has entered a &quot; new era . &quot; 
Sometimes the stories are mere fabrications to validate market optimism , as with the 1990 &quot; s boom . 
But , at other times , the stories seem more solid . 
Lula has called this a &quot; magic moment &quot; for the Brazilian economy . 
While such words merit caution , economy fundamentals bear them out . 
The currency , the real , has been strengthening steadily , to nearly twice its value against the US dollar in October 2002 , when Lula was first elected . 
Inflation and interest rates are falling , the country is running a trade surplus , foreign investment is flowing in at a high rate , and the government has more than paid off its debts to foreigners , becoming a net creditor to the rest of the world . 
So stock investors seem to be recognizing Brazil &apos;s economic vitality , carefully watching corporate earnings rise , and running with them . 
After being lone believers through 2002 , Brazilian stock market participants are now finding that investors from all over the world want to join the party . 
Nevertheless , given corruption scandals involving prominent government figures that have come to light over the past few years , it is natural to wonder why the stock market has remained so strong . 
Why haven &apos;t the stories of corruption caused a crisis , as similar scandals did in Korea and Malaysia during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 ? 
Indeed , while the scandals have shaken the government , Lula was overwhelmingly reelected last year , and investors continue to pour money into the stock market . 
One reason is that the corruption scandals have provided an opportunity for investors to see Brazilian freedom of speech and democracy in action . 
Newspapers and television commentators have been relentless in reporting the scandals , helping to prove to Brazilians and foreign investors alike that the political system is sufficiently stable to withstand open criticism . 
Lula remains popular with Brazilians because his populist rhetoric shows real sympathy with the less affluent , and with foreign investors because he has always tempered his radicalism to accommodate economic reality . 
He recently criticized Bolivian President Evo Morales &apos;s threats to seize foreign assets for his failure in this regard : &quot; Radicalism is incompatible with the common sense needed from someone who governs . &quot; 
That combination of philosophical radicalism and economic pragmatism has proven to be a perfect formula for Brazil &apos;s progress . 
Granted , the future is unknown ; we have no crystal ball to predict the Bovespa &apos;s likely path . 
But , for me , the story is far more convincing than the one told during the 1990 &quot; s stock-market boom .
