Is Iran Next ? 
Can politics learn from history ? 
Or is it subject to a fatal compulsion to repeat the same mistakes , despite the disastrous lessons of the past ? 
President Bush &apos;s new strategy for Iraq has posed anew this age-old philosophical and historical question . 
Ostensibly , President Bush has embarked on a new political and military strategy for the war-torn Iraq . 
Bush &apos;s new course can be summarized under three headings : more American troops , more Iraqi responsibility , and more US training for more Iraqi troops . 
If you apply this new plan to Iraq alone , two things immediately catch the eye : almost all the proposals of the Baker-Hamilton report have been ignored , and the plan itself - in the face of the chaos in Iraq - is quite simplistic . 
In light of the failure of all previous &quot; new strategies &quot; for stabilizing Iraq , there is little to suggest that the newest &quot; new strategy &quot; will succeed any better , despite the additional 21,000 US soldiers . 
What is interesting and really new in the US administration &apos;s recently announced policy is the way it reaches beyond Iraq , to deal with Iran , Syria , and the Gulf states . 
Here , unexpected and genuinely new decisions have been announced : an additional US aircraft carrier group will be moved to the Persian Gulf ; 
So one wonders about the purpose of this military build-up ? 
One might almost think that Saddam was still alive and in power , so his overthrow had to be prepared all over again . 
The surprise of Bush &apos;s new policy is its shift of political focus from Iraq to its two immediate neighbors . 
Bush accuses Syria and Iran of interfering in Iraq , threatening its territorial integrity and endangering American troops , and , more generally , of seeking to undermine America &apos;s allies in the region . 
If you add to this the seizure , on President Bush &apos;s orders , of Iranian &quot; diplomats &quot; by US forces in the northern Iraqi town of Erbil , a completely new picture of the President &apos;s plan comes to the fore : the &quot; new strategy &quot; does not follow the advice of the Baker-Hamilton report , but harks back to the disastrous strategy of the neo-cons . 
Iran is now in the superpower &apos;s sights , and the US approach brings to mind the preparatory phase of the Iraq war - down to the last detail . 
Where does all this lead ? 
Basically , there are two possibilities , one positive and one negative . 
Unfortunately , the positive outcome appears to be the less likely one . 
If the threat of force - a force that the US is quite obviously building - aims at preparing the ground for serious negotiations with Iran , there can and should be no objection . 
If , on the other hand , it represents an attempt to prepare the American public for a war against Iran , and a genuine intention to unleash such a war when the opportunity arises , the outcome would be an unmitigated disaster . 
Unfortunately , this danger is all too real . 
Since the Bush administration views Iran &apos;s nuclear program and hegemonic aspirations as the major threat to the region , its new strategy is based on a newly formed undeclared anti-Iranian alliance with moderate Sunni Arab states and Israel . 
The nuclear program is the dynamic factor here , because it will set a timeline for action . 
But air strikes on Iran , which America may see as a military solution , would not make Iraq safer ; they would achieve exactly the opposite . 
Nor would the region as a whole be stabilized ; on the contrary , it would be plunged into an abyss . 
And the dream of &quot; regime change &quot; in Tehran would not come true , either ; rather , Iran &apos;s democratic opposition would pay a high price , and the theocratic regime would only become stronger . 
The political options for stabilizing Iraq , and the whole region , as well as for securing a long-term freeze of Iran &apos;s nuclear program , have not yet been exhausted . 
The current state of Iran &apos;s nuclear program does not call for immediate military action . 
Instead , the focus should be on diplomatic efforts to detach Syria from Iran and isolate the Tehran regime . 
But this presupposes American willingness to return to diplomacy and talking to all the parties involved . 
Tehran is afraid of regional and international isolation . 
Moreover , the recent municipal elections in Iran have shown that betting on diplomacy and a transformation of Iran from within is a realistic option . 
So why the current threats against Iran ? 
The debacle in Iraq was foreseeable from the beginning , and America &apos;s numerous partners and friends predicted it quite clearly in their warnings to the Bush administration . 
The mistake that the US may be about to make is equally predictable : a war that is wrong will not be made right by extending it - that is the lesson of Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia . 
The ideologically driven strategy of regime change by means of military force led the US into the Iraq war disaster . 
Getting into Iraq and defeating Saddam was easy . 
But today , America is stuck there and knows neither how to win nor how to get out . 
A mistake is not corrected by repeating it over and over again . 
Perseverance in error does not correct the error ; it merely exacerbates it . 
Following the launch of the new American policy , the old question of whether politics can learn from history will be answered again in the Middle East . 
Whatever the answer , the consequences - whether good or bad - will be far-reaching .
