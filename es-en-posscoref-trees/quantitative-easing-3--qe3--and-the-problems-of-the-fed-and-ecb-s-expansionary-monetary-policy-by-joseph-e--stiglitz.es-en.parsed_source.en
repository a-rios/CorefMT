Monetary Mystification 
NEW YORK - Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic took extraordinary monetary-policy measures in September : the long awaited &quot; QE3 &quot; ( the third dose of quantitative easing by the United States Federal Reserve ) , and the European Central Bank &apos;s announcement that it will purchase unlimited volumes of troubled eurozone members &quot; government bonds . 
Markets responded euphorically , with stock prices in the US , for example , reaching post-recession highs . 
Others , especially on the political right , worried that the latest monetary measures would fuel future inflation and encourage unbridled government spending . 
In fact , both the critics &quot; fears and the optimists &quot; euphoria are unwarranted . 
With so much underutilized productive capacity today , and with immediate economic prospects so dismal , the risk of serious inflation is minimal . 
Nonetheless , the Fed and ECB actions sent three messages that should have given the markets pause . 
First , they were saying that previous actions have not worked ; indeed , the major central banks deserve much of the blame for the crisis . 
But their ability to undo their mistakes is limited . 
Second , the Fed &apos;s announcement that it will keep interest rates at extraordinarily low levels through mid-2015 implied that it does not expect recovery anytime soon . 
That should be a warning for Europe , whose economy is now far weaker than America &apos;s . 
Finally , the Fed and the ECB were saying that markets will not quickly restore full employment on their own . 
A stimulus is needed . 
That should serve as a rejoinder to those in Europe and America who are calling for just the opposite - further austerity . 
But the stimulus that is needed - on both sides of the Atlantic - is a fiscal stimulus . 
Monetary policy has proven ineffective , and more of it is unlikely to return the economy to sustainable growth . 
In traditional economic models , increased liquidity results in more lending , mostly to investors and sometimes to consumers , thereby increasing demand and employment . 
But consider a case like Spain , where so much money has fled the banking system - and continues to flee as Europe fiddles over the implementation of a common banking system . 
Just adding liquidity , while continuing current austerity policies , will not reignite the Spanish economy . 
So , too , in the US , the smaller banks that largely finance small and medium-size enterprises have been all but neglected . 
The federal government - under both President George W. Bush and Barack Obama - allocated hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up the mega-banks , while allowing hundreds of these crucially important smaller lenders to fail . 
But lending would be inhibited even if the banks were healthier . 
After all , small enterprises rely on collateral-based lending , and the value of real estate - the main form of collateral - is still down one-third from its pre-crisis level . 
Moreover , given the magnitude of excess capacity in real estate , lower interest rates will do little to revive real-estate prices , much less inflate another consumption bubble . 
Of course , marginal effects cannot be ruled out : small changes in long-term interest rates from QE3 may lead to a little more investment ; some of the rich will take advantage of temporarily higher stock prices to consume more ; and a few homeowners will be able to refinance their mortgages , with lower payments allowing them to boost consumption as well . 
But most of the wealthy know that temporary measures result only in a fleeting blip in stock prices - hardly enough to support a consumption splurge . 
Moreover , reports suggest that few of the benefits of lower long-term interest rates are filtering through to homeowners ; the major beneficiaries , it seems , are the banks . 
Many who want to refinance their mortgages still cannot , because they are &quot; underwater &quot; ( owing more on their mortgages than the underlying property is worth ) . 
In other circumstances , the US would benefit from the exchange-rate weakening that follows from lower interest rates - a kind of beggar-thy-neighbor competitive devaluation that would come at the expense of America &apos;s trading partners . 
But , given lower interest rates in Europe and the global slowdown , the gains are likely to be small even here . 
Some worry that the fresh liquidity will lead to worse outcomes - for example , a commodity boom , which would act much like a tax on American and European consumers . 
Older people , who were prudent and held their money in government bonds , will see lower returns - further curtailing their consumption . 
And low interest rates will encourage firms that do invest to spend on fixed capital like highly automated machines , thereby ensuring that , when recovery comes , it will be relatively jobless . 
In short , the benefits are at best small . 
In Europe , monetary intervention has greater potential to help - but with a similar risk of making matters worse . 
To allay anxiety about government profligacy , the ECB built conditionality into its bond-purchase program . 
But if the conditions operate like austerity measures - imposed without significant accompanying growth measures - they will be more akin to bloodletting : the patient must risk death before receiving genuine medicine . 
Fear of losing economic sovereignty will make governments reluctant to ask for ECB help , and only if they ask will there be any real effect . 
There is a further risk for Europe : If the ECB focuses too much on inflation , while the Fed tries to stimulate the US economy , interest-rate differentials will lead to a stronger euro ( at least relative to what it otherwise would be ) , undermining Europe &apos;s competitiveness and growth prospects . 
For both Europe and America , the danger now is that politicians and markets believe that monetary policy can revive the economy . 
Unfortunately , its main impact at this point is to distract attention from measures that would truly stimulate growth , including an expansionary fiscal policy and financial-sector reforms that boost lending . 
The current downturn , already a half-decade long , will not end any time soon . 
That , in a nutshell , is what the Fed and the ECB are saying . 
The sooner our leaders acknowledge it , the better .
