Israel &apos;s Dangerous Political System 
PARIS - What is wrong with Israel ? 
In the last few years , the Jewish state seems to have done more than all of its combined enemies to delegitimize itself in the eyes of the world . 
Its leaders &quot; apparent inability to think in strategic terms , and their indifference to the tribunal of global public opinion , is resulting in growing frustration among its citizens and , what may be more dangerous , deepening international isolation . 
Where should one look for an explanation for this tragic evolution ? 
Was it simply inevitable for a people who , deprived of a state for more than 2,000 years , may have lost the ability to act collectively in a &quot; raison d &quot; Ã©tat &quot; manner ? 
Or perhaps the weight of Holocaust remembrance has blinded Israel &apos;s leaders and distorted their thinking - in ways that , at the time the State of Israel was created , the Holocaust itself almost miraculously did not . 
Certainly , the failure of the peace process in the 1990 &quot; s , followed by the coming of the second Intifada , appears to have encouraged the radicalization of Israel &apos;s extremes while discouraging moderates . 
And the revival of religious parties - in a country created by avowed secularists - opened the way for a more politically powerful but also more nationalistic and intolerant setting . 
One could also ask whether the arrival of one million &quot; Russians , &quot; regardless of their actual ties to Judaism , had a negative effect on Israeli society , by encouraging ideological rigidity and a disdain for democracy that did not prevail before . 
Or is the explanation for Israel &apos;s current predicament to be found on the more prosaic terrain of the country &apos;s dysfunctional democracy ? 
In reality , all these explanations are largely complementary ; none is in contradiction with the others . 
But the most important cause , the one that should be addressed before all others because it is eroding Israel &apos;s very viability , is the near paralysis of the political system . 
Italy can survive being badly governed and with a high level of corruption because it is surrounded by the peaceful environment of the European Union . 
This is not true of Israel . 
Protected by a &quot; security wall &quot; on one side and the sea on the other , Israeli citizens may enjoy the feeling of living on an artificial island from which they can connect directly to the areas of modernity and prosperity in Asia and the West . 
Yet they are surrounded by a sea of angry and frustrated people , and cannot escape the logic of the region they inhabit . 
Israel &apos;s political system , through its complex mechanisms of rigged party selection and absolute proportionality , condemns the country to weak coalition governments and escalating corruption . 
It must be reformed urgently . 
Government leaders in Israel cannot afford to spend 90 % of their time thinking about how to survive politically at a time when the state &apos;s right to exist is being challenged . 
To make of their country a pariah is a political , strategic , and moral failure for the leaders of Israel . 
Those leaders &quot; strategic decisions over the last few years , if not longer , have been rather consistently poor , or at least imprudent . 
This systematic miscalculation can be explained as follows . 
From the 2006 war in Lebanon to the recent deadly raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla , Israeli leaders have badly appreciated the ratio between military gains and political risks , and the necessary proportionality between the two . 
This is all the more dangerous for Israel in view of the apparent decline in its operational military capabilities . 
Even the operation in Gaza in 2008-2009 , despite its apparent military success , was highly damaging for Israel in political terms . 
As Israel &apos;s political center of gravity has shifted to the right , if not the extreme right , one consequence whose long-term effects are not sufficiently appreciated is the growing alienation of Arab citizens , who represent 20 % of the population . 
Yesterday , they felt discriminated against . 
Today , they feel &quot; occupied &quot; by a nation of which they can never be a part , and by a state that they perceive as &quot; democratic &quot; for its Jewish citizens only and &quot; Jewish &quot; for its Arab citizens . 
The process of isolation of Israel starts in the heads of its citizens , and is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
History has taught the Jewish people that they can count only on themselves for protection and survival . 
Yesterday , intelligence without power led to immense suffering . 
But today , power without intelligence creates immense dangers not only for the Israel , but for the Jewish people at large . 
Israel is too small to act foolishly . 
It desperately needs allies whose populations accept what it is and respect what it does . 
There will come a moment when Israel &apos;s actions will incite people - not only the most fanatical of the country &apos;s foes , but also the most generously inclined of its supporters - to question Israel &apos;s essence . 
Whether or not this moment has already come , Israel cannot continue to be misgoverned in the way that it is . 
Reform of the country &apos;s political system has simply become a matter of life and death .
