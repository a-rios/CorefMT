Europe &apos;s Middle East Mission 
LONDON - America &apos;s gradual withdrawal from the Middle East puts increasing pressure on Europe to help foster peace in the region . 
With complex and heated wars threatening to bring about the collapse of states like Syria and Iraq , and the long-simmering conflict between Israel and Palestine seemingly as far from resolution as ever , it is almost easier to ask what Europe should avoid than what it should do . 
The starting point must be a simple , fundamental principle : Europe should not take sides . 
Allowing preconceptions or emotional reactions to overshadow facts could make the situation much more dangerous . 
Consider sectarian struggle between Sunni and Shia Muslims - now the prime mover of events in the Middle East . 
Fueled by religious rhetoric and a bloody history , the conflict engenders a degree of passion and irrationality that is difficult to moderate . 
As has been said : &quot; Where the fires of faith are burning , the goddess of reason tiptoes silently out of the room . &quot; 
Likewise , when it comes to the Israel-Palestine conflict , Europe must recognize that both sides are hypersensitive . 
If they are faced with criticism that they deem unfair , they will resort to the kind of truculence and bitterness that has long thwarted efforts to reach an agreement . 
At least two-thirds of Israelis , recognizing the benefits that lasting peace would bring to the region , would prefer a two-state solution . 
But the same majority fears that the Palestinians - with the split leadership of a relatively moderate Fatah under Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a Gaza administration under the implacable , terror-supporting leadership of Hamas - are not ready for a conventional peace and good neighborly relations . 
Making matters worse , concessions on either side appear to leave no impression on the other . 
On the contrary , they are usually met with lethal provocations that push any agreement even further away . 
Palestine &apos;s response to Israel &apos;s release in December of 26 political prisoners - the third batch from a total of 104 detainees that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu pledged to release when the peace talks were revived last summer - is a case in point . 
Many of the prisoners had committed heinous acts of terror . 
For example , Juma Ibrahim Juma Adam and Mahmoud Salam Saliman Abu Karbish firebombed a civilian bus , killing a pregnant woman , three of her preschool-age children , and the Israeli soldier who tried to save them . 
Yet Abbas received them upon their release , praising them as heroes of the Palestinian people and examples for Palestinian youth . 
In this fragile context , EU threats to halt business with Israeli companies present in the country &apos;s West Bank settlements are problematic , as are academic and scientific boycotts against Israel . 
Indeed , such moves would be dangerously close to favoring Palestine - a sure-fire way to turn Israel against cooperation . 
Of course , given the role that the continual expansion of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine has played in hampering progress toward peace , it merits a more thorough and sober examination by all relevant parties - especially Israel . 
This requires , first and foremost , an understanding of the issue &apos;s scale . 
During previous rounds of negotiations , the Palestinian Authority agreed , in principle , to exchange up to 1.9 % of West Bank land for Israeli territory . 
This means that Israel would be able to annex some settlements adjacent to its border , while giving up only a small share of its land - an exchange to which it should be open when serious negotiations are underway . 
The good news is that Tzipi Livni , Israel &apos;s main negotiator , recently stated that Israel would not claim isolated settlements on Arab land . 
Through all of this , Europe must present itself as an unbiased mediator . 
If negotiators on both sides view it as a credible broker of a lasting and balanced agreement , they may be more receptive to each other &apos;s concessions . 
The same is true of religious conflicts throughout the Middle East . 
Instead of getting sucked into historical enmities and impassioned disputes , Europe must be resolved to fight implacably against all forms of jihadism , while consistently supporting progress toward conflict resolution . 
This does not apply only to diplomats ; the European media also have a critical role to play . 
New and traditional outlets alike must ensure that they portray the facts accurately and dispassionately , in order to foster a constructive , fair-minded discussion . 
Those directly involved in the Middle East &apos;s myriad conflicts do not need any help generating heat .
