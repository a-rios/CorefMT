A New Vision for the World Bank 
LIMA - Finance ministers , central bankers , and development economists are gathering in Lima , Peru , for the World Bank &apos;s annual meetings , where the debate will focus on how the institution &apos;s agenda fits our changing world . 
Holding the event in a developing country represents a welcome shift from the usual Washington , DC venue . 
The World Bank &apos;s current mission - to end extreme poverty within a generation and boost shared prosperity - is undoubtedly important . 
But , by reframing that mission to emphasize support for member governments &quot; pursuit of inclusive and sustainable growth , the Bank could do even more good . 
Such an approach would reflect and reinforce the recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , which will guide global development efforts until 2030 . 
And , far from excluding the current goal of ending poverty , it would embrace poverty reduction as an outcome of building stable , prosperous societies , in which citizens , through their taxes , are able and willing to fund capable and responsive states that honor agreed global standards and rules . 
Such a reframed mission would align the World Bank more closely with its founders &quot; original vision of a &quot; global credit cooperative &quot; generating benefits for all members through collective action . 
That vision was built on a simple and brilliant idea : to borrow against the secure capital of creditor members ( at the time , primarily the US ) and lend to members where investment capital was scarce and returns would be high . 
That idea took advantage of the positive externality associated with borrowing costs as low as those merited by the credit risk of any single creditor ( or lower ) . 
A return to that original dynamic would be good for everyone , from creditor countries ( which would benefit from a more stable global system ) to borrowers ( whose economies would enjoy faster growth and poverty reduction ) . 
Moreover , re-casting the World Bank &apos;s mission in this way taps the Bank &apos;s distinct comparative advantage relative to the dozens of bilateral aid agencies and hundreds of non-governmental organizations that work in developing countries . 
This makes the Bank &apos;s involvement particularly valuable . 
The World Bank has knowledge and experience in sectors as diverse as infrastructure , agriculture , health , education , pensions , and financial regulation . 
It has the ability to deploy a variety of financing and risk-sharing instruments in support of both private and public investment . 
And its staff possesses unparalleled expertise about individual countries , including insight into the difficult local politics that sometimes inhibit the reforms needed to ensure returns on investment . 
In adapting its mission to twenty-first-century needs , the World Bank should also take on the responsibility of providing development-relevant global public goods . 
Today , the biggest risks to stable and prosperous societies - such as unabated climate change , overwhelming pandemics , and the rise of antimicrobial resistance - are global in nature , and therefore need to be addressed collectively . 
Given that the returns on investment in development-relevant global public goods are collectively high , but remain limited on a country-by-country basis , this is an ideal area of focus for the World Bank as a global cooperative . 
Specifically , the Bank should become a prime mover in fostering investments to promote environmental sustainability ; supporting research in agriculture , health , and clean energy ; and collecting and analyzing economic and social data . 
Of course , it need not assume responsibility for providing all of these public goods . 
To succeed , the Bank must broaden its toolkit beyond country-specific loans - the key instrument on which it has relied for seven decades . 
For this , it needs a clear mandate from member countries , as well as new instruments for financial and technical assistance that are geared toward the provision of development-relevant global public goods . 
The final internal shift that must occur involves just one member : the US . 
During the last half-century , America has been a reasonably good steward of international stability - a kind of benign bully operating in the collective interest . 
But while the US remains an economic and military superpower , other countries are catching up fast . 
And the US seems unwilling to make space for them , as evidenced by its resistance to the establishment of the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank . 
The US should recognize that , while still globally powerful , it must now lead more by influence and persuasion , and less by holding fast to the rules and customs set 70 years ago , when it was , for all practical purposes , the sole creditor backing the creation of new international financial institutions . 
So in Lima this week , the discussion of China &apos;s economic health and the Fed &apos;s timetable for interest rate hikes must be accompanied by a genuine debate on the need for these three shifts . 
With a reframed mission , an updated agenda , and a more inclusive US , the Bank would be well positioned to play a pivotal role in advancing the kind of development the world needs now .
