America \ u0027s Retreat from Asia 
The United States &apos; planned withdrawal of troops from Asia , which President George W. Bush announced on August 16 , need not harm peace and stability in the region and particularly in Korea . 
South Korea and Japan need to have their views taken into serious account if this now inevitable withdrawal is to succeed . 
By contrast , unilaterally announcing the withdrawal - and then unilaterally implementing it - may harm the very purpose that the remaining US troops in Asia are intended to serve : assuring deterrence , stability , and nonproliferation in Korea and Asia . 
The withdrawal plan is causing countless worries . 
In Japan , there are concerns that it will make the country America &apos;s frontline command post in Asia , possibly beyond the scope of its bilateral security treaty with the US . 
One result is that China feels nervous about the implications of any expansion of the American-Japanese military partnership . 
But the impact of America &apos;s planned troop withdrawals is felt most keenly in South Korea . 
In June , the Bush administration revealed its plan to withdraw some 12,500 of the 37,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea by the end of 2005 . 
These include 3,600 troops from the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division , who are already earmarked for redeployment in Iraq . 
The US Defense Department justifies this change as part of the so-called &quot; Global Posture Review &quot; that it has been carrying out to provide more flexibility and mobility in deploying troops to more urgently needed places around the world . 
South Koreans genuinely fear that the plan may weaken deterrence by sending North Korea - which is demanding a US military withdrawal while refusing to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions - the message that intransigence pays . 
Indeed , it should not be forgotten that North Korea maintains an army of 1.1 million troops . 
Moreover , the manner in which the Bush administration unveiled its withdrawal plan has weakened the credibility of the US-Korean alliance . 
America &apos;s unilateral announcement has fuelled rumors to the effect that withdrawal must have something to do with the rising tide of anti-Americanism in South Korea , and especially with the country &apos;s reluctance and delay in dispatching an additional 3,600 of its own soldiers to Iraq . 
The Bush administration tries to rebut these charges by saying that the plan will not weaken the deterrence capabilities of American forces , for America &apos;s far more powerful air and naval presence in the area will be maintained . 
Moreover , the US plans to strengthen South Korea &apos;s own forces by supplying some $ 11 billion worth of high-technology equipment over the next five years . 
Militarily , this argument does make sense . 
Politically and psychologically , however , the method , let alone the timing and implementation of the withdrawals , raises many questions about the ongoing viability of the US-Korean security alliance , for the alliance now seems adrift , without a common purpose and with little direction from either side . 
Yet the Bush administration insists : &quot; The US views South Korea as a strong and steadfast ally . 
We are committed to South Korea &apos;s security and to our alliance and partnership with Seoul . &quot; 
If Washington is serious about these words , it should transform this commitment into a long-term and comprehensive alliance that can survive the current estrangement - and continue even after Korean unification - by making a joint declaration with South Korea &apos;s government at the highest level . 
In order to allay misgivings and restore trust in the alliance , it is necessary for the US and South Korea to reaffirm their common interests and values in pursuing deterrence , nonproliferation , stability , and democracy on the Korean peninsula and across Asia . 
Once they resolve to continue their alliance with these purposes in mind , it should be possible for responsible officials to work out guiding principles for concrete security cooperation . 
Specific negotiations on withdrawing American troops from Korea or on redeploying them from the DMZ to south of Seoul must be carried out according to these principles . 
In so doing , America must treat South Korea as a full partner with its own voice in making decisions that affect its security interests . 
As an American ally for 51 years , and as East Asia &apos;s third-largest economy , South Korea is entitled to be fully consulted on such decisions . 
Despite anti-American sentiments among some South Koreans , a majority of the country &apos;s people wants American forces to remain as a stabilizing force . 
Securing a peaceful and nuclear-free Korean peninsula , a place where the interests of China , Japan , Russia , and America directly intersect , is one of the most important security goals anywhere on the planet . 
For this reason , America and South Korea must restore a strategic vision for the future .
