The Last Guerrillas 
BOGOTÁ - During the Cold War , tensions between the West and the Soviet Union affected virtually all countries worldwide . 
As a result , throughout Latin America , guerrilla groups emerged , seeking to destabilize military dictatorships and attain democracy , freedom , and policy reform - goals that they believed could not be achieved peacefully . 
Above all , it was the Cuban Revolution of 1959 - in which armed revolutionaries successfully overthrew the military dictator Fulgencio Batista - that inspired this movement . 
Indeed , Che Guevara , an icon of the revolution , died in Bolivia while attempting to export the guerrilla project . 
At the end of 2012 , conditions in Latin America are very different . 
Democracy is not the exception , but the rule ; military regimes have succumbed to the power of the ballot box ; and guerrilla groups have largely become a relic of the past . 
But Colombia - the region &apos;s oldest and most stable democracy - is still plagued by illegal , armed guerilla organizations . 
Unlike in other countries , where guerrillas pursued exclusively political demands , Colombia &apos;s guerilla groups became involved in drug trafficking , which transformed them into lethal institutional monsters , one part subversive organization and one part criminal mafia . 
In response , citizens illegally formed armed self-defense groups . 
As a result , generations of Colombians have grown up surrounded by violence , never having known real peace . 
Former members of several of the guerrilla groups that arose during the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s have been reintegrated into Colombian society following peace agreements . 
Some have even held important political positions , serving as ministers , members of congress , governors , and mayors . 
Nowadays , only two groups remain immersed in an anachronistic struggle : the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces ( FARC ) , the larger , older , and better funded of the two , and the National Liberation Army ( ELN ) . 
After winning the presidency in 2002 , Álvaro Uribe vowed to defeat the guerrillas - who have added terrorism to their repertoire - mounting an offensive that employed all of the power of the state and its law-enforcement authorities . 
I have had the opportunity - first as Uribe &apos;s defense minister , and now as President - to deal the strongest blows to the guerrillas and drug-trafficking gangs . 
The government &apos;s commitment to the fight against terrorism has already caused FARC &apos;s membership to plummet , from more than 20,000 a decade ago to little more than 8,000 today . 
We will not let up until Colombia is free of guerilla armies . 
Last month , after nearly two years of exploratory conversations , formal peace talks were initiated in Oslo , Norway . 
This month , the talks moved to Havana , Cuba , where they will be held until their conclusion . 
The talks will be direct , will follow a brief and precise thematic agenda , and will be conducted within a defined time horizon . 
Norway and Cuba have served not only as host countries , but also as guarantors of the dialogues . 
The Colombian people are counting on the talks to result in agreement on a clear path toward the end of internal armed conflict . 
This opportunity must not be wasted . 
The peace talks will not paralyze the state or weaken its ability to act . 
Indeed , until a final agreement is reached , Colombian law-enforcement authorities will continue to confront forcefully all illegal armed groups whose members insist on threatening the peace and lives of the Colombian people . 
Moreover , the government will continue to take action to build peace . 
The serious , realistic , and sober peace process that we have begun with the FARC could end the internal armed conflict in Colombia , implying the defeat , once and for all , of the continent &apos;s guerrilla groups and bringing down the curtain on a half-century of senseless violence . 
Indeed , this outcome would contribute to peace and stability for the entire region . 
The conflict &apos;s end would also bolster development efforts in Colombia - already a model of democracy and political and economic stability . 
Even in the wake of the global economic crisis , Colombia &apos;s economy has been growing at an average rate of close to 5 % , while benefiting from unprecedented inflows of foreign investment . And Colombian governance is admired worldwide . Reaching an agreement with the FARC to end the conflict - which implies the group &apos;s disarmament and demobilization - would allow Colombia &apos;s star to shine more brightly than ever . The Colombian government is committed to making every possible effort to realize the dream of a guerilla-free country - and continent - in 2013 .
