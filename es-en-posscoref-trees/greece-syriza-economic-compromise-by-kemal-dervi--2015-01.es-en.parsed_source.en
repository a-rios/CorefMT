Still No Exit for Greece 
WASHINGTON , DC - Opinion polls in the run-up to Greece &apos;s early general election on January 25 indicate that the left-wing Syriza party is likely to win the largest share of votes . 
As a result , Syriza stands to earn a crucial premium under Greek electoral law , according to which the party that gains the most votes is allocated an extra 50 of the parliament &apos;s 300 seats . 
In other words , Syriza could come to power , with enormous implications for Greece and Europe . 
Syriza is more a coalition than a unified party , meaning that its leader , Alexis Tsipras , must reconcile moderate socialists , including some of his economic advisers , with radical left-wing members . 
The implementation and impact of Syriza &apos;s agenda , especially its decisive economic program , will depend on the new government &apos;s ability to maintain support at home and compromise with Greece &apos;s creditors abroad . 
Syriza &apos;s economic program rejects the austerity policies supported - or , some might say , imposed - by the so-called &quot; troika &quot; ( the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission ) . 
These policies require Greece to maintain a very high primary budget surplus - more than 4 % of GDP - for many years to come . 
Syriza also plans to demand a substantial reduction in Greece &apos;s foreign debt , the nominal value of which remains very high - close to 170 % of GDP . 
In fact , the real present value of the debt is much lower , given that most of it is now held by governments or other public entities and carries long maturities and low interest rates . 
Nonetheless , repayment &quot; spikes &quot; this year constitute a real short-term challenge . 
The problem for Greece is that its creditors may adopt a very tough stance . 
This largely reflects the belief that , if a breakdown of negotiations triggers another Greek crisis , the systemic risks to the eurozone and the wider European Union would be far smaller than they were just a few years ago . 
The &quot; acute &quot; phase of the euro crisis is over ; even if growth remains elusive , financial contagion is no longer viewed as a risk . 
After all , private creditors hold only a minimal share of Greek debt nowadays . 
In 2010-2012 , by contrast , systemically important European banks were exposed , raising the risk of a domino effect that threatened the entire eurozone . 
Moreover , a debt reduction in the form of further interest-rate reductions and maturity extensions on foreign government-held debt would not hurt financial markets . 
If Greece &apos;s new government does not tread lightly in these discussions , withdrawal of these institutions &quot; liquidity support for Greek banks could follow . 
Despite the lack of significant financial contagion risk , a renewed Greek crisis , stemming from a lasting and serious breakdown of negotiations between the new government and EU institutions , would constitute a major problem for European cooperation . 
The absence of financial contagion would not rule out serious political repercussions . 
Europe &apos;s political landscape is changing . 
Populist parties , both on the far right and the far left , are gaining electoral traction . 
Some , such as France &apos;s National Front , oppose their country &apos;s eurozone membership ; others , such as Podemos in Spain , do not . 
Nonetheless , the challenge that these new parties pose to Europe could prove to be extremely disruptive . 
A Greek exit from the eurozone , together with financial and political turmoil inside Greece , would be perceived as a major defeat for European integration - especially after the laborious efforts made to hold together the monetary union and , with it , the European dream . 
Such an outcome would be even more disheartening in light of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris , and after unity marches in France and across the continent rekindled a long-fading sense of European solidarity . 
A new image of solidarity is precisely what the Greek election should produce . 
There is little doubt that the suffering that Greeks have had to endure for the last five years is mainly attributable to the fiscal profligacy and poor public management of a procession of Greek governments . 
For the sake of Greece and Europe , the new government must work with the European institutions to revise their strategy , while taking responsibility for implementing growth-promoting structural reforms . 
Greece &apos;s creditors and partners , for their part , must provide the fiscal space needed for the reforms to work . 
Walking away from Greece because it no longer poses a threat of financial contagion is not a politically viable option . 
Both sides will have to show more foresight . 
The last five years have provided two clear lessons for Europe : procrastination only makes reform more difficult , and the end of financial turmoil does not necessarily mean the end of socioeconomic crisis . 
It is time to use these lessons to develop a cooperative strategy that will finally enable Greece to make real progress toward a more stable future . 
A Greek exit from the euro is not a more viable solution today than it was three years ago .
