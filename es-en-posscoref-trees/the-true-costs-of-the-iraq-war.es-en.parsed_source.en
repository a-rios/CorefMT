The True Costs of the Iraq War 
The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless . 
But that doesn &apos;t mean that issues involving the preservation of life ( or a way of life ) , like defense , should not be subjected to cool , hard economic analysis . 
Shortly before the current Iraq war , when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $ 100 and $ 200 billion , other officials quickly demurred . 
For example , Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $ 60 billion . 
It now appears that Lindsey &apos;s numbers were a gross underestimate . 
Concerned that the Bush administration might be misleading everyone about the Iraq war &apos;s costs , just as it had about Iraq &apos;s weapons of mass destruction and connection with Al Qaida , I teamed up with Linda Bilmes , a budget expert at Harvard , to examine the issue . 
Even we , as opponents of the war , were staggered by what we found , with conservative to moderate estimates ranging from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than $ 2 trillion . 
Our analysis starts with the $ 500 billion that the Congressional Budget Office openly talks about , which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the war would cost . 
Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government . 
And the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole . 
For example , the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded - 16,000 so far , including roughly 20 % with serious brain and head injuries . 
So it is no surprise that its figure of $ 500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come . 
Nor does the administration want to face up to the military &apos;s recruiting and retention problems . 
The result is large re-enlistment bonuses , improved benefits , and higher recruiting costs - up 20 % just from 2003 to 2005 . 
Moreover , the war is extremely wearing on equipment , some of which will have to be replaced . 
These budgetary costs ( exclusive of interest ) amount to $ 652 billion in our conservative estimate and $ 799 billion in our moderate estimate . 
Arguably , since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes , the expenditures have been debt financed , and the interest costs on this debt add another $ 98 billion ( conservative ) to $ 385 billion ( moderate ) to the budgetary costs . 
Of course , the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families . 
But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings . 
Similarly , payments for those who are killed amount to only $ 500,000 , which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death , sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ( $ 6.1 to $ 6.5 million ) . 
But the costs don &apos;t stop there . 
The Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy , with one spokesperson even suggesting that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices . 
As in so many other ways , things have turned out differently : the oil companies are the big winners , while the American and global economies are losers . 
Being extremely conservative , we estimate the overall effect on the economy if only $ 5 or $ 10 of the increase is attributed to the war . 
At the same time , money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere . 
We estimate that if a proportion of that money had been allocated to domestic investment in roads , schools , and research , the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short run , and its growth would have been enhanced in the long run . 
There are a number of other costs , some potentially quite large , although quantifying them is problematic . 
For instance , Americans pay some $ 300 billion annually for the &quot; option value &quot; of military preparedness - being able to fight wherever needed . 
That Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs . 
But there is little doubt that the option value has been greatly impaired and will likely remain so for several years . 
In short , even our &quot; moderate &quot; estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America &apos;s involvement in Iraq . 
And our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself . 
We do not attempt to explain whether the American people were deliberately misled regarding the war &apos;s costs , or whether the Bush administration &apos;s gross underestimate should be attributed to incompetence , as it vehemently argues is true in the case of weapons of mass destruction . 
Nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war . 
Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs . 
Certainly , when a war &apos;s timing is a matter of choice , as in this case , inadequate preparation is even less justifiable . 
But such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration &apos;s reckoning . 
Elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century . 
The Iraq war was an immense &quot; project , &quot; yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent . 
One cannot help but wonder : were there alternative ways of spending a fraction of the war &apos;s $ 1- $ 2 trillion in costs that would have better strengthened security , boosted prosperity , and promoted democracy ?
