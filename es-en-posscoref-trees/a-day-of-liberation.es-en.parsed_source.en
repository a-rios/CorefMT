A Day of Liberation 
When I was seven years old , in 1960 , my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the meaning of 8 May 1945 , the day when Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe . 
We were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on D-Day , 6 June 1944 . 
One evening , I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past . 
I have forgotten the details of their conversation , but I can still hear my grandmother &apos;s sigh of relief when she said &quot; Thank God we lost that war ! &quot; 
From a child &apos;s perspective , it wasn &apos;t self-evident that losing was a good thing . 
But of course , my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation . 
The more I have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago , the clearer I have seen another , less obvious dimension in what she said : It is &quot; we &quot; who lost the war . 
Collectively , the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called &quot; Nazis &quot; - Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans , and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually . 
In today &apos;s Germany , an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation - not only for Europe , but also for Germany itself . 
Compared to public opinion in 1960 , that &apos;s certainly an enormous progress . 
But paradoxically , it may also contain an element of forgetfulness , because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat . 
To use my grandmother &apos;s parlance , it is not &quot; us &quot; who were the liberators , but &quot; them . &quot; 
The way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself . 
This is what the term &quot; politics of memory &quot; is meant to indicate . 
And this is why it doesn &apos;t matter whether the relevant events happened 60 years ago ( as World War II ) , 90 years ( as in the case of the Armenian genocide ) or even 600 years ( such as the battle of Kosovo in 1389 ) . 
A violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present , as can be observed in the current dispute between China and South Korea on one side , and Japan on the other . 
A war of memories , in turn , may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future . 
Former perpetrators often try to de-legitimize their former victims &quot; moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves . 
Therefore , the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German &quot; politics of memory &quot; than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be . 
Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed &quot; Dresden &apos;s Holocaust of bombs . &quot; 
Fortunately , their propaganda campaign has been a failure . 
Although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent at an individual level , there can be no doubt it was morally imperative that Germany be defeated collectively . 
On the left side of the German political spectrum , the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged . 
However , it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result . 
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact . 
Its slogan &quot; Never again war ! &quot; is only half the truth - the other half is &quot; Never again appeasement ! &quot; 8 May 1945 was not &quot; zero hour , &quot; as a popular saying in Germany goes . 
It had an antecedent , that is , a lack of pre-emptive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany during the 1930 &quot; s . 
There is yet another lesson to be learned . 
Yes , 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively . 
But for millions of Central and East Europeans , liberation was followed by Stalin &apos;s oppressive regime . 
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia , with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on 9 May this year , reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility . 
The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty , the so-called Hitler-Stalin pact , concluded in August 1939 , had been supplemented by a secret appendix dividing the border states Finland , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland and Romania into spheres of interest for the two parties . 
But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem . 
When Chancellor Schr√∂der travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations , he should bear in mind Nazi Germany &apos;s contribution to the Baltic tragedy . 
On 8 May this year , public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget . 
They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned , history is bound to repeat itself . 
All this is perfectly true . 
But personally , I will also remember my grandmother &apos;s sentence &quot; Thank God we lost that war ! &quot; 
Thank God - and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe &apos;s liberty .
