A Blueprint for Greece &apos;s Recovery 
ATHENS - Months of negotiations between our government and the International Monetary Fund , the European Union , and the European Central Bank have produced little progress . 
One reason is that all sides are focusing too much on the strings to be attached to the next liquidity injection and not enough on a vision of how Greece can recover and develop sustainably . 
If we are to break the current impasse , we must envisage a healthy Greek economy . 
Sustainable recovery requires synergistic reforms that unleash the country &apos;s considerable potential by removing bottlenecks in several areas : productive investment , credit provision , innovation , competition , social security , public administration , the judiciary , the labor market , cultural production , and , last but not least , democratic governance . 
Seven years of debt deflation , reinforced by the expectation of everlasting austerity , have decimated private and public investment and forced anxious , fragile banks to stop lending . 
With the government lacking fiscal room , and Greek banks burdened by non-performing loans , it is important to mobilize the state &apos;s remaining assets and unclog the flow of bank credit to healthy parts of the private sector . 
To restore investment and credit to levels consistent with economic escape velocity , a recovering Greece will require two new public institutions that work side by side with the private sector and with European institutions : A development bank that harnesses public assets and a &quot; bad bank &quot; that enables the banking system to get out from under their non-performing assets and restore the flow of credit to profitable , export-oriented firms . 
Imagine a development bank levering up collateral that comprises post-privatization equity retained by the state and other assets ( for example , real estate ) that could easily be made more valuable ( and collateralized ) by reforming their property rights . 
Imagine that it links the European Investment Bank and the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker &apos;s â‚¬ 315 billion ( $ 350 billion ) investment plan with Greece &apos;s private sector . 
Instead of being viewed as a fire sale to fill fiscal holes , privatization would be part of a grand public-private partnership for development . 
Imagine further that the &quot; bad bank &quot; helps the financial sector , which was recapitalized generously by strained Greek taxpayers in the midst of the crisis , to shed their legacy of non-performing loans and unclog their financial plumbing . 
In concert with the development bank &apos;s virtuous impact , credit and investment flows would flood the Greek economy &apos;s hitherto arid realms , eventually helping the bad bank turn a profit and become &quot; good . &quot; 
Finally , imagine the effect of all of this on Greece &apos;s financial , fiscal , and social-security ecosystem : With bank shares skyrocketing , our state &apos;s losses from their recapitalization would be extinguished as its equity in them appreciates . 
Meanwhile , the development bank &apos;s dividends would be channeled into the long-suffering pension funds , which were abruptly de-capitalized in 2012 ( owing to the &quot; haircut &quot; on their holdings of Greek government bonds ) . 
In this scenario , the task of bolstering social security would be completed with the unification of pension funds ; the surge of contributions following the pickup in employment ; and the return to formal employment of workers banished into informality by the brutal deregulation of the labor market during the dark years of the recent past . 
One can easily imagine Greece recovering strongly as a result of this strategy . 
In a world of ultra-low returns , Greece would be seen as a splendid opportunity , sustaining a steady stream of inward foreign direct investment . 
But why would this be different from the pre-2008 capital inflows that fueled debt-financed growth ? 
Could another macroeconomic Ponzi scheme really be avoided ? 
During the era of Ponzi-style growth , capital flows were channeled by commercial banks into a frenzy of consumption and by the state into an orgy of suspect procurement and outright profligacy . 
To ensure that this time is different , Greece will need to reform its social economy and political system . 
Creating new bubbles is not our government &apos;s idea of development . 
This time , by contrast , the new development bank would take the lead in channeling scarce homegrown resources into selected productive investment . 
In the meantime , Greece &apos;s regulatory authorities would be keeping a watchful eye over commercial lending practices , while a debt brake would prevent our government from indulging in old , bad habits , ensuring that our state never again slips into primary deficits . 
Cartels , anti-competitive invoicing practices , senselessly closed professions , and a bureaucracy that has traditionally turned the state into a public menace would soon discover that our government is their worst foe . 
The barriers to growth in the past were an unholy alliance among oligarchic interests and political parties , scandalous procurement , clientelism , the permanently broken media , overly accommodating banks , weak tax authorities , and a weighed-down , fearful judiciary . 
Only the bright light of democratic transparency can remove such impediments ; our government is determined to help it shine through .
