How Europe Can Rescue Europe 
LONDON - At their meeting in Rome last Thursday , the leaders of the eurozone &apos;s four largest economies agreed on steps towards a banking union and a modest stimulus package to complement the European Union &apos;s new &quot; fiscal compact . &quot; 
Those steps are not enough . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel resisted all proposals to provide relief to Spain and Italy from the excessive risk premiums that both countries are now confronting . 
As a result , the EU &apos;s upcoming summit could turn into a fiasco , which may well prove lethal , because it would leave the rest of the eurozone without a strong enough financial firewall to protect it from the possibility of a Greek exit . 
Even if a fatal calamity can be avoided , the division between creditor and debtor countries will be reinforced , and the &quot; periphery &quot; countries will have no chance to regain competitiveness , because the playing field is tilted against them . 
This may serve Germany &apos;s narrow self-interest , but it will create a very different Europe from the open society that fired people &apos;s imagination and propelled European integration for decades . 
It will make Germany the center of an empire and permanently subordinate the &quot; periphery . &quot; 
That is not what Merkel or the overwhelming majority of Germans stand for . 
Merkel argues that it is against the rules to use the European Central Bank to solve eurozone countries &quot; fiscal problems - and she is right . 
ECB President Mario Draghi has said much the same . 
Indeed , the upcoming summit is missing an important agenda item : a European Fiscal Authority ( EFA ) that , in partnership with the ECB , could do what the ECB cannot do on its own . 
In particular , the EFA could establish a Debt Reduction Fund - a modified form of the European Debt Redemption Pact that was proposed by Merkel &apos;s Council of Economic Advisers and endorsed by Germany &apos;s Social Democrats and Greens . 
In exchange for specified structural reforms in Italy and Spain , the Fund would acquire and hold a significant portion of their outstanding stock of debt . 
It would finance the purchases by issuing European Treasury bills - joint and several obligations of the member countries - and pass on the benefit of cheap financing to the countries concerned . 
The Treasury bills would be assigned a zero-risk rating by the authorities and treated as the highest-quality collateral for repo operations at the ECB . The banking system has an urgent need for risk-free liquid assets . 
Banks are currently holding more than â‚¬ 700 billion of surplus liquidity at the ECB , earning only one quarter of 1 % interest . This assures a large and ready market for the bills at 1 % or less . 
Should a participating country subsequently fail to abide by its commitments , the EFA could impose a fine or other penalty , which would be proportionate to the violation , thereby preventing enforcement from becoming a nuclear option that can never be exercised . 
This would provide strong protection against moral hazard . 
A successor government in , say , Italy , would find it practically impossible to break any commitments undertaken by Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti &apos;s current administration . 
With practically half of Italy &apos;s debt financed by European Treasury Bills - producing an effect similar to a reduction in the average maturity of its debt - a successor government would be all the more responsive to any punishment imposed by the EFA . 
After a suitable period , the participating countries would enter into debt-reduction programs tailored in a way that does not jeopardize their growth . 
This would be the prelude to the establishment of a full political union and the introduction of Eurobonds . 
Of course , the issuance of European Treasury bills would require the approval of the Bundestag , but it would be in conformity with the German Constitutional Court &apos;s requirement that any commitment approved by the Bundestag be limited in time and size . 
It is not too late to turn this proposal into a political declaration that outlines not only the long-term goal of a political union , but also a road map toward a fiscal and banking union . 
Guided by this declaration , the eurozone &apos;s financial-rescue fund , the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) , could immediately take over the ECB &apos;s holdings of Greek bonds ; the ECB could start accumulating Spanish and Italian bonds ; and Italy and Spain could implement the structural reforms needed to qualify for the Debt Redemption Fund . 
This agenda would bring immense relief to the financial markets . 
Equally important , it would change Europe &apos;s political dynamics from negative to positive . 
The main obstacle is that German politicians remain mired in a &quot; can &apos;t do &quot; mode . 
Merkel insists that a political union should precede a full-fledged fiscal and banking union . 
That is both unrealistic and unreasonable . 
There can be no treaty or constitutional clause preventing the establishment of the EFA if the German electorate , as represented by the Bundestag , approves it ; otherwise , the ESM could not have been created . 
If the rest of Europe is united behind this proposal , and the Bundestag rejects it , Germany must take full responsibility for the financial and political consequences .
