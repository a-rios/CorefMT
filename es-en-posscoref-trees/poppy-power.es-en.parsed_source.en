Poppy Power 
This month , the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Afghanistan that could pave the way for a new and more open-minded approach to counter-narcotics strategies worldwide . 
In fact , the resolution calls on the participants at a conference of donors , to take place in London at the end of January , &quot; to take into consideration the proposal of licensed production of opium for medical purposes , as already granted to a number of countries . &quot; 
This proposal was originally made by the Senlis Council , an independent organization based in Paris , during a workshop in Kabul last September . 
The text introduced by the European Liberal Democrats , with the support of virtually all political groups in the European Parliament , is revolutionary , not only because it goes against conventional thinking , but also because it raises the issue above the stagnant reality of the &quot; war on drugs . &quot; 
In Afghanistan , that so-called war has essentially been based on eradication campaigns and alternative livelihood projects , which have achieved only scant results . 
The European Parliament &apos;s new stance may , I hope , mark the beginning of a radical policy shift by all actors involved in rebuilding Afghanistan . 
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , despite concerted efforts at eradication and crop substitution , Afghanistan produced 87 % of the world &apos;s opium in 2005 - roughly 4.1 tons - generating $ 2.7 billion of illegal revenue , which amounts to roughly 52 % of the country &apos;s GDP . 
The 2005 Afghanistan Opium Survey , released last November , estimates that the total value of this opium , once turned into heroin and distributed around the world , could reach more than $ 40 billion . 
Moreover , in recent years , factories and laboratories for processing opium into heroin have been sprouting in Afghanistan , producing 420 tons of heroin last year alone . 
The increase in domestic heroin production has provided a massive boost to the local retail market , giving rise to concerns about HIV / AIDS spreading in a country with poor infrastructure and nonexistent health services . 
In addition , the itineraries used by the export convoys are no longer limited to the infamous &quot; golden route &quot; through Pakistan and Iran , but have multiplied , employing exit points in former Soviet Republics such as Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan . 
This is helping to promote further instability in already volatile political contexts . 
International counter-narcotics policy is currently driven by pressure for rapid and visible results . 
But eradication and alternative livelihood projects mainly affect the lowest end of the value-added chain , the farmers , with no real impact on those higher up , such as large landowners and local traffickers , not to mention the extremely powerful drug lords and the international cartels and mafias . 
Most landless farmers find it difficult to switch to different crops , being caught up as they are in the illegal opium-denominated market , which forces them to live at the mercy of the drug traffickers , who provide them with access to credit and market outlets . 
The result of this was laid out in a report by the European Union &apos;s Election Observation Mission that I presented in Kabul last December : Afghanistan risks becoming a &quot; rentier &quot; state with easy access to resources that lubricate corruption throughout its entire political system , finance illegal armed groups , and fuel regional destabilization . 
Illicit Afghan networks , replicating well-known methods that organized crime has applied successfully for decades in other parts of the world , are mobile and resourceful , and can plug into a range of legal economic activities to sustain themselves . 
This might lead Afghanistan into a situation of no return : becoming a narco-state that drifts away from any form of rule of law and disengages itself from the fragile social contract with its own citizens that it has started to establish . 
As New York University &apos;s Barnett Rubin , an expert on Afghan society , has put it : &quot; Afghanistan cannot be stabilized while the most dynamic sector of its economy is illegal , nor if more than half of its economy is destroyed . &quot; 
So what should be done ? 
Because of the serious threat that the illegal drug economy poses to stability and democracy in Afghanistan , we must start thinking in terms of regulated poppy growing for medical purposes , in particular for painkillers , with the active participation of donor countries and the UN itself . 
Indeed , the UN estimates that just six countries prescribe 78 % of the total legal production of opiates , implying shortages of opium-based painkillers in many of the UN &apos;s 185 other member states . 
Hence the potential legal demand is huge . 
Moreover , the UN also estimates that there are 45 million people living with HIV / AIDS in countries where health systems are either absent or very poor , and that over the next 20 years there will be some 10 million new cases of cancer in the developing world . 
These estimates , together with poor countries &quot; additional needs when natural catastrophes strike , imply that the potential legal demand for medicinal opiates is even higher . 
An increase in production of &quot; medical &quot; opium would address its lack of availability worldwide . 
It would also provide Afghan peasants , who have been growing poppy despite forced eradication of the plant and incentives to change crops , with an option that is regulated by law and that , in time , could have an impact on the heroin trade . 
Governments , international organizations and individuals that participate in the London conference must not dismiss the call made by the European Parliament , for it offers a far more workable strategy to promote Afghanistan &apos;s future than the current counter-narcotics policies permit .
