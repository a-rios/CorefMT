The Case for Fiscal Stimulus 
CAMBRIDGE - Governments around the world are now developing massive fiscal stimulus packages that will cause unprecedented peacetime budget deficits . 
The fiscal deficit in the United States this year is likely to exceed 10 % of GDP . 
A substantial part of the increased deficit will be due to a wide range of new government spending . 
Under normal circumstances , I would oppose this rise in the budget deficit and the higher level of government spending . 
When an economy is closer to full employment , government borrowing to finance budget deficits can crowd out private investment that would raise productivity and the standard of living . 
Budget deficits automatically increase government debt , requiring higher future taxes to pay the interest on that debt . 
The resulting higher tax rates distort economic incentives and thus weaken future economic performance . 
Of course , some government spending is desirable or necessary . 
Now , however , increased government spending and the resulting rise in the fiscal deficit are being justified as necessary to deal with the economic downturn - a sharp change from the reliance on monetary policy that was used to deal with previous recessions . 
Countercyclical fiscal policy had been largely discredited because of the delays involved in implementing fiscal changes and households &quot; weak response to temporary tax cuts . 
By contrast , the central bank could lower interest rates rapidly , which worked to raise household and business spending through a variety of channels . 
Nevertheless , I support the use of fiscal stimulus in the US , because the current recession is much deeper than and different from previous downturns . 
Even with successful countercyclical policy , this recession is likely to last longer and be more damaging than any since the depression of the 1930 &quot; s . 
The 40 % decline in the US stock market and the dramatic fall in house prices have reduced American households &quot; wealth by more than $ 10 trillion , which is likely to reduce annual consumer spending by more than $ 400 billion . 
This $ 600 billion fall in demand is more than 3 % of GDP . 
If not reversed , it will cause further cuts in production , employment , and earnings , leading to further reductions in consumer spending . 
The usual monetary-policy response of lowering interest rates is unable to reverse this sharp drop in demand . 
The dysfunctional credit markets caused by the uncertain value of asset-backed securities means that banks and other financial institutions are unable to raise funds and are unwilling to lend . 
As a result , the central bank &apos;s lower interest rates do not translate into increased spending on interest-sensitive investment and consumption . 
So there is no alternative to fiscal policy if we want to reverse the current downturn . 
The resulting increase in the national debt is the price that we and future generations will pay for the mistakes that created the current economic situation . 
There are many reasons for the underpricing of risk and the rise in leverage . 
The exceptionally easy monetary policy at the start of the decade contributed to financial investors &quot; willingness to buy low-quality financial assets in order to get higher yield and to an explosive rise in house prices . 
The rating agencies miscalculated the value of asset-backed securities . 
The increase in leverage was driven in part by government policies aimed at expanding home ownership among lower-income groups that have proven unable to afford that life style . 
Banking supervisors did not deal with many institutions &quot; low levels of capital and poor asset quality . 
A major challenge for the future is to fix the institutional policies that led to these problems . 
The new Obama administration and the Congress are still working out the structure of the fiscal stimulus for the US . 
Regardless of what is done to provide a fiscal stimulus , governments around the world must act to fix dysfunctional credit markets . 
Otherwise , credit will not flow and growth will not resume . 
In the US , reviving the credit markets requires stopping the mortgage defaults driven by negative equity . 
The US Treasury Department wasted valuable time in 2008 by not using the funds provided by Congress to deal with those housing-market problems . 
There is hope that the Congress and the new administration will now address that issue . 
When the recession is over , the US and virtually every other country will have substantially higher debt-to-GDP ratios . 
At that point , it will be important to develop policies to reduce gradually the relative level of government spending in order to shift to fiscal surpluses and reduce the debt burden .
