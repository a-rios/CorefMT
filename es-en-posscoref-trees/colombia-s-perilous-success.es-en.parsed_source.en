Colombia &apos;s Perilous Success 
Recent months have been very good for Colombian President Alvaro Uribe . 
His &quot; Democratic Security &quot; policy now seems to have definitively turned the tables in the country &apos;s fight against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) , which have seen their leaders killed and their hostages freed . 
Uribe has also proven to be a strong economic administrator , attracting increasing flows of foreign direct investment to Colombia . 
But success presents Uribe with a new set of challenges that risk undoing most of his achievements . 
The first and most tangible challenge is that Uribe - with popularity ratings of more than 90 % following the rescue of 15 high-profile hostages , including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt , in early July - will be more tempted to run for a third term . 
This would not be catastrophic per se , but amending the constitution again to favor one of the players would undermine the country &apos;s relatively deep political institutionalization - one of the factors that has helped attract foreign investors . 
Changing the rules of the game to prop up personal rule would help perpetuate weaknesses such as a lack of accountability , and prevent important government policies from becoming entrenched as state policies . 
One can only hope that Uribe has learned the lessons of doomed third-term experiments in the region - Peru &apos;s Alberto Fujimori and Argentina &apos;s Carlos Menem spring to mind - and leave the presidency on a high note . 
If he does , he will probably be remembered as one of Colombia &apos;s most successful and influential presidents , and can look forward to a continuing career as a regional and international statesman . 
Perhaps more importantly , were Uribe to step down after his current term , he would still wield considerable proxy power at home , playing an integral role in choosing his successor - whoever he backs stands a very good chance of winning - and boosting his political supporters &quot; prospects in legislative elections . 
If the outcome of the first challenge rests solely on Uribe &apos;s shoulders , two others are tied to the FARC &apos;s reaction to these latest developments - whether it chooses to negotiate or to continue its armed struggle . 
Under the first scenario , Uribe faces the danger of being pushed into a &quot; weak &quot; or &quot; unconditional &quot; peace process . 
For more than six years , the government has resisted calls to negotiate with the FARC , rejecting the group &apos;s requests for a demilitarized zone , dismissing overtures , and demanding the release of all hostages and a cease-fire as a precondition for talks . 
The problem is that a weakened FARC may expose the government to popular pressure to launch negotiations , even if FARC does not declare a cease-fire . 
In that case , the FARC might use peace talks - as it has several times in the past - to bid for time , re-arm and regroup . 
For the last couple of years , the FARC , many of whose leaders believe that they &quot; win &quot; simply by prolonging the conflict , has been seeking ways - for example , a humanitarian exchange and political recognition - to ease the military pressure that it has faced since Uribe came to power . 
The danger , then , is a failure to deliver the knockout blow at a time when the group appears to be disintegrating . 
But continuing the fight also poses a serious threat to Uribe &apos;s main success , which has been to improve perceptions of security , including among investors . 
The FARC , now wounded and cornered , may decide that its only option is to go on the offensive in order to demonstrate its continuing relevance and remaining strength . 
Although the FARC &apos;s capabilities have been seriously degraded over the last six years , and its geographical dispersion has shifted away from the main population centers , a series of high-profile attacks against business and civilian targets in the main cities would suffice to shatter the impression of security in the country . 
Worryingly , this might also happen if the FARC splits , with one part deciding to negotiate while hard-line military commanders fight on . 
If Uribe stands down , whoever succeeds him will probably maintain most of his policies and continue to work toward improving security in the country . 
Investors will know that Colombia is not a one-man show , and that the political system &apos;s vaunted institutionalization and effective checks and balances are real . 
Strengthening the state and fostering a stable and growing economy would also provide the best rebuke to the FARC and its bid for time .
