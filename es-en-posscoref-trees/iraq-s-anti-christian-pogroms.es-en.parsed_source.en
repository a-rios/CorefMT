Iraq &apos;s Anti-Christian Pogroms 
The world is consumed by fears that Iraq is degenerating into a civil war between Shiites , Sunnis , and Kurds . 
But in this looming war of all against all , it is Iraq &apos;s small community of Assyrian Christians that is at risk of annihilation . 
Iraq &apos;s Christian communities are among the world &apos;s most ancient , practicing their faith in Mesopotamia almost since the time of Christ . 
The Assyrian Apostolic Church , for instance , traces its foundation back to 34 A.D. and St. Peter . 
Likewise , the Assyrian Church of the East dates to 33 A.D. and St. Thomas . 
The Aramaic that many of Iraq &apos;s Christians still speak is the language of those apostles - and of Christ . 
When tolerated by their Muslim rulers , Assyrian Christians contributed much to the societies in which they lived . 
Their scholars helped usher in the &quot; Golden Age &quot; of the Arab world by translating important works into Arabic from Greek and Syriac . 
But in recent times , toleration has scarcely existed . 
In the Armenian Genocide of 1914-1918 , 750,000 Assyrians - roughly two-thirds of their number at the time - were massacred by the Ottoman Turks with the help of the Kurds . 
Under the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy , the Assyrians faced persecution for co-operating with the British during the First World War . 
Many fled to the West , among them the Church &apos;s Patriarch . 
During Saddam &apos;s wars with the Kurds , hundreds of Assyrian villages were destroyed , their inhabitants rendered homeless , and dozens of ancient churches were bombed . 
The teaching of the Syriac language was prohibited and Assyrians were forced to give their children Arabic names in an effort to undermine their Christian identity . 
Those who wished to hold government jobs had to declare Arab ethnicity . 
In 1987 , the Iraqi census listed 1.4 million Christians . 
Today , only about 600,000 to 800,000 remain in the country , most on the Nineveh plain . 
As many as 60,000 , and perhaps even more , have fled since the beginning of the insurgency that followed the United States-led invasion in 2003 . 
Their exodus accelerated in August 2004 , after the start of the terrorist bombing campaign against Christian churches by Islamists who accuse them of collaboration with the allies by virtue of their faith . 
A recent UN report states that religious minorities in Iraq &quot; have become the regular victims of discrimination , harassment , and , at times , persecution , with incidents ranging from intimidation to murder , &quot; and that &quot; members of the Christian minority appear to be particularly targeted . &quot; 
Indeed , there are widespread reports of Christians fleeing the country as a result of threats being made to their women for not adhering to strict Islamic dress codes . 
Christian women are said to have had acid thrown in their faces . 
Some have been killed for wearing jeans or not wearing the veil . 
This type of violence is particularly acute in the area around Mosul . 
High-ranking clergy there claim that priests in Iraq can no longer wear their clerical robes in public for fear of being attacked by Islamists . 
Last January , coordinated car-bomb attacks were carried out on six churches in Baghdad and Kirkuk ; on another occasion , six churches were simultaneously bombed in Baghdad and Mosul . 
Over the past two years , 27 Assyrian churches have reportedly been attacked for the sole reason that they were Christian places of worship . 
These attacks go beyond targeting physical manifestations of the faith . 
Christian-owned small businesses , particularly those selling alcohol , have been attacked , and many shopkeepers murdered . 
The director of the Iraqi Museum , Donny George , a respected Assyrian , says that he was forced to flee Iraq to Syria in fear of his life , and that Islamic fundamentalists obstructed all of his work that was not focused on Islamic artifacts . 
Assyrian leaders also complain of deliberate discrimination in the January 2005 elections . 
In some cases , they claim , ballot boxes did not arrive in Assyrian towns and villages , voting officials failed to show up , or ballot boxes were stolen . 
They also cite the intimidating presence of Kurdish militia and secret police near polling stations . 
Recently , however , there are signs the Iraqi Kurdish authorities are being more protective of their Christian communities . 
Sadly , the plight of Iraq &apos;s Christians is not an isolated one in the Middle East . 
In Iran , the population as a whole has nearly doubled since the 1979 revolution ; but , under a hostile regime , the number of Christians in the country has fallen from roughly 300,000 to 100,000 . 
In 1948 , Christians accounted for roughly 20 % of the population of what was then Palestine ; since then , their numbers have roughly halved . 
In Egypt , emigration among Coptic Christians is disproportionately high ; many convert to Islam under pressure , and over the past few years violence perpetrated against the Christian community has taken many lives . 
The persecution of these ancient and unique Christian communities , in Iraq and in the Middle East as a whole , is deeply disturbing . 
Last April , the European Parliament voted virtually unanimously for the Assyrians to be allowed to establish ( on the basis of section 5 of the Iraqi Constitution ) a federal region where they can be free from outside interference to practice their own way of life . 
It is high time now that the West paid more attention , and took forceful action to secure the future of Iraq &apos;s embattled Christians .
