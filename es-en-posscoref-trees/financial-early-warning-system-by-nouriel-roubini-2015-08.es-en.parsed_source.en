A Financial Early-Warning System 
NEW YORK - Recent market volatility - in emerging and developed economies alike - is showing once again how badly ratings agencies and investors can err in assessing countries &quot; economic and financial vulnerabilities . 
Ratings agencies wait too long to spot risks and downgrade countries , while investors behave like herds , often ignoring the build-up of risk for too long , before shifting gears abruptly and causing exaggerated market swings . 
Given the nature of market turmoil , an early-warning system for financial tsunamis may be difficult to create ; but the world needs one today more than ever . 
Few people foresaw the subprime crisis of 2008 , the risk of default in the eurozone , or the current turbulence in financial markets worldwide . 
Fingers have been pointed at politicians , banks , and supranational institutions . 
But ratings agencies and analysts who misjudged the repayment ability of debtors - including governments - have gotten off too lightly . 
In principle , credit ratings are based on statistical models of past defaults ; in practice , however , with few national defaults having actually occurred , sovereign ratings are often a subjective affair . 
Analysts at ratings agencies follow developments in the country for which they are responsible and , when necessary , travel there to review the situation . 
This process means that ratings are often backward-looking , downgrades occur too late , and countries are typically rerated based on when analysts visit , rather than when fundamentals change . 
Moreover , ratings agencies lack the tools to track consistently vital factors such as changes in social inclusion , the country &apos;s ability to innovate , and private-sector balance-sheet risk . 
And yet sovereign ratings matter tremendously . 
For many investors , credit ratings dictate where and how much they can invest . 
Ratings affect how much banks are willing to lend , and how much developing countries - and their citizens - must pay to borrow . 
They inform corporations &quot; decisions regarding whom to do business with , and on what terms . 
Given the problems with ratings agencies , investors and regulators recognize the need for a different approach . 
Investors have tried to identify good alternatives - and have largely failed . 
Assessments of risk such as sovereign interest-rate spreads and credit default swaps react ( and often over-react ) fast ; but , because they reflect only the market &apos;s understanding of risk , they are not a systematic mechanism for uncovering hidden risks and avoiding crises . 
Indeed , the recent sudden rise in market volatility suggests that they are as bad as rating agencies at detecting the early warning signs of trouble . 
Regulators , meanwhile , are now starting to require banks to develop their own internal ratings processes . 
The problem is that few institutions have the tools and expertise to do this alone . 
A comprehensive assessment of a country &apos;s macro investment risk requires looking systematically at the stocks and flows of the national account to capture all dangers , including risk in the financial system and the real economy , as well as wider risk issues . 
As we have seen in recent crises , private risk taking and debt are socialized when a crisis occurs . 
So , even when public deficits and debt are low before a crisis , they can rise sharply after one erupts . 
Governments that looked fiscally sound suddenly appear insolvent . 
Using 200 quantitative variables and factors to score 174 countries on a quarterly basis , we have identified a number of countries where investors are missing risks - and opportunities . 
China is a perfect example . 
The country &apos;s home developers , local governments , and state-owned enterprises are severely over-indebted . 
China has the balance-sheet strength to bail them out , but the authorities would then face a choice : embrace reform or rely once again on leverage to stimulate the economy . 
Even if China continues on the latter course , it will fail to achieve its growth targets and will look more fragile over time . 
Brazil should have been downgraded below investment grade last year , as the economy struggled with a widening fiscal deficit , a growing economy-wide debt burden , and a weak and worsening business environment . 
The corruption scandal at energy giant Petrobras is finally causing ratings agencies to reassess Brazil , but the move comes too late , and their downgrades probably will not be sufficient to reflect the true risk . 
Other emerging markets also look fragile and at risk of an eventual downgrade . 
In the eurozone , shadow ratings already signaled red flags in the late 2000s in Greece and the other countries of the periphery . 
More recently , Ireland and Spain may deserve to be upgraded , following fiscal consolidation and reforms . 
Greece , however , remains a basket case . 
Even with substantial reform to improve its growth potential , Greece will never be able to repay its sovereign debt and needs substantial relief . 
An assessment of sovereign risk that is systematic and data-driven could help to spot the risks that changing global headwinds imply . 
To that extent , it provides exactly what the world needs now : an approach that removes the need to rely on the ad hoc and slow-moving approach of ratings agencies and the noisy and volatile signals coming from markets .
