Mind the Neighbors 
PRINCETON - The conventional wisdom last week on whether Syria would comply with former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan &apos;s ceasefire plan was that it was up to Russia . 
We were reverting to Cold War politics , in which the West was unwilling to use force and Russia was willing to keep arming and supporting its client . 
Thus , Russia held the trump card : the choice of how much pressure it was willing to put on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to comply with the plan . 
If this view were correct , Iran would surely be holding an equally powerful hand . 
Annan , after all , traveled to Tehran as well . 
Traditional balance-of-power geopolitics , it seems , is alive and well . 
But this is , at best , a partial view that obscures as much as it reveals . 
In particular , it misses the crucial and growing importance of regional politics and institutions . 
A longer-term resolution of the Syrian crisis depends as much on Turkey and the Arab League as it does on the United States , Europe , and Russia . 
Consider what else happened last week : Turkey &apos;s government made clear that it would turn to new measures if Annan &apos;s plan does not produce results . 
Turkish officials have been issuing similar proclamations for months , but now Syrian troops have fired into Turkey , chasing Free Syrian Army rebels who fled across the border , while the number of Syrian civilian refugees has increased sharply . 
Last week , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan raised the stakes dramatically with talk of having &quot; many options , &quot; and by adding : &quot; Also , NATO has responsibilities to do with Turkey &apos;s borders , according to Article 5 . &quot; 
Article 5 of the NATO treaty stipulates that an attack on one NATO member is to be considered an attack on all , and that all will come to the member &apos;s aid . 
Of course , other NATO members could disagree that Syria has in fact attacked Turkey , but if Turkey were to invoke Article 5 , a refusal to offer assistance could have unpleasant consequences for the alliance as a whole . 
The significance of Article 5 is that if a credible case can be made that Turkey and its allies are acting in self-defense , they do not need to seek the UN Security Council &apos;s approval . 
That makes Erdoğan &apos;s suggestion a game-changer , forcing Assad to reckon with the prospect of a de facto militarily-enforced safe zone for the civilian opposition . 
The deeper point here is that regional organizations , including NATO , provide the first level of legality and legitimacy required for a successful use of force . 
The US would not have supported intervention in Libya if the Arab League had not supported a no-fly zone and been willing to go to the UN on that basis . 
Indeed , assuming that Assad does not start bulldozing entire cities , I cannot imagine any circumstances under which the US would support even limited military intervention in Syria without public approval by the Arab League and Turkey . 
That is why we have seen a game of &quot; after you &quot; with respect to Syria , with the Turks saying that they need Western support , the US saying that it needs regional support , and both saying that they need UN support . 
Looking beyond the Middle East , Africa provides the best evidence for a geopolitics based as much on regional powers and institutions as on traditional great powers . 
While Annan has been trying his diplomatic best to resolve Syria &apos;s crisis , upheavals in Senegal , Mali , Malawi , and Guinea-Bissau have been swiftly addressed by other regional powers . 
In particular , the African Union ( AU ) has acted repeatedly in the name of enforcing the African Charter on Democracy , Elections , and Governance . 
In Senegal , simmering violence accompanied recent elections in which President Abdoulaye Wade was allowed to stand for an unprecedented third term . 
The first round forced Wade into a run-off with Macky Sall , at which point the AU promptly sent an Elections Observer Mission , drawn from 18 African countries , to assess whether the elections were legal and the results &quot; reflected the will of the Senegalese people . &quot; 
We cannot be sure what impact the mission had on Wade &apos;s ultimate decision to concede defeat to Sall , but knowing that the region was watching must have focused his mind . 
But , after the coup the AU and the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , backed by the UN , immediately suspended Mali &apos;s membership in the AU , imposed economic and diplomatic sanctions on the country , and placed travel restrictions on coup leaders . 
Just over two weeks later , ECOWAS announced that it had reached an agreement with the coup leaders to return the government to civilian rule in exchange for lifting the sanctions . 
Likewise , AU President Jean Ping condemned a coup in Guinea-Bissau in early April immediately and in the strongest terms . 
Those who interpret all moves on the international stage in terms of states &quot; eternal jockeying for power and prestige will never lack for evidence . 
The way in which the Saudi-Iranian rivalry is playing out in Syria is a prominent example . 
Increasingly , when a regional institution will not act , powers from outside the region find it difficult to intervene .
