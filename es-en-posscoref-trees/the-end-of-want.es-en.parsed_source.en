The End of Want ? 
Quarter after quarter the macroeconomic news from the United States teaches the same lesson : real GDP growth at a sustained rate of 3 % per year is not enough to increase America &apos;s employment level . 
Not even real GDP growth at a sustained annual rate of 4 % is sufficient to increase the share of American adults who have jobs . 
The underlying rate of labor productivity growth in the US , which we pegged at 1.2 % per year at the start of the Clinton administration and at 2 % to 2.5 % per year at the end of the 1990 &apos;s boom , now seems even higher : it is getting harder and harder to keep the estimated labor productivity growth trend below 3 % per year . 
How long this boom in productivity growth will continue is anyone &apos;s guess : optimists point to the fact that waiting behind the information technology revolution , ready for takeoff , is the biotechnology revolution , and behind that is a looming nanotechnology revolution . 
If such improvements in productivity do last , the vistas this will open are amazing : an America 50 years from now in which the average full-time worker earns not $ 40,000 a year , but the equivalent of today &apos;s $ 160,000 a year . 
The US is at one pole of the world economy . 
China - even with its economic miracle since Deng Xiaoping went on his Southern Expedition - is at the other . 
But China &apos;s labor productivity is now growing at roughly 6 % per year . 
If that rate can be sustained - and if the Chinese economy becomes and remains integrated enough for us to be able to speak of it as a single entity - China &apos;s labor productivity will be comparable to today &apos;s America sometime before 2050 . 
And India ? 
If the growth rates of the past 15 years continue , and if India remains united , its labor productivity in 2050 will be comparable to that of Spain today . 
Now the world of 2050 will not be a paradise . 
There will still be some regions where failed states do not protect property , enforce the law , encourage commerce , educate their citizens , or construct the physical , social , and organizational infrastructure necessary for people to make use of the magical technologies we have developed since the start of the Industrial Revolution . 
Similarly , there will still be wars , fought with ever more brutal and destructive weapons . 
Next winter , it will be sixty years since an army crossed the Rhine River bringing death and destruction- the longest such period since at least the late second century B.C. , when the Cimbri and Teutones challenged the army of the Roman Consul Gaius Marius in the Rhone Valley . 
The world of 2050 will not have &quot; solved the economic problem . &quot; 
The economy is the realm of things that have value . 
Things have value when they are both desirable and scarce . We humans are very good at figuring out ways to make scarce things desirable . 
But we do have an opportunity - and hence a duty - shared by no previous human generation : to make a world by 2050 in which nearly everyone has enough food to avoid hunger , enough clothing to keep warm , and enough shelter to remain dry - plus a super-broadband Internet connection . 
The stakes in this round of humanity &apos;s poker game are huge . 
The first step toward winning the jackpot is to shape global public opinion in support of creating a world without want - to make progress towards this goal is the touchstone of international relations today . 
We no longer have large states driven by powerful , aggressive ideologies to remake the world in their own image by any means necessary . 
The major sources and uses of power in the world today are softer , although not weaker . 
As long as we can keep it this way , we humans have a good chance of achieving our most important collective task .
