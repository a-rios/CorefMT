Ending the Tragedy of Darfur 
The critical conditions that continue to prevail in Darfur are causing immense suffering to its people . 
Both sides of the conflict - the government of Sudan and its allied forces , as well as all the opposition groups in Darfur - must understand that civilians should no longer fall victim to their political disputes . 
The Sudanese government &apos;s consent to the deployment of the hybrid United Nations / African Union mission , which aims to keep peace in the region , is of course a welcome development . 
But the mandate of this mission must be strong enough to allow for full protection of the civilian population . 
Moreover , the force must have sufficient manpower , capacity , and funding to put this vital objective into practice efficiently . 
The countries and institutions that have committed additional funds in order to help secure the success of this mission - notably France , Spain , and the European Commission - should all be applauded . 
It is important for international actors to assure Sudan &apos;s government that the UN / AU mission will not strive for regime change in the country or otherwise exceed its peacekeeping mandate . 
At the same time , the Sudanese government must be fully aware that only by adhering to past commitments and by cooperating in helping to prepare , deploy , and maintain the mission will the international community be encouraged to continue its support . 
As for the Darfur opposition , the recent efforts by some of its leaders to overcome fragmentation and re-unify their movement are a welcome development . 
It is essential that all major opposition groups achieve agreement about their aims and negotiating positions . 
Only then can they act as credible partners of the international community and the Sudanese government . 
All parties to the conflict must realize that , ultimately , there is no way to end their dispute other than through an equitable and sustainable peace agreement endorsed by all stakeholders . 
The return of internally displaced persons and due care for them must be a core component of any such arrangement . 
Responsible people around the globe , particularly politicians and journalists , must remain focused on Darfur . 
Now that there are signs of possible stabilization in the months to come , it is time to start preparing for increased volumes of international reconstruction and development assistance , in addition to humanitarian aid . 
Economically advanced countries in particular should meet their global responsibility and help Darfur move toward renewal and prosperity . 
This increased assistance should emerge from an extension or re-focusing of national development cooperation programs . 
Additionally , international arrangements aiming at effective use of synergies should be carefully explored . 
In facilitating the complex relations between the international community and the local actors in Darfur , the UN currently plays an indispensable role and must be actively supported . 
China in particular should use its considerable influence in Sudan to bring the country &apos;s decision-makers to a definitive peaceful settlement of the dispute . 
Moreover , because Darfur is emblematic of wider difficulties in the world , the international community must look beyond the immediate circumstances of the conflict and increase efforts to deal with the threats that have played a role in the disaster , such as climate change and environmental degradation . 
Indeed , the accelerating expansion of deserts will likely lead to a decrease of agricultural yields from the surrounding areas , acute deterioration of the availability of water , and possibly to further conflicts and displacement of people . 
Similar conditions exist - or may begin to exist - in several locations worldwide . 
So the global nature of this problem must be recognized and addressed in places where environmental degradation is already bringing about a dangerous deterioration in peoples &quot; lives . 
Where such damage looms as a threat , early prevention is required .
