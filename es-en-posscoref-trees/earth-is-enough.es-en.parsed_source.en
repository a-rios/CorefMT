Earth is Enough 
COPENHAGEN - According to conventional wisdom , we are voraciously using the world &apos;s resources and living way beyond Earth &apos;s means . 
This narrative of decline and pessimism underlies much of today &apos;s environmental discourse , and is often formulated in a simple fashion : by 2030 , we will need two planets to sustain us , owing to higher living standards and population growth . 
If everyone managed to live at American living standards today , we would need almost five planets . 
But this received wisdom is fundamentally wrong . 
Environmental campaigners use the so-called &quot; ecological footprint &quot; - how much area each one of us requires from the planet - to make their point . 
We obviously use cropland , grazing land , forests , and fishing grounds to produce our food , fiber , and timber , and we need space for our houses , roads , and cities . 
Moreover , we require areas to absorb the waste emitted by our energy use . 
Translating all these demands into a common unit of physical area gives us an opportunity to compare it with Earth &apos;s productive area - and thus to get a sense of how sustainable we are . 
For more than a decade , the World Wildlife Fund and several other conservation organizations have performed complicated calculations to determine individual &quot; footprints &quot; on the planet . 
Their numbers show that each American uses 9.4 hectares of the globe , each European 4.7 hectares , and those in low-income countries just one hectare . 
Adding it all up , we collectively use 17.5 billion hectares . 
Unfortunately , there are only 13.4 billion hectares available . 
So the WWF points out that we are already living beyond Earth &apos;s means , using around 30 % too much . 
And it will get worse . 
They tell us that the recent financial crisis &quot; pales in comparison to the looming ecological credit crunch , &quot; which could presage &quot; a large-scale ecosystem collapse . &quot; 
This message is being seared it into the public consciousness . 
The British newspaper The Observer used the headline &quot; Wanted : New Earth by 2050 &quot; ; according to the BBC , Earth is &quot; on course for eco-crunch &quot; ; and The Washington Post was horrified by the four extra planets needed , and urged us to use more canvass shopping bags and energy-saving light bulbs . 
The message has been received loud and clear . 
We are using up too much of the planet &apos;s area . 
But wait a minute . 
How can we do that ? 
How can we actually use more area than there is on earth ? 
Obviously , any measure that tries to aggregate many different aspects of human behavior will have to simplify the inputs ; the ecological footprint is no different . 
For example , when we talk about American lifestyles needing five planets , we assume that technology is frozen , whereas it is likely that worldwide land-use productivity will increase dramatically . 
Likewise , organic farming actually leaves a larger footprint than its conventional cousin . 
Yet , despite such shortcomings , it is clear that areas we use for roads cannot be used for growing food , and that areas we use to build our houses takes away from forests . 
This part of the ecological footprint is a convenient measure of our literal footprint on earth . 
Here , we live far inside the available area , using some 60 % of the world &apos;s available space , and this proportion is likely to drop , because the rate at which the earth &apos;s population is increasing is now slowing , while technological progress continues . 
So no ecological collapse here . 
There is just one factor that keeps increasing : our carbon emissions . 
It is not at all obvious to anybody how to convert CO2 to area . 
The WWF and some researchers choose to get around this by defining the area of emissions as the area of forest needed to soak up the extra CO2 . 
This now makes up more than 50 % of the ecological footprint , and will grow to three-quarters before mid-century . 
In essence , we are being told that we ought to cut emissions to zero , and to plant trees to achieve that , meaning that we would have to plant forests today on 30 % more than all of the available land , and plant forests on almost two planets by 2030 . 
This is unreasonable . 
Is it really necessary for us to cut all emissions ? 
Just cutting about half of all emissions would reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the medium term . 
More importantly , planting forests is one of the least area-efficient low-tech ways to cut carbon . 
Solar cells and wind turbines require less than 1 % of the area of forests to reduce CO2 , they become increasingly efficient , and they can often be placed on non-productive land ( such as wind turbines at sea and solar panels in deserts ) . 
Measured this way , the scary eco-crunch disappears . 
Due to technology , the individual demand on the planet has already dropped 35 % over the past half-century , and the collective requirement will reach its upper limit before 2020 way below any overdraft . 
Translating CO2 into an illogical and inefficient measure of forest cover seems intended mainly to ensure that an alarming message results . 
In the scientific literature , a leading modeler acknowledges that most modelers regard this method as &quot; hard to defend . &quot; 
Two other research teams have pointed out that the ecological footprint &quot; itself is nothing more than an important attention-grabbing device , &quot; and that &quot; it is less a scientific measure than one designed to raise public awareness and influence politics . &quot; 
When we really examine the &quot; ecological footprint &quot; calculations , we discover that the only thing the world is running out of is space to plant a colossal amount of imaginary forest that we wouldn &apos;t have planted anyway , to avoid CO2 emissions that we can prevent through much smarter and cheaper means . 
That our profligate consumption requires five planets is a catchy story , but it is wrong . 
The planet we have is more than enough .
