Demystifying the Chinese Economy 
WASHINGTON , DC - China had an advanced and prosperous civilization for millennia until the eighteenth century , but then degenerated into a very poor country for 150 years . 
Now it has resurged to become the world &apos;s most dynamic economy since launching its transition to a market economy in 1979 . 
What drove these fateful changes ? 
In my recent book Demystifying the Chinese Economy , I argue that , for any country at any time , the foundation for sustained growth is technological innovation . 
Prior to the Industrial Revolution , craftsmen and farmers were the main source of innovation . 
With the largest population in the world , China was a leader in technological innovation and economic development throughout most of its history because it had a large pool of craftsmen and farmers . 
The Industrial Revolution accelerated the pace of Western progress by replacing experience-based technological innovation with controlled experiments conducted by scientists and engineers in laboratories . 
This paradigm shift marked the coming of modern economic growth , and contributed to the global economy &apos;s &quot; Great Divergence . &quot; 
China failed to undergo a similar shift , owing primarily to its civil-service examination system , which emphasized the memorization of Confucian classics and provided little incentive for elites to learn mathematics and science . 
The Great Divergence had a silver lining : developing countries could use technology transfers from advanced countries to achieve a faster rate of economic growth than the countries that were at the industrial vanguard . 
But China failed to exploit this benefit of backwardness until the transition from a command economy began in earnest . 
In the wake of the communist takeover in 1949 , Mao Zedong and other political leaders hoped to reverse China &apos;s backwardness quickly , adopting a big push to build advanced capital-intensive industries . 
This strategy enabled China to test nuclear bombs in the 1960 &quot; s and launch satellites in the 1970 &quot; s . 
But China was still a poor , agrarian economy ; it held no comparative advantage in capital-intensive industries . 
Firms in those industries were not viable in an open , competitive market . 
Their survival required government protection , subsidies , and administrative directives . 
These measures helped China establish modern , advanced industries , but resources were misallocated and incentives distorted . 
Economic performance was poor . 
Haste made waste . 
When China &apos;s market transition started in 1979 , Deng Xiaoping adopted a pragmatic , dual-track approach , rather than the &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; formula of rapid privatization and trade liberalization . 
On the one hand , the government continued to provide transitory protection to firms in priority sectors ; on the other , it liberalized the entry of private enterprises and foreign direct investment into the labor-intensive sectors that were consistent with China &apos;s comparative advantage but were repressed in the past . 
This approach enabled China to achieve stability and dynamic growth simultaneously . 
Indeed , the benefits of backwardness have been breathtaking : 9.9 % average annual GDP growth and 16.3 % annual trade growth over the past 32 years - a stellar achievement that holds valuable lessons for other developing countries . 
Now China is the world &apos;s largest exporter and its second largest economy , and more than 600 million people were pulled out of poverty . 
Yet China &apos;s success has not come without cost . 
Income disparities have widened , owing in part to the continuation of distortionary policies in various sectors , including the domination of China &apos;s four large state-owned banks , the near-zero royalty on mining , and monopolies in major industries , including telecommunications , power , and financial services . 
Because such distortions ( a legacy of the dual-track transition ) result in income disparities , they ultimately repress domestic consumption and contribute to China &apos;s trade imbalance . 
Those imbalances will remain until China completes its market transition . 
I am confident that , notwithstanding the headwinds blowing from the eurozone crisis and the slump in demand worldwide , China can continue its dynamic growth . 
In 2008 , China &apos;s per capita income stood at 21 % of the US level ( measured in purchasing power parity ) , and was similar to Japan &apos;s per capita income in 1951 , South Korea &apos;s in 1977 , and Taiwan &apos;s in 1975 . 
Annual GDP growth averaged 9.2 % in Japan from 1951 to 1971 , 7.6 % in South Korea from 1977 to 1997 , and 8.3 % in Taiwan from 1975 to 1995 . 
Given the similarities between these economies &quot; experience and China &apos;s post-1979 development strategy , it is likely that China can maintain 8 % growth in the coming two decades . 
Some may think that the performance of a country as unique as China , with more than 1.3 billion people , cannot be replicated . 
I disagree . 
Every developing country can have similar opportunities to sustain rapid growth for several decades and reduce poverty dramatically if it exploits the benefits of backwardness , imports technology from advanced countries , and upgrades its industries . 
Simply put , there is no substitute for understanding comparative advantage .
