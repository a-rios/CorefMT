New Policy Paradigms for a New World 
WASHINGTON , DC - Over the last quarter-century , the global economy enjoyed a remarkable stretch of stable growth and low inflation . 
The so-called &quot; Great Moderation &quot; lulled many policymakers into a false sense of security about their ability to manage the economy and deal with financial crises . 
But , as the Great Moderation metastasized into the Great Recession , fatal flaws in conventional thinking came to light . 
Today , as policymakers seek new paradigms for managing the economy in 2011 and beyond , a better understanding of these linkages will be essential to promoting economic growth and reducing the risk of crises . 
Equally important is the realization that by working together , we can build a more successful and more stable global economy , for the benefit of all countries . 
Let me spell out what this means for three policy objectives : building a stronger and safer financial sector , achieving more balanced and more stable growth , and managing large and volatile capital flows . 
A stronger and safer financial system is the bedrock of a successful economy . 
Now , even with the best rules and supervision , crises will still occur - which is why we need effective resolution mechanisms to deal with institutions that get into trouble . 
Much has already been done to advance regulatory reform , notably the recent agreement to strengthen bank capital ( Basel III ) . 
Yet we are far from having the supervision needed for proper implementation of the rules . 
Effective resolution mechanisms and systemic frameworks remain even more elusive . 
Moving to the broader economy , we have learned that growth must be balanced in order to be healthy . 
At the national level , this requires tools to prevent excesses in one sector from bringing down the entire economy . 
At the global level , it requires a better distribution of growth across countries , in order to prevent destabilizing imbalances . 
What are the implications for macroeconomic policy ? 
Monetary policy needs to look beyond its core focus on low and stable inflation and pay much greater attention to financial stability . 
The debate now is how , exactly , to factor this imperative into monetary policy , and how to coordinate the work of monetary and regulatory authorities . 
For fiscal policy , the crisis showed the value of maintaining low public debt and deficits during good times : countries with healthier public finances have more space to cushion the economic impact of crises . 
How quickly fiscal retrenchment should be launched - and the right balance between higher taxes and lower spending - will vary by country , reflecting factors like the strength of the economic recovery , the market &apos;s appetite for debt , and initial spending and revenue ratios . 
The distribution of income is another important issue . 
In the years leading up to the crisis , inequality rose in many countries , with worrisome consequences for social cohesion . 
Rising inequality may also have increased vulnerability to crisis : with fewer people able to dip into savings during bad times , the impact on growth is even larger . 
Turning to the international dimension , understanding better how policies adopted in one country spill over onto other economies is key . 
This approach lies at the heart of the G-20 &quot; s efforts to achieve strong , stable , and balanced global growth . 
The International Monetary Fund is also stepping up its work in this area , through &quot; spillover reports &quot; on China , the euro zone , Japan , the United Kingdom , and the United States . 
Gaining a better appreciation of the financial linkages between countries is also important . 
During the crisis , we saw how quickly capital fled from countries previously considered safe bets . 
Today , many of these countries are reeling from a veritable tsunami of returning money . 
Policymakers in many emerging-market countries worry that surging capital inflows will drive up the value of the local currency , destabilize financial markets , and fuel economic overheating . 
Their reactions range from buying up the foreign money to prevent currency appreciation to adopting capital controls , and , in extreme cases , to keeping the money out altogether . 
The situation has become quite tense , with talk of &quot; currency wars &quot; and a real risk of financial protectionism . 
Clearly , we need to get a better handle on what is driving these capital inflows . 
We also need to identify the best policies for dealing with them - keeping in mind the impact of these policies on the global economy as a whole . 
Global financial insurance is an important related issue . 
Just as a family backstops its savings with insurance , countries should be able to tap into a global financial safety net . 
Much has already been achieved since the crisis , through more resources for the IMF and new financing instruments . 
Let me tie all of this together . 
One principal policy failure in the run-up to the crisis was a lack of imagination : we failed to appreciate just how intricate the global economic and financial web had become . 
Let our next failing not be the result of a lack of cooperation . 
We must reach across old dividing lines - both within economies and between them - and work together to build a stronger , more resilient global economy .
