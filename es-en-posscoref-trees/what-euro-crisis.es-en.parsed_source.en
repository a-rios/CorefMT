What Euro Crisis ? 
FRANKFURT - What constitutes a crisis ? 
Is it sustained economic decline , high and long-term unemployment , poverty , rampant inflation , a precipitous fall in the exchange rate , fiscal deficits , high borrowing costs , and political dysfunction ? 
Most would agree that a crisis exists if just some of these &quot; misery indices &quot; are present . 
But , while Europe is widely perceived to be in the grip of crisis , only a handful of them are present , and in only a few eurozone countries . 
So , why is there a eurozone crisis , and what defines it ? 
Time and again , it is argued that the single currency does not fit the different needs of its member countries , and that unsustainable economic divergence will ultimately require that the euro be abandoned . 
The fatal divergences that are most frequently cited include differences in growth rates , job-creation , and unemployment rates , as well as dramatic disparities in current-account balances , all of which may be traceable to wide deviations in unit labor costs . 
Perceptions of such divergences force considerable risk premiums on problem countries , inevitably resulting in accelerating capital flight to safe havens . 
All of these developments are now visible in the eurozone , particularly in its peripheral countries . 
Risk premiums started rising above benign levels in 2009 , and then more strongly in 2011-2012 , while capital flight became rampant in 2011 . 
But , if one considers what might underlie capital movements of this sort , suspicion must also fall on unsustainable policies that extend to countries well outside the eurozone . 
In the wider European Union , countries like the United Kingdom or Hungary are as much afflicted by structural deficiencies as some peripheral eurozone countries are . 
Exchange-rate flexibility has not helped them much , or at least they have chosen not to exploit it . 
Moreover , there are countries with government-debt burdens that are as large , if not larger , than those on Europe &apos;s periphery - the United States and Japan being prime examples . 
Other countries , like Norway and Switzerland , are running current-account surpluses that exceed 10 % of their GDP , but are resisting currency revaluation . 
It is worth remembering that , for the decade until 2005 , Germany was labeled the &quot; sick man of Europe . &quot; 
Germany was uncompetitive when it entered the eurozone , owing to excessive wage and price increases following the country &apos;s reunification - a problem that has since been overcome by structural reforms that the country undertook within the single currency . 
The same is true for the most recent eurozone member , Estonia , whose rigorous wage restraint ensured competitiveness in the single market in a short period of time . 
Why , then , is there such strong doubt that the euro can survive ? 
Some say that the current efforts to enforce sound policies in the peripheral countries are bound to fail , and that sacrificing democracy in these countries to keep the monetary union intact is too high a price to pay . 
In fact , the efforts of governments and international institutions point the way toward more sustainable solutions . 
Who would have believed at this time last year that the fiscal pact adopted in March would have been possible ? 
And , despite fluctuations , has there not been a considerable reduction in risk premiums for problem countries , without adding to the financing costs of donor countries ? 
Much remains unknown . 
Are we seeing tentative signs of escape from the eurozone &apos;s malaise ? 
Will debtor countries be able to stick to tough reform programs , or will their citizens reject austerity ? 
And will donor countries avoid the sort of populist backlash at home that might push them in a protectionist direction ? 
Intelligent cooperation that avoids moral hazard should be able to prevent panic , reduce risk premiums , and permit fuller use of resources . 
For example , transnational migration flows should certainly be made easier and more attractive . 
High levels of unemployment , particularly among young skilled workers , could be avoided if donor countries that need migrants to invigorate their own workforces were able to attract them . 
More immigration would strengthen skills and raise income levels , while reducing distressed countries &quot; expenditure on unemployment benefits . 
Greater labor mobility within the EU would also help to create a more open European mindset , and thus weaken old nationalist prejudices . 
So , will Europe commit to moving toward political union , and thereby address what has remained missing , despite the single market , the euro , and the Schengen Agreement &apos;s elimination of internal borders ? 
The model for a future United States of Europe is Switzerland , a country with four languages and ethnicities , fiscally strong sub-national units ( cantons ) , a single first-rate currency , and a federal government and a parliament that exercises genuine , if limited , fiscal authority . 
If the EU made the most of the competencies that it already has , and governed more effectively , the Union as a whole could achieve faster economic growth for at least the next decade , with a 2.5 % annual rate not out of reach . 
More generous support for countries in trouble is essential , because the euro must be preserved ( albeit not necessarily on the base of a larger eurozone ) . 
Financial markets would be more easily convinced if such support were complemented by the recipient countries &quot; acceptance of the fiscal pact , together with technical help to strengthen their governance . 
In Greece , anti-corruption officers from the US , Italian tax-efficiency specialists , German privatization experts , and Spanish tourism professionals should be made available to accelerate the pace of modernization . 
All of this amounts to a much-needed and often-advocated Marshall Plan for the periphery . 
But it recognizes that what Europe &apos;s troubled countries need most is not money , but the planning and administrative capacity to spend it effectively . 
Over the last decade , Greece could absorb only a fifth of the EU modernization funds available to it . 
It didn &apos;t have to be that way then , and Europe cannot afford to let it remain that way now .
