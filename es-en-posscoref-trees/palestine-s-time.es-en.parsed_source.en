Palestine &apos;s Time 
PARIS - This September , Mahmoud Abbas , president of the Palestinian Authority , took the bold step of directly asking the United Nations to grant official recognition to the state of Palestine . 
The UN &apos;s 193 member states look geared to vote on that request within the next few months . 
The world &apos;s focus is now on Palestine . 
It is almost two decades since the &quot; quartet &quot; - the UN , the United States , the European Union , and Russia - agreed that the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government should establish peace by coexisting as two separate states . 
And yet , while US President Barack Obama has referred to the quartet &apos;s decision as his guiding principle for diplomatic action on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , the situation remains as dire as ever , because the devil remains in the details . 
The Palestinians want an independent state , but on the condition that they secure Jerusalem as its capital , and that Israel ceases to expand settlements on territory that it has occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War . 
Israel , however , has never considered ceding Jerusalem to Palestine . 
But the question of the settlements is even more difficult to resolve . 
Even under pressure from the international community and , most powerfully , from the US , Israel has consistently refused to slow expansion of its settlements in the West Bank . 
Tragically , strong resistance from Israel and the Jewish diaspora has led Obama to acknowledge openly his powerlessness in the conflict , and thus to abandon US political pressure on Israel . 
As a result , a small group of pro-Israeli congressmen has been free to threaten and pressure those countries likely to vote for the recognition of the Palestinian state . 
In any event , Israel &apos;s leaders are not actually interested in a realistic peace . 
Instead , they seem to want a solution reminiscent of nineteenth-century Ireland - which led to a century of casualties on both sides . 
Israel is effectively demanding the disappearance of Palestinian identity . 
The rest of the world should not tolerate that effort , even if the US does . 
Every country knows that it is difficult and costly to engage in an explicit conflict with the US . 
But when the US fails to act as a global leader because of its fragile internal politics , other countries do not have to follow its example . 
Abbas well understands the riskiness of his strategy : there will be brutal retaliation from Israel . 
But his persistence in pursuing this last chance at peace has clearly gained him increased popularity at home and greater respect abroad . 
Hamas , the Palestinian Authority &apos;s rival in Gaza , will undoubtedly try to thwart Abbas &apos;s effort . 
An organization like Hamas , which supports permanent war - and with which Israel negotiated for five years for the release of one abducted Israeli soldier , Gilad Shalit , in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners - is exactly the enemy that Israel needs to justify its hardline stance . 
For a long time , Israeli leaders have lobbied supporters like me , who , since the Holocaust , have defended the Jewish people &apos;s right to security and statehood . 
But Israel &apos;s tactics regarding Palestine have been unconscionable . 
No civilized country can permit this behavior . 
Palestine must be granted legal status so that , at the very least , its people will have access to the international legal court , with the understanding that international support is required to aid and defend this young state . 
The Americans have lost their moral right to leadership in resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict . 
It is time for Europe to step into the fray .
