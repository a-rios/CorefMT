China &apos;s Political Storm 
NEW DELHI - As senior leaders are purged and retired provincial officials publicly call for Politburo members to be removed , it has become clear that China is at a crossroads . 
China &apos;s future no longer looks to be determined by its hugely successful economy , which has turned the country into a world power in a single generation . 
Instead , the country &apos;s murky and increasingly fractured politics are now driving its fate . 
One need look no further than the ongoing power struggle in the run-up to this autumn &apos;s planned leadership changes , or official figures showing that rural protests have been increasing at the same rate as China &apos;s GDP . 
The sudden downfall of Bo Xilai - and the call from Yunnan Province for the removal of the two Politburo members closest to him - is just one example of the no-holds-barred infighting now taking place in Zhongnanhai , the closed leadership compound in Beijing . 
Indeed , the internecine squabbles are said to be so vicious that there have been rumors , denied by the regime , that the Communist Party &apos;s congress at which a new president and prime minister are to be anointed this autumn , might be postponed . 
The Party &apos;s abrupt vilification of Bo after lauding him for his leadership in Chongqing has fueled public cynicism over his orchestrated downfall and laid bare the leadership &apos;s thin ideological core . 
If China is to preserve its gains in global stature , it must avoid a political hard landing . 
For the time being , at least five different scenarios are conceivable . 
Re-equilibration : The Party protects its legitimacy , keeps the military subordinate , and manages to put a lid on popular dissent . 
In other words , the status quo prevails for the foreseeable future . 
This is the least likely scenario , owing to deepening internal Party disagreements and rising popular discontent . 
Implosion : This likelihood of political disintegration , economic collapse , and social disorder may be no higher than that of re-equilibration . 
The government &apos;s fixation on weiwen , or stability maintenance , has resulted in China becoming the world &apos;s only important country whose official internal-security budget is larger than its official national-defense budget . 
This underscores the extent to which authorities have to carry out internal repression to perpetuate one-party rule and maintain control over the restive ethnic-minority homelands that make up more than 60 % of China &apos;s landmass . 
But it may also explain why one self-immolation in Tunisia helped to kindle the Arab Spring , whereas some three dozen self-immolations by Tibetan monks and nuns have failed to ignite a similar popular movement against the Chinese state . 
The Soviet Union imploded because the party was the state , and vice versa . 
China , by contrast , has established strong institutional capacity , a multi-tiered federal structure , a tradition of civilian leadership turnover every ten years , and a well-oiled , sophisticated security apparatus that has kept pace with technological advances . 
Thus , China &apos;s government can pursue a policy of wai song nei jin - relaxed on the outside , vigilant internally . 
Guided reform : A process of gradual political change begins , in keeping with outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao &apos;s warning that without &quot; urgent &quot; reforms , China risks turmoil and disruption of economic growth . 
Can China emulate the recent example of neighboring Myanmar ( Burma ) , which has initiated significant , if still tenuous , political reforms ? 
As the political heirs of the country &apos;s Communist revolutionaries , the third-generation leaders that are taking over the reins of power in China may possess a strong pedigree , but they are also scarred and limited by it . 
These so-called princelings are trapped in the same political culture that led to the death of millions of Chinese and the continuing repression of opponents ( real or imagined ) . 
They do not look like political reformers in the slightest . 
Great leap backward : A new &quot; Cultural Revolution &quot; erupts , as the clique in power ruthlessly seeks to suppress dissent within and outside the establishment . 
As the Dalai Lama recently warned , there are still plenty of &quot; worshippers of the gun &quot; in power in China . 
Indeed , such is China &apos;s political system that only the strongest advance . 
One fallen princeling , Bo , has been accused of cruelty and corruption - traits that are endemic in China &apos;s cloistered but fragmented oligarchy , which values family lineage and relies on networks of allies . 
Praetorian takeover : The People &apos;s Liberation Army rules from behind a civilian mask , increasingly calling the shots with government officials , who are beholden to it . 
While the civilian leadership has become diffuse ( every Chinese leader since Mao Zedong has been weaker than his predecessor ) , the military has enjoyed greater autonomy and soaring budgets since 1990 . 
Indeed , the Party , having ceased to be a rigid monolith obedient to a single leader , has become dependent on the military for its political legitimacy and to ensure domestic order . 
The PLA &apos;s growing political clout has been manifest in the sharpening power struggle within the Party . 
In recent weeks , an unusual number of senior military officers have published articles in official newspapers calling for Party discipline and unity , and alluding to the military &apos;s role in containing the infighting . 
Another development is the increasing tendency of military generals to speak out of turn on strategic issues and undercut diplomatic strategy . 
The simple truth is that the foreign ministry is the Chinese government &apos;s weakest branch , often overruled or simply ignored by the security establishment , which is ever ready to upstage even the Party . 
China &apos;s internal politics has a bearing on its external policy . 
The weaker the civilian leadership has become , the more China has been inclined to discard Deng Xiaoping &apos;s dictum tao guang yang hui ( hide brightness , nourish obscurity ) . 
China has lately taken more to the spotlight than to the shadows . 
Under any plausible scenario , a restrained and stable Chinese foreign policy may become more difficult .
