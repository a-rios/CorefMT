Zhu Rongji Reexamined 
As China &apos;s new leadership team emerges , the world &apos;s attention has focused on President Jiang Zemin &apos;s successor . 
But this is misguided , for perhaps the most significant moment in China &apos;s recent history of boom and transformation was the 1998 appointment of Zhu Rongji ( pronounced &quot; Joo Rong-jee &quot; ) as premier of the State Council , a position once held by Deng Xiaoping . 
Given the obvious importance of the post in recent years , the choice of Mr. Zhu &apos;s replacement may be of even more significance than President Jiang &apos;s departure from center stage . 
Even before he became premier , Mr. Zhu , as the president of China &apos;s central bank , was known as the architect of China &apos;s 8 % annual economic growth in the 1990s and the mastermind of its successful fight against inflation . 
Mr. Zhu has been China &apos;s Jack Welch , the tough-minded , longtime CEO of the American conglomerate General Electric - a man celebrated for his candor , his global sophistication , and his insistence on performance . 
Indeed , Mr. Zhu was renowned for punishing those who fell short of his expectations . 
As mayor of Shanghai , he once disciplined his tourist bureau officials by making them scrub the city &apos;s public toilets themselves . 
A few months after his appointment as premier , Mr. Zhu delivered his &quot; three promises &quot; speech , in which he pledged to make three bold moves to secure a more vibrant , self-sustaining economy . 
First , he would overhaul the 300,000 state-run national corporations that still conducted an overwhelming amount of China &apos;s business and accounted for the bulk of its economic activity . 
More than 70 % of such companies were unprofitable and were propped up by government subsidy . 
Just as Mr. Welch promised to &quot; fix , close , or sell &quot; nonperforming divisions of General Electric when he took over the company , Mr. Zhu threatened to fire chief executives of Chinese firms that lost money for more than two consecutive years , and then either to shut them down or sell them . 
This forced national corporations to be privatized and go public or to be overseen by provincial governments , a change that proved to be a major impetus for a sudden decentralization of China &apos;s governance structure - another key legacy of Mr. Zhu &apos;s tenure . 
Second , Mr. Zhu said he would wipe out the many bad debts of China &apos;s banks and &quot; international trust companies . &quot; 
Many of these had contributed to a softening in China &apos;s economy by routinely lending money to insolvent corporations . 
At the time , there were 245 such trust companies , which had such a poor record of repayment that overseas investors were beginning to shun China entirely . 
Reforming them would take 10 years , he said . 
Third , Mr. Zhu said he would streamline the central government and take on one of China &apos;s most pernicious problems : high-level corruption in government agencies . 
He would propose measures including , for example , cutting links between government and organized crime , and making it more difficult for bureaucrats to accept bribes . 
Politicians often make bold promises but rarely keep them . 
On July 1 , 2001 , at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party , Mr. Zhu assessed his progress . 
His appraisal of his record in office is notably accurate , and stands as a convincing testament to the effectiveness of his leadership . 
Mr. Zhu told the assembled Communist leadership that he had fulfilled the first promise : many of China &apos;s public corporations had become profitable private entities or had been shut down . 
Those that were still operating were given stringent profitability targets , were allowed to choose the people they hired , and were encouraged to raise money on private stock exchanges , which effectively propelled them into the private sector as &quot; red chip &quot; corporations . 
As for the second promise , more than 50 heads of financial institutions had at that point been fired ( more followed ) , and reforms had changed the investment climate dramatically . 
Instead of fleeing the country , capital was flowing in more rapidly than ever before . 
Mr. Zhu &apos;s record concerning his third promise was more mixed . 
While the size of the central government fell dramatically , with employment at the State Council halved from 34,000 to 17,000 , corruption continued to fester . 
Despite Mr. Zhu &apos;s efforts , opposition from vested interests throughout the government - particularly at the highest levels - impeded reform . 
Nonetheless , Zhu Rongji &apos;s reforms created the kind of level playing field and rule of law on which a vibrant capitalist system depends . 
That is a political legacy second to none in modern Chinese history .
