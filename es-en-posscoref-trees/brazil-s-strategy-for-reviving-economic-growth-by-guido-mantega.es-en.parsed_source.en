Brazil &apos;s Economic Revolution 
BRASILIA - Large emerging economies were hit hard in the past year - particularly in the first half - by the crisis in developed countries , with Europe in recession and the United States staging only a meager recovery . 
But 2012 will also be remembered as the year when structural changes in the Brazilian economy were consolidated . 
The global economic crisis that began in 2008 is similar to the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s not only in terms of its depth and duration , but also in view of advanced countries &quot; policy errors and hesitation . 
It is worrying that European leaders find it so difficult to agree on fiscal adjustment policies that make room for the stimulus measures needed to revive economic growth . 
Until now , European countries with fiscal leeway have insisted on spending and investment cuts that , together with tax increases , have reduced economic activity and increased unemployment , ultimately compromising tax collection - and thus fiscal consolidation . 
In the US , despite a slight improvement , uncertainty lingers . 
In addition to the risk posed by the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; in 2013 , the main problem remains : the lack of effective counter-cyclical fiscal policies - for example , a public-investment program - to boost economic activity . 
Instead , the US has placed all of its chips on monetary easing , unleashing what I have called a currency war , in which global investors , chasing higher yields , flood into emerging countries , driving up their exchange rates . 
The poor international environment hit Brazil &apos;s economy mainly via foreign trade , aggressive competition in the Brazilian market , and echoes of the negative expectations prevailing in advanced countries . 
To combat the downturn , Brazil &apos;s government implemented measures that are now yielding clear dividends . 
The main change was a large reduction in interest rates , in line with an inflation-targeting framework , which has led to a more competitive exchange-rate policy . 
This was combined with a counter-cyclical fiscal policy has that kept deficits and public debt under control . 
More important , the government &apos;s policies will have a permanent - indeed , revolutionary - impact on Brazil &apos;s economy . 
This will become more obvious throughout 2013 . 
For a long time , Brazil &apos;s interest rates were among the highest in the world . 
Besides damaging public accounts and imposing a severe fiscal sacrifice on the country , the abnormally high level of the Selic rate ( the Brazilian overnight interbank rate ) inhibited the &quot; animal spirits &quot; of entrepreneurship , distorted resource allocation , and impeded the development of the real-estate and capital markets , while causing currency appreciation . 
Over time , the persistence of these conditions undermined the competitiveness of domestic industry , impeding sales of Brazilian products not only internationally , but also in the robust and growing internal market . 
The government &apos;s macroeconomic stabilization efforts , coupled with policies that increased the country &apos;s growth potential , allowed the interest rate to fall over the last decade . 
Nevertheless , until 2011 , the Selic remained at levels that were incompatible with the economy &apos;s clear strengths and low risks . 
Reducing borrowing costs without unleashing inflation was one of the main challenges faced by President Dilma Rousseff when she took office at the beginning of that year . 
The resurgence of crisis conditions , particularly in the eurozone , had halted the resumption of global growth - and provided an added incentive to accelerate domestic reforms . 
The process of reducing interest rates - anchored on a solid tax policy and enabled by the removal of institutional obstacles ( such as the rule of remuneration of savings accounts ) - was extended to the second half of 2012 , leading to a real annual rate under 2 % . 
This resulted in a significant reduction in the interest-rate differential with other countries , which , together with a more active intervention policy in the spot and future markets , brought the exchange rate to a much more competitive level , despite the global currency war . 
While these two fundamental changes are here to stay , Brazil &apos;s government has gone even further . 
We have pressed ahead on reducing the tax burden by decreasing various rates , particularly on payroll taxes , thereby reducing hiring costs without harming workers &quot; purchasing power - one reason why Brazil is now one of the world &apos;s few major economies with low unemployment . 
The fiscal bureaucracy , too , is being modernized , with the deployment of electronic tax notifications and other administrative reforms boosting revenue collection while diminishing the size of the informal economy . 
To accelerate economic growth , the priority has been to stimulate investment and recovery in manufacturing , the sector that was hardest hit by the international crisis . 
We have launched a program worth more than $ 60 billion for highway and railway concessions , to be followed by a similar program for ports and airports . 
As a result of these measures , the Brazilian economy is returning to an annual growth rate of around 4 % , which should be sustained in 2013 . 
More important , the structural changes that we have implemented still have much to contribute to future growth . 
With low interest rates , price stability , a more competitive exchange rate , a lower tax burden , plentiful resources for investment , and the reduction of electricity tariffs , Brazil is strengthening its potential for more rapid expansion . 
Here , it is also important to note our efforts to end the fiscal war among Brazil &apos;s states . 
With the ongoing reform of the interstate ICMS ( a tax levied on the circulation of goods and services ) , investors will have greater legal clarity and security . 
We will also seek to finalize the unification of the PIS / Cofins taxes , Brazil &apos;s overly complicated - and much-criticized - federal taxes levied on businesses &quot; invoicing . 
With these initiatives , Brazil &apos;s government has sought to ensure that annual growth remains above 4 % for many years , regardless of the challenges - which will certainly persist in 2013 - posed by the international environment . 
Only through such sustained growth can per capita income approach the levels prevailing in the developed world . 
What we hope for most is that rich countries - and not only the BRICs ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) - also contribute to global recovery . 
If we act together and pull in the same direction , we all will win .
