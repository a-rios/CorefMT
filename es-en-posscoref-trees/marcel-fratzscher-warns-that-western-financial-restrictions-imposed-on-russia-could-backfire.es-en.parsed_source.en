Sanctions Blowback 
BERLIN - With the crisis in Ukraine intensifying , the United States and the European Union are locked in a battle of wills - and sanctions - with Russia . 
Indeed , in retaliation for the intensification of Western financial sanctions , Russia has announced a ban on food and agricultural imports from the US and the EU . 
Consider Russia &apos;s 1998 financial crisis . 
In August of that year , then-President Boris Yeltsin declared , &quot; There will be no devaluation - that is firm and definite . &quot; 
Three days later , the ruble was devalued , and Russian financial markets went into a tailspin . 
With capital pouring out of the country , the Russian government was forced to restructure its debt , and the economy entered a deep recession . 
Though Russia was relatively insignificant financially , its crisis had far-reaching consequences . 
Among the worst affected was Argentina ; the Russian crisis exacerbated a decline in investors &quot; confidence in emerging markets that culminated in Argentina &apos;s sovereign default less than four years later . 
Even the US and Europe were not immune , with the collapse of the major hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management ( LTCM ) fueling anxiety about the viability of many other financial institutions . 
Today &apos;s financial dramas bear a striking resemblance to this experience . 
Argentina has technically defaulted ; 
The most obvious similarity is Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s assertions that his country can weather any and all Western sanctions . 
That may be wishful thinking . 
In fact , barring most major Russian banks from operating freely in Western capital markets could affect the entire Russian economy , not just the banks themselves . 
The problem with financial sanctions is that no one knows precisely how they will unfold - especially in an economy as large as Russia &apos;s . 
If they prove to be more effective than intended , they will pose a serious threat to global financial stability . 
The restrictions on Russian banks operating in Europe and the US appear modest . 
The banks can still access money markets , cover their short-term financing needs , and count on the central bank for support . 
Though Russia &apos;s public debt is modest , its foreign-exchange reserves large , and its economy much stronger than in 1998 , once the herd is running , it is impossible to stop it . 
Europe &apos;s banks have extended almost â‚¬ 200 billion ( $ 268 billion ) in loans to Russian institutions and firms , and hold a significant share of Russia &apos;s euro-denominated assets , making them especially vulnerable . 
Moreover , the eurozone &apos;s current stress tests may well reveal significant capital holes in major European banks in the coming months . 
Having just emerged from a deep recession , financial disruptions could easily cause Europe to slide back into recession , particularly given the eurozone economy &apos;s close links to Russia via trade and energy . 
Compounding the problem , no one truly understands the precise connections among Russian and European institutions and markets . 
The collapse of LTCM in 1998 was completely unexpected . 
Is Europe today prepared to deal with a similar failure of an important financial institution ? 
The financial sanctions on Russia are not targeted , temporary , or fully credible . 
If they affect Russia &apos;s entire economy , hitting ordinary citizens the hardest , popular support for Putin &apos;s regime may solidify further . 
Of course , an economic slowdown could erode Putin &apos;s popular support , which is based on the gains in living standards made under his leadership . 
In that case , Putin &apos;s response could be even more damaging . 
Another problem is that implementing sanctions that cannot be reversed quickly removes the incentive for Russia to return to the negotiating table , especially because the threat of an escalation of financial sanctions lacks credibility , given the risk to European and US financial stability . 
And , as Russia &apos;s experience in 1998 , and Argentina &apos;s after 2002 , demonstrated , the process of restoring confidence among market participants is a long and painful one . 
These concerns do not mean that the US and the EU should not impose sanctions on Russia for its illegal annexation of Crimea and continuing efforts to destabilize eastern Ukraine . 
Though such sanctions may not work as quickly , they would be targeted , temporary , and credible , enabling the US and Europe to control - and adjust - the impact on the Russian leadership and economy . 
In any case , US and European leaders must recognize that all sanctions will have costs - many of them unexpected - for both sides . 
If they are not willing to risk global financial stability in an unpredictable game of chicken with Putin , perhaps it would be wise to re-think the composition of the sanctions that they impose .
