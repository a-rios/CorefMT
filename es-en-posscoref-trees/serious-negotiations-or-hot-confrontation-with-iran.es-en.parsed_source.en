Serious Negotiations or Hot Confrontation with Iran ? 
Berlin - For two weeks , it looked like the regime in Iran had finally gotten the message that , if it continues to pursue its nuclear program , serious military confrontation is likely to result . 
Indeed , there were interesting - and previously unheard of - statements and signals from Teheran that suggested an increased willingness to start negotiating about Iran &apos;s nuclear program and regional security issues . 
And America &apos;s decision to send Undersecretary of State William Burns to a meeting with Iran &apos;s top nuclear negotiator suggests that those signals are being taken seriously . 
But the recent military muscle-flexing with rocket tests and the rejection of a compromise by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and his foreign minister show that the country &apos;s leadership is seriously divided over the strategic line that Iran should pursue . 
Iran &apos;s leadership still harbors the misconception that Israeli threats against its nuclear facilities are an expression of the domestic difficulties of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s government . 
This is plainly wrong . 
Olmert &apos;s government has serious problems , but they are not the reason that the situation between Israel and Iran is coming to a head . 
On the contrary , a cross-party consensus exists in Israel concerning Iran &apos;s possible nuclear armament and regional hegemony . 
All sides agree that , unless there is a diplomatic solution , Iran &apos;s possession of nuclear weapons must be prevented in good time and by any means necessary . 
Moreover , Saudi Arabia and some other Arab countries share this view , albeit behind closed doors . 
If Iran adopts a more realistic approach , there is real hope for a diplomatic solution . 
The most recent offer of the 5 + 1 group ( the United Nations Security Council &apos;s five permanent members and Germany ) was well received in Teheran . 
In addition to far-reaching political and economic cooperation , the offer promises cooperation on nuclear matters , including the construction and supply of the newest light-water reactors in Iran , as well as Iranian access to nuclear research and development - provided that there is a negotiated settlement . 
But what was really new is that Iran also responded positively to the procedure proposed by the 5 + 1 group . 
In the pre-negotiation phase , this means that Iran would agree not to install any new centrifuges , necessary for increasing the volume of uranium being enriched , while the 5 + 1 group would refrain from calling for new sanctions in the Security Council . 
Once negotiations start , Iran would , under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency , suspend its uranium enrichment and all related activities for six months - something that the Iranian government refused even to discuss in the last four years . 
For its part , the Security Council would suspend all its deliberations related to the Iranian nuclear program . 
The aim of these negotiations is a comprehensive agreement between Iran and the 5 + 1 group that would resolve both the nuclear conflict and address regional security issues ( Iraq , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Lebanon , Persian Gulf , Afghanistan ) while opening up extensive international and regional cooperation . 
There were also signals emanating from Iran that , having , having mastered uranium enrichment technology , the authorities could envisage continuing enrichment in a third country in a joint consortium with the West . 
A similar proposal made by Russia was unceremoniously dismissed only a short time ago . 
Moreover , while there is no willingness to accept Israeli hegemony , the tone vis-Ã -vis Israel is beginning to change . 
Ahmadinejad &apos;s vile anti-Semitism has of late been indirectly , but fairly openly , criticized by one of the closest confidants of Iran &apos;s supreme religious leader , former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati . 
Iranian spokesmen also indicate that there is an official awareness of Israel &apos;s importance for a comprehensive regional solution , and that doing business with Israel is no longer inconceivable . 
One hasn &apos;t heard this sort of language in all the years since Ahmadinejad came to power . 
But is Iran really serious ? 
Or are these simply the old stonewalling tactics ? 
Does the government just want to buy time once more , now to make it through the America &apos;s presidential elections ? 
Given the public contradictions in the Iranian leadership &apos;s behavior , is there a reliable Iranian position , and , if so , who represents it ? 
These crucial questions can only be answered by the practical test of negotiations , this time with direct American participation . 
If Iran is serious , the result may be nothing less than the long awaited &quot; Grand Bargain &quot; - a regional reconciliation of interests between Iran , on one side , and America , Europe , and the region &apos;s US allies on the other . 
But if Iran is playing for time , its behavior is shortsighted and foolish . 
The conflict , and thus the danger of a military confrontation , will not disappear under a new US administration . 
On the contrary , should the negotiations fail , the confrontation will resurface in short order , and be far more dangerous . 
Neither John McCain nor Barack Obama will take a softer stance than the current American administration on the question of Iran &apos;s regional hegemony and its nuclear program . 
Indeed , if a diplomatic solution fails , they are more likely to react more forcefully . 
It is therefore imperative that diplomacy , which looks possible at the moment , be given a chance . 
If the top leadership in Teheran has realized that it makes a great deal more sense , and is more in keeping with Iran &apos;s interests , to consolidate the successes of its foreign policy in the last few years , and to strengthen the regime , rather than risk everything in a military showdown with unforeseeable consequences , then there is a real chance for a diplomatic solution . 
If not , the region will be plunged into a hot confrontation . 
There &apos;s wisdom , which Iran &apos;s leaders should heed , in the old adage that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .
