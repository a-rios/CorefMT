China &apos;s Blackstone Coup 
When China National Offshore Oil Company tried to buy America &apos;s UNOCAL two years ago , it set off a political firestorm in the United States . 
When Dubai Ports World bought Britain &apos;s P O Steam Navigation Company , the fact that P O operated ports inside the US led to more controversy in America . 
One would think that a country like the US , with a current account deficit of roughly $ 800 billion a year , would realize that such a yawning external gap is inevitably financed only by selling off assets , which means that foreigners with money acquire ownership and control of US-based businesses . 
Americans evidently hope for a world in which they can have feckless deficit-generating fiscal policies , a very low private savings rate , and a moderate rate of investment , all financed by foreign capital whose owners are happy to bear the risks yet have no control over their assets . 
One might think that foreign investors would quake in terror at these terms and shy away from dollar-denominated assets . 
But this has not been the case . 
The same is true of Russia , whose oligarchs , as well as the huge state investment fund that finance minister Alexi Kudrin has created , also want to invest their oil revenues in the US . 
As for Asia &apos;s governments , with China in the lead , the US remains the importer of last resort . 
The key to their development strategy is to put migrants from the countryside to work making exports destined for the US market . 
Thus , the real values of their currencies must be kept low relative to the dollar , which means that their reserves now invested in the US must continue to grow . 
Someday , of course , this will come to an end . 
Perhaps Asian real currency values will rise sharply as a result of a burst of inflation in Asia . 
Perhaps the dollar will collapse and there will be a burst of inflation in the US as the Federal Reserve Board decides that temporarily abandoning its price-level peg is a lesser evil than the unemployment fallout that will result from a dollar collapse and interest rate spike . 
A government that buys political risk insurance by placing an ever-growing stock of reserve assets in dollar securities guards against some dangers . 
But it is exposed to other risks , especially if it confines its investments to that slice of the asset pool , US Treasury and high-grade corporate bonds , that American politicians are comfortable having foreigners own . 
Nominal bonds are not well hedged against inflation , and , over the long run , assets that are claims to cash without effective control are highly vulnerable to financial vultures . 
Prudent foreign government and private investors would find some way to diversify . 
But how ? 
Buying other countries &quot; bonds would mean abandoning the goal of keeping real currency values low against the dollar . 
Buying up whole enterprises triggers angry speeches in the US Congress . 
What are needed are intermediary organizations that will grant a measure of control to foreigners , allow diversification across a wider range of US-located assets , and yet still appear 100 % American to US politicians . 
Enter the Blackstone Group . 
China &apos;s $ 3 billion investment in Blackstone , while insignificant relative to China &apos;s $ 1.3 trillion of reserve assets - a sum headed for $ 1.5 trillion by the end of this year and likely to hit $ 2 trillion sometime in 2009 - is but a toe dipped in the water , a test run . 
At the start of the process , China will have small and indirect ownership stakes in a great many US enterprises , and the odds are that the usual objections will be absent . 
China will gain a measure of risk diversification , reduce the price pressure that has kept earnings on its foreign exchange reserves low , and avoid running into political trouble . 
Blackstone will gain extra cash to deploy and extra fees . 
Some observers think that the US political backlash against foreigners &quot; buying up America &quot; is what will bring the current configuration of global imbalances to an end . 
Deals like China &apos;s investment in Blackstone postpone that backlash , but not for long : $ 3 billion is equivalent to what China accumulates in reserve in less than three working days . 
The question following China &apos;s Blackstone investment is this : how far can this process go ? 
And how much control will US investors ultimately find that they have given up ?
