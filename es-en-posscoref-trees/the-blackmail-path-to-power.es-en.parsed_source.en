The Blackmail Path to Power 
ABIDJAN - On December 2 , Côte d &apos;Ivoire &apos;s Independent Electoral Commission ( CEI ) declared opposition leader Alassane Ouattara the winner of the country &apos;s November presidential election with 54.1 % of the vote . 
The incumbent , Laurent Gbagbo , gained 45.9 % . 
The United States , European Union , Canada , and United Nations Secretary-General all congratulated Ouattara and called on Gbagbo to respect the people &apos;s will . 
One day after the result was announced , the country &apos;s Constitutional Council , led by Gbagbo &apos;s close ally Paul Yao N &apos;Dre , annulled the results from seven departments in the north , declaring Gbagbo the winner of the election with 51 % of the vote . 
The decision , reached in less than 24 hours , left many Ivorians flabbergasted . 
UN Special Envoy for Côte d &apos;Ivoire Choi Young-jin was categorical , stating that &quot; the proclamation of the final results by the President of the Constitutional Council ... which makes candidate Laurent Gbagbo the winner of the second round , can only be interpreted as a decision having no factual basis . &quot; 
Choi also declared that even if the irregularities alleged by Gbagbo were confirmed , Ouattara still would have won enough votes to carry the election . 
Within 48 hours of the CEI &apos;s announcement , both candidates swore themselves in as President . 
Ouattara went a step further , naming a prime minister and a 13-seat cabinet . 
Gbagbo &apos;s refusal to accept defeat has met with a remarkable international rebuke . 
The Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) strongly condemned any attempt to &quot; usurp the popular will of the people of Côte d &apos;Ivoire and appeals to all stakeholders to accept the results declared by the electoral commission . &quot; 
ECOWAS Chair and Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called on all parties to &quot; respect and fully implement the verdict of the Ivorian people as declared by the Independent Electoral Commission . &quot; 
And US President Barack Obama congratulated Ouattara , and said that the world would &quot; hold those who act to thwart the democratic process and the will of the electorate accountable for their actions . &quot; 
The African Union also responded promptly . 
Its Peace and Security Council met and expressed the AU &apos;s categorical rejection of any attempt to create a fait accompli that undermines the electoral process . 
The AU also sent former South African president Thabo Mbeki and Burkina Faso &apos;s former minister for national security , Djibril Bassolé , who helped broker the Ouagadougou Agreement between then President Gbagbo and rebel leader Guillaume Soro a decade ago . 
But , while the AU &apos;s dispatch of Mbeki demonstrates serious engagement , it should not lead to a negotiated solution or a compromise that thwarts the wishes of a majority of Ivorians . 
Indeed , in recent years an unfortunate trend has emerged in African politics : losing candidates , unhappy with their election results , unleash violence until the only option for mediators is to grant them a continued role in government . 
The will of the voters becomes subordinated to the need to end the chaos . 
As mediator for the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , Mbeki helped broker the Global Political Agreement between Morgan Tsvangirai and Zimbabwe &apos;s President Robert Mugabe . 
Mugabe remained President and Tsvangirai - who won 47 % of the vote in the March 2008 elections , compared to Mugabe &apos;s 43 % - became Prime Minister . 
Their forced partnership has been plagued by disagreement and dysfunction . 
Similarly , in Kenya , President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga signed a power-sharing agreement following elections in January 2008 that were marred by widespread irregularity , violence , and destruction . 
Odinga has on several occasions stated that the power-sharing deal is at risk of collapse . 
It is not farfetched to imagine that Gbagbo hopes to convert his loss at the polls into a similar pact with Ouattara . 
In such a scenario , his continued participation in government would be portrayed as a route to peace . 
This forced hand - presented as a legitimate option - is nothing short of blackmail . 
It is vital that Africa and the international community take a stand against such strategies - not only to defend the votes of Ivorians , but as a signal to others in the future that legitimate electoral results must be respected . 
Africa and the international community have been patient with Côte d &apos;Ivoire , with thousands of hours spent by many people of goodwill on diplomacy and mediation . 
This effort stemmed from a conviction that peace could be achieved only by accommodating all parties &quot; concerns . 
In that spirit , the continent took considerable pride in the successful execution of the 2010 election and in Ivorian voters &quot; courageous and disciplined behavior . 
What Gbagbo and his supporters are doing constitutes a coup d &quot; état . 
They are holding their fellow citizens hostage , bringing the region into disrepute , and , above all , risking a renewed armed conflict . 
It is time to end this impunity .
