Dying to Grow ? 
STANFORD - We are constantly bombarded with information about the purported risks or protective effects of one or another food , dietary supplement , chemical , drug , or activity . 
In July , for example , an article in The Annals of Internal Medicine reported that people who work at least 11 hours a day have a 67 % higher risk of having a heart attack or dying from heart disease than those who work 7-8 hours a day . 
However , the study cannot conclude that long work hours cause cardiac disease . 
In fact , one of the most common misunderstandings about scientific studies is the critical difference between correlation and causation . 
Working long days might be only a marker for being at higher risk of heart disease . 
For example , it could be that highly stressed people with Type A personality who think that bacon cheeseburgers and creamy sauces are staple foods , and who already have an increased , long-term risk of heart disease , also tend to work longer hours . 
Studies that show an association between a factor and a health effect should be regarded as no more than a preliminary result that points researchers toward further research and analysis . 
But even professional regulators , who should know better , sometimes get sidetracked by this sort of misapprehension , and overreact . 
Last December , the US Food and Drug Administration issued a public Drug Safety Communication about results from a large study conducted in France - the Sant√© Adulte GH Enfant , or SAGhE , study - which found an increased risk for death with biosynthetic human growth hormone therapy relative to the general French population . 
There were 93 deaths in the treated group , compared with the 70 expected from a statistical calculation . 
One news article reported the study and FDA alert with this headline , &quot; Are children dying for an inch or two ? &quot; - language guaranteed to terrify the tens of thousands of patients ( and the innumerable body-builders and athletes who use the drug off-label ) who have taken the hormone over the past 26 years . 
This brings us back to the conundrum of correlation versus causation . 
The French study compared all patients who took growth hormone to the general population . 
But the two groups are not at all comparable : kids who receive the drug are far from normal . 
Growth hormone is given to children for various kinds of short stature . 
These include growth-hormone deficiency of unknown cause or as a result of impairment of the pituitary gland &apos;s ability to produce the hormone , owing to traumatic injury or irradiation to treat cancer . 
It is also administered to children who fail to grow because of chronic renal insufficiency or significant genetic abnormalities , including Turner syndrome , Noonan syndrome , and Prader-Willi syndrome . 
These kids are severely impaired . 
Turner syndrome , a chromosomal abnormality in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is absent , manifests itself in several ways . 
These include characteristic physical abnormalities ( most often non-functioning ovaries , which results in the absence of menstrual cycles and sterility ) and various other health problems , such as congenital heart disease , low thyroid hormone levels , and autoimmune diseases . 
Similarly , Noonan syndrome , a relatively common genetic disorder , is marked by abnormal development in various systems of the body that causes unusual facial characteristics , short stature , and cardiac abnormalities . 
Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by poor muscle tone , low levels of sex hormones , and a defect in the part of the brain that controls feelings of satiety or hunger , which leads to overeating and obesity . 
Thus , to expect the same death rate in such patients as in the general population would be like blaming insulin for decreased longevity in diabetics ( who suffer cardiac and renal disease more frequently than non-diabetics ) . 
In fact , it would be big medical news if there were no increase in deaths in patients treated with growth hormone , because that would imply that the drug actually provides a life-prolonging effect in a population expected to die prematurely . 
Another finding in the SAGhE study arouses skepticism about a cause-and-effect relationship between the drug and the increased death rate : the mortality came from causes that are mechanistically and physiologically quite different - mainly bone cancers , cardiovascular diseases , and cerebrovascular events . 
A more narrow , unimodal manifestation of toxicity would be more persuasive in establishing causation . 
American regulators jumped the gun . 
The European Medicines Agency was more measured , saying in a statement , &quot; Based on this observational study alone , the risk cannot be associated with certainty to the growth hormone treatment . 
The results need to be confirmed and complemented with further analyses . &quot; 
There is a reproducible , undeniable association between fires and fire engines , but that doesn &apos;t mean that the latter cause the former . 
If you or a loved one has taken ( or is taking ) human growth hormone under a physician &apos;s supervision , you shouldn &apos;t lose sleep over it .
