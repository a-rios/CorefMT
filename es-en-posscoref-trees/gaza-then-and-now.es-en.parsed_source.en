Gaza Then and Now 
When the Gaza Strip was plunged into darkness last week as a result of the Israeli fuel blockade , many people around the world were surprised . 
But the optimism produced by the Annapolis peace process , which included President George W. Bush &apos;s promise of an agreement in 2008 to create a Palestinian state , was clearly unrealistic . 
Gaza is usually viewed in terms of Hamas &apos;s overwhelming support there , but the reality is much different . 
Opinion polls conducted in Gaza by the Near East Consulting Group in late November 2007 indicated 74 % popular support for a peace agreement with Israel . 
Only 15 % would vote for Hamas MP &apos;s or a Hamas presidential candidate , compared to 55 % for Fatah candidates . 
The Annapolis-inspired peace process received 81 % support . 
Like many territories in the region , Gaza has had a long history of foreign occupation , extending to ancient times . 
In 1949 , the Arab-Israeli war ended with an armistice agreement that divided Palestine into three parts , each under separate political control . 
Israel encompassed more than 77 % of the territory , Jordan was left to rule East Jerusalem and the West Bank , and Egypt took control of Gaza . 
The Palestinian Arab state envisioned by the United Nations &quot; 1947 partition plan , which was to include Gaza , was never established . 
Economic development in the Gaza Strip was limited under Egyptian rule , and the region suffered the burden of absorbing Palestinian refugees fleeing the fighting in the southern part of mandatory Palestine , which would later become Israel . 
Palestinians &quot; access to Egypt was restricted , and much of Gaza &apos;s largely unskilled workforce was dependent on the UN Relief Works Administration , which built and maintained the local refugee camps . 
The 1967 war placed all of mandatory Palestine ( as well as Sinai and the Golan ) under Israeli military occupation . 
Nevertheless , although one-third of the West Bank was closed to Palestinians to make room for a few thousand Jewish settlers , only 10 % of its largely rural population were refugees , many owned their land , and a variety of jobs was available . 
By contrast , 70 % of the Gaza population comprised refugees , who lived in difficult conditions in scores of refugee camps and were largely dependent on work in Israel . 
At one time , more than 150,000 Gazans crossed the Erez checkpoint daily . 
Gaza &apos;s poverty was fertile ground for Islamic radicalism . 
Sheikh Ahmad Yasin , a paraplegic refugee from the village of Jora ( now on Israel &apos;s southern coast ) , worked quietly to build a grass-root movement with the tacit assent of the Israeli army , which sought to encourage an alternative to the PLO . 
But , with the 1987 uprising ( Intifada ) , Yasin &apos;s supporters announced the creation of the Islamic Resistance Movement . 
Better known by its Arabic acronym , HAMAS , Yasin &apos;s group competed with the secular PLO groups by staging amateurish attacks on Jewish settlers and kidnapping Israeli soldiers . 
While the 1987 Intifada brought about the Oslo process and the return of the PLO leadership , it failed to produce a real economy in Gaza . 
The flow of money to the new Palestinian Authority was evident mostly in high-rise buildings , which the PA built to deal with overcrowding . 
Non-PA groups like Hamas acquired their own weapons mostly by buying them from Israeli soldiers or on the Israeli black market . 
Later , after the Israelis withdrew from Gaza , weapons , ammunition , and cash were smuggled through tunnels from Sinai . 
During the second Palestinian Intifada , which erupted in 2000 , Hamas used its weapons and explosives to attack Israelis and create their own small protectorate . 
But the more that Hamas and others attacked Israelis , the more the Israelis tightened the siege on Gaza . 
The number of Gazan workers in Israel was reduced to a few hundred , and rising unemployment and poverty empowered armed factions , gangs , and warlords - a development that intensified after Hamas &apos;s electoral victory in 2006 , which resulted in an international siege that cut off public servants &quot; salaries overnight . 
As a largely refugee population , most Gazans had weak social roots . 
Those with a university education left to work in either the West Bank or the Gulf States , while Gaza &apos;s armed groups became a magnet for most young people - the only job they understood and which gave them power . 
Armed men joined Fatah , Hamas , or other groups and sub-groups , and clans like the Dugmush family ( which kidnapped the BBC journalist Alan Johnston ) boasted a few hundred members willing to kill for pay . 
Clearly , the false trappings of a state provided as part of the Oslo peace process have resulted in little tangible change for Palestinians . 
They got an elected president ( who for a while was trapped in his headquarters ) , a parliament and government ( whose MPs and ministers are not guaranteed passage from Gaza to the West Bank ) , and passports ( whose numbers must be entered into Israeli computers ) . 
What they did not get was real sovereignty , without which it is difficult to imagine any improvement . 
Gaza &apos;s history , and evaporating support for Hamas there , suggest that integrating Gazans into mainstream Palestinian life would not be difficult . 
But it also suggests that maintaining the current siege would merely punish a peace-loving population while strengthening the grip of its worst elements on society and public life .
