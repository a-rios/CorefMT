Nationalism and Terrorism 
BOSTON - September 11 , 2001 , may - at least at first - seem like an inappropriate addition to the history of nationalism , given Al Qaeda &apos;s explicitly stated global pretensions . 
In fact , now that the initial shock and confusion have given way to a more sober perspective , the terrorist attacks of that awful day are increasingly seen - as they should be - as one among numerous other nationalist milestones . 
From this perspective , the attacks no longer appear , as they did to so many immediately afterwards , to reflect an incomprehensible , irrational , and uncivilized mentality , or a different civilization altogether - pre-modern , unenlightened , and fundamentally &quot; traditional &quot; ( in other words , undeveloped ) . 
It is in this unflattering sense that Islam , the dominant religion of an economically backward part of the world , was said to have motivated the attacks of September 11 , 2001 . 
And , because those who believed this ( virtually everyone whose voices were heard ) belatedly perceived its insulting connotation , discussing the matter has caused considerable anguish in the years since . 
There are no euphemisms that can inoffensively imply that one of the great world religions is a murderous , irrational ideology , unacceptable for modern , civilized human beings . 
And yet two different American administrations have implied - and consistently acted upon - this assumption . 
But , once we place the tragedy of September 11 , 2001 , and the broader political phenomenon of international terrorism , in the context of other historical tragedies in the past century , religion becomes an unlikely explanation . 
It is here where the influence of nationalism becomes obvious . 
Nationalism has been the major motive force in the West since the beginning of the modern period . 
Historians have noted its influence in Elizabethan England ( which produced the spirit animating the Puritan Rebellion and migration to America ) , and increasingly recognize it as the motive force behind the French and the Russian Revolutions . 
Meanwhile , Chinese scholars are beginning to view it as the inspiration for Mao Zedong &apos;s struggle against the Kuomintang ( the openly self-named &quot; Nationalist Movement &quot; ) and the policies of the People &apos;s Republic . 
And no historical acumen is needed to understand that nationalism was the source of Hitler &apos;s National Socialism and , therefore , World War II . 
In fact , it would be puzzling if this were not the case , given that nationalism is the cultural foundation of modernity - the framework of its social consciousness . 
And , precisely because nationalism shapes the way we think , its role in phenomena that do not trumpet their nationalist motivation - like Al Qaeda &apos;s attacks in 2001 - can easily be overlooked . 
As a rule , most nationalists do not call themselves nationalists . 
Like the rest of us , they believe that their nationalism is natural and does not have to be emphasized . 
But a little self-examination should lead any thinking person to recognize that we all are nationalists - we feel , think , and react to the world as nationalism prescribes . 
Nationalism is a temporal vision ( and thus secular , even when using religion in its rhetoric ) that divides people into sovereign communities of equal members . 
The equality of national membership ( which , at the same time , may be exclusively defined ) elevates every member &apos;s status to that of the elite , making it dependent on the dignity of the nation as a whole . 
As a result , those who possess national consciousness become committed to and defensive of the dignity of the nation - measured by its standing , or prestige , vis-Ã -vis other nations . 
That is why competition for national prestige has been the main motive in international politics since the beginning of the twentieth century . 
Specifically , the aggressor in many international conflicts in this period has been motivated by perceived injury to national dignity . 
Actual injury is not necessary : the perceived superiority of another nation is enough . 
In an advanced modern society , such as Germany , intellectuals have no difficulty using openly nationalist language to convince a nationally conscious populace of threats to national prestige . 
By contrast , in a society where national consciousness is limited to the better educated ( for example , the Arab Middle East ) , they must resort to traditional means of mobilization . 
In the case of the Middle East , that traditional mobilizer is Islam , and so threats to national prestige are presented as threats to Islam . 
Some nations do not feel threatened by imaginary insults to national dignity - for various historical reasons , they believe themselves to be superior to others . 
But , if their prestige is in fact at stake , the perception of a threat becomes decisive . 
Why else would citizens across the developed world be so preoccupied with their economic competitiveness ? 
Is it not enough for us to be well off ? 
Why do we need to be better off than others ? 
Why , for example , do Americans feel so threatened by the peaceful economic rise of China ( as they did by Japan &apos;s economic success in the 1980 &quot; s ) ? 
To no longer be &quot; Number One &quot; would offend America &apos;s sense of dignity . 
There is no more to it than that . 
China is now also motivated by nationalism , and it will rise as high as a motivated population of 1.3 billion people can . 
The threat to America &apos;s international standing is real ; but , blinded by it , Americans believe that they are still in a position to condescend to China as they would to an inferior power . 
For the time being , the Chinese may be too preoccupied with their own backyard to pay attention to such insults , but it is foolish to offend them deliberately . 
Because Americans misunderstood the motives behind the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the United States fought two costly wars , which did not defeat its enemies and have left the Middle East more volatile than ever . 
Being blind to the connection between nationalism and dignity in China - and in America &apos;s own conduct when dealing with China - may cost the US even more .
