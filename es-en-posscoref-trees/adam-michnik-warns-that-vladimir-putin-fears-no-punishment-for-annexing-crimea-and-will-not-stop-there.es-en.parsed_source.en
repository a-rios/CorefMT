The Russian Godfather 
WARSAW - Russian President Vladimir Putin is behaving like a Mafia boss . 
In invading , occupying , and finally annexing Crimea , he pointed Russia &apos;s guns at Ukraine and said : your territorial sovereignty or your life . 
So far , extortion has worked - and Putin knows it . 
Indeed , in his speech announcing the annexation of Crimea , Putin spoke his mind : his regime fears no punishment and will do whatever it pleases . 
Crimea is just the first step toward realizing his dream of revived Russian greatness . 
His address in the Kremlin was a tissue of lies and manipulation , though a subtle analysis would be a waste of time . 
The simple fact is that the president of one of the world &apos;s most powerful countries has embarked on a path of confrontation with the entire international community . 
His speech smacked of the fevered , paranoid world of Fyodor Dostoyevsky &apos;s Demons , conjuring as it did a delusional alternative universe - a place that does not exist and has never existed . 
What does Kosovo , where the Albanians suffered persecution and ethnic cleansing , have in common with the situation in Crimea , whose people have never been oppressed by Ukrainians ? 
What is the point in displaying open contempt for Ukraine &apos;s government , parliament , and people ? 
Why label Ukrainian authorities &quot; fascist and anti-Semitic &quot; ? 
Crimean Tatars pay no heed to the fairy tales about fascists ruling Ukraine ; they can still remember the brutal and murderous mass deportations of their parents and grandparents , ordered by Stalin and carried out by the NKVD . 
In Putin &apos;s mind , the whole world has discriminated against Russia for the last three centuries . 
Russia &apos;s bloody despots - Catherine II , Nicholas I , or Stalin - apparently never discriminated against anyone . 
Putin also warns that &quot; you and we - the Russians and the Ukrainians - could lose Crimea completely . &quot; 
Yet he fails to specify who - perhaps Poles and Lithuanians again ? - are setting their sights on Sevastopol . 
Russia could not , according to Putin , leave the people of Crimea &quot; alone in their predicament . &quot; 
These words prompt a sad smile ; 
Leonid Brezhnev used precisely the same phrase in August 1968 to justify the Red Army &apos;s intervention in Czechoslovakia to help beleaguered Communist hardliners there crush the Prague Spring reform movement . 
&quot; We want Ukraine to be a strong , sovereign , and independent country , &quot; says Putin . 
Stalin said the same thing about Poland in 1945 . 
Brave Russian democrats who have not yet been silenced have already remarked on the similarity between Putin &apos;s appeal to ethnic solidarity in annexing Crimea and Hitler &apos;s stance during the Anschluss and the Sudeten crisis in 1938 . 
This is the real end of history - the history of dreams about a world governed by democratic values and the market economy . 
Unless the democratic world understands that now is not the time for faith in diplomatic compromise , and that it must respond strongly enough to stop Putin &apos;s imperial designs , events could follow a logic that is too dreadful to contemplate . 
I commend and take pride in Poland &apos;s prudent and determined policy and the attitude of its public , which do us great credit . 
But we must recognize that the best quarter-century in the last 400 years of Polish history is about to end before our very eyes . 
A time of tectonic shifts has begun . 
We must appreciate what we have managed to achieve - and learn to protect it . 
Mafia bosses often meet an unhappy fate , and I do not think that Putin will fare much better in the end . 
Unfortunately , many people are likely to be hurt in the meantime , not least those who now support him .
