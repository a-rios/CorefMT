Getting Investment in Europe Right 
PARIS - The European Commission &apos;s new president , Jean-Claude Juncker , has put public investment back on the agenda with his idea of a three-year € 300 billion ( $ 378 billion ) capital spending plan . 
The European Union &apos;s leaders are expected to discuss his proposal in December . 
Everyone seems to agree that more investment would help to strengthen a worryingly feeble European economy . 
But , behind the superficial consensus , many questions remain unanswered . 
For starters , this is not the first time that Europe has considered such an initiative . 
In 1993 , the Commission , under Jacques Delors , proposed a capital spending plan in its White Paper on growth , competitiveness and employment . 
The plan was broadly endorsed , but no action was taken . 
Likewise , in 2000 , as part of its Lisbon Strategy , the EU sought to increase national spending on research and development to 3 % of GDP . 
It failed to reach this target . 
More recently , in June 2012 , EU leaders adopted a Compact for Growth and Jobs that was supposed to mobilize € 120 billion . 
The check is still in the mail . 
It is indeed easy to pretend to act without taking effective action . 
One way is to ask the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the EU &apos;s development bank , to lend more . 
Such calls face two limitations : the EIB itself is careful not to jeopardize its financial rating by taking on too much risk , and its loans easily substitute for private financing . 
More lending therefore can be pointless if it results in the EIB crowding out private financing of the best available projects . 
A bridge financed by the EIB may be more affordable than one financed by capital markets , but it remains the same bridge and has the same economic impact . 
The size of the EIB &apos;s balance sheet is not a good measure of its effectiveness . 
Instead , three investment levers should be used . 
The first lever is budgetary : Governments that enjoy fiscal space should spend on economically sound projects . 
Public investment is a complement to private investment ; if designed and targeted well , it can trigger more private investment , rather than crowding it out . 
For example , adequate transport and broadband infrastructure favors the burgeoning of business initiatives . 
At a time when markets are willing to lend to solvent governments at historically low rates , there should be little room for hesitation . 
Obviously , cheap financing does not justify public investment in projects with dubious social returns , or what development practitioners call &quot; white elephants &quot; : headline-grabbing projects of disputable value but supported by special interests . 
Investments should be assessed on the basis of their overall economic impact , with proper procedures put in place to prevent public money from being wasted . 
The second lever for investment is regulatory in nature . 
Many large-scale investments that only pay off over the long term - for example , in energy , digital infrastructure , and transport - are concentrated in state-regulated sectors , giving governments the power to influence business decisions . 
Predictability regarding the future course of regulation would unlock projects held back by uncertainty . 
A credible outlook for the price of carbon , for example , would prompt new private-sector investment in cleaner technologies . 
Similarly , an agreed European framework for projects that connect countries would remove obstacles to cross-border investment . 
These conditions are a long way from being met , which means that profitable investments are not being made . 
Changing that would not cost a single euro ; it requires only political resolve . 
The third lever is financial . 
Investment demand has slackened not because interest rates are too high , but because there is not enough risk appetite within the banking system . 
Financing in continental Europe is traditionally bank-based , unlike in the US , where capital markets reign supreme . 
But banks are being told by regulators to reduce their leverage and to post higher capital when they embark on risky lending , and their creditors are being told that they should not expect to be bailed out if banks get into trouble . 
This is intentional . 
Governments and citizens in Europe have paid - and are still paying - an astronomically high price for the reckless lending and investment of the 2000s . 
Understandably , they do not want to repeat the experience . 
The consequence , however , is that high-risk , high-return projects are more difficult to finance than they should be . 
If Europe wants to revive its economy and escape stagnation , it needs entrepreneurs to take more risk to innovate . 
But its financial system is undergoing a transition from a bank-based to a market-based system that involves risk aversion . 
This is where the public side - both national governments and the EU - should step in and share some of the risk with private players . 
They should temporarily behave more like investors who scrutinize projects , contribute funding , and earn returns . 
Using the EIB and national development banks to this end would help overcome the current impasse . 
Would these three types of initiatives add up to € 300 billion ? 
No one knows at this stage . 
But this route would be the surest way to reach the goal .
