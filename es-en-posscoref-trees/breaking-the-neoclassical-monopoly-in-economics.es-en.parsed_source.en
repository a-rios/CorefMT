Breaking the Neoclassical Monopoly in Economics 
For 25 years , the so-called &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; - comprising measures aimed at expanding the role of markets and constraining the role of the state - has dominated economic development policy . 
As John Williamson , who coined the term , put it in 2002 , these measures &quot; are motherhood and apple pie , which is why they commanded a consensus . &quot; 
Not anymore . 
Dani Rodrik , a renowned Harvard University economist , is the latest to challenge the intellectual foundations of the Washington Consensus in a powerful new book titled One Economics , Many Recipes : Globalization , Institutions , and Economic Growth . 
Rodrik &apos;s thesis is that though there is only one economics , there are many recipes for development success . 
Rodrik has rendered a major service by stating so openly the claim of &quot; one economics . &quot; 
A critic who made the same claim that economics allows only one theoretical approach would be dismissed as paranoid , whereas Rodrik &apos;s standing creates an opportunity for a debate that would not otherwise be possible . 
The &quot; many recipes &quot; thesis is that countries develop successfully by following eclectic policies tailored to specific local conditions rather than by following generic best-practice formulas designed by economic theorists . 
This challenges the Washington Consensus , with its one-size-fits-all formula of privatization , deregulated labor markets , financial liberalization , international economic integration , and macroeconomic stability based on low inflation . 
But , while the many recipes thesis has strong appeal and empirical support , and suggests a spirit of theoretical pluralism , the claim of &quot; one economics &quot; is misguided , for it implies that mainstream neoclassical economics is the only true economics . 
Part of the difficulty of exposing this narrowness is that there is a family split among neo-classical economists between those who believe that real-world market economies approximate perfect competition and those who don &apos;t . 
Believers are identified with the &quot; Chicago School , &quot; whose leading exponents include Milton Friedman and George Stigler . 
Non-believers are identified with the &quot; MIT School &quot; associated with Paul Samuelson . 
Rodrik is of the MIT School , as are such household names as Paul Krugman , Joseph Stiglitz , and Larry Summers . 
This split obscures the underlying uniformity of thought . 
The Chicago School claims that real-world market economies produce roughly efficient ( so-called &quot; Pareto optimal &quot; ) outcomes on which public policy cannot improve . 
Thus , any state intervention in the economy must make someone worse off . 
The MIT School , by contrast , argues that real-world economies are afflicted by pervasive market failures , including imperfect competition and monopoly , externalities associated with problems like pollution , and an inability to supply public goods such as street lighting or national defense . 
Consequently , policy interventions that address market failures - as well as widespread information imperfections and the non-existence of many needed markets - can make everyone better off . 
None of this is about fairness , which is a separate issue . 
Indeed , neither the Chicago School nor the MIT School say that market outcomes are fair , because actual market outcomes depend on the initial distribution of resources . 
If that distribution was unfair , current and future outcomes will be unfair , too . 
Chicago economists seem to believe that real-world outcomes are acceptably unfair and , more importantly , that attempts to remedy unfairness are too costly , because tampering with markets causes economic inefficiency . 
They believe that government intervention tends to generate its own costly failures because of bureaucratic incompetence and rent-seeking , whereby private interests try to steer policy to their own advantage . 
MIT economists tend to espouse the opposite : fairness is important , the real world is unacceptably unfair , and government failure can be prevented by good institutional design , including democracy . 
These differences reflect the intellectual richness of neo-classical economics , but they provide no justification for the claim that there is one economics . 
On the contrary , heterodox economists like Thorsten Veblen and Joseph Schumpeter long ago raised many of today &apos;s cutting-edge issues in neoclassical economics , including the role of social norms and the relationship between technological innovation and business cycles . 
Heterodox economics includes core theoretical concepts that are fundamentally incompatible with neoclassical economics in either of its two contemporary forms . 
These concepts result in significantly different explanations of the real world , including income distribution and the determinants of economic activity and growth . 
Moreover , they often result in different policy prescriptions . 
The late Robert Heilbronner - one of Schumpeter &apos;s most renowned students - viewed economics as &quot; worldly philosophy . &quot; 
Just as philosophers are divided on the nature of truth and understanding , economics is divided on the workings of the real world . 
Paradigms should co-exist in economics , just as in other social sciences . 
Yet , in practice , the dominance of the belief in &quot; one economics , &quot; particularly in North America and Europe , has led increasingly to a narrow and exclusionary view of the discipline . 
This reality is difficult to convey . 
One reason is that liberal neo-classical economists like Stiglitz and Krugman share values with heterodox economists , and shared values are easily conflated with shared analysis . 
Another reason is that heterodox and MIT School economists also often agree on policy , even if their reasoning is different . 
Finally , most people are incredulous that economists could be so audacious as to enforce one view of economics . 
The &quot; many recipes &quot; thesis enriches neo-classical economics &quot; contribution to the development debate , and many of its policy proposals will find support from heterodox economists . 
However , it fails to engage the deep intellectual divisions regarding economic development , trade , and globalization , because it refuses to admit the legitimacy of such disagreements . 
By repeating the claim of &quot; one economics , &quot; Rodrik inadvertently reveals the censorship embedded in contemporary economics . 
The great challenge is not to admit that there are many recipes , but rather to create space for other perspectives on economic analysis and policy .
