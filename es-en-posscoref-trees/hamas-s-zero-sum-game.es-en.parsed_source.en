Hamas &apos;s Zero-Sum Game 
Imagine your next-door neighbor - with whom you have had a long and bloody feud - pulling out a gun and shooting into your windows , from his own living room , which is densely packed with women and children . 
In fact , he &apos;s holding his daughter on his lap as he tries to target your own kids . 
He claims he will not stop until your family is dead . 
What should you do ? 
One option is to do nothing , or little . 
You try this for a while . 
After all , your neighbor is poor and traumatized , there is a sad and complicated history between you , and you bear some of the blame . 
But finally , as one shot hits your child &apos;s bedroom , you decide that enough is enough . 
You attempt a surgical strike : aim at the shooter &apos;s head and try to spare the innocents . 
In an abstract sense , this is what Israel is doing right now . 
But there is nothing surgical about the blood and agony that have engulfed Gaza in the last week . Try as Israel might to target militants alone , civilian bodies are being pulled from the rubble , because , like our metaphorical gunman &apos;s home , militants and civilians inhabit the same urban space in the Gaza Strip . 
Gaza City and Rafah are crowded and poor - and , more than ever before , they double as army camps . 
Fighters train next to schools , and rockets are stored in the basements of apartment buildings . 
According to recent reports , Hamas &apos;s senior officials are currently hiding in hospitals . 
Over a million Palestinians , unable to flee to either Egypt or Israel , have for years been ruled by a military junta that prioritizes the killing of Israelis , across the international border , at all costs . 
Of course , civilians have always been in the line of fire and conquest , from Troy to Berlin . 
While theories of just war instruct us not to hurt non-combatants , Hamas and its military arm have made a conscious decision , banking on global humanitarian concerns , to ensure that Israel hits as many civilians as possible . 
Even if Israel &apos;s current war against Gaza is a just war - which is suggested by its attempts at limited and &quot; measured &quot; retaliation after eight years of Hamas rockets followed its unilateral retreat from Gaza - it is therefore a very dirty war , too . 
There is a sad zero-sum game between Palestinian suffering and Israeli sovereignty , security , and normal life . 
Most Israelis - even those hoping to see , in their lifetime , an independent and prosperous Palestine - agree that the attack on Hamas was necessary . 
Many others would not like to see the Israeli army launch a ground invasion into Gaza . 
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has rightly allowed convoys of food and medicine into Gaza during the fighting , and Israeli hospitals are treating several injured Gazan citizens . 
Not unreasonably , Israel wants an internationally guaranteed and monitored ceasefire agreement that would put a total stop to Hamas assaults against its territory . 
After all , Israel is the strong guy , the former occupying power , the better shooter . 
Its bombardment of Gaza is not &quot; proportional . &quot; 
Indeed , there is no symmetry of suffering on the two sides of the border . 
Gazans are worse off than Israelis in every conceivable way . 
Or should Israel respond &quot; proportionally , &quot; by firing 10 to 80 rockets , indiscriminately aimed against Gazan homes and schools , every day for the next few years ? 
Israelis have become used to blanket accusations . 
It is the kind of message that unites the nation , left and right , in grim resolve . 
What , Israelis ask , would other countries do ? 
Does the enemy &apos;s civilian suffering trump Israel &apos;s sovereignty ? 
Does it trump the real , if less bloody , agony and fear of hundreds of thousands Israelis over long years ? 
Olmert , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , and Foreign Minister Tzippi Livni have cast aside their political rivalries in order to orchestrate an answer : Israel must fight off the Gazan rockets . 
That said , Israel &apos;s unity may be short-lived . 
It is a democracy , not a one-voice nation , and , with a general election due in February , debate is continuing both within the government and beyond it . 
If the Gaza campaign turns Lebanon-like , with a humanitarian catastrophe , ongoing bombardment of Israeli civilians , or both , domestic criticism will echo loud and clear . 
But even opponents of Olmert &apos;s second war must face the blunt fact that Hamas is lethal . 
To the detriment of their own people , its leaders , Haled Mash &apos;al and Ismail Hanieh , want neither peace nor compromise . 
Like their friend and supporter , President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad of Iran , they want Israel dead . 
It is as simple as that . 
One ray of hope is that moderate Arab leaders , including Egypt &apos;s foreign minister , have openly blamed Hamas for the current Gazan predicament . 
Egypt , Saudi Arabia , and Jordan are willing to broker peace , and perhaps save the Palestinians from their own worst leadership . 
Israel has gone a long way since the Arab world set out to kill it off . 
For the first time , prominent Arab voices acquit Israel of the wholesale blame that some Western critics still lazily throw at it . 
For the time being , Israel should strive for the safest truce it can accomplish , provided that Hamas stops shooting out of its own crowded living room . 
He or she must talk directly to the Arab League , whose proposed peace plan will require tough Israeli negotiation , but is a reasonable start to preventing future wars , including just wars . 
Give it a chance .
