Mobilizing Africa \ u0027s Governments to Fight HIV / AIDS 
Last year a Nigerian team of HIV / AIDS experts performed what many thought to be a miracle : they submitted a well-designed , thoughtfully written , and locally developed proposal to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria . 
The objective was to take successful pilot projects - including a nascent national anti-retroviral therapy ( ARV ) program - and expand them to cover thousands of patients . 
Dr. Suritiri Fola , one of a handful of AIDS experts in Nigeria &apos;s Federal Ministry of Health , was , at age 32 , directing the national ARV program . 
Dr. Fola was expert at doing a lot with a little . 
His constraints were overwhelming : antiquated technology , deteriorating or non-existent physical infrastructure , and an anachronistic health bureaucracy . 
To compose Nigeria &apos;s ARV proposal , he typed on a creaky old computer on loan from a colleague . 
Fola had minimal support from colleagues to overcome the obstacles and frustrations he faced daily . 
Yet the Global Fund approved his proposal without reservation , and it committed to backing his efforts with $ 18 million over the next two years . 
For the first time , he would have sufficient staff , medicines , and training to put thousands on ARV therapy . 
Even so , Fola &apos;s ideal plan will reach only a small portion of those who need therapy . 
In poor countries like Nigeria , the battle against AIDS demands an array of medical personnel , clinics , and medicines that simply do not exist . 
The creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , together with US President George W. Bush &apos;s recent proposal to add $ 10 billion in funds to fight HIV / AIDS , mean that the financial weapons needed to wage the fight against this epidemic are beginning to arrive . 
But spending billions instead of millions will not be enough to get the job done . 
Generating and harnessing top level political commitment to engage societies ravaged by HIV / AIDS is critical to fighting this battle successfully . 
Until recently , Africa &apos;s poorest countries have been failing on this count . 
As a result , dedicated professionals like Fola have found their task insurmountable . 
If a country were at war and knew that one-third of its population were certain to perish in the next ten years , its leaders would most likely declare a state of emergency and commit every resource at their command to averting that outcome . 
Yet , in many African countries , HIV / AIDS is not at the top of the national agenda . 
Ministers of Health continue to discuss the threat of HIV / AIDS in the same breath with cancer , diabetes , and heart disease . 
Unfortunately , even the promise of additional funding cannot overcome governmental intransigence . 
In one southern African country , a leadership group comprising representing the ministry of health , local non-governmental organizations , as well as multi-lateral and bi-lateral aid groups , created a proposal for the Global Fund . 
When they voted on the components to be included in the country &apos;s submission , the HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis plans were accepted but the malaria component was rejected due to its low quality . 
The health ministry representative responsible for the malaria component was a crony of the health minister and complained about his proposal &apos;s rejection . 
In a fury , the Minister of Health pulled rank over the leadership group and announced , &quot; If the malaria proposal is not submitted , no proposal will be submitted . &quot; 
The threat was carried out : this country has put forward no proposal . 
Everyone working in these countries - whether in the private or public sector - must now place the fight against HIV / AIDS front and center . 
It is not wild-eyed extremism to insist that every conversation with an African leader should discuss what they are doing to win the battle against HIV / AIDS . 
But more than conversation is needed . 
Governments must change their ways . 
The proper , efficient use of the expected influx of international funds demands a powerful political commitment from government at the highest level . 
Much of what must be done entails not the rebuilding of atrophied or destroyed institutions , but rather the establishment of institutions that never existed . 
New medical schools , clinics , communications lines , and training centers for medical personnel and counselors must be built . 
Only when public health is deemed the highest priority will such infrastructure be created ( or enhanced ) and funds channeled to the neediest areas . 
Without such a commitment , incoming funds will be mishandled , allocated ineffectively , or remain unspent . 
Too often , leaders issue empty promises and offer unrealistic targets that only heighten pressure on over-stretched program directors . 
Ministries of health cannot go it alone . 
Presidents must pressure their planning , education , and finance ministers to work with the health ministry and other key stakeholders to create a national plan that focuses the government &apos;s energies . 
They must hold their public health leaders accountable for their actions and demand results . 
Cementing and focusing political leadership will take time . 
But if there &apos;s one lesson the HIV / AIDS virus has taught public health officials , it is that waiting only creates opportunities for the epidemic that will cost us millions of lives . 
Delay is an ally of no one but the disease . 
A towering myth in the fight against HIV / AIDS is that high-quality local talent does not exist . 
Dr. Fola , a leader in the fight against AIDS in Nigeria , died in an automobile accident last May . 
But he proved that such capacity exists , albeit in small numbers . 
If donor countries provide adequate financial and technical resources , and recipient governments offer the necessary financial and political commitment , a generation of Folas will be found to carry the fight forward .
