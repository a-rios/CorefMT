Muddling Out of Freefall 
NEW YORK - Defeat in the Massachusetts senatorial election has deprived America &apos;s Democrats of the 60 votes needed to pass health-care reform and other legislation , and it has changed American politics - at least for the moment . 
But what does that vote say about American voters and the economy ? 
It does not herald a shift to the right , as some pundits suggest . 
Rather , the message it sends is the same as that sent by voters to President Bill Clinton 17 years ago : 
&quot; It &apos;s the economy , stupid ! &quot; and &quot; Jobs , jobs , jobs . &quot; 
Indeed , on the other side of the United States from Massachusetts , voters in Oregon passed a referendum supporting a tax increase . 
The US economy is in a mess - even if growth has resumed , and bankers are once again receiving huge bonuses . 
As Europe learned long ago , hardship increases with the length of unemployment , as job skills and prospects deteriorate and savings gets wiped out . 
The 2.5-3.5 million foreclosures expected this year will exceed those of 2009 , and the year began with what is expected to be the first of many large commercial real-estate bankruptcies . 
Even the Congressional Budget Office is predicting that it will be the middle of the decade before unemployment returns to more normal levels , as America experiences its own version of &quot; Japanese malaise . &quot; 
As I wrote in my new book Freefall , President Barack Obama took a big gamble at the start of his administration . 
Instead of the marked change that his campaign had promised , he kept many of the same officials and maintained the same &quot; trickle down &quot; strategy to confront the financial crisis . 
Providing enough money to the banks was , his team seemed to say , the best way to help ordinary homeowners and workers . 
When America reformed its welfare programs for the poor under Clinton , it put conditions on recipients : they had to look for a job or enroll in training programs . 
But when the banks received welfare benefits , no conditions were imposed on them . 
Had Obama &apos;s attempt at muddling through worked , it would have avoided some big philosophical battles . 
But it didn &apos;t work , and it has been a long time since popular antipathy to banks has been so great . 
Obama wanted to bridge the divides among Americans that George W. Bush had opened . 
But now those divides are wider . 
His attempts to please everyone , so evident in the last few weeks , are likely to mollify no one . 
Deficit hawks - especially among the bankers who laid low during the government bailout of their institutions , but who have now come back with a vengeance - use worries about the growing deficit to justify cutbacks in spending . 
But these views on how to run the economy are no better than the bankers &quot; approach to running their own institutions . 
Cutting spending now will weaken the economy . 
So long as spending goes to investments yielding a modest return of 6 % , the long-term debt will be reduced , even as the short-term deficit increases , owing to the higher tax revenues generated by the larger output in the short run and the more rapid growth in the long run . 
Trying to &quot; square the circle &quot; between the need to stimulate the economy and please the deficit hawks , Obama has proposed deficit reductions that , while alienating liberal democrats , were too small to please the hawks . 
Other gestures to help struggling middle-class Americans may show where his heart is , but are too small to make a meaningful difference . 
Three things can make a difference : a second stimulus , stemming the tide of housing foreclosures by addressing the roughly 25 % of mortgages that are worth more than the value the house , and reshaping our financial system to rein in the banks . 
There was a moment a year ago when Obama , with his enormous political capital , might have been able to achieve this ambitious agenda , and , building on these successes , go on to deal with America &apos;s other problems . 
But anger about the bailout , confusion between the bailout ( which didn &apos;t restart lending , as it was supposed to do ) and the stimulus ( which did what it was supposed to do , but was too small ) , and disappointment about mounting job losses , has vastly circumscribed his room for maneuver . 
Indeed , there is even skepticism about whether Obama will be able to push through his welcome and long overdue efforts to curtail the too-big-to-fail banks and their reckless risk-taking . 
And , without that , more likely than not , the economy will face another crisis in the not-too-distant future . 
Most Americans , however , are focused on today &apos;s downturn , not tomorrow &apos;s . 
Growth over the next two years is expected to be so anemic that it will barely be able to create enough jobs for new entrants to the labor force , let alone to return unemployment to an acceptable level . 
Unfettered markets may have caused this calamity , and markets by themselves won &apos;t get us out , at least any time soon . 
Government action is needed , and that will require effective and forceful political leadership .
