The American Comeback Kid 
VIENNA - As is customary at the start of a new year , imposing statistics and trend forecasts are being trumpeted worldwide . 
For example , in 2016 , China is expected to replace the United States as the world &apos;s largest economy . 
Perhaps the most startling projection is that the US will become an energy exporter by 2020 , and will become energy self-sufficient 15 years later , owing to the plentiful supply of inexpensive shale gas and the discovery of massive oil reserves everywhere from North Dakota to the Gulf of Mexico . 
Despite opposition from environmental groups , these reserves will be easier to exploit than those in Europe , because they are largely located in sparsely populated areas . 
As a result , energy will be significantly cheaper in the US than in Europe or China for the foreseeable future . 
Indeed , shale-gas extraction is so economically favorable that even American gas exported to Europe would cost 30 % less than what the Russian energy giant Gazprom currently charges . 
Cheap energy provides a powerful incentive for energy-intensive industries - from steel and glass to chemicals and pharmaceuticals - to locate in the US . 
Meanwhile , American universities still attract the world &apos;s best and brightest in many fields , most notably in science and technology . 
And the country &apos;s other longstanding advantages - flexibility , capacity for renewal , economic mobility , international regulatory strength , and the world &apos;s main reserve currency - remain in place . 
Given these favorable conditions , the US has already begun &quot; on-shoring &quot; its industry - a process that will most likely continue for several decades . 
As other advanced economies become increasingly services-based , the US is reindustrializing . 
The resulting added value will bolster policymakers &quot; ability to find long-term solutions to persistent problems , including an inefficient health-care system , inadequate primary and secondary education , and blatant social injustice . 
Success in these areas would further enhance America &apos;s appeal as an industrial center . 
As part of the Harvard Business School &apos;s US Competiveness Project , Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin recently published an eight-point plan , which could be implemented within the next two to three years . 
Each proposed measure has generated broad , bipartisan agreement among policymakers ( at least behind closed doors ) . 
The plan highlights the need to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by shale gas and newly discovered oil reserves . 
Low-cost domestic energy could help to lower the trade deficit , spur investment , and decrease America &apos;s economic exposure to volatile oil-exporting countries . 
A strong federal regulatory framework could help to ensure this result , while minimizing the environmental and safety risks associated with extraction . 
Other proposals include easing the immigration of highly skilled individuals , particularly graduates from US universities ; addressing distortions in international trade and investment ; developing a more sustainable federal budget framework ; streamlining taxes and regulations ; and initiating an ambitious infrastructure program . 
By pursuing these strategies , President Barack Obama could restore America &apos;s position as the engine of the global economy . 
But implementing the eight policy proposals would also widen further the wealth gap between the US and Europe , which has been growing for the last three decades . 
In 1980-2005 , the US economy grew by a factor of 4.45 - a level that no major European economy even approached . 
In 2011 , Norway and Luxemburg were the only European countries with higher per capita national income than the US in purchasing power parity terms . 
And , by 2040 , European countries &quot; populations will have stagnated or shrunk ( with the exception of the United Kingdom , which will have a population of roughly 75 million , comparable to Germany ) , while America &apos;s will have grown to 430 million , from 314 million today . 
The political consequences of the US economy &apos;s renewed strength will reverberate worldwide . 
This recognition has already dampened US policymakers &quot; support for the Arab Spring uprisings : witness Obama &apos;s hesitation to intervene in Libya and his unwillingness , at least so far , to involve America directly in Syria &apos;s bloody civil war . 
Although the Arab Spring &apos;s historic significance was initially likened to that of the fall of the Berlin Wall , mounting concern about the Muslim Brotherhood &apos;s increasing political influence is overshadowing the positive potential of change in the region . 
Likewise , while the US will not relinquish its bilateral relationship with Israel , relations between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Obama have reached a new low . 
In this context , a major American peace initiative in the Middle East is unlikely in the foreseeable future . 
Meanwhile , America &apos;s former rival , Russia , is struggling to restore its hegemony over many of the ex-Soviet countries . 
Given this , America &apos;s foreign-policy priorities have shifted to the Asia-Pacific region , where the most pressing economic , political , and security challenges - including the threat of North Korean missiles and rising tensions between China and its neighbors over competing sovereignty claims in the South and East China Seas - are emerging . 
Other global challenges appear relatively minor in comparison . 
Although the weight of global politics , economics , and , in turn , influence is largely shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific , it would be a mistake to underestimate America &apos;s role in the new world order . 
America never really stepped out of the spotlight , and it will continue to play a leading role .
