The Questions of Europe 
In the weeks since France and the Netherlands rejected the European Union &apos;s proposed Constitutional Treaty , the EU &apos;s leaders have been busy pointing fingers at each other or blaming French and Dutch citizens for misunderstanding the question they were asked . 
To be sure , French and Dutch citizens did not respond to the question that they were supposed to answer . 
Their vote was a protest against globalization , a rejection of the contemporary world , with its distant and incomprehensible governing mechanisms . 
Like the anti-globalization movement , the new anti-Europeanism can be regarded as a demand for a different European model - an &quot; alter-Europeanism . &quot; 
The issue , therefore , is not what Tony Blair , in his inaugural speech to the European Parliament , called a crisis of leadership . 
No statesman has emerged because the crisis runs deeper . 
The two world wars and the Cold War shaped European integration as a project of peace , a defense of the West &apos;s fundamental values , and common economic prosperity . 
This phase culminated with the collapse of communism in 1989 , but the chance to overcome the Continent &apos;s historical divisions now required a redefinition of the European project . 
The treaties of Maastricht ( 1992 ) and Amsterdam ( 1997 ) created a new organizational structure for the EU and laid the foundations for political institutions equal to Europe &apos;s economic power . 
When politicians debated the EU &apos;s future , they spoke of &quot; finality &quot; - the end formula of European integration , as defined in a famous lecture by German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in 2000 . 
The accompanying intellectual debate , inaugurated by the philosophers JÃ¼rgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida , defined the nature of European identity , above all , against the foil of the United States , but also in terms of the challenges posed by globalization . 
That debate must continue , even if the French and Dutch referenda appear to have killed the Constitutional Treaty . 
The EU will continue to be governed under the Nice Treaty of 2000 , but this leaves no room for further political integration ( or enlargement ) , nor does it ensure the effective functioning of the Union &apos;s institutions . 
Drafting a new constitutional treaty would probably require even more time than was needed for the current proposal , and it is also unlikely that the necessary changes could be introduced through an intergovernmental conference . 
The only viable course , then , is to use today &apos;s &quot; pause for reflection &quot; to revive the existing Constitutional Treaty . 
This would require prolonging the ratification deadline until 2008 . 
It also requires specifying a common date for ratification ( through simultaneous referenda or parliamentary votes ) for all countries that have not yet done so , including France and the Netherlands . 
In other words , the current &quot; pause for reflection &quot; is not the time to change the draft &apos;s text ( although the intergovernmental conference could move the third part , which harmonizes the earlier treaties , to an annex ) . 
Rather , the task is to alter the political and socio-psychological context of the ratification process by addressing key questions . 
First , how should relations between national and common European interests be defined ? 
At issue is not only the allocation of competencies , but also the more fundamental matter of when to rely on intergovernmental institutions and when to turn to the European people as a whole . 
The European Council , which represents member states in the structures of the Union , could be given a more public character . 
It could then be seen , in a bicameral system , as a kind of &quot; Chamber of Nations &quot; within the framework of what Jacques Delors called a &quot; federation of nation states . &quot; 
The second question concerns the EU &apos;s scope . 
Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history , but the boundaries of the EU - and thus the prospects for its further enlargement - are determined by its absorptive capacity and the adaptive abilities of candidate countries . 
Is enlargement the only effective policy of stabilization and peace ? 
Or can the &quot; neighborhood policy &quot; become an instrument for supporting development and stabilization , much as the Marshall Plan once was for Western Europe ? 
Third , instead of futile opposition between &quot; liberal &quot; and &quot; social &quot; models of economic development , we need a confrontation of the experiences of Great Britain and Sweden , on the one hand , and Germany and France , on the other . 
Are these experiences mutually exclusive , or is convergence possible ? 
What policies reduce unemployment ? 
Which measures can ensure the EU &apos;s global competitiveness ? 
How can we narrow the existing differences in development and material welfare within Europe ? 
Fourth , the EU &apos;s aspiration for a common foreign and security policy must be addressed . 
The threats facing the world today are supranational , so counteracting them must be supranational , too . 
But this is impossible without a clear European identity - and thus a common interest to be asserted and defended . 
In the aftermath of the French and Dutch referenda , the European Commission and the European Parliament have sketched plans for a Europe-wide debate on these issues . 
Democracy carries certain costs , but they are always lower than the costs of evading popular participation . 
Only a new European debate that embodies the common action of European citizens and institutions can combat &quot; alter-Europeanism &quot; effectively . 
The time may not have come for a true European constitution , but confronting , rather than evading , the fundamental issues that the EU faces could create the proper context for reviving the constitutional treaty and preparing the Union for the challenges of our time .
