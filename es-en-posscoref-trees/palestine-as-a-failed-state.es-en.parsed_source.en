Palestine as a Failed State 
Every week , it seems , brings another backward step for Palestine . 
President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s failure to convene the Palestinian Legislative Assembly , due to a Hamas boycott , may lead inexorably to the final breakdown of the political structures created under the Oslo Accords . 
Sadly , this is only the latest chapter in the Palestinians &quot; tragic history of failed attempts to create a nation-state . 
Palestinians see their history as one of struggle against Zionism and Israel . 
But the reality is more complicated , and marked by repeated failures to create a coherent body politic , even when historical opportunities beckoned . 
Perhaps the first failure occurred in the 1920 &quot; s , when the British Mandatory government in Palestine encouraged the two national communities - Jewish and Arab - to establish communal institutions of self-government to look after education , welfare , housing , and local administration . 
The Jews - then less than 20 % of British Palestine &apos;s population - set up what became known as the National Committee ( Va &apos;ad Leumi ) , based on an elected body , the Representative Assembly of Palestinian Jews . 
Regular elections to this Assembly took place , sometimes with more than a dozen parties competing . 
This autonomous institution became the forerunner of the political structure of the nascent Jewish state , and its leaders - David Ben-Gurion among them - emerged as Israel &apos;s future political elite . 
Israel succeeded as a nation , with a vibrant and sometimes obstreperous parliamentary life , precisely because its leaders used this opportunity . 
The Palestinians , however , never created similar embryonic state structures : an Arab Higher Committee was established , made up of regional and tribal notables , but no elections ever took place . 
The Mufti of Jerusalem , Haj Amin al-Husseini ( later an ally of Nazi Germany ) , became its chairman , but it never succeeded in creating a generally accepted national leadership or in providing the Arab community the panoply of educational and welfare services offered to the Jewish community by its elected institutions . 
The second failure occurred during the Arab Revolt against British rule in Palestine in 1936-1939 , which was accompanied by massive terror attacks against Jewish civilians . 
The revolt itself was brutally suppressed by the British army , but not before a split within the Palestinian community resulted in two armed militias - one based on the Husseini clan , the other on the more moderate Nashashibis - that turned viciously on each other . 
More Palestinians were killed by contending militias than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces . 
The third failure - even more tragic - occurred in 1947-48 , when Palestinian Arabs rejected the United Nations partition plan , which envisaged separate Arab and Jewish states after the departure of the British . 
While Jews accepted this compromise , the Palestinian Arabs , supported by the Arab League countries , rejected it and went to war against the emerging State of Israel . 
The Palestinian Arab defeat in this endeavor , and the resulting refugee problem , is a defining moment for Palestinians . 
But what sometimes gets lost in this narrative is that , while practically all sectors of Palestinian Arab society rejected the UN plan , Palestinians were unable to devise coherent political institutions and a unified military command with which to confront the much smaller Jewish community . 
By contrast , the besieged Jewish community , under David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish self-defense force ( the Hagannah ) was able to mobilize , through its democratic institutions and with only marginal dissent , the resources needed for a successful military campaign . 
Indeed , many Palestinian political leaders absconded to Beirut or Cairo once violence broke out . 
The Husseini clan set up its militia in the Jerusalem area . 
Near Tel Aviv , in adjoining Jaffa , a competing militia under Hassan Salameh , took control . 
In the north of the country , a Syrian-based militia , under Fawzi al-Kaukji , attacked Jewish villages . 
The more moderate Haifa Arabs tried , not very successfully , to stay out of the fray . 
Disunity made the Arab defeat almost inevitable . 
Moreover , the scars of the 1930 &quot; s virtual civil war have still not healed : mutual suspicion and memories of internecine massacres vitiated cooperation and trust . 
The last failure occurred when the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO set up the autonomous Palestinian Authority under Yasser Arafat . 
Instead of creating the infrastructure of the future Palestinian state , with various functions slowly transferred from the Israeli army to the Palestinian Authority , Arafat created a mukhabarat ( security services ) state , as in Egypt , Syria , and ( until Saddam Hussein &apos;s fall ) in Iraq . 
Arafat and his Fatah-based supporters established almost a dozen competing security services - sometimes indistinguishable from clan-based militias - which consumed more than 60 % the Palestinian Authority &apos;s budget , at the expense of education , housing , welfare , and refugee rehabilitation . 
Into this vacuum burst Hamas , with its network of schools , welfare services , community centers , and support organizations . 
The Hamas takeover of Gaza was but the latest step in this development . 
It is easy to blame the current Palestinian crisis on individuals - be it Arafat or Abbas . 
It is even easier to blame the Israeli occupation or American policies . 
To be sure , there is a lot of blame to go around . 
But all national movements - the Greek as well as the Polish , the Jewish as well as the Kurdish - begin in adversity . 
The Palestinians have a difficult history - one of internal disunity and murderous internecine conflict - to overcome . 
They now stand again at a crossroads , and whether they will be able to transcend their tragic heritage depends on them . 
No one can help them if they cannot come up with a coherent , consensual , and reasonably united leadership - what Abbas himself calls &quot; one law , one authority , one gun . &quot;
