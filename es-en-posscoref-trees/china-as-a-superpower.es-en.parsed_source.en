China as a Superpower 
YALTA - Given its rapid and successful development , there can be no doubt that the People &apos;s Republic of China will become one of the dominant global powers of the twenty-first century . 
Indeed , despite the massive problems that the country is confronting , it could even emerge as the global power . 
But it would be a mistake to assume that the reemergence of so-called &quot; XXL powers &quot; like China and India will simply bring a continuation of Western traditions . 
We will have to deal with a different type of superpower . 
Ever since the European powers set sail at the end of the fifteenth century to conquer the world , historiography and international politics have become accustomed to a certain pattern : military , economic , and technological power is translated into the exercise of influence over other countries , conquest , and even global dominance and empire . 
This was particularly true in the twentieth century , when , in the wake of two world wars , the United States and the Soviet Union replaced the European world powers on the global stage . 
The Cold War and the period of US global dominance after 1989 / 1990 followed this pattern as well . 
But China &apos;s rise to global power , I believe , will not , owing to its massive population of 1.2 billion people , which threatens to overstretch the structures of any kind of government system and its decision makers . 
This is all the more true in times of rapid fundamental change , as is occurring in China now . 
The permanent danger of overstretching the country &apos;s internal political structures is unlikely to permit any imperial foreign-policy role . 
Insofar as this is true , the United States won &apos;t be replaced as the dominant power unless and until it abdicates that role . 
This may sound simple , but it will have far-reaching consequences for the coming century &apos;s international order . 
The vital interests guiding Chinese policy are internal modernization , the ruling regime &apos;s political stability and survival , and the country &apos;s unity ( which includes Taiwan ) . 
These interests are unlikely to change for a long time . 
As a result , China will become a largely inward-looking superpower , which - precisely for that reason - will pursue its foreign-policy interests in a completely unsentimental manner . 
Militarily , China will focus primarily on its regional supremacy , because the country &apos;s unity depends on it . 
Otherwise , though , the transformation of China &apos;s economy and society will be all-important , because the regime &apos;s stability depends on it . 
For the Chinese leadership , this means that a growth rate of about 10 % per year will be essential for a long time . 
Otherwise , the rapid and fundamental transformation of the country from a largely agrarian to an ultra-modern industrialized society could not proceed without destabilizing the system . 
But this focus on internal growth will have massive political consequences , both domestically and in foreign-policy terms . 
Domestically , China will be the first country that , due to its sheer size and required GDP growth , is forced to pursue a &quot; green &quot; economy . 
Otherwise , China would quickly reach its &quot; limits to growth , &quot; with disastrous ecological and , as a result , political consequences . 
Since China will be the most important market of the future , it will be decisive in determining not only what we produce and consume , but how . 
Consider the transition from the traditional automobile to electric transport . 
Despite European illusions to the contrary , this will be decided in China , not in the West . 
All that will be decided by the West &apos;s globally dominant automobile industry is whether it will adapt and have a chance to survive or go the way of other old Western industries : to the developing world . 
In foreign-policy terms , China will attempt to protect its domestic transformation by securing resources and access to foreign markets . 
Sooner or later , though , China &apos;s government will come to realize that America &apos;s role as a global regulator is indispensible for China &apos;s vital foreign-policy interests , because China is unable to assume that role , other global players aren &apos;t available , and the only alternative to the US would be a breakdown of order . 
This US-Chinese tandem will run far from smoothly , and will do little but ameliorate crises and periods of serious economic and political confrontation , like that which is currently looming over the bilateral trade imbalance . 
Strategically , however , China and the US will have to rely on one another for a long time . 
This co-dependency will , at some point , also take shape politically , probably to the chagrin of all other international players , particularly the Europeans . 
Europe could change the course of this development only if it presented itself as a serious player and stood up for its interests on the global stage . 
The &quot; G-2 &quot; of China and the US would probably be happy about that .
