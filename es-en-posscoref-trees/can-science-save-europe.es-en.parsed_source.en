Can Science Save Europe ? 
VIENNA- Europe &apos;s current financial squeeze defies easy solutions . 
Self-inflicted austerity has met popular restlessness for more tangible measures to revive economic growth and create jobs . 
Protesters vividly express widespread frustration with deepening inequality , and condemnation of privileges of a global financial elite comes uncomfortably close to implicating government . 
In previous times , such a situation would have been described as pre-revolutionary . 
In today &apos;s world , the consequences may seem more benign , but they are no less worrisome : a loss of solidarity , a return to nationalist insularity , and greater scope for political extremism . 
Europe &apos;s image has suffered accordingly , notably from the perspective of Asia &apos;s booming economies . 
Whereas China , India , and others have enjoyed continuing economic growth and investment in research and innovative capacity , Europe is perceived as being on the brink of decline , economically as well as politically . 
Worse still , Europe also seems intent on ignoring its persistent strengths . 
Those strengths lie in Europe &apos;s science base , part of the cultural heritage that shapes European identity . 
In terms of numbers - whether of scientific publications , researchers , or overall access to high-quality tertiary education - Europe compares favorably with its international partners ( which are also competitors ) . 
So why , critics ask , does Europe produce many novel scientific ideas and discoveries , but fail to transform them into marketable products ? 
In fact , that question is wedded to an obsolete linear model of innovation . 
What is lacking in Europe is public and official awareness of where the real potential of European science lies . 
Scientific curiosity , given sufficient space and autonomy , remains the most powerful driving force behind the completely unforeseeable transformations in how our societies develop . 
In order to understand what science can do for Europe , it is important to clarify what science - that is , curiosity-driven frontier research - cannot do for Europe : deliver results that can immediately be commercialized . 
Frontier research , like innovation , is an inherently uncertain process . 
One does not know what one will find when working at the cutting edge and attempting to push into unknown territory . 
Any short-term economic benefits are welcome byproducts , not the main &quot; deliverables &quot; that can be planned . 
Nor will science create much-needed jobs , except for those who work in research organizations and universities . 
Instead , cutting-edge research pioneers new ways of working ( and models of future workplaces ) , which require novel skills and knowledge that will diffuse widely into society and transform production and services . 
For example , it could lead to more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient uses of natural resources , or to investment in services that are more responsive to human needs and better attuned to human interaction . 
Science is the only civic institution with a built-in long-term time horizon - a feature that builds confidence in a fragile future . 
Modern science began in Europe 300 years ago with relatively few people - perhaps no more than a thousand when the putative scientific revolution was in full swing . 
They began to engage in the systematic inquiry of how the natural world ( and to a lesser extent , the social world ) functioned . 
They obtained new knowledge of how to manipulate and intervene in natural processes . 
The experimental practices that they invented spread beyond the laboratories . Later , they began to underpin and merge with progress in the crafts to drive forward the Industrial Revolution . 
The idea that we can only know what we can make gained wide acceptance . 
New tools provide new means of investigation , enabling researchers to speed up computation , for example , and hence increase the production of new knowledge . 
Science and technology mutually reinforce each other , and both percolate through the social fabric . 
This was the case in 1700 , and it remains true today . 
Let us now look forward towards the future . 
According to health statistician Hans Rosling , our planet will probably be home to at least nine billion people by 2050 . 
Six billion will live in Asia , one billion in Africa , 1.5 billion in the Americas , and 500 million in Europe . 
By ensuring that the pursuit of new knowledge remains a high priority , Europe can safeguard the scientific revolution and retain a leading edge globally , despite having fewer people than other regions . 
Europe &apos;s scientific institutions are already evolving and adapting to new global challenges . 
People working within science and people working with science - ordinary citizens - will assure that the unending quest for human betterment continues to be an important part of European identity . 
Science alone will not save Europe . 
Rather , a Europe that knows how to put its science to work will not need to be saved .
