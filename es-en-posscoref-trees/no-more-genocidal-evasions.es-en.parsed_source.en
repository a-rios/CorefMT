No More Genocidal Evasions 
&quot; Never again , &quot; declared the world in the wake of the Holocaust . 
Yet , the motto of the half-century since , at least insofar as the world &apos;s response to genocide is concerned , might better be stated as &quot; Again and again . &quot; 
Indeed , whenever genocide begins , the world &apos;s usual response - especially that of Western leaders - is to turn away . 
From Hitler &apos;s attempted eradication of Europe &apos;s Jews to the Rwandan Hutus &apos; extermination of the Tutsi in 1994 , policymakers balked at intervening politically , economically , or militarily to obstruct such targeted destructions of minorities . 
For the most part , they have even refrained from denouncing the perpetrators , clinging to a sham neutrality or taking shelter in the fog of &quot; imperfect information . &quot; 
Millions of innocent Bengalis , Cambodians , Kurds , Bosnians and Rwandans paid the price for this inaction , as did millions of Jews and Armenians earlier in the 20th century . 
That price , however , is also exacted from the rest of us , because when extremists are allowed to wipe out their neighbors , the victimized often become radicalized and militarized ; they look to settle old scores not only against the perpetrators of genocide , but against those who abetted them . 
Many in the Islamic world today cite years of European and American inaction in Bosnia as one root of their resentment . 
Would-be killers themselves learn that hate and mass murder are legitimate , or at least effective , tools of statecraft . 
Western governments winked at Saddam Hussein when he gassed the Kurds of northern Iraq in 1987-88 , but his agents may yet turn the chemicals he tested there on targets in Berlin , London , or Washington . 
Even when genocide remains contained within borders , the violence eventually tends to spill over into neighboring states , igniting regional wars , undermining global stability , and eventually costing billions as the world starts to tend to the humanitarian byproducts of slaughter . 
With genocide a real looming possibility in Burundi , Chechnya , Indonesia , Sudan , and elsewhere , what is to be done ? 
To start , Western leaders should stop pointing fingers and take responsibility for their moral and strategic failings . 
Countries avoid action by claiming that it is someone else &apos;s job to lead . 
The US pleads over-extension , that it can &apos;t be &quot; the world &apos;s policeman . &quot; 
Europe faults the &quot; world &apos;s sole superpower &quot; for standing idly by and then does nothing itself . 
Both claims are partly right . 
America probably lacks the capacity - and the will - to intervene militarily wherever the threat of genocide arises . 
The US record is marred by denial and absence of leadership , except when American strategic interests ( Kosovo ) or a president &apos;s domestic political concerns ( eventually , Bosnia ) become imperiled . 
In their criticisms of the US , however , European leaders often speak as if they have done better . 
Indeed , while Saddam Hussein attacked the Kurds , European governments were selling him weapons . 
If not for US resistance , John Major and Francois Mitterrand would likely have handed Bosnia over to the Serbs in 1993 . 
Moreover , Dutch peacekeepers failed to put up a fight or even sound a meaningful alarm when the Serbs stormed the town of Srebrenica , when some seven thousand Muslim men and boys might have been saved . 
In Rwanda , France armed the genocidal Hutu regime , and Belgium pulled out its peacekeepers though they were reporting corpses piling up like cordwood in Kigali . 
In the few instances where the US took steps to alter the behavior of repressive states , Europe &apos;s governments and peoples expressed open skepticism about the sincerity of America &apos;s humanitarian motives . 
But critics of the US can &apos;t have it both ways . 
Those who fault America , say , for its non-intervention in Rwanda and its intervention in Kosovo have not reckoned with the inconsistency of their own position , which is highlighted by a grim counter-factual . 
Had America deployed troops to Rwanda early in that genocide , as innumerable critics ( themselves silent at the time ) argue retrospectively , dozens , maybe even hundreds , of Rwandans would likely have perished as the US intervened . 
Would these critics have accepted this or , instead , would they have condemned the US ? 
The latter , more likely . 
General Dallaire , the UN commander in Rwanda who appealed for authority to confront the genocidaires , would also now likely be known as a trigger-happy alarmist . 
And we would never know about the 800,000 Rwandans that had been saved . 
Similarly , imperfect though NATO &apos;s bombing in Kosovo was , can anyone imagine how many Kosovar lives would have been lost had NATO remained on the sidelines ? 
Why focus on the prospect of further genocides now , when the threat of genocide seems secondary , say , to the War on Terror ? 
Because , alas , if history is any predictor , another eruption of the genocidal impulse will not be long in coming . 
So the brief surcease we are enjoying is precisely the time when everyone ( not just Americans and Europeans , but Japanese , Australians , South Africans-and Latin Americans and Asians and Africans generally ) need to steel ourselves for the moment when that eruption occurs . 
Genocide prevention is a burden that will not be carried unless it is shared . 
The world &apos;s leaders need to declare prevention of genocide not only in the interest of mankind in general , but in their own national interests . 
They must ready their publics and undertake the coordinated contingency military planning to ensure that &quot; Never again &quot; no longer simply means , say , &quot; Never again will Hutus be permitted to kill Tutsis in Rwanda between April and July 1994 . &quot;
