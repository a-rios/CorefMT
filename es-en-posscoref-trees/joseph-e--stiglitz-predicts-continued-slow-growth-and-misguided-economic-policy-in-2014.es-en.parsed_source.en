The Great Malaise Drags On 
NEW YORK - There &apos;s something dismal about writing year-end roundups in the half-decade since the eruption of the 2008 global financial crisis . 
Yes , we avoided a Great Depression II , but only to emerge into a Great Malaise , with barely increasing incomes for a large proportion of citizens in advanced economies . 
We can expect more of the same in 2014 . 
In the United States , median incomes have continued their seemingly relentless decline ; for male workers , income has fallen to levels below those attained more than 40 years ago . 
Europe &apos;s double-dip recession ended in 2013 , but no one can responsibly claim that recovery has followed . 
More than 50 % of young people in Spain and Greece remain unemployed . 
According to the International Monetary Fund , Spain can expect unemployment to be above 25 % for years to come . 
The real danger for Europe is that a sense of complacency may set in . 
As the year passed , one could feel the pace of vital institutional reforms in the eurozone slowing . 
For example , the monetary union needs a real banking union - including not just common supervision , but also common deposit insurance and a common resolution mechanism - and Eurobonds , or some similar vehicle for mutualizing debt . 
The eurozone is not much closer to implementing either measure than it was a year ago . 
One could also sense a renewed commitment to the austerity policies that incited Europe &apos;s double-dip recession . 
Europe &apos;s continuing stagnation is bad enough ; but there is still a significant risk of another crisis in yet another eurozone country , if not next year , in the not-too-distant future . 
Matters are only slightly better in the US , where a growing economic divide - with more inequality than in any other advanced country - has been accompanied by severe political polarization . 
One can only hope that the lunatics in the Republican Party who forced a government shutdown and pushed the country to the brink of default will decide against a repeat performance . 
But even if they do , the likely contraction from the next round of austerity - which already cost 1-2 percentage points of GDP growth in 2013 - means that growth will remain anemic , barely strong enough to generate jobs for new entrants into the labor force . 
A dynamic tax-avoiding Silicon Valley and a thriving hydrocarbon sector are not enough to offset austerity &apos;s weight . 
Thus , while there may be some reduction of the Federal Reserve &apos;s purchases of long-term assets ( so-called quantitative easing , or QE ) , a move away from rock-bottom interest rates is not expected until 2015 at the earliest . 
Ending low-interest-rates now would not be sensible , though QE has probably benefited the US economy only slightly , and may have raised risks abroad . 
The tremors in global financial markets set off by discussions earlier in 2013 of tapering QE highlighted the extent of interdependence in the global economy . 
Just as QE &apos;s introduction fueled currency appreciation , announcing its eventual end triggered depreciation . 
The good news was that most major emerging countries had built up large foreign-exchange reserves and had sufficiently strong economies that they could withstand the shock . 
Still , the growth slowdown in emerging economies was disappointing - all the more so because it is likely to continue through 2014 . 
Each country produced its own story : India &apos;s downturn , for example , was attributed to political problems in New Delhi and a central bank worried about price stability ( though there was little reason to believe that raising interest rates would do much about the price of onions and the other items underlying Indian inflation ) . 
Social unrest in Brazil made it clear that , despite remarkable progress in reducing poverty and inequality over the past decade , the country still has much to do to achieve broadly shared prosperity . 
At the same time , the wave of protest showed the growing political clout of the country &apos;s expanding middle class . 
China &apos;s decelerating growth had a significant impact on commodity prices , and thus on commodity exporters around the world . 
As in previous years , the fundamental problem haunting the global economy in 2013 remained a lack of global aggregate demand . 
This does not mean , of course , that there is an absence of real needs - for infrastructure , to take one example , or , more broadly , for retrofitting economies everywhere in response to the challenges of climate change . 
We have unmet needs and underutilized resources . 
The system is not delivering benefits for large segments of our societies . 
And the prospect of significant improvement in 2014 - or in the foreseeable future - seems unrealistic . 
At both the national and global levels , political systems seem incapable of introducing the reforms that might create prospects for a brighter future . 
Maybe the global economy will perform a little better in 2014 than it did in 2013 , or maybe not . 
Seen in the broader context of the continuing Great Malaise , both years will come to be regarded as a time of wasted opportunities .
