Greek Lessons for Europe 
BERLIN - &quot; It &apos;s when the tide goes out that you find out who has been swimming naked , &quot; the legendary investor Warren Buffett aptly remarked when the global economic crisis hit . 
And , as we have found out in the meantime , this is as true for countries as it is for companies . 
Following Ireland , Greece is now the second euro-zone member to have gotten into massive payment difficulties due to the crisis , almost to the point of national bankruptcy . 
Ireland was able to resolve its problems by itself , through a restructuring policy that was painful yet unflinching . 
It could do so because its economy , apart from its excessive debt burden following the collapse of an asset bubble , was basically sound . 
The situation in Greece is different . 
A restructuring of the economy will be much more difficult , because it will have to be more far-reaching . 
The fiscal deficit must now be redressed resulted not just from internal financial imbalances , but also from a political system that for too long time has been in denial of reality , allowing the country to live beyond its means . 
Nevertheless , the European Union can neither allow Greece to slide into national bankruptcy nor hand it over to the International Monetary Fund , since other euro-zone members - namely , Portugal , Spain , and Italy - would probably be next in line to be attacked by the financial markets . 
In that case , the euro would be in danger of failing , for the first time seriously imperiling the entire project of European integration . 
The real problem at the heart of the Greek crisis is so grave because it involves the fundamental weakness of the euro : its lack of support by a government policy . 
The caps on member states &quot; budget deficits and public debt imposed by the Maastricht criteria have proven relatively early on to be of limited use in the real world , and the same is true for the monitoring tools linked to these limits . 
In any case , the Maastricht rules were never designed for a perfect storm like the one triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 . 
The euro , which turned out to be the critical tool for defending European interests in this crisis , will now be subjected to an endurance test directed at the soft political heart of its construction . 
Europe &apos;s leaders - first and foremost Germany and France , which will play the deciding role - must act quickly and put through new , imaginative solutions . 
This will not come cheap , and therefore will entail substantial political risks . 
But , given a global economic environment that promises scant sustainable growth in the coming years , things could otherwise get very tough very soon . 
The solutions that Europe &apos;s leaders provide must go beyond Maastricht , but without triggering new institutional debates , which would lead us nowhere . 
Moreover , new instruments like Eurobonds will have to be made available in order to reduce the affected euro-zone countries &quot; interest burden , provided that they have taken serious steps - subject to effective control mechanisms - toward credible restructuring . 
The current crisis has , however , also shown that the Council of Finance Ministers ( Ecofin ) is unable to assert such control over EU member states &quot; fiscal policies . 
The direct leadership of heads of state and government is needed , at least in these times of extreme crisis . 
One sign of hope is that , following the recent Franco-German summit , German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time did not publicly oppose the idea of a European economic government . 
Spelling out such a body &apos;s structure , costs , decision-making procedures , and control mechanisms as quickly as possible is now the order of the day . 
Indeed , there is no time to lose . 
But even with one , two , or three steps forward , the German and French governments will be taking great political risks domestically if the euro crisis in the Mediterranean worsens and a financial bailout there becomes necessary to save the common currency . 
The populations in the countries that will have to foot the bill are unprepared for the reality check ahead of them , adding fuel to a years-long growth in Euro-skepticism , which now pervades all political camps . 
This applies increasingly to Germany as well , making it very likely that we will see an extremely large political problem emerge there in the near future . 
Pay for the southern European countries or resign oneself to the end of the euro ? 
The question alone makes clear what this crisis is about : the future of the European project . 
At the same time , muddling through - a typically European answer that limits political risk while not really changing anything - will be difficult , because the consequences of the global economic crisis have not yet been fully addressed . 
What is necessary now is statesman-like leadership - and even more so states woman -like leadership . 
Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy are facing the defining challenge of their respective terms in office . 
They must navigate the European ship safely through this storm . 
Only courageous thinking and action will enable them to steer clear of the rocks .
