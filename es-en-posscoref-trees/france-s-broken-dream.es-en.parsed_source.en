France &apos;s Broken Dream 
CAMBRIDGE - The crisis in the eurozone is the result of France &apos;s persistent pursuit of the &quot; European project , &quot; the goal of political unification that began after World War II when two leading French politicians , Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman , proposed the creation of a United States of Europe . 
Monnet and Schuman argued that a political union similar to America &apos;s would prevent the types of conflict that had caused three major European wars - an appealing idea , but one that overlooked America &apos;s horrific Civil War . 
A European political union could also make Europe a power comparable to the United States , and thereby give France , with its sophisticated foreign service , an important role in European and world affairs . 
The Monnet-Schuman dream led to the 1956 Treaty of Rome , which established a small free-trade area that was later expanded to form the European Economic Community . 
Establishing the EEC had favorable economic effects , but , like the North American Free Trade Area , it did not reduce national identification or create a sense of political unity . 
That was the purpose of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty , which established the European Union . 
The influential report &quot; One market , one money , &quot; issued in 1990 under the leadership of the former French Finance Minister Jacques Delors , called for the creation of a single currency , relying on the specious argument that the single market could not function well otherwise . 
More realistically , advocates of a single currency reasoned that it would cause people to identify as Europeans , and that the shift to a single European Central Bank would herald a shift of power away from national governments . 
Germany resisted the euro , arguing that full political union should come first . 
Since there was no chance that the other countries would accept political union , Germany &apos;s position seemed like a technical maneuver to prevent the establishment of the single currency . 
Germany was reluctant to give up the Deutsche Mark , a symbol of its economic power and commitment to price stability . 
Germany eventually agreed to the creation of the euro only when French President François Mitterrand made it a condition of France &apos;s support for German reunification . 
Moreover , under pressure from France , the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s requirement that countries could introduce the euro only if their national debt was less than 60 % of GDP was relaxed in order to admit countries that were seen to be &quot; evolving &quot; toward that goal . 
That modification allowed Greece , Spain , and Italy to be admitted . 
The pro-euro politicians ignored economists &quot; warnings that imposing a single currency on a dozen heterogeneous countries was bound to create serious economic problems . 
They regarded the economic risks as unimportant relative to their agenda of political unification . 
But the creation of the euro caused a sharp fall in interest rates in the peripheral countries , leading to debt-financed housing bubbles and encouraging their governments to borrow to finance increased government spending . 
Amazingly , global financial markets ignored the credit risks of this sovereign debt , requiring only very small differences between interest rates on German bonds and those of Greece and other peripheral countries . 
That ended in 2010 , after Greece admitted that it had lied about its budget deficits and debt . 
Financial markets responded by demanding much higher rates on the bonds of countries with high government debt ratios and banking systems weakened by excessive mortgage debt . 
Three small countries ( Greece , Ireland , and Portugal ) have been forced to accept help from the International Monetary Fund , and to enact painful contractionary fiscal cuts . 
The conditions in Greece are now hopeless , and are likely to lead to further defaults and a withdrawal from the eurozone . 
Spain , too , is in serious trouble , owing to the budget deficits of its traditionally independent regional governments , the weakness of its banks , and its need to roll over large sovereign-debt balances each year . 
It is already clear that the EU &apos;s recently agreed &quot; fiscal compact &quot; will not constrain budget deficits or reduce national debts . 
Spain was the first to insist that it could not meet the conditions to which it had just agreed , and other countries will soon follow . 
French President François Hollande has proposed balancing deficit limits with growth initiatives , just as France had earlier forced the EU &apos;s Stability Pact to become the Stability and Growth Pact . 
The fiscal compact is an empty gesture that may be the last attempt to pretend that EU members are moving toward political unification . 
The European project has clearly failed to achieve what French political leaders have wanted from the beginning . 
Instead of the amity and sense of purpose of which Monnet and Schuman dreamed , there is conflict and disarray . 
Europe &apos;s international role is shrinking , with the old G-5 having evolved into the G-20 . 
And , with German Chancellor Angela Merkel setting conditions for the eurozone , France &apos;s ambition to dominate European policy has been thwarted . 
Even if most eurozone countries retain the single currency , it will be because abandoning the euro would be financially painful . 
Now that its weaknesses are clear , the euro will remain a source of trouble rather than a path to political power .
