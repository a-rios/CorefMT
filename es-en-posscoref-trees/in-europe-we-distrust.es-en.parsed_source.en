In Europe We Distrust 
MADRID - For decades , critics of the European Union have spoken about a democratic deficit . 
I never accepted that reproach of the EU and its institutions , but I do see a new and dangerous deficit within the Union - a trust deficit , both among governments , and among the citizens of various member countries . Indeed , if today &apos;s euro banknotes included a motto , as dollars do , it could well be , &quot; In Europe We Distrust . &quot; 
This lack of trust has brought the eurozone to the cusp of implosion , and is calling into question the very future of European unity . 
The arc of EU history seems to be bending to catastrophe - the sort of periodic European disaster that integration was intended to prevent . 
Grandiloquent as it might sound , the disintegration of the euro and the disarray that would engulf the European project , not to speak of the global repercussions , would unleash comparable devastation . 
But few official pronouncements , let alone policies , are addressing Europe &apos;s deficit of trust and credibility . 
The current crisis has exposed the original lacunae and widening cracks in the compact between Europe &apos;s citizens and EU institutions , between Europe &apos;s north and south , and between its peoples and its elites . 
Indeed , a dangerous emotional discourse has emerged , reflecting - and feeding - the worst stereotypes of the &quot; lazy South &quot; and the &quot; despotic North . &quot; 
It is indicative that the latest Pew Research Survey in late May reveals unanimity about who the least hardworking Europeans are : southerners , especially Greeks . 
Likewise , polls and elections signal the ascent of populists across Europe , while financial markets &quot; vulture-like behavior stems from the cynical calculation that the EU lacks the wherewithal to restore its credibility . 
That , after all , is the point of Europe &apos;s straightjacket of austerity , which hampers its growth prospects , and thus makes little sense in economic terms . 
The ultimate aim of austerity is precisely the restoration of trust - among northern Europeans that the money transferred to troubled economies will not be squandered , and among the peoples affected by painful spending cuts that their efforts are recognized and supported . 
Speaking from the heartland of the troubled South , I can attest to the fact that the need for austerity has been the leitmotif of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy &apos;s government , a course that gained explicit popular support in the recent elections . 
Reforming Spains &apos;s cajas ( savings banks ) , labor market , welfare provisions , and how its autonomous regions function top the national agenda ( though unfortunately only at the insistence of the European Commission and Germany ) . 
But restoring trust and credibility requires more than southern discipline . 
Northern Europe must hold up its side of the bargain . 
Germany , in particular , must acknowledge that , far from being an innocent victim , its economy is the eurozone &apos;s biggest beneficiary - and has been since the euro &apos;s inception . 
That , together with the counterfactual - the economic calamity that would befall Germany following a collapse of the euro - implies a unique obligation to maintain it . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been a favorite target of opponents of austerity for some time now , and it is understandable that , after months of being a bystander to the EU &apos;s painful inability to govern , Germany has reluctantly - indeed , insufficiently - taken charge . 
Looking ahead , as the threat of disintegration looms larger , the need for German leadership will be even greater . 
But , once the crisis has passed , EU institutional reform will be a critical element in restoring trust . 
The EU &apos;s supposed democratic deficit is a corollary of the &quot; technocratic imperative &quot; that has emerged as a favorite scapegoat in the ongoing European drama . 
According to this view , European integration was flawed from the outset , more than six decades ago , because it was conceived and developed as an elite project . 
But , for as long as the European project delivered prosperity , no one bothered to question its rationale . 
Today , however , the EU is the last point of reference as far as prosperity is concerned . 
According to the Pew survey , EU favorability is down almost everywhere since 2007 , having dropped 20 points in the Czech Republic and Spain , 19 points in Italy , and 14 points in Poland . 
If EU institutions are to regain trust and relevance , they need to articulate concrete policies and deliver on issues that bear directly on citizens &quot; interests - youth unemployment , urban planning , health care , bio-tech research , energy conservation , transport , and aging . 
All of these issues were an integral part of the EU &apos;s ambitious Lisbon Strategy ( which in 2000 promised to make Europe the world &apos;s most competitive economy by 2010 ) , and all were quickly hijacked by national political agendas . 
That cannot be allowed to happen again . 
In fact , there is nothing inevitable about the euro &apos;s failure . 
The dismal image that Europe projects to the world nowadays does no justice to reality . 
Europe has the world &apos;s healthiest and most educated population , its largest economy , and huge stores of soft power , owing also to its commitment to human rights and democratic values . 
And yet Europe is facing a calamity . 
Discipline and morality may well be key to reinforcing trust and credibility to Europe &apos;s social fabric - a point that northern Europeans never tire of making . 
But , unless all Europeans accept responsibility for saving the euro - and , with it , the EU - everything else is shallow rhetoric .
