The Resistible Rise of Hindu Fascism 
In the 1930s , Hitler rose to power as the world focussed on Mussolini &apos;s African wars and Japan &apos;s invasion of China . 
As the world concentrates on the war in Iraq , it should keep a watchful eye on India , suggests the novelist Arundhati Roy , because a form of Hindu fascism is growing ever stronger in the subcontinent . 
One night a year ago , a friend called me . 
Weeping , she told me of her friend , a woman caught by a mob , her stomach ripped open and stuffed with burning rags . 
What Hindu scripture preaches this ? 
India &apos;s Prime Minister , A. B. Vajpayee , justified that deed as part of the retaliation meted out by outraged Hindus against the Muslim &quot; terrorists &quot; who had incinerated 58 Hindus on a train to Godhra . 
What Koran verse required those travellers to be roasted alive ? 
The more India &apos;s Hindus and Muslims call attention to their differences by slaughtering each other , the less there is that distinguishes them . 
They worship at the same altar , apostles of the same murderous god , whoever he is . 
A year after the Godhra massacre and the subsequent anti-Muslim pogroms in Gujarat province , India is again sipping from its poisoned chalice - a flawed democracy laced with religious fascism . 
In parliament , the government has unveiled a portrait of Vinayak Savarkar , a pre-independence Hindu nationalist , one of whose followers assassinated Mahatma Gandhi . 
The drive to build a temple to the god Ram in Ayodhya , on the site of a 16 th century mosque demolished by Hindu mobs in 1992 , is gaining new energy . 
But once Muslims are &quot; shown their place , &quot; will milk and Coca-Cola flow across the land ? 
Or will some fresh hate arise ? 
Will its target be Adivasis , Buddhists , Christians , Dalits , Parsis , Sikhs ? 
Those who speak English ? 
Those with thick lips ? 
What depraved vision imagines India without the spectacular anarchy of its many cultures ? 
The parallels between contemporary India and pre-Nazi Germany are chilling , but not surprising . 
Many Hindu nationalists are frank about their admiration for Hitler . 
Luckily , we don &apos;t yet have a Hitler . 
Instead , we have , the hydra-headed Sangh Parivar - the &quot; joint family &quot; of Hindu political / cultural organizations . 
Sangh Parivar &apos;s genius is its ability to be all things to all people . 
While the Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( VHP or World Hindu Congress ) exhorts its cadres to prepare for the Final Solution , Prime Minister Vajpayee assures the nation that all citizens , regardless of religion , are treated equally . 
Of course , every kind of pogrom - against castes , tribes , religions - has been seen here . 
In 1984 , following Indira Gandhi &apos;s assassination , the ruling Congress Party presided over the massacre of 3,000 Sikhs . 
Indeed , on virtually every politically volatile issue - from nuclear testing to communal conflict - Congress sowed the seeds and Vajpayee &apos;s nationalist BJP party reaps the hideous harvest . 
But whereas Congress whipped up communal hatred undercover and in shame , communal division is part of Sangh Parivar &apos;s mandate . 
For years it has injected a slow-release poison into society . 
Hundreds of thousands of children and young people are being weaned on religious hatred and falsified history . 
Their curriculum is as dangerous as that found in the Pakistani and Afghani madrassas that spawned the Taliban . 
Whenever hostility between India and Pakistan is cranked up , hostility toward Muslims grows . 
Increasingly , Indian nationalism means Hindu nationalism , which is based not on self-respect , but on a hatred of the &quot; Other &quot; - not just Pakistanis , but all Muslims . 
The incipient , creeping fascism that results has been groomed by our &quot; democratic &quot; institutions . 
Everything flirts with it - parliament , the press , the police , and the administration . 
If any institution ( including the Supreme Court ) exercises unfettered , unaccountable power , the erosion of civil liberties , and the spread of day-to-day injustices , fascism will not be far behind . 
Fighting religious fascism means winning back minds and hearts . 
It means demanding accountability from public institutions and listening to the powerless . 
It means fighting dispossession and the everyday violence of poverty . 
It means not allowing newspapers and TV to be hijacked by spurious passions and staged theatrics designed to divert attention from everything else . 
It does not mean banning communally minded madrassas , but rather working toward the day when they are voluntarily abandoned . 
Like termites , India &apos;s Hindu fascists have weakened the foundations of our constitution , parliament , and the courts - the backbone of every democracy . 
But it &apos;s futile to blame politicians and demand from them a morality of which they are incapable . 
If India &apos;s politicians let us down , it is because we allowed it . 
Our fascists didn &apos;t create today &apos;s grievances . 
Every strategy for real social change and greater social justice - land reform , education , public health , equitable distribution of natural resources - was cunningly scuttled by those castes and people with a stranglehold on politics . 
Fascist Hindus seized upon these grievances , mobilizing people by using the lowest common denominator - religion . 
People who lost control of their lives , people uprooted from home and community , stripped of culture and language , are made to feel proud of something . 
Not of something they achieved , but of something they happen to be . 
Or , more accurately , something they happen not to be . 
Unfortunately , no quick fix exists . 
Fascism can be defeated only if those outraged by it commit themselves to social justice with an intensity that equals their indignation . 
If we do not , we ordinary Indians will find ourselves - like the ordinary citizens of Hitler &apos;s Germany - unable to look our children in the eye because of our shame of what we allowed to happen .
