Another Roller Coaster Ride for Exchange Rates in 2009 ? 
CAMBRIDGE - 2008 has been an exceptionally tumultuous year for exchange rates . 
The American dollar soared , the Japanese yen went into orbit , the euro fell to earth , and the British pound crashed , leaving a giant crater . 
Emerging-market currencies were hammered , as were &quot; commodity currencies &quot; such as the Canadian , Australian , and New Zealand dollars , and the South African rand . 
Indeed , the currency of any country that is significantly dependent on commodity exports has suffered . 
So , what will the New Year bring for exchange rates ? 
While the only safe bet is continuing high volatility , we are at an unusual juncture where the short- and long-term trends appear to be very different . 
In the short run , the yen and the dollar continue to benefit from a flight to safety , as panicked investors seek a place to hide . 
The yen and dollar are also being bolstered as central banks elsewhere continue to cut interest rates towards zero , territory that the yen and dollar policy rates already occupy . 
Thus , even though the United States and Japan will not be raising interest rates anytime soon , lower foreign rates still make the dollar and yen relatively more attractive . 
Commodity prices will continue to be soft , pulling down commodity currencies , and bolstering the yen especially , since resource-poor Japan is so reliant on commodity imports . 
Normally , short-run and long-run exchange-rate trends point in the same direction . 
Indeed , a huge body of research shows that for most major currencies , the best forecast of next week &apos;s exchange rate , next month &apos;s exchange rate , or even next year &apos;s exchange rate is simply today &apos;s exchange rate . 
But times are hardly normal . 
The continuing financial crisis is putting steady upward pressure on the dollar thanks to its safe haven status . 
Commodity prices are plumbing new depths . 
Yet the financial crisis will eventually end , as will the global recession . 
Neither will end soon , mind you , perhaps not for another seven or eight months , if not longer . 
But , when more normal growth does resume , the recent trends underpinning dollar and yen appreciation will disappear . 
Perhaps international investors will be grateful to the US for its aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus , which will accelerate sharply when President-elect Barack Obama takes office on January 20 . 
But investors will still worry about what happens when the bills come due . 
Many emerging markets will also want to engage in countercyclical macroeconomic policy , but they are hemmed in by concerns of fiscal sustainability and fear of rampant inflation . 
European fiscal policy is constrained by the Maastricht Treaty , while European monetary policy is rather single-mindedly devoted to price stability.ampnbsp ; 
True , China , with its vast foreign exchange reserves , has the wherewithal to spend as much on countercyclical macroeconomic policy as anyone . 
But China &apos;s rulers know that their highly repressed banking system is vulnerable as the country continues to pursue gradual financial liberalization , and that foreign currency reserves may be needed for recapitalization . 
Thus perhaps no region will be as expansionary as the US . 
For the moment , global investors cannot get enough of US treasury bills , as collapsing interest rates for short-term US securities demonstrates . 
But a lot of this demand is driven by short-term , crisis-fueled fear . 
As markets normalize , surely investors will look around and realize that the US has vastly increased its debt in fighting the downturn , possibly by several trillion dollars . 
At the same time , today &apos;s falling prices ( or &quot; deflation &quot; ) will eventually morph into inflation as aggressive monetary easing takes its toll on price stability . 
Admittedly , some of the major currency &apos;s movements during the past year can be regarded as normalizing . 
On a purchasing power basis ( a crude measure of what different currencies can buy in terms of real goods ) , the euro was absurdly overvalued at $ 1.60 , just as the yen was absurdly undervalued at over Â¥ 120 to the dollar . 
Commodity currencies had to come off their meteoric highs . 
Thus , the past year &apos;s currency alignments have , to some extent , simply brought relative domestic price levels and exchange rates into better balance . 
But by now , emerging-market countries &quot; exchange rates , and even more so commodity currencies , have probably overshot on the downside.ampnbsp ; 
Over the long run , globalization and economic convergence will resume , and emerging market and commodity currencies will have to strengthen . 
At the same time , the prospect of higher US inflation and massively higher US public debt levels must eventually weigh on the dollar , as does the still worrisome US trade deficit . 
As for the yen , it , too , will suffer from the continuing rise in Japan &apos;s public debt levels , which are already among the highest in the world . 
Continuing weakness in the Japanese economy will eventually hit the yen . 
If today &apos;s constellation of exchange rates represents some excessive dollar and yen appreciation , especially against emerging-market currencies , when it will unwind ? 
That depends on when you think the financial crisis will abate , and the timing of that is as hard to predict as exchange rates . 
But come it will .
