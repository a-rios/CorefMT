The Myth of the China Stock Market 
Across China , many look at Shang Fulin as a savior . 
The new head of China &apos;s Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC ) takes the helm in the midst of an 18-month bear market , one caused by government policies - or so conventional wisdom has it . 
His challenge will be to resist the temptation to seek short-term popularity , recognizing instead that China &apos;s stock market must endure short-term pain to win long-term gains . 
Eight myths cloud debate over stock market policy in China . 
Mr. Shang &apos;s job will be easier if each is dispelled : 
# 1 . 
China &apos;s stock market has grown extremely large , extremely quickly . 
At the end of 2002 the official capitalization of China &apos;s stock market was $ 458 billion , making it the eighth largest in the world - an apparently astounding achievement given where China was a decade ago . 
Unfortunately , the figure is misleading , because it includes non-tradable , state-owned shares valued at market prices . 
In 1992 , the State Council , seeking to stop mass privatization , ruled that two-thirds of the equity capital of restructured state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) had to be issued to state organs and could not be traded . 
Former SOEs - whose market valuation is pumped up by the artificial shortage of tradable shares - account for more than nine-tenths of the 1,224 companies listed on China &apos;s stock exchanges . 
Strip out all this non-tradable equity and what is left is a market worth about $ 145 billion ( around 12 % of GDP ) at the end of 2002 . 
The equivalent figure in developed markets is usually over 100 % of GDP . 
Because share prices , therefore , cannot possibly affect the macro-economy , Mr. Shang should be able to improve the quality of regulation without worrying about the effect on growth . 
# 2 . 
Initial public offerings ( IPOs ) are now as important a source of capital as banks . 
During the 1990s , the stock market did grow in significance for Chinese firms , or at least for the former SOEs that were listed . 
But enterprises still rely on banks for the bulk of financing . 
In 2002 , domestic share issues raised $ 8.9bn , while banks provided twenty times that amount . 
The corporate debt market remains tiny . 
Indeed , only 20 corporate bonds are currently listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen . 
# 3 . 
The stock market allocates capital more efficiently than banks . 
One rationale for creating China &apos;s stock market was that it would channel finance to where it was most needed , side-stepping indebted and inefficient banks . 
But all stock markets rely on their local institutional environment . 
While the CSRC should be congratulated for its good work in improving this environment , more needs to be done . 
Firms do not compete freely for stock market capital ; former SOEs , indeed , receive preferential treatment . 
Fraudulent disclosures are commonplace . 
Artificially low interest rates create extra incentives for putting money into shares . 
Tough regulatory enforcement need to continue . 
More private firms must be allowed to make IPOs . 
# 4 . 
Restructuring a SOE into a shareholding firm and listing it improves performance . 
Good theory , but , again , only one-third of most SOEs &apos; shares are privatized . 
Local officials remain involved in running listed firms , and while regulatory institutions remain weak , asset stripping on the part of managers and owners is extensive . 
Real privatization is needed . 
Mr. Shang needs to grasp the nettle and come up with a new scheme for selling off the central government &apos;s shares . 
# 5 . 
China &apos;s stock market is dominated by small investors . 
Roughly 68.7m individual share accounts were opened by the end of 2002 . 
A majority of these are empty or disused . 
A recent survey by the Shanghai Stock Exchange found that only 8m of its 35m accounts were active . 
Institutional investors fraudulently opened millions of accounts in order to manipulate prices . 
A plausible estimate is that there are just 10-20 million active individual investors . 
China is not yet a nation of shareholders - another reason why Mr. Shang need not worry too much about pursuing unpopular policies . 
# 6 . 
The market lacks institutional investors . 
Sixty-one closed and open-ended investment funds currently own about 10 % of traded shares . 
But demand for asset management outstrips supply , and several thousand financial-management , trust , and consultancy companies now manage individual and corporate wealth . 
These are institutional investors in everything but formal registration . 
A survey conducted in 2001 suggests that funds under their management account for about 40 % of the market . 
# 7 . 
The CSRC , the securities and fund-management firms , and listed companies are all ultimately owned by the state and so little improvement in regulation is likely . 
For much of the 1990s , the political logic was clear : use the stock market to finance former SOEs and slacken regulation . 
That logic is now in question . 
An increasing number of officials recognize that privatization is the only way to improve efficiency and to raise funds to meet the government &apos;s liabilities . 
With intensification of privatization , the CSRC should be freer to do its job properly . 
# 8 . 
China &apos;s stock market cannot be a vehicle for privatization . 
According to Changjiang Securities , 320 listed companies experienced a change in their controlling shareholder in 1996-2001 . 
However , this usually involved the off-market sale of locally held state-owned shares to a private investor . 
At least 150 , and perhaps as many as 200 , listed firms have been privatized . 
As the government steps up privatization , the CSRC must encourage such sales and continue to establish a framework for mergers and acquisitions to support them .
