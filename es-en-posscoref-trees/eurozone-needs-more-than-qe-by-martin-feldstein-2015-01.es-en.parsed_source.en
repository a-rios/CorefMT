The Eurozone Needs More than QE 
CAMBRIDGE - Although the European Central Bank has launched a larger-than-expected program of quantitative easing ( QE ) , even its advocates fear that it may not be enough to boost real incomes , reduce unemployment , and lower governments &quot; debt-to-GDP ratios . 
They are right to be afraid . 
But first the good news : anticipation of QE has already accelerated the decline of the euro &apos;s international value . 
The weaker euro will stimulate eurozone countries &quot; exports - roughly half of which go to external markets - and thus will raise eurozone GDP . 
The euro &apos;s depreciation will also raise import prices and therefore the overall rate of inflation , moving the eurozone further away from deflation . 
Unfortunately , that may not be enough . 
The success of QE in the United States reflected initial conditions that were very different from what we now see in Europe . 
Indeed , eurozone countries should not relax their reform efforts on the assumption that ECB bond purchases will solve their problems . 
But even if these countries cannot overcome the political barriers to implementing structural changes to labor and product markets that could improve productivity and competitiveness , they can enact policies that can increase aggregate demand . 
To be sure , the major eurozone countries &quot; large national debts preclude using traditional Keynesian policies - increased spending or reduced taxes - to raise demand through increased budget deficits . 
But eurozone governments can change the structure of taxes in ways that stimulate private spending without reducing net revenue or increasing fiscal deficits . 
First , though , consider why QE &apos;s ability to stimulate growth and employment in the US does not imply that it will succeed in the eurozone . 
QE &apos;s effect on demand in the US reflected the financial-market conditions that prevailed when the Federal Reserve began its large-scale asset purchases in 2008 . 
At that time , the interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds was close to 4 % . 
The Fed &apos;s aggressive program of bond-buying and its commitment to keep short-term interest rates low for a prolonged period drove the long-term rate down to about 1.5 % . 
The sharp fall in long-term rates induced investors to buy equities , driving up share prices . 
Low mortgage interest rates also spurred a recovery in house prices . 
In 2013 , the broad Standard and Poor &apos;s index of equity prices rose by 30 % . 
The combination of higher equity and house prices raised households &quot; net worth in 2013 by $ 10 trillion , equivalent to about 60 % of that year &apos;s GDP . 
That , in turn , led to a rise in consumer spending , prompting businesses to increase production and hiring , which meant more incomes and therefore even more consumer spending . 
As a result , real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP growth accelerated to 4 % in the second half of 2013 . 
After a weather-related pause in the first quarter of 2014 , GDP continued to grow at an annual rate of more than 4 % . 
Thus , QE &apos;s success in the US reflected the Fed &apos;s ability to drive down long-term interest rates . 
In contrast , long-term interest rates in the eurozone are already extremely low , with ten-year bond rates at about 50 basis points in Germany and France and only 150 basis points in Italy and Spain . 
So the key mechanism that worked in the US will not work in the eurozone . 
Driving down the euro &apos;s dollar exchange rate from its $ 1.15 level ( where it was before the adoption of QE ) to parity or even lower will help , but it probably will not be enough . 
But , fortunately , QE is not the only tool at policymakers &quot; disposal . 
Any eurozone country can modify its tax rules to stimulate business investment , home building , and consumer spending without increasing its fiscal deficit , and without requiring permission from the European Commission . 
Consider the goal of stimulating business investment . 
Tax credits or accelerated depreciation lower firms &quot; cost of investing and therefore raise the after-tax return on investment . 
The resulting revenue loss could be offset by raising the corporate tax rate . 
Similarly , demand for new homes could be increased by allowing homeowners to deduct mortgage interest payments ( as they do in the US ) , or by giving a tax credit for mortgage interest payments . 
A temporary tax credit for home purchases would accelerate home building , encouraging more in the near term and less in the future . 
Here , the revenue loss could be offset by an increase in the personal tax rate . 
A commitment to raise the rate of value-added tax by two percentage points annually for the next five years would encourage earlier buying to get ahead of future price increases . 
The reduction in real incomes caused by the VAT increase could be offset by a combination of reduced personal income taxes , reduced payroll taxes , and increased transfers . 
Though eurozone members cannot adjust their interest rates or their exchange rates , they can alter their tax rules to stimulate spending and demand , with the appropriate policy possibly differing from country to country . 
It is now up to national political leaders to recognize that QE is not enough - and to start thinking about what else should be done to stimulate spending and demand .
