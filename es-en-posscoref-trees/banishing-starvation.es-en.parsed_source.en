Banishing Starvation 
VIENNA - Of the world &apos;s almost seven billion people , about one billion are starving , owing to a long list of unfortunate local events and circumstances , together with steadily increasing demand , unpredictable weather patterns , and poor financial management . 
And food shortages could grow much worse , as world population is expected to reach nine billion by 2050 or earlier . 
But , with the right programs , we can produce enough food for everyone . 
Indeed , by taking the right actions now , we can eradicate starvation . 
To meet expected demand over the next 20 years , global food supplies must increase by an estimated 50 % . 
This can be achieved through a program for subsistence farmers that not only improves productivity , but also reduces weather dependency and provides simple financing instruments to encourage investment in new technologies and equipment , increased land ownership , and easier access to local markets . 
Lifting subsistence farmers out of their precarious position would be equivalent to halving the number of hungry people . 
But it &apos;s a program that can be achieved only if international organizations like the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) work hand-in-hand with national governments and with private donors and partners . 
The European Union and other developed countries are already intent on tackling the problem of global food security , and could easily tailor their own schemes to become part of this wider program . 
For example , the EU supports the growth of agriculture and rural development through two types of instruments . 
Geographical initiatives , like the European Development Fund ( EDF ) , support implementation of agricultural policies in the African , Caribbean , and Pacific countries ( the Development Cooperation Instrument provides similar support in Latin America , Asia , and South Africa ) . 
Such programs already add up to significant spending - the current EDF , which runs from 2007-2013 , has set aside more than € 1 billion to support agriculture , rural development , and food security in Africa alone . 
The second type of instrument is emergency funding to deal with unforeseen events , such as natural disasters , market breakdowns , and political instability . 
The EU &apos;s ad hoc € 1 billion Food Facility , created in 2008 for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries , is a good example . 
Its objectives also include boosting agriculture in the short to medium term in selected countries . 
As part of an FAO project in Burkina Faso , the EU &apos;s Food Facility has helped to provide high-quality seeds to 100,000 vulnerable farmers , benefiting roughly 700,000 people amid the growing food crisis in the Sahel region . 
With EU support worth € 18 million , this operation will improve food security for around 860,000 rural households , or more than six million people . 
Similarly , two Food Facility projects in Mozambique , worth a total of € 2.5 million , are benefiting almost 50,000 farmers and nearly 300,000 rural families by increasing agricultural production , improving conditions for commercializing products , and addressing food security issues that affect rural households . 
Beyond these financial instruments , we need to improve on the status quo by investing in the research and development needed to modernize agriculture and reduce the risk of crop failures . 
Better , environmentally sustainable livestock production systems need to be developed , and we must boost investment in capacity-building , services training , market access , and efforts to strengthen supply chains . 
Equally important is research into the most effective measures to combat cross-border animal and plant diseases . 
Agriculture , after all , must be viewed in the context of the wider eco-system , which also means developing improved methods for conserving resources such as soil , forests , and fisheries . 
To tackle global food security successfully , we must change the way we treat rural development , which requires adopting a much more bottom-up approach . 
Again , I think that the EU is leading the way in developing countries with development policies that promote broad-based rural economic growth by boosting primary production and increasing its efficiency . 
Indeed , by promoting agricultural practices and technologies that are environmentally sustainable and raise rural incomes , these policies also stimulate rural non-farm activities . 
But problems at the top of the food system must be addressed as well . 
An important step would be better regulation of global financial markets in order to end the derivatives speculation that forces food prices up . 
Moreover , the World Trade Organization &apos;s Doha Round of global trade negotiations desperately needs to be concluded , and the EU has made a number of positive moves in this direction by proposing vast changes to its export subsidies regime . 
European spending on export refunds has declined considerably in recent years - from 30 % of agricultural expenditure in the early 1990 &quot; s to less than 1 % today ( if rural development is excluded ) . 
This huge drop results from successive reforms of the EU &apos;s Common Agricultural Policy , owing to commitments made by the EU to the WTO and to other developments on world markets . 
Last year , Europe &apos;s spending on export refunds dropped by more than 40 % from 2009 , to just € 400 million . 
With more and more subsistence farmers being driven off their land by pressures far beyond their control , we need to find better ways to balance the needs and rights of rural and urban populations . 
Unless we begin to do so , succeeding generations will fail to realize an environmentally sustainable world where people live in dignity .
