Clarity about Austerity 
MILAN - I have just had the privilege of speaking at the main annual conference of Germany &apos;s Economic Council , the economic and business arm of the Christian Democratic Union , the current governing party . 
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble were among the other speakers . 
It was an interesting event - and , more important , an encouraging one . 
It seemed clear that Germany ( or at least this rather large gathering of government , business , and labor leaders ) remains committed to the euro and to deeper European integration , and recognizes that success will require Europe-wide burden-sharing to overcome the ongoing eurozone crisis . 
The reforms in Italy and Spain are rightly reviewed as crucial , and there appears to be a deep understanding ( based on Germany &apos;s own experience in the decade and a half following reunification ) that restoring competitiveness , employment , and growth takes time . 
Greece has no good options , but a serious contagion risk remains to be contained in order to prevent derailment of the fiscal and growth-oriented reforms in Italy and Spain . 
In the face of high systemic risk , private capital is leaving banks and the sovereign-debt markets , causing governments &quot; borrowing costs to rise and bank capitalization to fall . 
This in turn threatens the functioning of the financial system and the effectiveness of the reform programs . 
Thus , the central European Union institutions , along with the International Monetary Fund , have an important role to play in stabilization and the transition to sustainable growth . 
Their efforts are needed to bridge the gap created by the exodus of private capital , thereby enabling the reform programs to be completed and begin to take effect . 
The IMF &apos;s role reflects the huge stake that the rest of the world - advanced and developing countries alike - has in Europe &apos;s recovery : it is a high-return investment . 
All of this seemed to me to be well understood among German politicians and business leaders . 
Moreover , this kind of support is and should be conditional on the extent of the reforms carried out in Italy and Spain , the eurozone &apos;s third- and fourth-largest economies , respectively . 
Labor-market liberalization in pursuit of competitiveness and growth is crucial - and remains to be implemented . 
Buying time for reform to work requires socialization of short-term risk . 
There is no other way to keep bond yields under control and banks functioning , and there is no ironclad guarantee that the reform programs needed to do the job will be approved . 
Eurobonds , viable in the longer term , are thus premature , because they imply a relaxation of conditionality , thereby weakening incentives to implement reforms . 
But if it all works , sharing risk now will not be expensive in the end . 
It might even yield a positive return . 
What , then , of the much-discussed conflict between austerity and growth ? 
I believe that it is based on a fairly serious misunderstanding . 
For Germans , austerity , in the form of sustained wage and income restraint , was an important part of the growth-oriented reforms that their country completed in 2006 . 
Much time and effort was devoted to ensuring that the considerable burden of restoring flexibility , productivity , and competitiveness was shared equitably across the population . 
But , on the receiving end of the message in southern Europe ( and across the Atlantic ) , &quot; austerity &quot; is interpreted largely in fiscal terms - as an excessively rapid and potentially growth-destroying drive to cut deficits faster than the economy can structurally adjust and fill the gap in aggregate demand . 
In other words , harsh austerity is being viewed largely through a Keynesian lens . 
Finding the right balance between excessively rapid and dangerously slow deficit reduction is important , and not all that easy . 
But that is just one component of rebalancing . 
Growth is essential to bringing down public debt / GDP ratios , and thus is a key part of fiscal stabilization . 
And it is true that the benefits of deficit reduction , if achieved too fast , will be more than offset by the negative effect on growth . 
At the same time , to restart an economy &apos;s growth and employment engines , other measures are needed , and vary somewhat across countries , owing to different initial conditions . 
But they generally include removing rigidities and other barriers to competition in labor , product , and service markets ; investment in skills , human capital , and the technology base of the economy ; and rebuilding safety nets in ways that promote and support , rather than impede , structural adjustment . 
These reforms require the sacrifice of certain kinds of protections , as well as of income and consumption growth . 
The benefits come in the form of sustainable patterns of growth and employment in the future . 
Discipline and austerity thus entail inter-temporal and intergenerational choices about the price to be paid now - and how fairly that burden is to be borne - for greater economic opportunity and social stability in the future . 
After all , restoring stability and growth is only partly about reviving short-term aggregate demand . 
It is also about structural reform and rebalancing , which comes at a cost . 
Achieving a sustainable pattern of growth requires choices that affect not just the level of aggregate demand , but also its composition - for example , investment versus consumption . 
Whether one calls this austerity or something else is a matter of semantics . 
But the confusion that has resulted is anything but harmless . 
On the contrary , it has become a major impediment to a common understanding of current challenges , and thus to achieving a broad consensus on the right path forward - one with well-defined and differentiated responsibilities - in confronting them .
