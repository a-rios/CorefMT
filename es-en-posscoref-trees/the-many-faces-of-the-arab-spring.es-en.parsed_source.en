The Many Faces of the Arab Spring 
MADRID - The attack by a Western-led alliance on Muammar Gaddafi &apos;s forces in Libya is driven largely by principled motives . 
Had it turned its back on the Libyan rebels , the West would have betrayed its very identity . 
Of course , the same principles are not being applied to save the brutally repressed masses in Yemen or the Shia protesters in Bahrain . 
It is doubtful whether they will be extended to Saudi Arabia and Syria , let alone to Iran . 
Nor is it improbable that a protracted war in Libya would end by vindicating the warning of the region &apos;s authoritarian rulers that the Arab Awakening is but a prelude to chaos . 
These built-in contradictions are compounded by the domestic conditions in each of the Arab states , as well as by strategic constraints , all of which define the shades of this uneven Arab Spring . 
The legitimacy of hereditary monarchies , a principle established by Metternich , the architect of the post-Napoleonic order , eventually prevailed in the 1848 European Spring . 
So far , the same principle remains in effect throughout the Arab world today . 
Monarchies - in Morocco , Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and most of the Gulf dynasties - still appear to their subjects to be more acceptable than secular autocracies . 
The vulnerability of the regimes in Egypt , Tunisia , Libya , Syria , and Yemen , which rely on rigged elections and a repressive state apparatus , reflects their lack of any acceptable source of legitimacy . 
Of course , the Arab monarchies are not entirely immune to the threat of popular uprisings . 
But , because their legitimacy stems from a religious or even divine source , rather than on a fiction of democratic support , as was the case of the Arab presidents , their rule is less questionable . 
Moreover , unlike the Arab &quot; republics &quot; - almost all of which arose from &quot; socialist &quot; revolutions or military takeovers that promised grandeur and social justice , only to end in corrupt , repressive regimes - the region &apos;s monarchies never promised Utopia . 
All such promises in history have ended either at the gates of the gulag or , as in Egypt and Tunisia , with the deceived masses &quot; cathartic overthrow of the rulers . 
In none of the Arab monarchies have protesters gone after the king &apos;s head ; their demand is for limits on absolute power , not an end to the monarchy . 
The revolutionary map is also influenced by attitudes toward the West . 
A sad lesson of the West &apos;s duplicity with regard to democratic reform in the Arab world , which both Syria and Iran have been happy to embrace , is that pro-Western moderate leaders who gave ground to pro-democracy protesters ended up being swept away , while those who brutally crushed their opponents are hanging on . 
The West , after all , never put irresistible pressure on any Arab regime to undertake reforms , and deserted its autocratic clients in Tunisia and Egypt only when they failed to nip the revolutionary bud . 
The lesson is that the West will coexist with tyranny , provided that it is swiftly and efficiently repressive . 
The United States , in particular , has been far more lenient with regard to the repression of democratic movements in the Gulf than it was in Egypt , Tunisia , or Libya . 
For , in the Gulf , the issue for the US is not democracy versus autocracy ; it is one of an Iran-led Shia axis versus the Sunni pro-Western incumbent regimes . 
Given rampant fear of Iranian influence , the movement for democracy in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia is bound to be stifled with US connivance . 
Indeed , the uprising by Bahrain &apos;s Shia majority has now become a struggle for regional mastery between Iran and the US-backed Sunni monarchies in the Gulf . 
Even Turkey , an ally of Iran whose prime minister , Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan , sharply criticized the military intervention against Libya - lashing out at the West for viewing the region as &quot; as a pawn in oil wars for decades &quot; - called on Iran to restrain its bellicose rhetoric during the Bahrain crisis . 
The Saudi monarchy &apos;s immunity from US pressure for democratic reform owes much to fear of the &quot; Shia crescent &quot; looming over the Gulf , with Iran at its center . 
Indeed , Saudi Arabia views political empowerment of Iraq &apos;s Shia majority as a calamity of historic proportions , a view vindicated by Iraq &apos;s outspoken support of Iranian designs in the Gulf . 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki joined the Iranian chorus against &quot; the intervention of Sunni forces in a neighboring state . &quot; 
He was seconded by the Iraq &apos;s powerful Shia leader , Mukhtada el-Sadr , and by its supreme Shia cleric , Ayatollah Ali Sistani , who urged Bahrain to get rid of the &quot; foreign forces . &quot; 
It has become fashionable to lay the blame for the vicissitudes of Arab democratization on the West . 
But historical turning points have never been characterized by easy choices , and human blunders frequently shape outcomes more than human wickedness . 
In their admirable march to civil liberty , the Arab peoples must face a preliminary test of any democracy , however incipient : assuming responsibility for the consequences of one &apos;s decisions .
