David Cameron &apos;s Great Expectations 
NEW YORK - As I listen to the news coming out of England after the recent wave of urban riots - and as I read Robert Douglas-Fairhurst &apos;s compelling new biography of Charles Dickens , Becoming Dickens - life and art seem to be echoing each other . 
In the wake of the riots , British Prime Minister David Cameron has proposed reviving children &apos;s courts , urged harsh sentences and orange jumpsuits for convicts , and floated even more odious ideas . 
For example , convicts could be intentionally exposed to public harassment through cleanup assignments , and their families , who have not committed crimes , could be evicted from their state-subsidized housing . 
Cameron is also testing arrests for Facebook comments , the suspension of social networks , and more lethal power for police . 
In Dickens &quot; England , the judiciary was not independent , and newspapers were subject to state censorship . 
Kids ( like Oliver Twist ) were punished in ways designed to break them ; poor people convicted of relatively minor offenses were transported to Australia , or given publicly humiliating forms of punishment ; police had unchecked and violent power over the poor . 
I am not endorsing leniency for looters and thugs ; but we already know where the raft of punitive legislation that Cameron is proposing , and his efforts to exploit civil unrest to clamp down on civil liberties , would lead the country . 
Likewise , we already know what an England without a social safety net - where the poor have no hope and no mobility - looks like . 
Public education barely existed for the &quot; lower orders &quot; 150 years ago , and university was a fantasy for them - as it could well be again , with tuition fees set to triple under Cameron . 
In Becoming Dickens , Douglas-Fairhurst , rejecting recent &quot; poststructuralist &quot; literary theory , reexamines Dickens and his England within their historical and political contexts . 
This approach yields valuable insights - and not a moment too soon . 
Such &quot; historicist &quot; interpretations of Victorian London have also appeared recently in the fascinating current exhibit at the Wellcome Collection , &quot; Dirt : The Filthy Reality of Everyday Life , &quot; and in Bill Bryson &apos;s new bestseller , At Home , which examines the social history surrounding a Victorian curate &apos;s manor . 
The renewed interest in Victorian social history - what people ate and wore , who worked for whom , etc . , as opposed to the history of battles and &quot; great men &quot; - may not be a coincidence . 
Western capitalist societies , especially the United Kingdom and the United States , are currently in the process of spooling time backward to the pre-Victorian era , for the benefit of a small group of elites that excludes the working and middle classes who benefited most from the Victorians &quot; social , economic , and political reforms - let alone the poor . 
As a result , it has become urgent to remember that it was the later Victorians who recognized modernity &apos;s moral dimension , originating almost every kind of public reform that we now take for granted as the mark of a civilized society . 
Early Victorian reality - destitute street children , raging cholera epidemics , and mounds of uncollected &quot; night soil &quot; in the streets - was a highly &quot; privatized &quot; reality . 
In the 1830 &quot; s , as Douglas-Fairhust movingly demonstrates , boys and girls who came from economically vulnerable families could find themselves unschooled and working 18 hours a day in blacking factories , like the 12-year-old Dickens . 
People who did not pay their creditors were sent - with their families - to debtors &quot; prisons , as John Dickens , Charles &quot; father , was for owing 40 pounds . 
Elderly people with no means of support died in rags in alleyways , while lower-middle-class families , with no unemployment insurance or welfare benefits , were perpetually in terror of illness or layoff , which would mean &quot; ruin &quot; and , possibly , being turned out into the street . 
London in the 1830 &quot; s was a city in which a third of women were servants and another third were prostitutes . 
A massive gap between the elites and everyone else ensured that the top echelons of literature , business , and politics were managed by the wealthy few , and that the talents that would emerge a generation later , in the wake of wider state-funded education , were suppressed . 
And this is more or less what all of England looked like without a social safety net . 
In contrast , the later Victorians , from the 1850 &quot; s-1880 &quot; s , created major public works and public-welfare initiatives , including state-funded infirmary networks and compulsory primary education . 
They expanded a system of workhouses and poor relief for the destitute , built up municipal water and sewage systems , municipalized police forces , and oversaw public investment in landmarks that are still with us , such as the Thames Embankment and the Victoria and Albert Museum . 
Likewise , with tens of thousands of street children entirely dependent for food on what they could scavenge or steal , the later Victorians established systems of orphanages . 
They commissioned the first epidemiological surveys to identify the source of cholera outbreaks - which could wipe out half the population of a neighborhood in a matter of weeks - and built new waterworks to stop the spread of the disease from the filthy Thames and tainted local pumps . 
They built the first major public hospitals at a time when home births and other home care spread contagion and death . 
In today &apos;s advanced capitalist democracies , most citizens &quot; obliviousness to this history serves elite interests ; otherwise , many more people , if not most , would be screaming bloody murder at increasingly successful efforts to shrink the public sector . 
As Cameron and other Western conservatives intensify their efforts to clear a path to the past , it is important to bear in mind that there is nothing novel or innovative about the absence of a welfare state and the privatization of basic services . 
We have been there already - indeed , much of what is now being dismantled in Britain was built in the Victorian era because of appalling social conditions for most people . 
If today &apos;s conservative political forces remain in power , the dark , dangerous , and ignorant past is where England - and other Western countries - risks returning .
