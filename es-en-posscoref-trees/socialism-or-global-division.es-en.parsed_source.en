Socialism or Global Division ? 
For the first time in history , we have the knowledge , the technology , and the wealth to design a different world . 
We have the resources to &quot; make poverty history . &quot; 
But , though we have the power to change the world , we are not taking the steps needed to do so . 
In 2000 , the world &apos;s governments adopted the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , which aim to halve global poverty by 2015 . 
Yet the international community has lacked the political will needed to meet these basic responsibilities to humanity , causing people to lose faith in politics . 
Unless we take action , our citizens will lose hope in the power of democracy - or find hope in extremism , fundamentalism , and violence . 
To restore people &apos;s trust not only in politics , but also in their own potential , our policies must guarantee responsible governance and institutions that work for and with responsible citizens . 
As the largest political organization in the world , the Socialist International can unite the world &apos;s citizens around a new global agenda to achieve these goals . 
Our first challenge is to democratize globalization . 
We must reconfigure globalization from the bottom-up , bringing in the two-thirds of the human race that is currently excluded from the process , on terms that reflect the socialist principles of inclusion , cultural diversity , and sustainable development . 
How can citizens have a democratic say in world economic development when the IMF and World Bank work on the principle of &quot; one dollar , one vote &quot; ? 
There can be no real democracy when we have a massive concentration of capital and power in the hands of the few ; when multinational corporations challenge the power of democratically elected representatives ; when organized criminals can buy off police officers , judges , and politicians ; when monopolization of the media erodes fundamental freedoms . 
Democratizing globalization will take time . 
But we can accelerate the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration . 
This calls for new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world - in China , the United States , India , and the Arab world . 
To tackle global problems , we need to strengthen and democratize international institutions like the United Nations . 
But we need to look beyond reform of the Security Council and start creating a democratic global architecture that puts globalization at the service of citizens , not markets . 
Today , the top priority for socialists is to re-establish a balance between economic productivity and social justice . 
While we have some successful precedents , such as the Nordic model , it is difficult for nations to achieve this balance . 
As capitalist markets give way to vast commercial networks , and as market economies become market societies , governments and unions are increasingly restricted in scope . 
This has disempowered and divided our citizens . 
Citizens of developed countries increasingly feel like mere objects of consumerism , while citizens of developing countries struggle for daily survival . 
In both cases , but in different ways , people feel impoverished . 
To be sure , we have very diverse societies , but we also face new forms of inequality . 
Lack of labor standards in one part of the world undermines the social welfare of workers in other parts of the world . 
Mass migration from poor countries has created fear and xenophobia in richer countries , especially among the working class . 
Similarly , free trade has turned farmers and service workers in the developing and developed world against each other . 
Environmental concerns have become a &quot; blame game . &quot; 
The developed world fears the depletion of vital resources by the developing world , which in turn blames the developed world for destroying the environment in pursuit of profit . 
To bridge these divides , we must rethink the nature of employment in an increasingly automated , borderless , and mobile global economy . 
As capital is globalized , so basic labor standards should be global . 
Forced labor , child labor , and discrimination in the workplace must be eliminated . 
We must also make our own politics more democratic . 
We must fight exclusion from our political parties , just as we fight exclusion in our societies . 
This means welcoming migrants and minorities , creating more opportunities for women and the disabled , and empowering citizens through education and participation . 
Empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well . 
In PASOK , the Greek Socialist party that I lead , we are undertaking far-reaching reforms in this direction . 
Likewise , the goal of the Socialist International is a world governed not by free markets , but by free people .
