Getting Past the American Election 
The pundits have now weighed in mightily in interpreting the American presidential election . 
Did the outcome - together with Republican gains in the Congress - represent an endorsement of Bush &apos;s positions ? 
Has the American electorate swung to the right ? 
Are Americans now more concerned about &quot; values ? &quot; 
Like price in economics , a single electoral choice compresses a lot of information . 
It is a summary of whether , taking everything into account , a citizen prefers one candidate to another . 
A host of surveys is required to figure out what it really means , for the United States - and for the world . 
This much is clear , however : there is little confidence in Bush &apos;s economic policies . 
The typical American family knows that it is worse off today than it was four years ago , and appears unconvinced that the tax cuts targeted at upper-income Americans brought the benefits heralded by the Bush administration . 
But while Bush was not held back four years ago by the lack of a popular mandate in pushing his agenda , he may be emboldened by the seeming ringing endorsement to push even harder - such as making the tax cuts permanent and partially privatizing social security . 
If adopted , these measures will further compound America &apos;s fiscal mess . 
To the rest of the world , these are America &apos;s problems . 
Yes , the soaring deficits may contribute somewhat to international financial instability . 
Real interest rates may rise , as America borrows more and more . 
If declining confidence in US fiscal policy leads to a weaker dollar , Europe and Asia may find it more difficult to export , and if the deficits prove a drag on the American economy , global growth may stall . 
But for much of the rest of the world , the real concern is American unilateralism . 
An interconnected world needs cooperation and collective action . 
Historically , the US has exercised enormous leadership in a world committed to the proposition that no state should dictate collective decisions . 
Unfortunately , over the past four years , America &apos;s president has lost the credibility necessary to exercise that leadership . 
Even if the 59 million votes cast for Bush represented a ringing endorsement of his Iraq policy , it would not restore America &apos;s international credibility . 
I believe most Americans reject Bush &apos;s unilateralism no less than his administration &apos;s economic policies . 
Before the invasion of Iraq , they wanted America to go to the UN , and today they recognize that America alone cannot maintain order in the Middle East . 
Even if Iraq is to bear more of the cost of its own reconstruction , there will have to be debt forgiveness , and this too requires international cooperation . 
Those who voted for Bush may not be as outraged by American involvement in torture , or the misleading information about Iraq &apos;s weapons of mass destruction and connections with Al Qaeda , as those abroad . 
But they do not want America alone to shoulder the burdens of international peace , and they are gradually coming to the realization that leadership and cooperation do not come automatically , simply because America is the only superpower . 
Some worry whether Bush will use his electoral mandate to engage in more ventures . 
As he himself put it , &quot; I earned capital in the campaign ... and now I intend to spend it . &quot; 
Had the Iraq venture been more successful , these worries would have been justified . 
There is little secret that there were discussions concerning Iran . 
But the doctrine of preemptive war has been badly tarnished , and I remain hopeful that Congress and the American people have learned a painful lesson . 
Peace will not quickly be restored to Iraq , and it is hard to conceive of opening up a major new front , when America can hardly manage what it has already undertaken . 
Others will , of course , have to continue to bear the costs of the mistaken and mismanaged adventure in Iraq . 
Instability in the Middle East will continue to limit oil supplies , discouraging the expansion of production . 
High oil prices will dampen global growth in the remainder of 2004 and into 2005 . 
In the short run , the only response is more conservation , and America &apos;s allies should put pressure on America to conserve . 
Presidents do make a difference , but every president operates within constraints . 
The good news is that the constraints that Bush and the American government will face in the next four years will almost surely limit the damage they will cause . 
The rhetoric and posturing , the lack of commitment to human rights or democratic processes , may be - and should be - upsetting , but there will be far more bark than bite . 
While America may continue on a path of unilateralism , other countries &apos; stance will make a difference . 
Some suggest that the US constitution provided fewer constraints on the president in the conduct of foreign policy , because the requisite checks and balances were to be provided by the powers of the time - Britain and France . 
Today , with the US as the only superpower , it is even more important for countries to stand up and express their views - and to stick by them even when pressured . 
Some worry that this will worsen relations with the US . 
But long-term relationships are based on friendship and respect ; coherent , well-argued positions will earn that respect . 
Today , many Americans , especially the young , feel far more respect for the countries that recognized the lack of evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction than for those whose leaders repeated the American distortions . 
It may be unfortunate that Realpolitik is the order of the day , but it is , so others must learn to play the same game . 
Standing up for multilateralism and international rule of law may not only be the morally right thing to do ; it is also in the interests of America &apos;s allies and , ultimately , America itself .
