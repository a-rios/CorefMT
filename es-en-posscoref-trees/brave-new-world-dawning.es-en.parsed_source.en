Brave New World Dawning 
Since 1978 , reproductive biologists have helped couples overcome infertility by using increasingly sophisticated techniques for generating and manipulating human embryos in the laboratory . 
At the same time , molecular biologists have been working to overcome human disease by deciphering the entire sequence of the human genome and constructing tools to correct genetic and cellular defects . 
While reproductive and molecular biologists focus on unrelated medical problems - infertility and disease - combining their technologies produces reprogenetics , which will allow us to design ourselves . 
Reprogenetics will enable prospective parents to give their children genes that they themselves do not carry , thereby increasing their offspring &apos;s chances for health , longevity , happiness , and success - an appalling prospect for many bioethicists . 
But is reprogenetics simply a new and more powerful vehicle to repeat the abhorrent eugenic practices of the past ? 
Or are reprogenetics and eugenics fundamentally different from one another in terms of both control and purpose ? 
Eugenics embodies the desire and attempts of a society &apos;s leaders to control the breeding practices of its citizens , including the forcible sterilization or murder of those deemed as carrying undesirable genes . 
Reprogenetics , by contrast , is concerned with the question of what genes an individual child will receive , not with the vague , unscientific goal of improving a society &apos;s gene pool . 
Moreover , it gives control to individual prospective parents . 
While eugenic practices led to a restriction of reproductive freedom and worse , reprogenetics can do the opposite . 
It could help parents have children with a higher likelihood of being healthy , without bringing direct harm to anyone else . 
Reprogenetics can be understood as an extension of parents &apos; fundamental motivation and desire : to protect their children and give them all possible advantages in life . 
Parents in affluent societies already provide environmental advantages to their children after birth ; reprogenetics could allow them to pursue the same objectives before birth . 
Of course , neither environmental nor genetic advantages guarantee healthier , happy , successful children . 
But the lack of guarantees does not prevent parents from spending $ 140,000 to send their children to the elite private university where I teach . 
If democratic societies allow people to spend money to buy environmental advantages for children , how can they prohibit parents from buying genetic advantages ? 
If reprogenetics is used to increase chances of health , happiness and success , what could be wrong with it ? 
Once issues of technical safety are resolved , a fundamental objection to reprogenetics is its inherent unfairness to families unable to afford it . 
All modern democratic societies must balance individual autonomy and social justice . 
In the US , individual autonomy is of paramount importance . 
In most other Western countries , social solidarity looms much larger . 
Most European countries try to realize it by providing equal healthcare and educational opportunities to all children . 
But the argument that genetic enhancements are immoral because not all children can receive them is flawed . 
Children are not biologically equivalent to begin with . 
Everyone is born with advantages or disadvantages across a whole range of physical characteristics as well as innate abilities . 
Life is not fair . 
So , in the future the critical question will be this : &quot; Who decides how genetic advantages are distributed ? &quot; 
Who decides which child will get the HIV resistance gene and who will be born susceptible to AIDS ? 
Who will decide which child will have superior protection against cancer and heart disease ? 
Should the decision be left to the randomness of nature , as it is now ? 
Should it be determined by the parents &apos; affluence ? 
Or should it be controlled by a benevolent state that doles out life-enhancing genes to all its newly conceived children ? 
Unfortunately , provision and regulation of genetic enhancement technology will not be easy . 
Unlike healthcare , there are almost no limits to genetic enhancements . 
There can always be stronger resistance to disease , greater longevity , more physical prowess , and higher mental capacity . 
Furthermore , the innate desire to provide for one &apos;s children is so powerful that affluent citizens may buy reprogenetics elsewhere even if their society bans or limits its use . 
Today , for example , Europeans travel to the US to purchase human eggs from young women chosen on the basis of their presumed genetic characteristics . 
It is , however , possible to envisage an alternative scenario to that of a growing gap between &quot; haves &quot; and &quot; have-nots . &quot; 
Although such a gap may emerge initially , the cost of reprogenetics is likely to drop sharply over time . 
Like computers and advanced telecommunications , it could become affordable to the majority in developed countries . 
Ultimately , hyper-human genetic enhancements will become feasible , too , and the economic and social advantages that wealthy countries maintain could be expanded into a genetic advantage . 
The divide between wealthy and poor nations could widen further with each generation until a common humankind no longer exists . 
A severed humanity could be the ultimate legacy of unfettered global capitalism . 
The only alternative to this bleak possibility seems remote today and may never be viable : a single global state in which all children are provided with the same genetic enhancements and the same opportunities for health , happiness , and success . 
While this sounds like political fiction in a world where children still die from starvation , reprogenetics sounded like science fiction only thirty years ago . 
The course of political development is , for good or bad , far more difficult to predict .
