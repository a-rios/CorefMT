Whose Champions , Anyway ? 
The links between states and companies have grabbed headlines , most recently in Russia , where President Vladimir Putin seems obsessed with creating &quot; national champions &quot; in the energy and aerospace sectors . 
Such efforts seem but a part of a surge of protectionism in European political debate about business , especially when it comes to cross-border acquisitions . 
Across Europe , governments position themselves to be seen as defending &quot; national &quot; players from &quot; foreign &quot; competitors . 
&quot; Economic patriotism , &quot; the slogan coined by France &apos;s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin following PepsiCo &apos;s rumored attempt in July 2005 to takeover Danone , perhaps best encapsulates the political imperative . 
Although de Villepin &apos;s speeches are more flamboyant than those of most political leaders , the underlying sentiment extends far beyond France . 
The same impulse appears to be at work behind Italy &apos;s policy on Autostrade , Spain &apos;s on Endesa , Poland &apos;s on its banking sector , the former Swedish Prime Minister &apos;s on Volvo , German unease about &quot; locust &quot; -like funds on Deutsche BÃ¶rse , or the United Kingdom &apos;s ever louder defense of the London Stock Exchange &apos;s independence from the United States . 
The basic belief that underpins &quot; economic patriotism &quot; is that of an alignment of interests between companies considered &quot; national &quot; ( most prominently the largest ones or so-called &quot; champions &quot; ) , their national employees , and the national community . 
According to de Villepin , &quot; to defend the employees &quot; interests well , we must protect the interests of our companies . &quot; 
He later argued that Danone should be considered &quot; French &quot; because its &quot; milk collection and its water sources are in France . &quot; 
But Danone &apos;s own filings indicate that only 22 % of its global sales and less than 14 % of its global workforce are in France . 
In fact , the link between European companies and national communities is becoming more tenuous by the day . 
Research that I carried out for Bruegel surveyed the largest 100 listed companies headquartered in Europe ( ranked by market capitalization ) and analyzed the geographical distribution of their revenue , which is increasingly transparent since the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) last year . 
Europe was divided into eight broad zones , comprising individual countries like Germany , France , and Italy , or groupings of smaller countries such as Benelux and the Nordic area . 
The survey then calculated the share of revenue earned by each company in the zone in which it is headquartered ( or &quot; home base &quot; ) , the rest of Europe , and the rest of the world . 
Where relevant information for companies was available , the comparable distribution of employees was also examined . 
The results show that the share of the home base in total revenue has become , on average , relatively low : just three-eighths , or 37.5 % , on average for Europe &apos;s largest 100 companies . 
Of course , this figure covers a wide diversity of industries , and also some geographical differences across the continent . 
For example , the averages for German ( 34 % ) or French ( 35 % ) companies are markedly lower than for their Spanish ( 56 % ) or Italian ( 65 % ) counterparts . 
But the general trend is unambiguous . 
For a broadly representative sub-sample of 55 companies that could be tracked since 1997 , the proportion of revenue generated in the home region has fallen sharply on average , from 50.2 % to 36.9 % . 
For these companies , sales to the &quot; rest of Europe , &quot; which represented an average of less than 30 % of total European sales in 1997 , rose above 43 % in 2005 . 
If the trend is extrapolated , the home bases of Europe &apos;s largest companies will account , on average , for less than half of their European revenue , and less than a third of their global revenue , before the end of this decade . 
These companies are &quot; Europeanizing &quot; fast , and the relative weight of their home base is declining even faster . 
Moreover , this is not just a story about sales . 
The survey also measured the geographical distribution of employees relative to the distribution of revenue . 
While the distribution profiles between employees and revenue could be sharply dissimilar in some companies , on average they were almost identical : for a sub-sample of 73 companies among Europe &apos;s top 100 , the home base represented 37 % of employees and 35 % of revenue on average in 2005 , while the rest of Europe accounted for 29 % of employees and 28 % of revenue . 
This strongly suggests that jobs broadly &quot; follow &quot; sales ( or perhaps the other way round ) , even though , once again , this is true only on average and not for all companies . 
What are the implications for policymakers ? 
Put simply , the numbers show a growing gap of interests between these so-called &quot; champions &quot; and their national home bases . 
For Europe &apos;s governments , fostering champions increasingly means providing benefits to non-national customers and employees - a dubious use of taxpayer money . 
Another consequence is that regulatory competition is likely to increase in Europe , as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their headquarters at &quot; home &quot; if the tax or regulatory environment becomes unfavorable . 
The decision by Depfa Bank to shift its headquarters from Wiesbaden to Dublin in 2002 may be a sign of things to come . 
The biggest risk is that the growing disconnect between the perception of &quot; national &quot; companies and the reality of Europeanization may lead to spectacularly ill-judged policies . 
It is high time for business leaders to be more candid about where their real constituencies lie , and for national politicians to recognize that they can no longer wield control over the giants of today &apos;s European business .
