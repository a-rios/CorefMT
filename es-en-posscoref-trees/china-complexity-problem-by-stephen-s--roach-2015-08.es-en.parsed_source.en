China &apos;s Complexity Problem 
NEW HAVEN - There are many moving parts in China &apos;s daunting transition to what its leaders call a moderately well-off society . 
Tectonic shifts are occurring simultaneously on several fronts - the economy , financial markets , geopolitical strategy , and social policy . 
The ultimate test may well lie in managing the exceedingly complex interplay among these developments . 
Is China &apos;s leadership up to the task , or has it bitten off too much at once ? 
Most Western commentators continue to over-simplify this debate , framing it in terms of the proverbial China hard-landing scenarios that have been off the mark for 20 years . 
In the wake of this summer &apos;s stock-market plunge and surprising devaluation of the renminbi , the same thing is happening again . 
I suspect , however , that fears of an outright recession in China are vastly overblown . 
While the debate about China &apos;s near-term outlook should hardly be trivialized , the far bigger story is its economy &apos;s solid progress on the road to rebalancing - namely , a structural shift away from manufacturing and construction activity toward services . 
In 2014 , the services share of Chinese GDP hit 48.2 % , well in excess of the combined 42.6 % share of manufacturing and construction . 
And the gap is continuing to widen - services activity grew 8.4 % year on year in the first half of 2015 , far outstripping the 6.1 % growth in manufacturing and construction . 
Services are in many respects the infrastructure of a consumer society - in China &apos;s case , providing the basic utilities , communications , retail outlets , health care , and finance that its emerging middle class is increasingly demanding . 
They are also labor-intensive : in China , services require about 30 % more jobs per unit of output than do capital-intensive manufacturing and construction . 
Largely for that reason , China &apos;s employment trends have held up much better than might be expected in the face of an economic slowdown . 
Urban job growth averaged slightly more than 13 million in 2013-14 - well above the ten million targeted by the government . 
Moreover , the data from early 2015 suggest that urban hiring remains near the impressive pace of recent years - hardly the labor-market stress normally associated with economic hard landings or recessions . 
Services are also the ingredient that makes China &apos;s urbanization strategy so effective . 
Today , approximately 55 % of China &apos;s population lives in cities , compared to less than 20 % in 1978 . 
New and expanding cities sustain growth through services-based employment , which in turn boosts consumer purchasing power by trebling per capita income relative to that earned in the countryside . 
So , despite all the handwringing over a Chinese crash , the rapid shift toward a services-based economy is tempering downside pressures in the old manufacturing-based economy . 
The International Monetary Fund stressed the same conclusion in its recent Article IV consultation with China , noting that labor income is now expanding as a share of GDP , and that consumption contributed slightly more than investment to GDP growth in 2014 . 
That may seem like marginal progress , but it is actually quite rapid relative to the normally glacial pace of structural change - a process that began in China only in 2011 with the enactment of the 12th Five-Year Plan . 
Alas , there is an important catch . 
While progress on economic rebalancing is encouraging , China has put far more on its plate : simultaneous plans to modernize the financial system , reform the currency , and address excesses in equity , debt , and property markets . 
Meanwhile , the authorities are also pursuing an aggressive anti-corruption campaign , a more muscular foreign policy , and a nationalistic revival couched in terms of the &quot; China Dream . &quot; 
The interplay among these multiple objectives may prove especially daunting . 
For example , the confluence of deleveraging and the bursting of the equity bubble could create a self-reinforcing downward spiral in the old manufacturing economy that shakes consumer confidence and offsets the emerging dynamism of the new services economy . 
Similarly , military adventures in the South China Sea could damage China &apos;s links to the rest of the world long before it is able to count on domestic demand for economic growth . 
Ironically , China &apos;s juggling act may prove even more difficult for the authorities to pull off in a market-based , consumer-oriented system . 
Caught in the transition from China &apos;s tightly controlled , state-directed model , the government seems to be waffling - for example , by stressing a decisive shift to markets , only to intervene aggressively when equity prices plummet . 
Likewise , it is embracing more of a market-based foreign-exchange regime while guiding the renminbi lower . 
Add to that a stop-start commitment to reform of state-owned enterprises and China could inadvertently find itself mired in something comparable to what Minxin Pei has long called a &quot; trapped transition , &quot; in which the economic-reform strategy is stymied by the lack of political will in a one-party state . 
Under President Xi Jinping &apos;s leadership , there is no lack of political will in today &apos;s China . 
The challenge is to prioritize that will in a way that keeps China on the course of reform and rebalancing . 
Any backtracking on these fronts would lead China into the type of trap that Pei has long feared is inevitable . 
Economic development has always been a daunting challenge . 
As warnings about the &quot; middle-income trap &quot; underscore , history is littered with more failures than successes in pushing beyond the per capita income threshold that China has attained . 
The last thing China needs is to try to balance too much on the head of a pin . 
Its leaders need to simplify and clarify an agenda that risks becoming too complex to manage .
