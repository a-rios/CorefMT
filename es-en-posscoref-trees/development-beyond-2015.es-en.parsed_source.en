Development beyond 2015 
PARIS - It is now halfway to the target date of 2015 for the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) - the ambitious blueprint , backed by the entire development community , for development in the world &apos;s poorest countries . 
In the wake of the global financial crisis , which is about to hit the developing world , it is time to ask the right questions about the international community &apos;s commitment to achieving these goals . 
Sadly , we know that most countries will not meet the objectives by 2015 . 
If the global poverty reduction target is met , it will be due to high growth in emerging countries such as China or India rather than to a decline in absolute poverty in the neediest countries . 
This is worrisome , because it is a symptom of two more significant ills . 
First , the international community seems to be suffering from schizophrenia : whereas all countries solemnly affirmed their commitment to the MDGs , few have provided the means to achieve them . 
The reality is that aid increased only slightly over the 2000-2006 period : because of massive debt write-offs , the substantial increase in official development assistance did not translate into new and available funds on the ground . 
The MDGs were meant to help international solidarity move from a logic of inputs ( how much aid do we give ? ) to one of outputs ( what concrete impact are we aiming for ? ) . 
Second , this poor performance shows how short-sighted the international community can be . 
Global responsibility to assist developing nations goes far beyond the MDGs - in both time and scale . 
The pace of sustainable development is necessarily slow . 
In areas such as health or education , the acceleration needed to meet the targets in many countries would be faster than anything we have witnessed in history . 
While more action is needed to accelerate progress , a failure to achieve the MDGs by 2015 would not mean that they are worthless , or that aid is inefficient . 
Achieving these goals is an important step on the slow path to lasting development . 
Thus , by focusing on the ( arbitrary ) date of 2015 , we fail to perceive the fundamental change that the MDGs represent . 
By aiming for targets that are far out of reach of the poorest countries &quot; public finances , the international community has agreed to substitute itself for those states in providing essential social services through long-term financial transfers . 
The current global inequalities in living standards are close to those that existed within our own societies over a century ago . 
Globalization has generated a new global market , but also global risks that beg for collective management . 
No single economic space has ever been created without the parallel establishment of solidarity mechanisms to handle these risks and care for those left behind . 
What is at stake with the MDGs is the creation on a global scale of the same sort of public redistribution mechanisms that were progressively established in the world &apos;s richest societies over the course of the twentieth century . 
As most of today &apos;s financial , environmental , or sanitary crises are unpredictable and ignore borders , it is in everyone &apos;s interest to create a global &quot; social safety net &quot; that will span an indefinite period of time . 
If we accept the logic behind the more pragmatic and ambitious philosophy of international aid that underpins the United Nations &quot; &quot; Millennium Declaration , &quot; we must quickly adapt our instruments to ensure more sustainable and predictable modes of financing . 
This is one of the main aims of global taxation mechanisms , such as the International Finance Facility initiative and the Airplane Tax . 
We also need instruments that are better suited to delivery of long-term international transfers . 
Finally , we must find ways to nurture stronger and more vigorous economic growth , a prerequisite to solid investment in social sectors . 
Beyond the MDGs semi-success or semi-failure by 2015 , the key question is whether the international community will be able to overcome its myopia and schizophrenia . 
It must accept the idea of a long-term international redistribution policy to assist those who are excluded from the benefits of globalization , and give itself the means to implement this ambitious policy . 
Otherwise , any success in the battle on poverty is bound to be short-lived .
