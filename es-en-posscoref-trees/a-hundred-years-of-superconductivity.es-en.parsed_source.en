A Hundred Years of Superconductivity 
CHICAGO - The world &apos;s first &quot; quantum &quot; computer - a machine that harnesses the magic of quantum phenomena to perform memory and processing tasks incredibly faster than today &apos;s silicon-based computer chips - was recently sold by D-Wave Systems of Canada to Lockheed-Martin . 
And , while some question whether the machine is truly a quantum computer , its designers have published articles in peer-reviewed journals demonstrating that the basic elements of this novel computer are indeed superconducting quantum bits . 
This spring marked the 100th anniversary of the discovery of superconductivity - the ability of materials to carry electrical current with no loss . 
Currents set up in superconducting wires can exist for years without any measurable decay . 
Because of this property , superconductors have unique features that can be exploited in many ways . 
They can carry enormous amounts of current , making them ideal for urban power grids . 
And , when wound into coils , they can produce extremely strong magnetic fields . 
Such superconducting magnets have been applied in a variety of technologies . 
The best-known examples are the magnets that drive the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) machines found in most hospitals . 
Perhaps the most exotic are the huge magnets used to accelerate particles in the Large Hadron Collider , which seeks to discover the fundamental principles of matter . 
Despite their great promise , however , superconductors have limits , the primary one being that most superconduct at very low temperatures - indeed , near absolute zero ( -273 ÂºC ) . 
Such temperatures can be achieved only through liquid-helium cooling . 
Thus , Swiss researchers caused excitement in 1986 by announcing the discovery of superconductivity in an oxide of copper at twice the temperature of the previous record holder . 
Shortly thereafter , researchers in the United States found a related material that superconducts above the temperature at which air liquefies . 
As Time magazine proclaimed in May 1987 , with the discovery of these so-called &quot; cuprates , &quot; the superconducting revolution had begun . 
Alas , the revolution soon bogged down . 
Cuprates are notoriously difficult materials to work with , because they are very brittle . 
This is exacerbated by their strong anisotropy - the materials have a quasi-two-dimensional structure consisting of a weakly coupled stack of conducting sheets . 
As such , they are a challenge for industry , though applications are beginning to appear . 
Since the cuprates first appeared , a variety of other &quot; high temperature &quot; superconductors have been discovered - one is a simple compound of magnesium and boron , and another involves a mixture of iron and arsenic . 
Although none of them superconduct at temperatures as high as liquid air , they may ultimately be better materials with which to work . 
Given the vast number of combinations of elements that can form compounds , there is a good chance that better superconductors await our discovery . 
In the coming years , superconductors are expected to play a growing role in technology . 
Already , &quot; second generation &quot; cuprate wires are being used to make high-capacity cables for electric-power transmission , and lighter-weight generators for wind turbines . 
Stronger superconducting magnets are leading to the development of MRIs with more sophisticated diagnostic capabilities . 
Superconductors are being used for levitated trains in high-speed rail transport , and as microwave filters for improved signal bandwidth in cellular base stations . 
The discovery of a new superconductor with enhanced properties could lead to even greater technological innovation . 
This brings us to the intellectual challenge of superconductors . 
It took 46 years from the discovery of superconductivity to the 1957 Bardeen , Cooper , and Schrieffer ( BCS ) theory of how the phenomenon occurs . 
Along the way , a number of famous physicists tried and failed to get the answer - Albert Einstein , Werner Heisenberg , and Richard Feynman being notable examples . 
Discovering the solution required the development of advanced theoretical techniques . 
What had been difficult to figure out was how to get electrons to superconduct . 
The basic discovery of BCS was that if the electrons pair up , those couples could indeed superconduct . 
Fortunately , the mechanism for such coupling was known . 
Although electrons are negatively charged , and therefore repel one another , the positive ions that they leave behind when they flow through a metal can mediate an effective attraction between two electrons under restrictive conditions ( for example , the metal must be very cold ) . 
The suspicion , though , is that this is not the case in the new superconductors . 
Cuprates superconduct at much higher temperatures , but , more importantly , they possess some exotic properties : they are formed by doping electrical carriers into a host material that is a magnetic insulator - the last place one would look for a conventional superconductor . 
And , unlike BCS theory , in which the pairs are isotropic - with identical properties in all directions in space - the pairs in cuprates are strongly anisotropic , resembling a cloverleaf . 
How can one pair electrons without ions holding them together , thereby enabling higher-temperature superconductors ? 
While ideas about this abound , new theoretical breakthroughs most likely will be needed to develop the machinery required to solve such electron-electron theories , perhaps even involving black holes . 
Whatever the theory turns out to be , it is certain to revolutionize physics .
