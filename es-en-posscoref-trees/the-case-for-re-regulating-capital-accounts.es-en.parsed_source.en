The Case for Re-Regulating Capital Accounts 
NEW YORK - Today &apos;s debates over &quot; currency wars &quot; reveal two paradoxical features of the global economy . 
The first is that there is no mechanism linking world trade rules to exchange-rate movements . 
Countries spend years negotiating trade rules , but exchange-rate movements can , within days , have a greater impact on trade than those painstaking deals . 
Furthermore , exchange-rate movements are essentially determined by financial flows and may have no effects in terms of correcting global trade imbalances . 
The second paradox is that monetary expansion may be largely ineffective in the country that undertakes it , but can generate large negative externalities on others . 
This is particularly true of the quantitative easing now underway in the United States , because the American dollar is the major global reserve currency . 
So far during the financial crisis and ensuing recession , the US has been incapable of kick-starting credit growth , the major transmission mechanism by which monetary expansion feeds through to domestic economic activity . 
But it is inducing massive capital flows to emerging markets , where they are generating asset-price bubbles . 
If this leads to a weakening of the dollar , it would also have negative effects on trading partners . 
( The same can be said of recent Japanese monetary-policy decisions . ) 
Some proposals would resolve the first of these paradoxes by allowing countries to use the World Trade Organization &apos;s dispute-resolution mechanism in cases of exchange-rate manipulation . 
But this is the wrong way to go , for it might serve only to erode one of the few effective mechanisms in place to make multilateral agreements binding . 
Unilateral countervailing duties against countries that are hypothetically manipulating their exchange rates are equally bad . 
This does not mean , of course , that China should take no action to correct the undervaluation of its currency , though some recognition should be given to the way in which it is already contributing to solving this problem by allowing domestic wages to rise . 
A much better way forward is to rethink seriously the role of cross-border capital-account regulations . 
One of the major areas of agreement during the recent crisis has been that deregulated financial activities can be a source of major macroeconomic disruptions . 
The G-20 , however , has largely focused on re-regulating domestic finance , whereas cross-border finance has been left entirely off its agenda , as if it required no regulation -and indeed as if it were not part of global finance . 
A particular linguistic twist is also involved here : domestic financial regulations are called by that name , but if they involve cross-border flows , they are called &quot; controls . &quot; 
A serious discussion of global capital-account regulations would benefit both advanced and emerging-market economies . 
The effectiveness of monetary expansion could be enhanced in advanced countries by reducing the leakages generated by the carry trade and other short-term capital outflows . 
Actually , this would imply a return to the IMF &apos;s founding principle : it is in the best interest of all members to allow countries to pursue their own full-employment macroeconomic policies , even if this requires regulating capital flows . 
This is why capital-account regulations are allowed under IMF rules , and why the attempt to introduce capital-account convertibility into the IMF &apos;s Articles of Agreement was defeated in 1997 . 
For emerging markets , the best way forward is to correct the incentives for interest-rate arbitrage at the source of capital flows . 
Such a reform would also serve as a mechanism of coordination at the international level , since coordinated capital-account regulations by recipient countries would be difficult to achieve . 
In the absence of such coordination , the unilateral approaches now in place could generate further distortions . 
This type of correction would also allow emerging markets to pursue more restrictive monetary policies , which they now need , given their greater macroeconomic strength . 
Indeed , the world will be characterized for several years by the asymmetry generated by advanced countries &quot; weakness and emerging economies &quot; strength , which calls for asymmetry in these two groups of countries &quot; monetary policies . 
That would be very difficult to manage without some form of capital-account regulation . 
Many regulations make sense , as the IMF has recognized in several cases . 
A reserve requirement on cross-border flows is one of them . 
Mutual and other private-sector funds require minimum terms for investments , and such mandatory lock-up periods should be applied to capital inflows as well . 
High capital and provision requirements for certain transactions , or prohibition of such transactions , should also be introduced for prudential reasons . 
This is particularly true with respect to lending in foreign currencies to economic agents that do not have revenues in those currencies . 
At the source , capital requirements for currency mismatches in portfolios , together with margin requirements on foreign-exchange derivatives , make sense . 
Non-deliverable forward contracts should be subject to close regulation and supervision in both source and destination countries . 
In fact , a tax on foreign-exchange transactions - the so-called &quot; Tobin tax , &quot; advocated by the late Nobel laureate economist James Tobin - might be the simplest way to go .
