Are Foreign Investors Still Welcome ? 
World flows of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) have soared over the past two decades , from $ 40 billion in the early 1980 &quot; s to $ 900 billion last year . 
The cumulative stock of FDI has reached close to $ 10 trillion , making it the most important mechanism for delivery of goods and services to foreign markets : sales by foreign affiliates total roughly $ 19 trillion , compared to world exports of $ 11 trillion . 
At the same time , the liberalization of FDI regimes by virtually all countries has been a driving force of intra-firm trade - the lifeblood of the emerging system of integrated international production and already around one-third of world trade . 
But are the good times coming to an end ? 
FDI can bring a range of benefits , but it also can have costs . 
During the 1970 &quot; s , when the transnational corporations ( TNC &apos;s ) undertaking such investment caught the public eye , many governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed its benefits , so they controlled it . 
Led by the developed countries , the pendulum began to swing in the 1980 &quot; s . 
Once viewed as part of the problem , FDI became part of the solution to economic growth and development . 
Nothing exemplifies this more than changes in national FDI regimes . 
As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reports , of the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004 , 93 % were in the direction of creating a more hospitable environment for TNC &apos;s . 
But there is a real danger that the pendulum is beginning to swing back , leading to a reversal of that liberalization process . 
FDI in developed countries ( and increasingly in emerging markets ) often takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions ( M A &apos;s ) . 
Resistance to such M A &apos;s is becoming more frequent when they involve domestic firms that are regarded by politicians as &quot; national champions &quot; or important for national security , economic development , or cultural identity . 
The growing involvement of private equity groups in M A activity implies additional controversy , as such transactions are typically regarded as being purely speculative . 
In the name of &quot; economic patriotism , &quot; security , and other considerations , resistance to M A &apos;s is being codified in an increasing number of countries . 
For example , a United States Senate committee recently sought to block the planned liberalization of foreign takeover rules for airlines , while Europe has enacted more restrictive takeover laws . 
Moreover , governments are applying more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the vetting of takeovers by foreign firms . 
This response is intertwined with a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNC &apos;s from emerging markets , the &quot; new kids on the block . &quot; 
Established TNC &apos;s , and their home countries , will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market . 
As we know from other contexts , adjustment to newcomers is not easy : compare , say , the reaction to the tie-up between France &apos;s Alcatel and America &apos;s Lucent to the bids by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or Mittal for Acelor . 
Another type of defensive reaction - this time to outward FDI - may well arise once the offshoring of services gathers more speed . 
All indications are that offshoring has reached the tipping point , and more of it will take place through FDI . 
If home countries do not put in place the adjustment mechanisms to deal with the rapidly unfolding revolution in making service industry jobs tradable , a backlash against such outward FDI will become inevitable . 
The growing unease with FDI is so far largely confined to developed countries . 
But there are signs that it is spreading to emerging markets . 
In the case of large-scale projects , some host countries are raising questions about the contracts that define their relationship with TNC &apos;s , and governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that they did not get a fair deal . 
Of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects , some two-thirds were initiated during the past three years . 
Approaches to FDI have changed in the past , and they can change again in the future , depending on how governments view the balance of costs and benefits . 
This balance involves not only economic factors , but also such considerations as security and the desire to control one &apos;s own economic development . 
The concept of &quot; twenty-first-century nationalization , &quot; introduced by Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala , mirrors in this respect the &quot; economic patriotism &quot; of French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin . 
Reservations against FDI ( as against anything foreign ) can be found in all groups of countries , and politicians can bring them to the surface , resulting in protectionism . 
It would be ironic , though , if developed countries - which led the FDI liberalization wave of the past two decades - now led a backlash against FDI . 
Let us hope that the de-liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spreads to other parts of the world and ultimately brings undesirable consequences for all .
