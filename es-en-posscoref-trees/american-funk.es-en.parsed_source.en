American Funk 
NEW YORK - The eccentric Bengali intellectual Nirad C. Chaudhuri once explained the end of the British Raj in India as a case of &quot; funk , &quot; or loss of nerve . 
The British had stopped believing in their own empire . 
They simply lost the will , in Rudyard Kipling &apos;s famous words , to fight &quot; the savage wars of peace . &quot; 
In fact , Kipling &apos;s poem , &quot; The White Man &apos;s Burden , &quot; which exhorted the white race to spread its values to the &quot; new-caught sullen peoples , half devil and half child , &quot; was not about the British Empire at all , but about the United States . 
Subtitled &quot; The United States and the Philippine Islands , &quot; it was published in 1899 , just as the US was waging a &quot; savage war of peace &quot; of its own . 
Chaudhuri had a point . 
It is difficult to sustain an empire without the will to use force when necessary . 
Much political rhetoric , and a spate of new books , would have us believe that the US is now in a dangerous state of funk . 
For example , Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney likes to castigate President Barack Obama for &quot; apologizing for America &apos;s international power , &quot; for daring to suggest that the US is not &quot; the greatest country on earth , &quot; and for being &quot; pessimistic . &quot; 
By contrast , Romney promises to &quot; restore &quot; America &apos;s greatness and international power , which he proposes to do by boosting American military force . 
Romney &apos;s Kipling is the neo-conservative intellectual Robert Kagan , whose new book , The World America Made , argues against &quot; the myth of American decline . &quot; 
Yes , he admits , China is growing in strength , but US dominance is still overwhelming ; 
American military might can still &quot; make right &quot; against any challenger . 
The only real danger to US power is &quot; declinism &quot; : the loss of self-belief , the temptation to &quot; escape from the moral and material burdens that have weighed on &#91; Americans &#93; since World War II . &quot; 
In a word , funk . 
Like Chaudhuri , Kagan is an engaging writer . 
His arguments sound reasonable . 
And his assessment of US firepower is no doubt correct . 
True , he has little time for domestic problems like antiquated infrastructure , failing public schools , an appalling health care system , and grotesque disparities in income and wealth . 
But he is surely right to observe that no other power is threatening to usurp America &apos;s role as the world &apos;s military policeman . 
Less certain , however , is the premise that the world order would collapse without &quot; American leadership . &quot; 
France &apos;s King Louis XV allegedly declared on his deathbed : &quot; Après moi , le déluge &quot; ( After me , the flood ) . 
This is the conceit of all great powers . 
Even as the British were dismantling their empire after World War II , the French and Dutch still believed that parting with their Asian possessions would result in chaos . 
And it is still common to hear autocratic leaders who inherited parts of the Western empires claim that democracy is all well and good , but the people are not yet ready for it . 
Those who monopolize power cannot imagine a world released from their grip as anything but a catastrophe . 
In Europe after World War II , Pax Americana , guaranteed by US military power , was designed &quot; to keep the Russians out and Germany down . &quot; 
In Asia , it was meant to contain communism , while allowing allies , from Japan to Indonesia , to build up economic strength . 
Spreading democracy was not the main concern ; stopping communism - in Asia , Europe , Africa , the Middle East , and the Americas - was . 
In this respect , it succeeded , though at great human cost . 
But , now that the specter of global communist domination has joined other fears - real and imagined - in the dustbin of history , it is surely time for countries to start handling their own affairs . 
Japan , in alliance with other Asian democracies , should be able to counterbalance China &apos;s growing power . 
Similarly , Europeans are rich enough to manage their own security . 
But neither Japan nor the European Union seems ready to pull its own weight , owing in part to decades of dependency on US security . 
As long as Uncle Sam continues to police the world , his children won &apos;t grow up . 
In any case , as we have seen in Iraq and Afghanistan , &quot; savage wars of peace &quot; are not always the most effective way to conduct foreign policy . 
Old-fashioned military dominance is no longer adequate to promote American interests . 
The Chinese are steadily gaining influence in Africa , not with bombers , but with money . 
Meanwhile , propping up secular dictators in the Middle East with US arms has helped to create Islamist extremism , which cannot be defeated by simplysending more drones . 
The notion promoted by Romney and his boosters that only US military power can preserve world order is deeply reactionary . 
It is a form of Cold War nostalgia - a dream of returning to a time when much of the globe was recovering from a ruinous world war and living in fear of communism . 
Obama &apos;s recognition of America &apos;s limitations is not a sign of cowardly pessimism , but of realistic wisdom . 
His relative discretion in the Middle East has allowed people there to act for themselves . 
We do not yet know what the outcome there will be , but &quot; the greatest country on earth &quot; cannot impose a solution . 
Nor should it .
