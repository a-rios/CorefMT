The Global Economy &apos;s Dialogue of the Deaf 
CHICAGO - As governments do more to try to coax the world economy out of recession , the danger of protectionism is becoming more real . 
It is emerging in ways that were unforeseen by those who founded our existing global institutions . 
Unfortunately , the discussion between countries on trade nowadays is very much a dialogue of the deaf , with countries spouting platitudes at one another , but no enforceable and verifiable commitments agreed upon . 
There is an urgent need to reform global institutions - and more dramatically than envisaged by the G-20 thus far . 
Protectionism is not just about raising tariffs on imports ; it is any government action that distorts the global production and allocation of goods , services , and capital to favor domestic producers , thereby reducing overall efficiency . 
So , for example , government pressure on multinational banks to lend domestically , or to withdraw liquidity from foreign branches , is protectionism , as are capital injections into multinational companies with the explicit requirement that domestic jobs be preserved . 
Such actions are problematic not only because they insulate inefficient forms of production , but also because foreign countries respond by adopting similar measures towards their national champions , so that everyone is worse off . 
The number of inefficient workers protected by these measures is offset by the number of efficient workers laid off by foreign multinationals responding to political pressures in their home country . 
Perhaps of greatest concern , moreover , is that the public , especially in poor countries that cannot undertake offsetting measures , will come to distrust global integration , with multinationals viewed as Trojan horses . 
In addition to explicit protectionist measures , governments now plan actions that will affect others across the globe . 
For example , the large volume of public debt that industrial countries will issue will undoubtedly raise interest rates and affect developing country governments &quot; borrowing costs . 
There is little dialogue about how industrial country issuances can be staggered to minimize the impact on global markets , and what alternatives can be developed for countries that are shut out . 
If developing countries are left to their own devices , they will conclude that they should self-insure by rebuilding foreign-exchange reserves to even higher levels , a strategy that has clearly hurt global growth . 
We need a moderate-sized representative group of leaders of the world &apos;s largest economies to meet regularly to discuss such issues , informed by an impartial secretariat that will place its analyses before the group . 
Initially , the group should only exert peer pressure on its members to comply with international responsibilities . 
But , as confidence in the group &apos;s decision-making - and in the impartiality of the secretariat - improves , members might give it some teeth , such as the ability to impose collective economic sanctions on recalcitrant members . 
The United Nations is too large to serve this purpose , and the most obvious candidate for the group , the G-20 , is not representative . 
There is , however , a representative alternative - the International Monetary and Financial Committee ( IMFC ) , a group of finance ministers and central bank governors that meets twice a year to advise the International Monetary Fund . 
While the IMFC could be shrunk ( for example , if euro-zone countries agree to a common seat ) , the real challenge is to make it a venue in which countries talk to one another rather than at one another . 
To meet this goal , some changes would be in order . 
First , the frequency of meetings should be increased , especially in times of crisis , and the level of a few of these meetings enhanced . 
So , for example , two meetings a year at the head-of-government level and quarterly meetings at the finance-minister level ( with more at the deputy-minister level ) would provide ample time for dialogue , and thus for trust-building , and would allow the commitments made by the heads of government to be monitored . 
Second , the IMF &apos;s permanent Executive Board , established in an era when travel was costly and communications difficult , and consisting of mid-level government functionaries , should be abolished . 
Important decisions should be vetted by the IMFC and others delegated to IMF management . 
Current executive directors typically do not have the authority to make commitments on their countries &quot; behalf , so their effort is often diverted to minutiae . 
And , in an attempt to preserve its turf , the Board constantly attempts to keep the IMFC from discussing anything of substance . 
Third , the obvious secretariat is the IMF . 
Unfortunately , the Fund is not regarded as being impartial , especially by countries that have been seared by its past conditionality . 
The IMF has , however , become far more neutral than it is given credit for - though it could take more steps to distance itself from its past . 
These include abolishing any region or country &apos;s right to appoint IMF management ; allowing the Fund to borrow from markets , so that it does not have to keep seeking key countries &quot; permission to expand ; eliminating any country &apos;s official veto power over major decisions ; and having its agenda set by the IMFC rather than outside bodies . 
Industrial countries should be happy that developing countries would take greater responsibility for global economic outcomes , rather than simply sulking about their lack of voice and representation . 
Developing countries , in turn , would gain greater voice , but would also be forced to contribute ideas ( and resources ) to deal with global problems . 
And maybe , just maybe , we would preserve faith in globalization .
