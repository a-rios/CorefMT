Fighting Words and False Promises 
For almost five years , the â € œwar on terrorâ €  has proved to be a false metaphor that has led to counterproductive and self-defeating policies . 
A misleading figure of speech has been applied literally to unleash a real war on several fronts , including Iraq , Gaza , Lebanon , Afghanistan , and Somalia . 
Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed , enraging millions around the world . 
Yet al-Qaeda has not been subdued , as was shown by the recent plot to blow up United States-bound commercial flights from London . 
That plot , which could have claimed more victims than the 9 / 11 attacks , was foiled by the vigilance of the British intelligence authorities . 
Clearly , it wonâ € ™ t be the last . 
Unfortunately , the American public accepted uncritically the war metaphor as the obvious response to 9 / 11 . 
Indeed , even now , when it is widely admitted that the invasion of Iraq was a blunder , the â € œwar on terrorâ €  remains the frame into which American policy has to fit . 
Most Democratic politicians , too , subscribe to it for fear of being branded as weak on defense . 
But continuing support for the war on terror makes it no less self-defeating . 
By its very nature , war creates innocent victims , and this even more likely when it is waged against terrorists , because terrorists tend to keep their whereabouts hidden . 
The deaths , injuries , and humiliation of civilians generate rage and resentment among their families and communities , in turn fueling support for terrorists . 
Moreover , terrorism is an abstraction that lumps together all political movements that use terrorist tactics . 
Al-Qaeda , Hamas , Hezbollah , and the Sunni insurrection and the Mahdi army in Iraq are very different forces , but President George W. Bushâ € ™ s global war on terror prevents us from differentiating between them and dealing with them accordingly . 
It inhibits much-needed negotiations with Iran and Syria , because they are states that support terrorist groups . 
At the same time , as the British have shown , groups like al-Qaeda are best dealt with by good intelligence . 
The war on terrorâ € ™ s emphasis on military action merely increases the terrorist threat and makes the task of the intelligence agencies more difficult . 
Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are still at large , and we need to focus on finding them if we are to prevent attacks like the one foiled in England . 
Finally , the war on terror drives a wedge between â € œusâ €  and â € œthem.â €  We are innocent victims ; they are perpetrators . 
While we seem not to notice that we also become perpetrators in the process , much of the rest of the world does notice â € &quot; a gap in perception that has severely weakened Americaâ € ™ s international credibility and standing . 
Taken together , these factors ensure that the war on terror cannot be won . 
On the contrary , an endless war waged against an unseen enemy is doing great damage not only to our authority and prestige in the world , but also to our own society . 
It has led to a dangerous extension of executive powers , tarnished our adherence to universal human rights , and inhibited the critical process that is at the heart of an open society . 
It has also cost a lot of money . 
Most importantly , the war on terror has diverted attention from other urgent tasks that require American leadership , such as finishing the job that we correctly began in Afghanistan , addressing the looming global energy crisis , and dealing with nuclear proliferation . 
With American influence at low ebb , the world is in danger of sliding into a vicious cycle of escalating violence . 
We can escape it only if we Americans repudiate the war on terror as a false metaphor . 
If we persevere on our current course , the situation will continue to deteriorate . 
It is not our will that is being tested , but our understanding of reality . 
It is painful to admit that our predicaments are brought about by our own misconceptions . 
The strength of an open society lies in its ability to recognize and correct its mistakes . 
That is the test that now confronts us .
