Putinism in Crisis 
MOSCOW - &quot; Owing to the harsh economic situation , it was decided to cut off the light at the end of the tunnel as a temporary measure . &quot; 
That is but one of the jokes making the rounds in Russia these days , as the country faces its most severe crisis in a decade . 
Having been born in the early 1960 &quot; s , my generation remembers two crises . 
The first , following the collapse of the USSR , was almost cataclysmic - nothing in the shops , the country in bankruptcy , all savings lost . 
The other affected everyone but was less severe - Russia &apos;s 1998 default , which saw a fourfold devaluation of the ruble . 
Today &apos;s crisis is acute , but there is no sense of an approaching apocalypse . 
Yet the crisis will be severe , not only because prices for the major Russian export commodities - oil , gas , and metal - have plummeted , but also because the government , which believed in its boundless force and wisdom , now seems inadequate to the challenges that Russia faces . 
Yes , Russia has enormous gold and currency reserves , but they are being depleted fast . 
They will not last for long while being spent - mostly in defense of the ruble - at the current pace . 
Most importantly , there is no one in power who can change the country &apos;s economic policies . 
Instead , Russia is ruled by &quot; yes men &quot; who are only able to agree and echo : &quot; As you say , Mr. Prime Minister ... &quot; ; 
&quot; As you wish , Mr. President ... &quot; One reason is that the country &apos;s leadership now appears to be digesting the same garbage information it feeds to the public . 
Whole regions - the Urals and Mordovia , for example - are stagnant . 
Moscow , which used to rain gold on the economy , is also suffering , because it , too , depends on natural resources , and its biggest taxpayers - Gazprom , Lukoil , Transneft - are now in bad shape . 
Indeed , Moscow &apos;s budget has lost about a quarter of its revenues . 
But , given the tastes and appetites of Moscow &apos;s mayor , you can assume that he will continue to pour what money remains into the city &apos;s building boom . 
What does not bring in money - roads , schools , hospitals , and kindergartens - will suffer . 
As in the early 1990 &quot; s , everyone is again afraid of unemployment . 
But back then , there was almost no unemployment , peaking at 12 % , because Russia &apos;s Labor Code makes firing employees hard and very costly . 
Moreover , most Russians do not object strenuously to wage cuts , reductions in working hours , and unpaid leaves . 
There is a good reason for this docility . 
Moving and buying a new apartment in a different place is almost impossible , which makes Russian workers highly immobile . 
In Soviet times , people were proud of the fact that they had only one or two jobs during their lifetime . 
Those who acted differently were referred to pejoratively as &quot; job-hoppers . &quot; 
So , today , people stay near idle factories - kind of employed , but having nothing to do and earning virtually no money . 
Occasionally the factory pays them something , but people mainly live off their own vegetable gardens . 
The outcome is widespread alcoholism , poverty , and lack of prospects . 
Yet real signs of crisis are emerging . 
Electricity consumption fell 6 % in November from a year ago , and freight traffic has decreased by 20 % . 
Even the Ministry of Economics recognizes that Russia has entered a recession that will last at least six months . 
The strange thing about today &apos;s crisis is that Russia &apos;s billionaires have been hit harder than others . 
Don &apos;t worry , Russia &apos;s oligarchs are not starving , but the fortunes of many of them have collapsed . 
In another joke making the rounds in Moscow , a billionaire borrows 300 rubles ( just over $ 10 ) from another to buy Forbes to check his place in the latest rankings of Russia &apos;s richest people . 
Indifferent to the poor , Russia &apos;s government is actively supporting its fallen oligarchs , especially those who are close to the Kremlin . 
For example , the state has granted a $ 4.2 billion loan to the aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska ( who held first place on the Forbes list before the crisis ) to pay off Western creditors . 
While experts are not sure whether Deripaska will repay the loan , the Kremlin and the oligarchs have their own ways of settling debts . 
Deripaska , who accompanied President Dmitry Medvedev on his recent trip across Latin America , appealed to Russia &apos;s rulers to study Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s &quot; New Deal &quot; in the 1930 &quot; s as a model for economic recovery . 
Roosevelt &apos;s idea of a treaty between industrialists and the authorities appeals to the Russian oligarch . 
Notably , Deripaska has suggested that the government create an &quot; aluminum stabilization fund , &quot; because the industry - his industry - is losing money and global market share . 
Of course , Vladimir Putin had already put in place a treaty between Russia &apos;s government and the country &apos;s richest men , who agreed not to comment on the actions of the state in exchange for the freedom to earn as much money as possible in any way they wanted . 
And if a well-placed official wanted to enter into a successful business , refusals were not accepted . 
Fortunately , Russians know how to survive hard times . 
I remember the late 1980 &quot; s not only for its hopes for freedom , but also for a total absence of baby food for my newborn daughter . 
Twenty years have passed . 
My daughter has grown up . 
There is enough baby food in the shops . 
But now there are no hopes for freedom . 
Moscow intellectuals debate whether the current economic crisis will bring a new wave of liberalization to Russia . 
This is the key question for me . 
With a feeling of approaching freedom , any economic crisis can be endured more easily . 
So far , that feeling remains a ghost .
