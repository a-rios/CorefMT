Bush &apos;s New Middle East 
President George W. Bush &apos;s declaration of &quot; mission accomplished &quot; in Iraq five years ago was as hubristic as his current assessment that the &quot; surge &quot; has &quot; delivered a major strategic victory in the broader war on terror &quot; is a fantasy . 
The Iraq adventure is not only the longest and most expensive war in America &apos;s history - the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz has advanced a staggering estimate of $ 3 trillion - but is also the least conclusive . 
The war has pulverized Iraqi society , dissolving it into an ethno-sectarian patchwork . 
The &quot; surge &quot; will end sooner or later , and the Iraqis , crippled by violence and corruption , will still be incapable of uniting their polity , and , with their military still unable to take over from the Americans , jihadi and inter-ethnic violence is bound to erupt again . 
As Iraqi Colonel Omar Ali , the Iraqi battalion commander in Mosul , the main focus of the insurgency today , recently put it , &quot; Without the Americans , it would be impossible for us to control Iraq . &quot; 
Wars , as Winston Churchill defined them , are always &quot; a catalogue of blunders . &quot; 
History &apos;s judgment of the Iraq war will therefore certainly dwell more on whether it has accomplished its strategic objectives of &quot; reconstructing &quot; a highly dysfunctional Middle East in America &apos;s democratic image and consolidating America &apos;s hegemonic position in the region than on its price in blood and money . 
Strategically , the war was an utter failure . 
A clear case of imperial overstretch , the war strained America &apos;s military , undermined the America &apos;s moral standing worldwide and its reputation in the Middle East , severely threatened its economy , and showed to both friends and foes the limits of American power . 
The most serious unintended consequence of the war is the emergence of a powerful Shia challenge to the West &apos;s Sunni allies in the Middle East . 
America &apos;s destruction of Iraq as a regional power handed hegemony in the Persian Gulf - whose centrality to Western interests cannot be overstated - to Iran &apos;s Shia Islamist regime on a silver platter . 
On the rubble of Saddam Hussein &apos;s dictatorship , the Americans helped create in Iraq the first Shia-dominated Arab state , which may well become subservient to Iran &apos;s regional ambitions - a calamity of historic dimensions for America &apos;s Sunni allies . 
President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad &apos;s recent state visit to Iraq conveyed to the Americans an unequivocal message : the prospects of the United States ever reaching a modicum of stability in Iraq have become dependent on Iran-aligned forces . 
America &apos;s difficulties in Iraq and beyond contributed decisively to Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions . 
The Iranians now see themselves as immune from an American attack on their nuclear installations , for America &apos;s troubles in Iraq and the growing opposition to the war in the US are a signal to them that America &apos;s strategy of pre-emptive wars has failed . 
But , however radical the Iranian regime might be , it is not suicidal . 
Hence , the threat of a nuclear Iran might consist less in its propensity to start a nuclear war with Israel than in its capacity to project its regional power effectively . 
A nuclear Iran might even threaten America &apos;s capacity to project conventional military force in the Gulf in times of crisis . 
If anything , America &apos;s debacle in Iraq has only emboldened the challengers of the status quo in the region . 
That has also been the result of Bush &apos;s ill-conceived democracy crusade in the Arab world . 
Bush discovered to his dismay that any exercise in Arab democracy is bound to usher in anti-Western Islamists , be it the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , Shia parties in Iraq , or Hamas in Palestine . 
The US eventually had to abandon its fantasies about Western-style Arab democracy , but it ironically left the Iranians carrying the torch of democracy in the region . 
After all , Iran was quick to recognize that free elections are the safest way to undermine the Middle East &apos;s pro-American regimes . 
The Iraq war also meant that America ignored the Israeli-Palestinian peace process . 
The chances that the Bush administration might be able to rally America &apos;s Sunni &quot; moderate &quot; allies in the region to help salvage an Israeli-Palestinian peace are now hostage to an Iranian-led regional axis that includes Hamas , Hezbollah , and Syria . 
All are united in their rejection of a Pax Americana in the Middle East , and all have so far shown remarkable resilience in ignoring America &apos;s pre-conditions for a dialogue . 
America &apos;s inability to inspire the peoples of the Middle East , all ruled by US-backed autocracies , is not exactly stunning news . 
What is news is that American power might also be losing its ability to intimidate them .
