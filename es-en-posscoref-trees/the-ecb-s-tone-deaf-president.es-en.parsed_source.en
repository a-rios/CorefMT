The ECB &apos;s Tone-Deaf President 
PALO ALTO - Once upon a time , European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet communicated effectively with the outside world . 
Not anymore . 
More than a few eyebrows were raised after the ECB &apos;s January Governing Council meeting , when Trichet threatened that the Bank would act &quot; preemptively &quot; if labor unions tried to embed higher energy and food prices into new contracts , risking a wage-price spiral . 
This threat took a heavy toll on the ECB &apos;s credibility , since an interest-rate hike in the midst of the most serious financial crisis in decades was obviously absurd . 
No one believed it , and the ECB not only withdrew its clumsy threat the next month , but it adopted a policy of interest-rate neutrality . 
But the announcement of this policy change at the February meeting also did not go smoothly . 
Trichet somehow garbled the Council &apos;s message in his press conference , making it sound as if the ECB wanted to shift to an easing bias instead of &quot; wait and see &quot; neutrality . 
European fixed-income markets rallied strongly as a result , only to reverse course days later when Trichet and his colleagues made it clear that the markets had &quot; misread &quot; him . 
So there was unwelcome and unneeded market volatility because Trichet couldn &apos;t get the message out straight . 
Indications that Trichet &apos;s communicative skills were slipping already had become evident last September , when the Governing Council could not follow through with the rate increase the ECB president had promised the previous month . 
For some unknown reason , Trichet is keen not to surprise markets over the very short term . 
He tips them off about what he plans to do one month in advance , using code words like &quot; vigilance &quot; to signal policy change , all the while maintaining with a straight face that the bank never &quot; pre-commits &quot; its policy stance . 
Many on the Governing Council object to this childish game of code words , because it eliminates their freedom of action once the Council commits itself to a course of action . 
The Council may then be forced to choose between doing the right thing and preserving the credibility of the ECB &apos;s communications . 
This is precisely what happened in September , when the financial crisis made it impossible for the ECB to proceed with the interest-rate hike that it had &quot; announced &quot; in August . 
Code word communications , which only work in a stable and crisis-free economic and financial environment , had damaged ECB credibility . 
Calm economic waters had given the ECB and Trichet a honeymoon until last fall . 
But , with financial markets now in turmoil and likely to stay that way , the time has come for the ECB to jettison its use of code words - a poor substitute for real central bank transparency in any case . 
What also needs to be jettisoned from the ECB &apos;s communications policy is its obsession with the short run . 
With the United States now in recession ( and the possibility of a deep recession not that remote ) , it is striking how positive ECB officials sound about the European economy : Europe &apos;s &quot; economic fundamentals are sound , &quot; the economy is &quot; robust , &quot; economic performance is &quot; just below potential , &quot; and so on . 
The ECB &apos;s policymakers are not blind , merely shortsighted . 
They fear that honesty about Europe &apos;s economic prospects over the next year or so might cause markets to force it into an unwanted rate cut now . 
So they exaggerate and tell stories about how the European economy is fundamentally different from the US economy . 
This is a major mistake , for which the ECB could pay dearly . 
Yes , today the European economy is not doing badly . 
But how long is this likely to last with the US falling into a deep slump ? 
The ECB should be preparing Europeans for what many of its own officials admit in private : Europe has not &quot; de-coupled &quot; from the US . 
On the contrary , America &apos;s current economic difficulties will hit Europe hard , but with a time lag - the best guess being 2009 . 
This is not to argue , of course , that the ECB should cut interest rates now . 
On the contrary , the Bank &apos;s current policy of fighting inflationary pressures by slower growth , a stronger euro , and the credit crunch seems just about right for the time being . 
But , after all the happy talk about the European economy , how much credibility will the ECB have if Europe eventually succumbs to recessionary pressures from abroad ? 
The ECB &apos;s independence is still a contentious political issue in Europe . 
It is more prudent that it voice concern for Europe &apos;s future economic prospects today than face a deceived and angry public tomorrow .
