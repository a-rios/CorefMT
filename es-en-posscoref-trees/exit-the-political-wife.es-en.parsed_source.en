Exit the Political Wife 
NEW YORK - France &apos;s new president , Fran√ßois Hollande , is not married to his partner , the glamorous political journalist Valerie Trierweiler , and no one seems to care . 
Germany &apos;s president , Joachim Gauck , is not married to his partner , the journalist Daniela Schadt , and no one seems to care . 
Andrew Cuomo , the governor of New York , is not married to his partner , the domesticity guru Sandra Lee , and no one seems to care . 
The list could easily be continued . 
Is the adoring political spouse - so much a part of the political landscape that she has her own iconography , from knit suits to the dreamy upward gaze at her man - receding into the past ? 
It is true that in America , at least , hay can still be made from the role of political wife . 
President Barack Obama may have experienced his first major dip in the polls - and his first real slide with women voters - when a partisan supporter , Hilary Rosen , said that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney &apos;s wife , Ann Romney , had never worked a day in her life . 
It was only 20 years ago that , during Bill Clinton &apos;s first presidential campaign , his wife Hillary &apos;s career - that is , the fact that she had one of her own - sparked wild and vituperative debate . 
There was even her absurd &quot; bake-off &quot; against First Lady Barbara Bush , in which she had to produce her own cookie recipe in order to appease a lingering cultural demand for domesticity in the role . 
Those days now seem like another age . 
In America in this election cycle , as in Europe , headlines are absent that in the past would have raised questions about an unmarried female partner , a working woman , a woman with a life of her own . 
So , what accounts for the sudden disappearance of the adoring political wife ? 
The role achieved its apotheosis with someone who , perhaps not coincidentally , was trained as an actress . 
Nancy Reagan codified the misty-eyed gaze at the rugged man , the demure demurrals , and the aggregation of power behind the throne , while claiming , in interviews , interest in nothing more serious than the White House &apos;s latest china patterns . 
&quot; I don &apos;t talk about political matters , &quot; she famously said . 
&quot; That &apos;s not my department . &quot; 
It is not surprising that this role has recently vanished . 
For starters , recent events have made it highly unappealing to any woman who has any alternative to assuming it . 
In recent years , the role of the traditional spouse has been , most visibly , to stand by ( or not ) while some excruciatingly embarrassing foible or betrayal by one &apos;s husband is publicly aired in mortifying detail . 
What woman would want to risk that role - one that has become increasingly likely in an age when surveillance by political opponents has become increasingly sophisticated and extensive ? 
Smart women may be unwilling to marry high-profile political men these days , owing to the tremendous potential downside . 
Other domestic arrangements might be easier than taking the matrimonial plunge , with its prospect of thankless exposure in the event of a scandal . 
Another reason for the not-necessarily-married and not-necessarily-full-time political spouse has to do with simple generational change : the role of adoring wife that Nancy Reagan perfected is a time-consuming profession . 
Most men who are ready to seize the reins of national power will be with women of their own generation , who are likely to have plenty to do on their own trajectory . 
We do have Clinton ( as fraught and self-involved as her journey around these issues was ) and Cherie Blair to thank for clearing away the cultural detritus . 
In a way , voters may find this evolution reassuring : when every male politician had to be equipped with a smart but underemployed full-time adoring wife , there was reason to be uneasy about the unseen influence of an unelected adviser hovering around cabinet meetings . 
Finally , what smart contemporary woman wants to take on a one-step-down role ? 
It is taxing to spend all of one &apos;s time making one &apos;s husband look good , and it is demeaning to have to feign a lack of interest in issues that doubtless were part of the attraction to one another in the first place . 
If the traditional political wife is vanishing , it is voters &quot; own fault : we set it up to be a thankless and infantilizing position . 
Why should we expect our leaders &quot; partners to perform , on a massive public stage , social roles that we no longer accept in our own lives ? 
The adoring political wife was always more caricature than character . 
Now , fortunately , she can finally retire .
