Are US Multinationals Abandoning America ? 
BERKELEY - At a recent conference in Washington , DC , former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said that US policymakers should focus on productive activities that take place in the United States and employ American workers , not on corporations that are legally registered in the US but locate production elsewhere . 
He cited research by former Labor Secretary Robert Reich , who , more than 20 years ago , warned that as US multinational companies shifted employment and production abroad , their interests were diverging from the country &apos;s economic interests . 
It is easy to agree with Summers and Reich that national economic policy should concentrate on US competitiveness , not on the well-being of particular companies . 
But their sharp distinction between the country &apos;s economic interests and the interests of US multinational companies is misleading . 
In 2009 , the latest year for which comprehensive data are available , there were just 2,226 US multinationals out of approximately 30 million businesses operating in the US . 
America &apos;s multinationals tend to be large , capital-intensive , research-intensive , and trade-intensive , and they are responsible for a substantial and disproportionate share of US economic activity . 
Indeed , in 2009 , US multinationals accounted for 23 % of value added in the American economy &apos;s private ( non-bank ) sector , along with 30 % of capital investment , 69 % of research development , 25 % of employee compensation , 20 % of employment , 51 % of exports , and 42 % of imports . 
In that year , the average compensation of the 22.2 million US workers employed by US multinationals was $ 68,118 - about 25 % higher than the economy-wide average . 
Equally important , the US operations of these firms accounted for 63 % of their global sales , 68 % of their global employment , 70 % of their global capital investment , 77 % of their total employee compensation , and 84 % of their global R D. The particularly high domestic shares for R D and compensation indicate that US multinationals have strong incentives to keep their high-wage , research-intensive activities in the US - good news for America &apos;s skilled workers and the country &apos;s capacity for innovation . 
Nonetheless , the data also reveal worrisome trends . 
First , although US multinationals &quot; shares of private-sector R D and compensation were unchanged between 1999 and 2009 , their shares of value added , capital investment , and employment declined . 
Moreover , their exports grew more slowly than total exports , their imports grew more quickly than total imports , and the multinational sector as a whole moved from a net trade surplus in 1999 to a net trade deficit in 2009 . 
Second , during the 2000 &quot; s , US multinationals expanded abroad more quickly than they did at home . 
As a result , from 1999 to 2009 , the US share of their global operations fell by roughly 7-8 percentage points in value added , capital investment , and employment , and by about 3-4 percentage points in R D and compensation . 
The shrinking domestic share of their total employment - a share that also fell by four percentage points in the 1990 &quot; s - has fueled concerns that they have been relocating jobs to their foreign subsidiaries . 
But the data tell a more complicated story . 
From 1999 to 2009 , US multinationals in manufacturing cut their US employment by 2.1 million , or 23.5 % , but increased employment in their foreign subsidiaries by only 230,000 ( 5.3 % ) - not nearly enough to explain the much larger decline in their US employment . 
Moreover , US manufacturing companies that were not multinationals slashed their employment by 3.3 million , or 52 % , during the same period . 
A growing body of research concludes that labor-saving technological change and outsourcing to foreign contract manufacturers were important factors behind the significant cyclically-adjusted decline in US manufacturing employment by both multinationals and other US companies in the 2000 &quot; s . 
So , while US multinationals may not have been shifting jobs to their foreign subsidiaries , they , like other US companies , were probably outsourcing more of their production to foreign contractors in which they held no equity stake . 
Indeed , it is possible that such arm &apos;s-length outsourcing was a significant factor behind the 84 % increase in imports by US multinationals and the 52 % increase in private-sector imports that occurred between 1999 and 2009 . 
To understand domestic and foreign employment trends by US multinationals , it is also important to look at services . 
And here the data say something else . 
From 1999 to 2009 , employment in US multinationals &quot; foreign subsidiaries increased by 2.8 million , or 36.2 % . 
But manufacturing accounted for only 8 % of this increase , while services accounted for the lion &apos;s share . 
Moreover , US multinationals in services increased their employment both at home and abroad - by almost 1.2 million workers in their domestic operations and more than twice as many in their foreign subsidiaries . 
During the 2000 &quot; s , rapid growth in emerging markets boosted business and consumer demand for many services in which US multinationals are strongly competitive . 
Since many of these services require face-to-face interaction with customers , US multinationals had to expand their foreign employment to satisfy demand in these markets . 
At the same time , their growing sales abroad boosted their US employment in such activities as advertising , design , R D , and management . 
Previous research has found that increases in employment in US multinationals &quot; foreign subsidiaries are positively correlated with increases in employment in their US operations : in other words , employment abroad complements employment at home , rather than substituting for it . 
Facts , not perceptions , should guide policymaking where multinationals are concerned . 
And the facts indicate that , despite decades of globalization , US multinationals continue to make significant contributions to US competitiveness - and to locate most of their economic activity at home , not abroad . 
What policymakers should really worry about are indications that the US may be losing its competitiveness as a location for this activity .
