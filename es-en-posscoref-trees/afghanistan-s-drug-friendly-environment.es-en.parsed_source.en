Afghanistan &apos;s Drug-Friendly Environment 
Afghanistan &apos;s President Hamid Karzai has stepped up international fundraising efforts in recent weeks , seeking a fresh package of military and reconstruction aid from the United States , together with stronger strategic guarantees . 
Underlying the opium trade issue is a security threat of another kind , one overlooked since the US-led invasion toppled the Taliban regime in 2001 , despite the grave risk it poses to Afghanistan &apos;s long-term stability , and that of the region . 
In countries like Afghanistan , where 80 % of the population lives on what they grow and many communities live far from any water source , environmental damage can be both economically devastating and politically momentous . 
That lesson should have been absorbed and understood , not least by American strategists , long before the Taliban &apos;s fall . 
After all , desertification and deforestation helped fuel the rise , two decades earlier , of the Maoist guerilla group Sendero Luminoso ( Shining Path ) in Peru . 
Sendero , which supplemented its income with drug production and timber smuggling , deliberately chose drought-weakened and deforested mountain villages as the stronghold of its insurgency . 
Similarly , the Maoist insurgency in Nepal , which has claimed 10,000 lives , exploits the desperation of mountain villagers hit by flash floods - the result of deforestation higher up . 
No Maoist group could ever gain a toehold in Afghanistan &apos;s parched Pashtun south ( these were , after all , people who , bare-knuckled , smashed the Soviets ) . 
Villagers whose crops shriveled and whose livestock died in a prolonged drought saw joining the Taliban as an economic opportunity . 
Had there been more irrigation , the Taliban &apos;s gains might have been far less impressive . 
The Taliban are now an increasingly spent force , but lack of water reinforced the logic of opium production across its former strongholds in the south . 
Irrigation has failed or is inadequate in Helmand , Uruzgan , and Kandahar - three of the top five opium-producing provinces - where indebted farmers are hooked by the economics : opium brings in eight times as much cash as wheat and uses less water . 
Without serious investment in irrigation , including construction of reservoirs to make use of the snowfall in the Hindu Kush , and in new cash crops such as saffron and rose oil , Afghanistan &apos;s drift toward narco-statehood will continue , with all the instability that this implies . 
Clear-cutting of old growth forests in the mountains bordering Pakistan may prove as problematic . 
Agriculture there has been damaged by the cutting of walnut , apricot , and mulberry trees for winter fuel , and by a failure to replant poplar , willow , and tamarisk - the trees that hold fragile meadows in place . 
These sorts of trees can be restored , given a concerted campaign and investment in nurseries to produce local varieties . 
Loss of the ancient cedar , pine , fir , and oak forests on the slopes above is another matter . 
This year &apos;s snowmelt caused landslides and flooding - a warning of more soil erosion and destruction of arable land to come ; hundreds died and thousands lost their livelihoods . 
Forestry has always been a problem in Afghanistan . 
In 1960 , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization spoke of wasteful logging practices , such as &quot; head-skidding &quot; ( in which a log is rolled downhill , ripping up plants and soil ) . 
Aerial photographers were called in , and a large budget was set aside . 
The 1976 plan called for sustainable logging and basic forest-fire control , but war intervened , costing Afghanistan half its forest cover . 
Up to 60 % of the old growth forest in Nangahar , the second largest opium-producing province , may have been cut during the war years . 
Mujahedin factions and later the Taliban exported stands of fine-grained cedar by the truckload from Nangahar and surrounding provinces to Pakistan , often in return for arms . 
Illegal logging continues today , with only ineffectual efforts made to stop it . 
At the current rate , Afghanistan &apos;s old growth forest could vanish within a decade . 
The UN acknowledges the problem but is ( rightly ) unwilling to risk sending forestry experts into a tribal region where American and allied troops venture only in armored convoys . 
A new initiative called the Green Corps includes 300 forest rangers charged with stopping illegal logging , and the ministry hopes to boost their numbers within a year . But the initiative is unlikely to have much effect . 
They have chain saws and trucks . 
They are armed and work with the backing of drug and emerald smugglers - and often of local officials . 
Environmental issues are of paramount importance in marginal countries because their impact on human survival is immediate and direct .
