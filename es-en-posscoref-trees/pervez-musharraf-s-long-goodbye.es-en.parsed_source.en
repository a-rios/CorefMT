Pervez Musharraf &apos;s Long Goodbye 
ISLAMABAD - Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan stands virtually alone today while facing the most serious challenge to his presidency : possible impeachment by the new democratically-elected government . 
The potential charges are serious : conspiring to destabilize the government that was elected last February , unlawfully removing the country &apos;s top judges in November 2007 , and failing to provide adequate security to Benazir Bhutto before her assassination last December . 
Allying himself with the Bush administration has increased his unpopularity , especially following missile attacks by the United States in Pakistan &apos;s tribal areas . 
Despite earlier differences on how to deal with Musharraf , Pakistan &apos;s leading political parties are now united against him . 
Feuding between the Pakistan People &apos;s Party , led by Benazir &apos;s widower , Asif Ali Zardari , and the Pakistan Muslim League ( N ) , led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , had given Musharraf a chance to regain some standing after his allies were defeated in the February elections . 
American reluctance to abandon Musharraf - together with prolonged electricity shortages , which made the new government appear incompetent - also raised his hopes . 
Musharraf may be counting on the army , his primary constituency , to bail him out of this crisis . 
Though such support remains a possibility , it is unlikely that the army leadership will extend itself on his behalf . 
Though a protégé of Musharraf , the army &apos;s chief of staff , General Ashfaq Kayani , is a professional soldier for whom the army &apos;s institutional interests are more important than the political interests of his former army boss . 
Kayani has repeatedly declared that the army will not interfere in political affairs , and that the parliament and constitution are supreme . 
Even if the army is tempted to step in on Musharraf &apos;s behalf , it has been chastened by political developments during the past year . 
The entire legal community arose to demand restoration of the country &apos;s judges and reinforcement of the rule of law . 
The public &apos;s demand for free elections and the resulting creation of a democratic government have forced the military to accept the public will . 
The army has also paid a heavy price for Musharraf &apos;s approach to the war on terror . 
Suicide bombers have struck repeatedly at military installations and personnel around the army &apos;s headquarters in Rawalpindi . 
An increase in deadly attacks on army convoys in the Pakistan-Afghanistan tribal areas has also pushed the army away from Musharraf . 
Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid , and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaeda in the region , its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best . 
Consequently , the prestige of the Taliban and other militant groups operating in the area has grown . 
In this context , the army , seeking to avoid sole responsibility for reverses , wants a popular government to take charge of policy . 
No such government can emerge if the elected parties are unseated . 
Nevertheless , there are signs of disagreement on important matters between the government and the army . 
The military recently blocked a government move to place Pakistan &apos;s infamous intelligence service , the ISI , under the control of the interior minister rather than the prime minister . 
Musharraf backed the military &apos;s opposition to this reform , gaining some gratitude from military commanders . 
During Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani &apos;s recent visit to the US , President Bush repeatedly said that his administration supports Pakistan &apos;s democracy , a policy since reiterated by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . 
This indicates that the US will not back Musharraf in any confrontation between him and Pakistan &apos;s democratic forces . 
Most Pakistanis hope so . 
Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy . 
Rather than trying to face down impeachment and prolonging the crisis , he should recognize that Pakistan cannot afford more instability , and that giving up honorably will bring him some respect . 
For the sake of argument , even if Musharraf faces impeachment and by some stroke of luck is saved from being thrown out of office , his future will be bleak . 
In March 2009 , the current ruling coalition will gain more seats in the Senate , and the government would almost certainly try to impeach him again . 
Moreover , any attempt by Musharraf to dislodge the government by using his constitutional authority would trigger another election , the results of which would not be much different from the vote in February . 
It is time for Musharraf &apos;s friends in the West to press him to serve his country one last time , by avoiding confrontation with his country &apos;s democratic forces and calling it quits .
