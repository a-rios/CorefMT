Turkey &apos;s Quagmire 
TEL AVIV - As the Islamic State militant group has advanced across Iraq and Syria , traditional regional alliances , long shaped by Western powers , have been upended . 
Particularly consequential is Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s struggle to reconcile his country &apos;s relationship with NATO with its image as a leading protector of Sunni Islam . 
The Turkish government &apos;s reluctance to join the United States-led coalition against the Islamic State &apos;s extremist Sunni fighters has isolated it from other Sunni Arab powers , such as Saudi Arabia , that have joined the coalition . 
Moreover , it has further alienated Turkey &apos;s Iranian allies , already estranged by Erdoğan &apos;s obsession with toppling their man in Damascus , Bashar al-Assad . 
Indeed , a key NATO member state has become the paladin of radical Islam throughout the Middle East , led by a president whose core political constituency is ingrained with anti-Western sentiment . 
Erdoğan &apos;s supporters dismiss Western campaigns against Islamist terrorism as a ploy to repress Sunnis . 
As one such supporter , Kenan Alpay , recently wrote , &quot; Turkey cannot be a part of an international system that aims to dissolve all Islamic movements from the Muslim Brotherhood to &amp; hellip ; the Taliban in Afghanistan . &quot; 
A couple of weeks later , Erdoğan himself unleashed a furious anti-Western diatribe at Istanbul &apos;s Marmara University . 
In his speech , he compared the West &apos;s interference in the Middle East today with the British officer Lawrence of Arabia &apos;s involvement in the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans during World War I , and blasted the Sykes-Picot Agreement , which has since defined the Middle East &apos;s political map . 
The similarities with the views of the Islamic State are glaring . 
In a video produced after the battle for the Mosul Dam in August , the group called for the &quot; end of Sykes-Picot , &quot; and proclaimed the need to redraw the Western-imposed political map of the Middle East . 
Erdoğan &apos;s ambition to restore Turkey &apos;s primacy in the Sunni world is driving him to collude with this challenge to the Western-devised regional order . 
Indeed , Turkey has been offering logistical support to the Islamic State , even as it has enabled the group &apos;s murderous members to massacre thousands of civilian Kurds and Yazidis in the Syrian town of Kobani on Turkey &apos;s doorstep . 
This highlights another issue on which Turkey and the Islamic State converge : the Kurds . 
Erdoğan seems to hope that , by degrading Kurdish military strength and territorial control , the Islamic State will help him to achieve his central goal of diminishing the Kurdish nationalist movement , which has long been a thorn in Turkey &apos;s side . 
But , if anything , the war against the Islamic State has bolstered the Kurdish cause . 
The Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in Iraq have already established a quasi-independent state along the border with Turkey . 
Together , these groups have emerged as the most effective force in the war against the Islamic State . 
And there is more bad news for Erdoğan . 
The perception that his true objective in supporting the Islamic State is to stem the rise of the Kurds , bolstered by his apparent indifference to the agony in Kobani , has jeopardized one of his major legacies : peace talks with the PKK . 
Erdoğan has even argued that , in Turkey &apos;s view , the PKK and the Islamic State are the same - mirroring Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu &apos;s statement that Hamas and the Islamic State were branches of the same tree . 
With such desperate and unreasonable rhetoric , Erdoğan is lending credence to accusations that the entire &quot; peace process &quot; was simply a ploy to persuade the Kurdish members of Turkey &apos;s parliament to support the constitutional changes that allowed him to move from Prime Minister to President . 
That is an entirely plausible conclusion . 
After all , Erdoğan &apos;s anti-Kurdish sentiment also shaped his policy decisions concerning regime change in Syria . 
He has long insisted on the creation of a no-fly &quot; buffer &quot; zone on the Syrian side of the border , under the pretext that it would help to address the humanitarian crisis that the civil war has engendered . 
( Turkey &apos;s Western allies continue to oppose the proposal , lest they be dragged into an all-out confrontation with the Syrian regime and its Russian and Chinese allies . ) 
Erdoğan now finds himself in a strategic quagmire . 
If his position on the Islamic State continues to waver , he will only alienate the Kurds further , which means that when the jihadists decide to encroach on Turkish territory , Turkey will have to confront them without a Kurdish alliance . 
But stronger Kurdish nationalism might not be such a bad thing for Erdoğan , who has been a vociferous advocate of the right of national self-determination beyond Turkey &apos;s immediate vicinity , such as in the case of Palestine . 
Indeed , such a move could be a welcome sign of political and moral consistency , possibly even boosting Erdoğan &apos;s leverage in devising an arrangement with Turkey &apos;s Kurds , including the PKK . 
In any case , it is time for Erdoğan to make a choice . 
He has already led Turkey into a thicket of clashes among its vital interests : its Western alliance , its regional aspirations , and the Kurdish question . 
Something will have to give - and soon .
