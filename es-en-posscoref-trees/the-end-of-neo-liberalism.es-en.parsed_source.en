The End of Neo-liberalism ? 
NEW YORK - The world has not been kind to neo-liberalism , that grab-bag of ideas based on the fundamentalist notion that markets are self-correcting , allocate resources efficiently , and serve the public interest well . 
It was this market fundamentalism that underlay Thatcherism , Reaganomics , and the so-called &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; in favor of privatization , liberalization , and independent central banks focusing single-mindedly on inflation . 
For a quarter-century , there has been a contest among developing countries , and the losers are clear : countries that pursued neo-liberal policies not only lost the growth sweepstakes ; when they did grow , the benefits accrued disproportionately to those at the top . 
Though neo-liberals do not want to admit it , their ideology also failed another test . 
No one can claim that financial markets did a stellar job in allocating resources in the late 1990 &quot; s , with 97 % of investments in fiber optics taking years to see any light . 
But at least that mistake had an unintended benefit : as costs of communication were driven down , India and China became more integrated into the global economy . 
But it is hard to see such benefits to the massive misallocation of resources to housing . The newly constructed homes built for families that could not afford them get trashed and gutted as millions of families are forced out of their homes , in some communities , government has finally stepped in - to remove the remains . 
In others , the blight spreads . 
So even those who have been model citizens , borrowing prudently and maintaining their homes , now find that markets have driven down the value of their homes beyond their worst nightmares . 
To be sure , there were some short-term benefits from the excess investment in real estate : some Americans ( perhaps only for a few months ) enjoyed the pleasures of home ownership and living in a bigger home than they otherwise would have . 
Millions will lose their life savings as they lose their homes . 
There is an increasing consensus on the prognosis : this downturn will be prolonged and widespread . 
Nor did markets prepare us well for soaring oil and food prices . 
Of course , neither sector is an example of free-market economics , but that is partly the point : free-market rhetoric has been used selectively - embraced when it serves special interests and discarded when it does not . 
Perhaps one of the few virtues of George W. Bush &apos;s administration is that the gap between rhetoric and reality is narrower than it was under Ronald Reagan . 
For all Reagan &apos;s free-trade rhetoric , he freely imposed trade restrictions , including the notorious &quot; voluntary &quot; export restraints on automobiles . 
Bush &apos;s policies have been worse , but the extent to which he has openly served America &apos;s military-industrial complex has been more naked . 
The only time that the Bush administration turned green was when it came to ethanol subsidies , whose environmental benefits are dubious . 
Distortions in the energy market ( especially through the tax system ) continue , and if Bush could have gotten away with it , matters would have been worse . 
This mixture of free-market rhetoric and government intervention has worked particularly badly for developing countries . 
They were told to stop intervening in agriculture , thereby exposing their farmers to devastating competition from the United States and Europe . 
Their farmers might have been able to compete with American and European farmers , but they could not compete with US and European Union subsidies . 
Not surprisingly , investments in agriculture in developing countries faded , and a food gap widened . 
Those who promulgated this mistaken advice do not have to worry about carrying malpractice insurance . 
The costs will be borne by those in developing countries , especially the poor . 
This year will see a large rise in poverty , especially if we measure it correctly . 
Simply put , in a world of plenty , millions in the developing world still cannot afford the minimum nutritional requirements . 
In many countries , increases in food and energy prices will have a particularly devastating effect on the poor , because these items constitute a larger share of their expenditures . 
The anger around the world is palpable . 
Speculators , not surprisingly , have borne more than a little of the wrath . 
The speculators argue : we are not the cause of the problem ; we are simply engaged in &quot; price discovery &quot; - in other words , discovering - a little late to do much about the problem this year - that there is scarcity . 
But that answer is disingenuous . 
Expectations of rising and volatile prices encourage hundreds of millions of farmers to take precautions . 
They might make more money if they hoard a little of their grain today and sell it later ; and if they do not , they won &apos;t be able to afford it if next year &apos;s crop is smaller than hoped . 
A little grain taken off the market by hundreds of millions of farmers around the world adds up . 
Defenders of market fundamentalism want to shift the blame from market failure to government failure . 
One senior Chinese official was quoted as saying that the problem was that the US government should have done more to help low-income Americans with their housing . 
But that does not change the facts : US banks mismanaged risk on a colossal scale , with global consequences , while those running these institutions have walked away with billions of dollars in compensation . 
Today , there is a mismatch between social and private returns . 
Unless they are closely aligned , the market system cannot work well . 
Neo-liberal market fundamentalism was always a political doctrine serving certain interests . 
It was never supported by economic theory . 
Learning this lesson may be the silver lining in the cloud now hanging over the global economy .
