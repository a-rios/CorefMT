Asia &apos;s Dammed Water Hegemon 
NEW DELHI - As if to highlight that Asia &apos;s biggest challenge is managing the rise of an increasingly assertive China , the Chinese government has unveiled plans to build large new dams on major rivers flowing to other countries . 
The decision by China &apos;s State Council to ride roughshod over downstream countries &quot; concerns and proceed unilaterally shows that the main issue facing Asia is not readiness to accommodate China &apos;s rise , but the need to persuade China &apos;s leaders to institutionalize cooperation with neighboring countries . 
China is at the geographical hub of Asia , sharing land or sea frontiers with 20 countries ; so , in the absence of Chinese participation , it will be impossible to establish a rules-based regional order . 
How , then , can China be brought on board ? 
This challenge is most striking on trans-boundary rivers in Asia , where China has established a hydro-supremacy unparalleled on any continent by annexing the starting places of major international rivers - the Tibetan plateau and Xinjiang - and working to reengineer cross-border flows through dams , reservoirs , barrages , irrigation networks , and other structures . 
China - the source of trans-boundary river flows to more countries than any other hydro-hegemon - has shifted the focus of its dam-building program from dam-saturated internal rivers to international rivers after having already built more large dams than the rest of the world combined . 
Most of China &apos;s dams serve multiple functions , including generating electric power and meeting manufacturing , mining , irrigation , and municipal-supply water needs . 
By ramping up the size of its dams , China now not only boasts the world &apos;s largest number of mega-dams , but is also the biggest global producer of hydropower , with an installed generating capacity of 230 gigawatts . 
The State Council , seeking to boost the country &apos;s already-large hydropower capacity by 120 gigawatts , has identified 54 new dams - in addition to the ones currently under construction - as &quot; key construction projects &quot; in the revised energy-sector plan up to 2015 . 
Most of the new dams are planned for the biodiversity-rich southwest , where natural ecosystems and indigenous cultures are increasingly threatened . 
After slowing its dam-building program in response to the serious environmental consequences of completion in 2006 of the Three Gorges Dam - the world &apos;s largest - China is now rushing to build a new generation of giant dams . 
At a time when dam building has largely petered out in the West - and run into growing grassroots opposition in other democracies like Japan and India - China will remain the nucleus of the world &apos;s mega-dam projects . 
Such projects underscore the zero-sum mentality that seemingly characterizes China &apos;s water-policy calculations . 
By embarking on a series of mega-dams in its ethnic-minority-populated borderlands , China is seeking to appropriate river waters before they cross its frontiers . 
Asia , the world &apos;s driest continent in terms of per capita freshwater availability , needs a rules-based system to manage water stress , maintain rapid economic growth , and ensure environmental sustainability . 
Yet China remains the stumbling block , refusing to enter into a water-sharing treaty with any neighbor - much less support a regional regulatory framework - because it wants to maintain its strategic grip on trans-boundary river flows . 
Among the slew of newly approved dam projects are five on the Salween , three on the Brahmaputra , and two on the Mekong . 
China has already built six mega-dams on the Mekong - the lifeblood for continental Southeast Asia - with its latest addition being the 254-meter-high Nuozhadu Dam , whose gargantuan reservoir is designed to hold nearly 22 billion cubic meters of water . 
The current dam-building plans threaten the Salween River &apos;s Grand Canyon - a UNESCO World Heritage site - and the pristine , environmentally sensitive areas through which the Brahmaputra and the Mekong flow . 
These three international rivers originate on the Tibetan plateau , whose bounteous water resources have become a magnet for Chinese planners . 
The Salween , which runs from Tibet through Yunnan Province into Burma and Thailand , will cease to be Asia &apos;s last largely free-flowing river , with work on the first project - the giant , 4,200-megawatt Songta Dam in Tibet - to begin shortly . 
The State Council &apos;s decision reverses the suspension of dam building on the Salween announced by Premier Wen Jiabao in 2004 , after an international uproar over the start of multiple megaprojects in the National Nature Reserves , adjacent to the world heritage area - a stunning canyon region through which the Salween , the Mekong , and the Jinsha flow in parallel . 
This reversal is consistent with the pattern established elsewhere , including on the Yangtze : China temporarily suspends a controversial plan after major protests in order to buy time while public passions cool , before resurrecting the same plan . 
Meanwhile , China &apos;s announcement of three new dam projects on the Brahmaputra , the main river running through northeastern India and Bangladesh , has prompted the Indian government to advise China to &quot; ensure that the interests of downstream states are not harmed &quot; by the upstream works . 
Water has emerged as a new divide in Sino-Indian relations . 
China &apos;s new focus on building dams in the southwest of the country also carries larger safety concerns . 
Indeed , Chinese scientists blamed the massive 2008 earthquake that struck the Tibetan plateau &apos;s eastern rim , killing 87,000 people , on the newly constructed Zipingpu Dam , located next to a seismic fault . 
The weight of the water impounded in the dam &apos;s massive reservoir was said to have triggered severe tectonic stresses , or what scientists call reservoir-triggered seismicity . 
China &apos;s rush to build more dams promises to roil relations across Asia , fostering greater competition for water and impeding the already slow progress toward institutionalizing regional cooperation and integration . 
If China continues on its current , heedless course , prospects for a rules-based order in Asia could perish forever .
