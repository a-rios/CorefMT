Tymoshenko &apos;s Trial and Ukraine &apos;s Future 
STOCKHOLM - There is little doubt that the embarrassing spectacle of the trial of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko - and her recent arrest on contempt charges during the proceedings - is causing great damage to her country . 
Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution in 2004 ignited the hope of a new wave of democratic reforms in the countries to the east of the European Union - a period of so-called &quot; color &quot; revolutions . 
Soon , however , those forces that feared losing power in this vast and important region began a determined counter-offensive . 
Nonetheless , Ukraine continued to stumble in a European direction , preserving important parts of the gains made in 2004 . 
The 2010 comeback of President Viktor Yanukovych was essentially the result of a free and fair election . 
It took some time , but Yanukovych &apos;s determination to press on with the European integration efforts begun by his predecessor , Viktor Yushchenko , has become increasingly clear - in the face of repeated calls ( and sometimes thinly veiled threats ) by Russia to join its customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan . 
Indeed , tension with Russia could well escalate towards the end of the year , because Ukraine &apos;s foreign-policy orientation is of clear consequence to the Kremlin . 
A democratic Ukraine with an open economy and close ties with the European Union could not fail to influence Russia &apos;s future path as well . 
Negotiations for an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , which includes far-reaching provisions for trade and regulatory integration , are well advanced , and could even be concluded this year . 
The agreement could become a model for similar agreements with other countries belonging to the EU &apos;s Eastern Partnership . 
Georgia and Moldova arelined up to start similar negotiations . 
Ukraine , reasonably enough , wants this agreement to be accompanied by an acknowledgment of its European destiny , and by clear steps towards reciprocal visa-free travel . 
Such an acknowledgement could be seen as formal recognition of the fact that membership of the EU remains a long-term option for Ukraine . 
All of that has been put in profound jeopardy by Tymoshenko &apos;s trial . 
Of course , few saints grace Ukrainian politics . 
Indeed , large-scale corruption has become entrenched in the country &apos;s political system , with various oligarchic groups often battling each other . 
The corruption networks surrounding the old Soviet pipeline system carrying gas from Siberia to Western Europe have obviously impeded Ukraine &apos;s political development . 
The rule of law must apply to all , and very few believe that any of the charges against Tymoshenko would stand the slightest chance of being upheld in a Western court . 
It all smacks of a politically directed attempt by Yanukovych and his supporters to rid themselves of a powerful opponent before the next election . 
Together with other similar cases , these trials raise serious questions about Ukraine &apos;s judicial system and law enforcement agencies . 
They provide the clearest indication yet that Ukraine , despite assurances by Yanukovych &apos;s government , is developing in the wrong direction . 
Negotiations on the EU association agreement should proceed - this is an issue of strategic importance to Europe - but subsequent steps will inevitably depend on Ukraine &apos;s commitment to the values and principles underpinning European integration . 
If the bizarre scenes now being witnessed in Kyiv continue , even Ukraine &apos;s closest friends in Europe will find it very difficult to make the case for a deepening of relations . 
Tymoshenko &apos;s trial , and how she is treated by the Ukrainian authorities , must not only be fair , but also must be seen to be fair . 
Ukraine &apos;s moves in the direction of the EU reflect its efforts to modernize and reform its economy . 
Indeed , the country could develop into a mini-China , placing massive manufacturing capacity immediately adjacent to the global economy &apos;s largest integrated market . 
And Ukraine &apos;s potential as an agricultural producer is equally impressive . 
Yet Ukraine currently is struggling to meet the conditions of its IMF assistance program . 
Determined reform policies could overcome these obstacles ; but , if Ukraine wants to proceed on the EU path , it must understand that the rule of law is a precondition for substantial integration . 
Yanukovych &apos;s government must take stock of its behavior . 
Freedom House concluded earlier this year that , since Yanukovych came to power in 2010 , Ukraine &quot; has become less democratic and , if current trends are left unchecked , may head down a path toward autocracy and kleptocracy . &quot; 
So Ukraine &apos;s future remains open . 
It is a great country that deserves a secure and prosperous future as a member of Europe &apos;s family . 
The show-trial of Yulia Tymoshenko , unfortunately , risks turning it into an estranged cousin .
