China &apos;s Resurgent Warlords 
OSAKA - Last December , the world was appalled by the North Korean government &apos;s execution of Chang Song-thaek , an uncle-in-law of the young Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and the regime &apos;s de facto second in command . 
Given Chang &apos;s pivotal role in steering North Korea &apos;s moribund economy , his execution raised serious doubts about the regime &apos;s stability - raising fears of the collapse of a dynasty that possesses weapons of mass destruction . 
Five months later , there remains no clear account of the motivation behind the decision to eliminate Chang . 
Nonetheless , a series of in-depth analyses have offered some insight into the power struggle among North Korea &apos;s leadership over the distribution of resources - including mining and other concessions - that are closely linked with the regime &apos;s foreign policy . 
Chang was known to have given priority to the regime &apos;s economic survival over the development of nuclear weapons . 
China - North Korea &apos;s sole supplier of oil and food - strongly supported this approach . 
Why would the North Korean regime jeopardize its relationship with China , the only country that could bring it down immediately , just to execute one official ? 
Assuming that Kim is rational , he must have had good reason to believe that the Chinese lifeline would be sustained , even if he executed China &apos;s favorite North Korean interlocutor . 
The only possible explanation lies in the Chinese government &apos;s struggle to control the Shenyang Military District , which borders North Korea . 
Otherwise , China may well have stopped supplying oil and food to the North after Kim &apos;s regime conducted nuclear tests , in line with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 , which imposed stringent economic sanctions against North Korea . 
China could have vetoed both resolutions , in order to avoid North Korea &apos;s collapse and the inflows of refugees that would result from it . 
The problem was that the Shenyang Military District refused to implement them . 
Even if China deliberately acted falsely - endorsing sanctions , while knowing that it would not enforce them - it would have used its support for Chang to tame Kim . 
Chang &apos;s execution was thus a straightforward challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping - a move that , under normal circumstances , would prompt China to suspend , or at least reduce , its support for North Korea . 
The fact that China did not suggests that Kim has somehow secured a lifeline directly from Shenyang . 
Bo Xilai , the former Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) chief in Chongqing who was sentenced last year to life in prison for bribery , embezzlement , and abuse of power , spent two decades in an area within Shenyang , including in stints as Mayor of Dalian City and Governor of Liaoning Province . 
Exploiting popular discontent fueled by rapidly rising inequality , Bo , who had been widely viewed as a likely candidate for a top leadership position in the Politburo Standing Committee , adopted a neo-Maoist stance that China &apos;s top leadership could not abide . 
But , as the economy slows , the regime &apos;s legitimacy is increasingly being questioned , which implies that neo-Maoism may yet make a comeback . 
Indeed , it is a stance that resonates deeply with the egalitarian tradition of the People Liberation Army ( PLA ) , as well as with its institutional interests , particularly those in the Shenyang District . 
As it stands , in order to meet China &apos;s strategic and operational needs in coping with the United States and its allies , particularly Japan , the government is emphasizing the modernization and professionalization of the navy and air force . 
To this end , it has been redirecting spending away from the army . 
Of the seven military districts , Shenyang &apos;s mechanization and mobility makes it the most potent . 
In fact , it houses four of the PLA &apos;s five mechanized army corps , with the fifth protecting China &apos;s strategic nuclear forces in Sichuan . 
In 1992 , China &apos;s government established two additional mechanized corps in the Shenyang District to deter and , if necessary , respond to tumult in North Korea . 
Given the CCP &apos;s fear of warlordism - which played a key role in China &apos;s dismemberment after the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911 - this imbalance in favor of Shenyang is odd . 
The lack of a countervailing ground force in northern China makes it vulnerable to a possible coup by Shenyang , which has already taken advantage of its influence on the North Korean regime to put pressure on China &apos;s leaders . 
This has led to speculation that Chang &apos;s execution was retaliation , endorsed by Shenyang , for Bo &apos;s arrest and the ongoing purge of his supporters , including , most recently , Zhou Yongkang , the powerful former chief of internal security . 
In other words , what appeared to be a form of political-military brinkmanship by Kim may actually be a manifestation of Shenyang &apos;s reaction to Xi &apos;s struggle to reassert Party authority over Bo &apos;s faction and its supporters in the military . 
Thus , China &apos;s ability to bring North Korea into line - a capacity that the US , in particular , believes Xi has - may in fact depend on the outcome of a more epochal struggle to bring the PLA fully under central authority . 
Twenty-five years after the military rescued the Party by crushing pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square , Xi &apos;s potential strategy for doing so - a purge of high-level military figures - may incite a major internal fight .
