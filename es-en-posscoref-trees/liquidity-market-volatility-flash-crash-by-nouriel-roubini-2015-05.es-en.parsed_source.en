The Liquidity Time Bomb 
NEW YORK - A paradox has emerged in the financial markets of the advanced economies since the 2008 global financial crisis . 
Unconventional monetary policies have created a massive overhang of liquidity . 
But a series of recent shocks suggests that macro liquidity has become linked with severe market illiquidity . 
Policy interest rates are near zero ( and sometimes below it ) in most advanced economies , and the monetary base ( money created by central banks in the form of cash and liquid commercial-bank reserves ) has soared - doubling , tripling , and , in the United States , quadrupling relative to the pre-crisis period . 
This has kept short- and long-term interest rates low ( and even negative in some cases , such as Europe and Japan ) , reduced the volatility of bond markets , and lifted many asset prices ( including equities , real estate , and fixed-income private- and public-sector bonds ) . 
And yet investors have reason to be concerned . 
Their fears started with the &quot; flash crash &quot; of May 2010 , when , in a matter of 30 minutes , major US stock indices fell by almost 10 % , before recovering rapidly . 
Then came the &quot; taper tantrum &quot; in the spring of 2013 , when US long-term interest rates shot up by 100 basis points after then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted at an end to the Fed &apos;s monthly purchases of long-term securities . 
Likewise , in October 2014 , US Treasury yields plummeted by almost 40 basis points in minutes , which statisticians argue should occur only once in three billion years . 
The latest episode came just last month , when , in the space of a few days , ten-year German bond yields went from five basis points to almost 80 . 
These events have fueled fears that , even very deep and liquid markets - such as US stocks and government bonds in the US and Germany - may not be liquid enough . 
So what accounts for the combination of macro liquidity and market illiquidity ? 
For starters , in equity markets , high-frequency traders ( HFTs ) , who use algorithmic computer programs to follow market trends , account for a larger share of transactions . 
This creates , no surprise , herding behavior . 
Indeed , trading in the US nowadays is concentrated at the beginning and the last hour of the trading day , when HFTs are most active ; for the rest of the day , markets are illiquid , with few transactions . 
A second cause lies in the fact that fixed-income assets - such as government , corporate , and emerging-market bonds - are not traded in more liquid exchanges , as stocks are . 
Instead , they are traded mostly over the counter in illiquid markets . 
Third , not only is fixed income more illiquid , but now most of these instruments - which have grown enormously in number , owing to the mushrooming issuance of private and public debts before and after the financial crisis - are held in open-ended funds that allow investors to exit overnight . 
Imagine a bank that invests in illiquid assets but allows depositors to redeem their cash overnight : if a run on these funds occurs , the need to sell the illiquid assets can push their price very low very fast , in what is effectively a fire sale . 
Fourth , before the 2008 crisis , banks were market makers in fixed-income instruments . 
They held large inventories of these assets , thus providing liquidity and smoothing excess price volatility . 
But , with new regulations punishing such trading ( via higher capital charges ) , banks and other financial institutions have reduced their market-making activity . 
So , in times of surprise that move bond prices and yields , the banks are not present to act as stabilizers . 
In short , though central banks &quot; creation of macro liquidity may keep bond yields low and reduce volatility , it has also led to crowded trades ( herding on market trends , exacerbated by HFTs ) and more investment in illiquid bond funds , while tighter regulation means that market makers are missing in action . 
As a result , when surprises occur - for example , the Fed signals an earlier-than-expected exit from zero interest rates , oil prices spike , or eurozone growth starts to pick up - the re-rating of stocks and especially bonds can be abrupt and dramatic : everyone caught in the same crowded trades needs to get out fast . 
Herding in the opposite direction occurs , but , because many investments are in illiquid funds and the traditional market makers who smoothed volatility are nowhere to be found , the sellers are forced into fire sales . 
This combination of macro liquidity and market illiquidity is a time bomb . 
So far , it has led only to volatile flash crashes and sudden changes in bond yields and stock prices . 
But , over time , the longer central banks create liquidity to suppress short-run volatility , the more they will feed price bubbles in equity , bond , and other asset markets . 
As more investors pile into overvalued , increasingly illiquid assets - such as bonds - the risk of a long-term crash increases . 
This is the paradoxical result of the policy response to the financial crisis . 
Macro liquidity is feeding booms and bubbles ; but market illiquidity will eventually trigger a bust and collapse .
