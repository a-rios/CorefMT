Greece &apos;s Aid Addiction 
NEW YORK - The ongoing Greek debt saga is tragic for many reasons , not least among them the fact that the country &apos;s relationship with its creditors is reminiscent of that between the developing world and the aid industry . 
Indeed , the succession of bailouts for Greece embodies many of the same pathologies that for decades have pervaded the development agenda - including long-term political consequences that both the financial markets and the Greek people have thus far failed to grasp . 
As in the case of other aid programs , the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars has been transferred from richer economies to a much poorer one , with negative , if unintended , consequences . 
The rescue program designed to keep Greece from crashing out of the eurozone has raised the country &apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio from 130 % at the start of the crisis in 2009 to more than 170 % today , with the International Monetary Fund predicting that the debt burden could reach 200 % of GDP in the next two years . 
This out-of-control debt spiral threatens to flatten the country &apos;s growth trajectory and worsen employment prospects . 
Like other aid recipients , Greece has become locked in a codependent relationship with its creditors , which are providing assistance in the form of de facto debt relief through subsidized loans and deferred interest payments . 
No reasonable person expects Greece ever to be able to pay off its debts , but the country has become trapped in a seemingly endless cycle of payments and bailouts - making it dependent on its donors for its very survival . 
The country &apos;s creditors , for their part , have an incentive to protect the euro and limit the geopolitical risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone . 
As a result , even when Greece fails to comply with its creditors &quot; demands - for , say , tax hikes or pension reforms - it continues to receive assistance with few penalties . 
Perversely , the worse the country performs economically , the more aid it receives . 
The long-term consequences of this cycle of dependence could be serious . 
As long as Greece &apos;s finances are propped up by international creditors , the country &apos;s policymakers will be able to abdicate their responsibility to manage the provision of public goods like education , health care , national security , and infrastructure . 
They will also face few incentives to put in place a properly functioning system to collect taxes . 
Dependence on aid undermines the implicit contract between citizens and their government , according to which politicians must keep taxpayers satisfied in order to stay in office . 
With foreign infusions of cash easing the need for tax revenues , politicians are likely to spend more time courting donors than caring for their constituents . 
The weakened connection between public services and taxes not only makes it easier for officials to cling to power , but also increases the scope for corruption and inefficiency . 
Indeed , based on the experience of aid-recipient economies in the emerging world , the Greek people may find it increasingly difficult to hold their government accountable or penalize officials for misbehavior or corruption . 
So far , the Greek crisis has been treated as a recurring emergency , rather than the structural problem that it is . 
And yet , as long as the country remains locked in a cycle of codependence with its creditors , the state of perpetual crisis is likely to persist . 
Effective aid programs have almost always been temporary in nature , working - as was the case with the Marshall Plan - through short , sharp , finite interventions . 
Open-ended commitments , like aid flows to poor developing countries , have had only limited success , at best . 
As long as Greeks view assistance as guaranteed , they will have little incentive to put their country on a path toward self-sufficiency . 
Whatever the way forward for Greece , if there is to be any hope of progress , the assistance provided by the European Union and the IMF must come to be regarded as temporary . 
Cutting the umbilical cord in a relationship of aid dependency is never easy , and there is no reason to expect that it will be any different with Greece . 
Phasing out transfers , even in a considered and systematic way , works only when the recipient is determined to put in place the measures necessary to survive without assistance . 
There are few signs that Greece is ready to walk on its own , and as long as the aid continues to flow , that is unlikely to change . 
In this sense , markets should view the Greek situation as an equilibrium , not a transition .
