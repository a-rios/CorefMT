Escaping the Refugee Crisis 
PRINCETON - In July , the number of migrants reaching the borders of the European Union passed 100,000 - the third consecutive month in which a new record was set . 
In one week in August , 21,000 migrants arrived in Greece . 
Tourists complained that the summer holiday they had planned on a Greek island was now in the midst of a refugee camp . 
Of course , the refugee crisis has far more serious implications . 
Last week , Austrian authorities found the decomposing bodies of 71 migrants in a Hungarian truck abandoned near Vienna . 
Migrants who have made it as far as France are living in tents near Calais , waiting for a chance to get to England by scrambling aboard a freight train passing through the Channel Tunnel . 
Some of them die , too , falling off trains or getting run over . 
Nevertheless , the number of refugees in Europe is still small compared to some other countries . 
Germany has received more applications for asylum than any other European country , but its six refugees per thousand inhabitants is less than a third of Turkey &apos;s 21 per thousand , which in turn is dwarfed by Lebanon &apos;s 232 per thousand . 
At the end of 2014 , UNHCR , the United Nations agency for refugees , estimated that there were 59.5 million forcibly displaced people worldwide , the highest level ever recorded . 
Of these , 1.8 million are awaiting a decision on their asylum applications , 19.5 million are refugees , and the rest are displaced inside their own countries . 
Syria , Afghanistan , and Somalia are the largest sources of refugees , but many more come from Libya , Eritrea , the Central African Republic , South Sudan , Nigeria , and the Democratic Republic of Congo . 
In Asia , the persecution of the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myanmar has contributed to a recent increase in the number of refugees . 
We cannot blame people for wishing to leave conflict-ridden , impoverished countries and find a better life elsewhere . 
In their situation , we would do the same . 
A few bold thinkers advocate a world with open borders , arguing that this would greatly boost both global GDP and average global happiness . 
( See , for example , http : / / openborders.info. ) 
Such arguments ignore our species &quot; lamentable xenophobic tendencies , evidenced all too clearly by the surge in popularity of far-right extremist political parties in Europe . 
For the foreseeable future , no government will open its borders to all who want to enter . 
Indeed , there is only movement in the opposite direction : Serbia and Hungary are building fences to keep migrants out , and there has been talk of reinstating border controls within the Schengen Area , which currently guarantees freedom of movement among 26 European countries . 
Instead of simply sealing themselves off , affluent countries should be giving much more support to less affluent countries that are supporting large numbers of refugees : Lebanon , Jordan , Ethiopia , and Pakistan are obvious examples . 
Refugees living securely in countries that border their own are less likely to attempt hazardous journeys to remote regions and more likely to return home once a conflict is resolved . 
International support for countries bearing the greatest refugee burden also makes economic sense : it costs Jordan about € 3,000 ( $ 3,350 ) to support one refugee for a year ; in Germany , the cost is at least € 12,000 . 
Ultimately , however , we need to reconsider what for many is a sacred and immutable text : the UN Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees . 
The Convention , concluded in 1951 , was originally limited to persons within Europe fleeing events before that date . 
It required the signatory countries to allow refugees who reached their territory to stay there , without discrimination or penalty for breaching immigration laws . 
Refugees were defined as those unable or unwilling to return to their country because of a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of &quot; race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or political opinion . &quot; 
In 1967 , the restrictions of time and geography were removed , making the Convention universal . 
That was a noble thing to do , but a key question was never asked : Why should someone who is able to travel to another country have priority over others who are in refugee camps and unable to travel ? 
Affluent countries have a responsibility to take refugees , and many of them can and should accept more than they do . 
The Convention has also given rise to the new , often unscrupulous , and sometimes lethal industry of people smuggling . 
If those who claim asylum in a nearby country were sent to a refugee camp , safe from persecution , and supported financially by aid from affluent countries , people smuggling - and deaths in transit - would be eliminated . 
Moreover , the incentive for economic migrants to seek asylum would be reduced , and affluent countries could fulfill their responsibility to accept more refugees from the camps , while maintaining control of their borders . 
That may not be the best solution , but it may be the most workable . 
Turning away people who manage to reach one &apos;s country is emotionally difficult , even if they are being sent to a safe haven . 
We need to give them hope , too .
