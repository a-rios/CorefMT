Europe &apos;s Short Vacation 
NEW YORK - Since last November , the European Central Bank , under its new president , Mario Draghi , has reduced its policy rates and undertaken two injections of more than € 1 trillion of liquidity into the eurozone banking system . 
This led to a temporary reduction in the financial strains confronting the debt endangered countries on the eurozone &apos;s periphery ( Greece , Spain , Portugal , Italy , and Ireland ) , sharply lowered the risk of a liquidity run in the eurozone banking system , and cut financing costs for Italy and Spain from their unsustainable levels of last fall . 
At the same time , a technical default by Greece was avoided , and the country implemented a successful - if coercive - restructuring of its public debt . 
A new fiscal compact - and new governments in Greece , Italy , and Spain - spurred hope of credible commitment to austerity and structural reform . 
And the decision to combine the eurozone &apos;s new bailout fund ( the European Stability Mechanism ) with the old one ( the European Financial Stability Facility ) significantly increased the size of the eurozone &apos;s firewall . 
But the ensuing honeymoon with the markets turned out to be brief . 
Interest-rate spreads for Italy and Spain are widening again , while borrowing costs for Portugal and Greece remained high all along . 
And , inevitably , the recession on the eurozone &apos;s periphery is deepening and moving to the core , namely France and Germany . 
Indeed , the recession will worsen throughout this year , for many reasons . 
First , front-loaded fiscal austerity - however necessary - is accelerating the contraction , as higher taxes and lower government spending and transfer payments reduce disposable income and aggregate demand . 
Moreover , as the recession deepens , resulting in even wider fiscal deficits , another round of austerity will be needed . 
And now , thanks to the fiscal compact , even the eurozone &apos;s core will be forced into front-loaded recessionary austerity . 
Moreover , while über-competitive Germany can withstand a euro at - or even stronger than - $ 1.30 , for the eurozone &apos;s periphery , where unit labor costs rose 30-40 % during the last decade , the value of the exchange rate would have to fall to parity with the US dollar to restore competitiveness and external balance . 
After all , with painful deleveraging - spending less and saving more to reduce debts - depressing domestic private and public demand , the only hope of restoring growth is an improvement in the trade balance , which requires a much weaker euro . 
Meanwhile , the credit crunch in the eurozone periphery is intensifying : thanks to the ECB long-term cheap loans , banks there don &apos;t have a liquidity problem now , but they do have a massive capital shortage . 
Faced with the difficulty of meeting their 9 % capital-ratio requirement , they will achieve the target by selling assets and contracting credit - not exactly an ideal scenario for economic recovery . 
To make matters worse , the eurozone depends on oil imports even more than the United States does , and oil prices are rising , even as the political and policy environment is deteriorating . 
France may elect a president who opposes the fiscal compact and whose policies may scare the bond markets . 
Elections in Greece - where the recession is turning into a depression - may give 40-50 % of the popular vote to parties that favor immediate default and exit from the eurozone . 
Irish voters may reject the fiscal compact in a referendum . 
And there are signs of austerity and reform fatigue both in Spain and Italy , where demonstrations , strikes , and popular resentment against painful austerity are mounting . 
Even structural reforms that will eventually increase productivity growth can be recessionary in the short run . 
Increasing labor-market flexibility by reducing the costs of shedding workers will lead - in the short run - to more layoffs in the public and private sector , exacerbating the fall in incomes and demand . 
Finally , after a good start , the ECB has now placed on hold the additional monetary stimulus that the eurozone needs . 
Indeed , ECB officials are starting to worry aloud about the rise in inflation due to the oil shock . 
The trouble is that the eurozone has an austerity strategy but no growth strategy . 
And , without that , all it has is a recession strategy that makes austerity and reform self-defeating , because , if output continues to contract , deficit and debt ratios will continue to rise to unsustainable levels . 
Moreover , the social and political backlash eventually will become overwhelming . 
That is why interest-rate spreads in the eurozone periphery are widening again now . 
The peripheral countries suffer from severe stock and flow imbalances . 
The stock imbalances include large and rising public and private debt as a share of GDP . 
The flow imbalances include a deepening recession , massive loss of external competitiveness , and the large external deficits that markets are now unwilling to finance . 
Without a much easier monetary policy and a less front-loaded mode of fiscal austerity , the euro will not weaken , external competitiveness will not be restored , and the recession will deepen . 
And , without resumption of growth - not years down the line , but in 2012 - the stock and flow imbalances will become even more unsustainable . 
More eurozone countries will be forced to restructure their debts , and eventually some will decide to exit the monetary union .
