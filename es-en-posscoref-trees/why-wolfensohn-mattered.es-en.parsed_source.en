Why Wolfensohn Mattered 
At the end of this month , James Wolfensohn &apos;s ten-year tenure as President of the World Bank comes to an end . 
Though much remains to be accomplished and consolidated , his achievements as leader of the international development community are noteworthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build . 
Perhaps Wolfensohn &apos;s most important contribution was to clarify the Bank &apos;s mission - to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world - while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the inadequacy of previous approaches . 
At one time , it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries , merely supplying more capital would solve their problems . 
Indeed , this view provided part of the rationale for the World Bank : if a shortage of funds was the problem , clearly a Bank would have to be a key part of the solution . 
In the 1980 &quot; s , there was a switch from projects to policies - structural adjustments , involving trade liberalization , privatization , and macroeconomic stabilization ( typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output . ) 
But these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth ; the countries of East Asia , which followed different policies , achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction . 
Under Wolfensohn &apos;s leadership , the Bank began to look for multifaceted strategies , framed by what he called a Comprehensive Development Framework . 
Many of the links were obvious , but had been given insufficient attention . 
Improved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if roads and harbors were lacking . 
In a malaria-infested country , mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage , as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable . 
The returns from education , too , can be increased , if more individuals live longer because of better health care . 
The Bank began to recognize that developing countries differed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resources ; there was also a knowledge gap . 
Among the success stories were India and East Asia , which invested heavily not just in primary education , but also in secondary and tertiary education , and especially in technology and science . 
This represented a major change in the Bank &apos;s approach to education , which previously focused on primary schooling . 
Wolfensohn &apos;s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking , a shift from downsizing the state to improving the State . 
Failed states , it was now acknowledged , were no less an impediment to development than were overbearing states . 
The Bank &apos;s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state , and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government . 
Under Wolfensohn , the Bank repeatedly stood up to the United States , where both the Clinton and Bush administrations might have preferred a more pliant President . 
When then US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers tried to change the Bank &apos;s Decennial report on poverty - to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income - the Bank prevailed . 
When the US tried to suppress the Bank &apos;s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime - one more consonant with the interests of developing countries - the Bank prevailed yet again . 
Both the Bush administration and the EU would undoubtedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes , which have such adverse effects on developing countries . 
It would have been helpful for Bush if the World Bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves , thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank &apos;s lending capacity . 
Changing the relationship between the Bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achievement . 
In the past , the Bank was seen as a purveyor of neoliberal orthodoxy - an approach to development whose credibility had weakened by the time Wolfensohn arrived , and whose standing has eroded further since . 
That orthodoxy often went hand in hand with the national , corporate , and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries , or so it was perceived . 
Worse , the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance , an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies , thereby enervating their effectiveness . 
When Bank research showed that conditionality did not work , the Bank under Wolfensohn moved away from it . 
The Bank began to realize that on many key issues there were legitimate disagreements among economists about the right course of action . 
Democracy requires active debate about economic policies , not the suppression of discussion or the delegation of decision-making to experts , whether domestic or foreign . 
The Bank &apos;s attempt to open the debate was not well received , by either the US Treasury or the IMF , but its influence was undeniable . 
The Fund , too , began to reduce conditionality , and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization , which previously had been central to its agenda . 
Gradually the Bank came to be perceived , at least in many quarters , as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction , not an adversary attempting to promote a Western economic agenda or ideology . 
Wolfensohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver &apos;s seat , though not everyone within the Bank was as enthusiastic about this ( or some of his other ) initiatives . 
James Wolfensohn presided over the World Bank at a time of enormous change , tumult , and opportunity , an era marked by the end of the Cold War , the postcommunist transition to market economies , and the East Asian - and then global - financial crises . 
His commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious . 
He has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up .
