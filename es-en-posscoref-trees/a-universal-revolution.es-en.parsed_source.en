A Universal Revolution 
NEW YORK - The most important contribution of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations General Assembly 60 years ago , on December 10 , 1948 , was to assert a powerful idea : rights are universal . 
Rights do not depend on membership of a particular community or citizenship in a certain state . 
Rather , because rights are universal , they are attributes of all human beings . 
Indeed , they are part of what makes us human . 
Each of us may enjoy rights . 
The limits are set by rights . 
It is , of course , possible to trace the concept of universal rights at least as far back as seventeenth-century English thinking about natural law . 
The concept was partially embraced in the French Declaration of Rights of 1789 and , to a greater extent , in Thomas Jefferson &apos;s language in the same era about &quot; inalienable rights . &quot; It also shaped the thinking of those in England who led the anti-slavery struggle of the second half of the eighteenth century , the first human rights movement . 
Yet the Universal Declaration marked a giant step forward , as the world &apos;s governments - with abstentions from the Soviet bloc states , Saudi Arabia , and apartheid South Africa , but with no votes in opposition - agreed that rights should take precedence over state power . 
One way to think about the six decades that have elapsed since the adoption of the Universal Declaration is as a struggle to implement its promises . 
For a long time , it was a losing struggle , marked especially by the spread of both communist and anti-communist tyrannies . 
Things began to change in the 1980 &quot; s with the fall of military dictatorships in Latin America and in such East Asian countries as the Philippines and South Korea , and with the growing number of people engaged in the struggle for human rights in the Soviet empire . 
By the end of the decade , many Soviet bloc regimes had collapsed . 
A factor that contributed to their demise was a shift in thinking that transformed the conflict between East and West away from one that emphasized economic systems . Instead , it was the contrast between totalitarianism and respect for rights that completely discredited the oppressive regimes linked to Moscow and helped to bring them down . 
South Africa &apos;s largely peaceful transition to a multi-racial democracy in the early 1990 &quot; s was a further advance for rights . 
But the last decade of the twentieth century was also indelibly stained by ethnic cleansing in ex-Yugoslavia and genocide in Rwanda , and during the current decade the tide has seemed to turn against the rights cause . 
Powerful states such as China and Russia are not limiting themselves to authoritarian rule at home , but are also supporting those in other countries engaged in similar practices . 
The same is true of lesser powers such as Iran and Venezuela . 
Moreover , the United States has been squandering much of its capacity to promote human rights internationally . In responding to the terrorist attacks on its own soil on September 11 , 2001 , the US has resorted to such measures as prolonged indefinite detention without charges , trials before military commissions lacking due process safeguards , and cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment of detainees , including torture . 
Other governments and intergovernmental bodies have not filled the gap left by the US . 
The European Union has been a positive force in promoting rights in those countries aspiring to membership , but it has not demonstrated a capacity to exercise influence worldwide . 
Today , the most effective force promoting human rights is global public opinion , informed and mobilized by the large and growing nongovernmental human rights movement , which , as in the recent war between Georgia and Russia , has focused international attention on violations of the laws of armed conflict that protect noncombatants . 
It has also led the way in creating international criminal tribunals that prosecute and punish those who commit war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide . 
These achievements are not stopping war , but they are reducing the number of terrible human rights violations that accompany armed conflict . 
It is , of course , dismaying that 60 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , so many governments disregard the principles that they endorsed so long ago . 
Yet without the legitimacy derived from the Universal Declaration and its role in promoting compliance , the nongovernmental human rights movement could not have developed into a global force . 
The fact that the movement continues to secure advances even in difficult times is an indication of the enduring significance of what was achieved in 1948 when the world &apos;s governments declared that rights are universal .
