An Afghan Afghanistan 
NEW DELHI - As it braces for its upcoming presidential election , Afghanistan finds itself at another critical juncture , with its unity and territorial integrity at stake after 35 years of relentless war . 
Can Afghanistan finally escape the cycle of militancy and foreign intervention that has plagued it for more than three decades ? 
Two key questions are shaping discussions about Afghanistan &apos;s post-2014 trajectory . 
The first concerns the extent to which Pakistan will interfere in Afghan affairs , such as by aiding and abetting the Afghan Taliban and its main allies , including the Haqqani network and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar &apos;s militia . 
This will depend on whether the United States conditions its generous aid to cash-strapped Pakistan on noninterference in Afghanistan . 
The second question is whether US-led NATO forces will continue to play any role in Afghanistan . 
It is no secret that US President Barack Obama wants to maintain an American military presence in the country - a reversal of his declaration in 2009 that the US sought no military bases there . 
Indeed , for several months , the US has been involved in painstaking negotiations with the Afghan government to conclude a bilateral security agreement that would enable the US to maintain bases in Afghanistan virtually indefinitely . 
What was supposed to be an endgame for Afghanistan has turned into a new game over America &apos;s basing strategy . 
But , despite having finalized the terms of the agreement , Obama failed to persuade Afghanistan &apos;s outgoing president , Hamid Karzai , to sign it . 
That means that America &apos;s role in the country can be settled only after the new Afghan president assumes office in May . 
And the election &apos;s outcome is far from certain . 
While all eight Afghan presidential candidates claim to support the security accord , this may offer little comfort to the US , given that most of the candidates have directly opposed US interests in the past - not to mention that several of them are former or current warlords . 
Moreover , there remains the question of how a residual American-led force , even if sizable , could make a difference in Afghanistan , given that a much larger force failed to secure a clear victory over the past 13 years . 
Obama has offered no answer . 
Nonetheless , there is strong bipartisan support in the US for maintaining military bases in Afghanistan , as a means of projecting hard power , and the increasingly charged confrontation between the US and Russia over Ukraine has boosted that support considerably . 
In fact , former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice explicitly linked Russia &apos;s actions in Ukraine with &quot; talk of withdrawal from Afghanistan , whether the security situation warrants it or not . &quot; 
According to Rice , anything less than a residual force of 10,000 American troops will send the message that the US is not serious about helping to stabilize Afghanistan - a message that would embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin further . 
What she does not seem to recognize is that America &apos;s deteriorating ties with Russia - a key conduit for US military supplies to Afghanistan - could undercut its basing strategy . 
The US is clearly convinced that a continued military presence in Afghanistan is in its interests . 
Afghanistan has been at war since 1979 , when Soviet forces launched a disastrous eight-year military campaign against multinational insurgent groups . 
That intervention - together with the US and Saudi governments &quot; provision of arms to Afghanistan &apos;s anti-Soviet guerrillas through Pakistan &apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence agency - helped spread militancy and terrorism , which the subsequent US military intervention has kept alive . 
As a result , Afghanistan is now at risk of becoming partitioned along ethnic and tribal lines , with militia- or warlord-controlled enclaves proliferating . 
In short , foreign involvement in Afghanistan has so far failed to produce positive results . 
That is why Afghanistan &apos;s political and security transition would be better served by focusing on three key internal factors : 
· Free and fair elections that are widely viewed as reflecting the will of the Afghan people to chart a peaceful future . 
· The ability of Karzai &apos;s successor to unite disparate ethnic and political groups - a tall order that can be filled only by a credible and widely respected leader . 
· The government &apos;s success in building up Afghanistan &apos;s multi-ethnic security forces . 
How next month &apos;s presidential election plays out is crucial . 
If threats and violence from the Taliban prevent too many Afghans from casting their vote , the legitimacy of the outcome could be questioned , possibly inciting even more turmoil , which Afghanistan &apos;s fledging security forces would struggle to contain . 
To be sure , the security forces have , so far , mostly held their ground , deterring assassinations and keeping Kabul largely secure . 
Unable to sustain the current force with reduced aid , the Afghan government will have to try to make it &quot; leaner and meaner . &quot; 
Whether it will succeed is far from certain . 
That only increases the pressure to maintain a foreign military presence , even though it is unlikely to bring peace to Afghanistan . 
In fact , the risk of becoming locked in a protracted , low-intensity war against militancy and warlordism is likely to outweigh any geopolitical advantages that the US would gain from military bases in the country . 
After all , the terrorist havens and command-and-control centers for the Afghan insurgency are located in Pakistan - undercutting the US military effort to rout the Afghan Taliban since 2001 . 
All of this points to a clear conclusion : Afghanistan &apos;s future must finally be put in the hands of Afghans . 
Outside resources should be devoted to building the governing capacity needed to keep the country united and largely peaceful .
