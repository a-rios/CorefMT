A Free Lunch for America 
BERKELEY - Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year : governments , he said , are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure . 
Summers was criticizing Europe &apos;s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances - between the EU &apos;s north and south , and between reckless banks &quot; creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly - worsen with each passing day . 
But , on the other side of the Atlantic , Americans have no reason to feel smug . 
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States , where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America &apos;s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis . 
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real ( inflation-adjusted ) interest rate of 1 % per year . 
Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $ 500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure - even unproductively , on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25 % per year . 
Suppose that - as seems to be the case - the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two . 
In that case , the $ 500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $ 1 trillion of extra output of goods and services , generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment , and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years . 
And , with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs , the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future . 
The impressive gains don &apos;t stop there . 
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $ 20 billion a year of income and social welfare . 
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $ 20 billion a year in higher production . 
And half of the extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households . 
In sum , on the benefits side of the equation : more jobs now , $ 500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years , and then a $ 40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter . 
So , what are the likely costs of an extra $ 500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years ? 
For starters , the $ 500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $ 300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity . 
So the net result would be a $ 200 billion increase in the national debt . 
American taxpayers would then have to pay $ 2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years , and then pay off or roll over the entire $ 200 billion . 
The $ 40 billion a year of higher economic activity would , however , generate roughly $ 10 billion a year in additional tax revenue . 
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due , the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt . 
In other words , taxpayers win , because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt , enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates . 
Households win , too , because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes . 
Companies win , because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure . 
The unemployed win , because some of them get jobs . 
And even bond investors win , because they get their money back , with the interest for which they contracted . 
So what is not to like ? 
Nothing . 
How , you might ask , can I say this ? 
But there are two things different about today . 
First , the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole . 
Second , bond investors are being really stupid . 
In a world in which the S P 500 has a 7 % annual earnings yield , nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1 % per year . 
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors &quot; extraordinary and irrational panic . 
They are willing to pay 6 % per year for &quot; safety . &quot; 
Right now , however , the US government can manufacture &quot; safety &quot; out of thin air merely by printing bonds . 
The government , too , would then win by pocketing that 6 % per year of value - though 30 years from now , bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios &quot; extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy .
