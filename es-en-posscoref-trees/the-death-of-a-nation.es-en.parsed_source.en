The Death of a Nation 
Belgium is in danger of falling apart . 
For more than six months , the country has been unable to form a government that is able to unite the French-speaking Walloons ( 32 % ) and Dutch-speaking Flemish ( 58 % ) . 
The Belgian monarch , Albert II , is desperately trying to stop his subjects from breaking up the state . 
Apart from the King ( who might be out of a job ) , who cares ? 
First of all , the Walloons do . 
Although the French-speaking Belgians started the European Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century , they are now living in a deprived rustbelt in need of federal subsidies , a substantial amount of which comes from taxes paid by the more prosperous , high-tech Flemish . 
A handful of right-wing Dutch dreamers care , too , for they have visions of uniting Belgian Flanders with the Dutch motherland . 
Alas for them , however , the Flemish have no such desire . 
Belgium , after all , became an independent state in 1830 , precisely in order to liberate the Catholic Flemish , as well as the Walloons , from being second-class subjects in a Protestant Dutch monarchy . 
But perhaps we should all care at least a little , for what is happening in Belgium is unusual , but not at all unique . 
The Czechs and Slovaks already parted ways , as did the different nations of Yugoslavia . 
Many Basques would like to break away from Spain , as would many Catalans . 
Corsicans would love to be rid of France , and many Scots of Britain . 
Then , of course , there is the Tibetan problem in China , the Chechen problem in Russia , and so on . 
No doubt some of these peoples would be able to survive perfectly well on their own . 
But history does seem to suggest that the cumulative effect of states falling apart is seldom positive . 
Belgian separatists like to observe that Belgium was never a natural nation-state , but an accident of history . 
But so are many , perhaps most . 
The accident in the case of Belgium is usually placed in the early nineteenth century , the result of Napoleon &apos;s European empire collapsing and Dutch arrogance . 
In fact , one might just as well set the accident in the sixteenth century , when the Habsburg Emperor hung on to the Southern Netherlands ( today &apos;s Belgium ) while the Protestant northern provinces broke away . 
Be that as it may , nation-states were often formed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to promote common interests that transcended cultural , ethnic , linguistic , or religious differences . 
This was true of Italy and Britain , no less than of Belgium . 
The problem now is that interests are no longer the same , or even held in common . 
The European Union , which actively promotes regional interests , has weakened the authority of national governments . 
Why rely on London , say the Scots , if Brussels offers greater advantages . 
When common interests no longer prevail , language and culture begin to matter more . 
One reason why Flemish Belgians resent having to prop up the Walloons with their tax money is that they regard them almost as foreigners . 
Most Flemish readers don &apos;t read French-language newspapers or novels , and vice versa . 
TV stations are separate . 
Similarly , northern Italians don &apos;t like their tax money being used to help the south , but at least they still have a language - more or less - in common , as well as TV stars , a national soccer team , and Silvio Berlusconi . 
The Belgians only have a king , who is descended , like most European monarchs , from Germans . 
Again , why should this matter ? 
Don &apos;t we feel sympathy for the Tibetans in their struggle for freedom ? 
Why shouldn &apos;t the Flemish go their own way ? 
It is one thing to support a people that is being oppressed by an authoritarian government . 
And Tibetans are actually in danger of losing their culture . 
It is more disturbing when people choose to break up nation-states because they refuse to share their wealth , for linguistic or ethnic reasons . 
If Flemish citizens don &apos;t want their taxes to go to the Walloons , what about helping out unemployed immigrants from Africa , a large chunk of which the Belgians once owned and exploited as a major source of their prosperity ? 
It should come as no surprise that the Flemish nationalist party ( Vlaams Belang ) is hostile to immigrants too . 
So the fate of Belgium should interest all Europeans , especially those who wish the Union well . 
For what is happening in Belgium now could end up happening on a continental scale . 
Why , for example , should the prosperous Germans continue to have their tax money pooled to assist the Greeks or the Portuguese ? 
It is difficult to sustain any democratic system , whether on a national or European scale , without a sense of solidarity . 
It helps if this is based on something deeper than shared interests : a language , a sense of common history , pride in cultural achievements . 
The European identity is still far from being solid . 
Perhaps the citizens of Belgium do not have enough in common anymore , and Flemish and Walloons would be better off being divorced . 
But one hopes not . 
Divorces are never painless . 
And ethnic nationalism unleashes emotions that are almost always undesirable . 
We know what happened when the twin pulls of blood and soil determined European politics before . 
Without having intended it , the EU now seems to be encouraging the very forces that postwar European unity was designed to contain .
