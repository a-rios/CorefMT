One Europe 
&quot; One Europe &quot; will be the rallying-call of the Danish Presidency of the EU , which begins this week . 
One Europe to seal the definitive unwinding of the 20 th century : its wars , divisions and tragedy . 
One Europe in pursuit of freedom , security and justice . 
One Europe with a competitive and resource-efficient economy . 
One Europe with food policies for the long-term . 
The bloodiest century in European history started in August 1914 . 
We can end it in December 2002 . 
1945 brought peace and freedom - but only to some of us . 
While Western Europe was free to construct common institutions for peace and prosperity , the Soviet Union subjugated our Central and Eastern heartland . 
The dream of One Europe was put off for almost two generations . 
The fall of the Berlin Wall revived that dream . 
The time has come to realize it . 
Preparations have been under way for almost a decade since conditions for membership were first defined in Copenhagen in 1993 . 
Candidate countries deployed immense efforts to comply with those conditions . 
Today the goal is moving from the dream world to the real world . 
We have a historic chance of closing enlargement negotiations with up to ten countries in Copenhagen in 2002 . 
The EU is determined to make it happen . 
Enlargement is the geo-strategic choice of a generation . 
It is about uniting a continent . 
It is about lasting peace and shared prosperity . 
We know we can do it . 
The evidence is the track record of the institutions and policies that enlargement will extend to new members . 
For decades they have created a zone where war has become unthinkable , where might is not right , where the poorer catch up with the richer . 
Not only is the EU one of history &apos;s greatest peace projects , it also delivers the goods in terms of higher incomes , more jobs , and greater opportunities for its citizens . 
One look at the economic transformation of , say , Ireland or Spain since they joined the Union suffices to drive home this point . 
By enlarging the EU , we will stimulate economies to grow and catch up , adding tens of millions of new consumers to the internal market . 
The resulting trade and investment will make everyone better off . 
When some object to the budgetary costs of enlargement and others to transitional periods , the prospect of stimulating growth across Europe is the perspective to keep in mind . 
One Europe . 
Lasting stability . 
Shared prosperity . 
This year provides a historic window of opportunity . 
We must seize it . 
Room for manoeuvre in the enlargement negotiations is limited . 
To make minds meet in Copenhagen , both sides must be flexible and willing to make necessary compromises . 
Not only do we owe it to the victims of the century that we lay behind , we owe it to the children to come . 
If we don &apos;t grasp the moment it will vanish . 
But some candidates will not be able to conclude negotiations this year . 
A special effort should be made in order to strengthen their prospects . 
We will also continue the efforts to bring Turkey closer to the EU . 
The door remains open to the countries of the Balkans too . 
They chose the path towards Europe as they entered the EU Stabilisation and Association Process . 
Enlargement will make Russia an even more important partner for the EU . 
The ultimate goal is far-reaching integration in a Common Economic Space . 
Together we can prevent a new silver curtain from replacing Europe &apos;s old iron curtain . 
In parallel with enlargement , we will set the stage for reinforced relations with Russia and the EU &apos;s new neighbours to the East . 
Our guiding principle always remaining : One Europe . 
While enlargement remains the EU &apos;s most important geo-strategic goal , we must shoulder our global responsibility in other ways as well . 
To this end , we must strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy . 
Not only will we strive to ensure a concerted , clear and speedy reaction to international events and crises , we will also continue the dynamic development of the EU &apos;s crisis management capabilities . 
As is well known , this will happen in close cooperation with Greece . 
The EU has a special responsibility for peace and stability in a world characterised by increasing interdependence . 
The transatlantic relationship embedded in our shared values remains the bedrock of our global efforts . 
This applies in particular to the fight against terrorism and to efforts to reduce poverty . 
We neither could nor should seek to put an end to globalization . 
But we can and should contribute to spreading the benefits of globalization more evenly . 
The World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and the new WTO round are both important means to this end . 
Today &apos;s new challenges require common solutions in the form of enhanced co-operation at European and global levels . 
To ensure the safety and security of our citizens , we must fight terrorism , trafficking in human beings and international crime . 
At the same time , we must promote fair and equal treatment of refugees and legal aliens . 
One Europe in the service of freedom , justice and security . 
We must also continually improve the capacity of the EU to deliver the goods expected by its citizens . 
A competitive , innovative and resource-efficient economy . 
One Europe with more jobs , freer competition and simpler and better rules for the benefit of companies , consumers and workers . 
One Europe able to stand its ground in the coming global competition . 
Last but not least , we need food policies for the long term . 
One Europe with the highest standards of food safety . 
One Europe that starts pondering how to steer its agricultural policy in a more market oriented and green direction . 
One Europe with a new fisheries policy that safeguards marine natural resources for the future while taking due account of the importance of the fishing industry to local communities . 
The Danish Presidency will consistently put the common interest at the forefront . 
We intend to achieve results through clear priorities and strong cooperation with all of our partners .
