The Politics of Frustration 
Does extreme poverty breed violence and ultimately revolution ? 
Many people believe that it does , and seek to explain phenomena ranging from guerrilla insurgencies to Islamist terrorism accordingly . 
But Karl Marx and Alexis de Tocqueville , the two great social analysts of the nineteenth century , knew better what makes people tick , and what makes societies change . 
Extreme poverty breeds apathy , not rebellion . 
The very poor can at most be used for occasional demonstrations of anger , but they are not the stuff from which either terrorists or revolutionaries are made . 
A far more critical group in any society are those who have begun to move forward to new conditions , but then find their path blocked . 
Their desires and ambitions are not unrealistic in the circumstances , but they are frustrated . 
Things do not move as fast as they want them to , or not at all , owing to conditions that they do not control . 
Opportunities exist , but they cannot be seized or realized . 
This group , not the desperately poor and helpless , forms the great mobilizing force of violent protest , and ultimately of major change . 
The politics of frustration has been particularly apparent in the postcommunist world during the last fifteen years . 
The heavy hand of nomenklatura rule was gone , and the vision of a new life like that in the open societies of the West seemed real . 
Yet , in fact , things initially got worse . 
The route to prosperity and freedom was not straightforward . 
On the contrary , it led through a valley of tears . 
People reacted in a variety of ways . 
Those who had the chance migrated , first to their homeland &apos;s centers of economic progress , then abroad , to countries and places where the new world could be found immediately . 
Those who stayed behind began to vote in strange ways - electing , for example , the successors of the old Communist parties that they had been glad to get rid of only a few years before . 
The European Union , for all its weaknesses , has helped the postcommunist countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe immensely . 
It made the valley of tears bearable both by offering financial and other assistance and by holding out the promise of membership and economic prosperity in the near future . 
Equally important , had the EU not supported the creation of an administrative and social infrastructure of liberty , there might well have been a more serious communist or even fascist backlash in Poland , Hungary , and elsewhere . 
While the politics of frustration was thus controlled in the postcommunist world , it broke out with a vengeance in the Islamic world . 
Here , too , the phenomenon was not new . 
With the onset of modernization , millions of people were uprooted from their traditional communities and ways of life . 
Young men , in particular , saw the prospect of a life more like that presented to them by Western television . 
But they soon discovered that realizing this prospect would require a longer and more arduous journey than they had anticipated . 
In fact , it would take at least a generation , during which much of the effort of modern life would have to be made , while the fruits of this effort would remain elusive . 
Earlier generations may have borne the burden of working and waiting more readily , but nowadays people want results here and now . 
If the benefits do not come quickly - and for most people they do not - they get restless . 
The massive migration processes that have only just begun will be the major issue of the coming decades . 
Particularly in Africa , migration will be almost the only quick route to modernization . 
Those who do not manage to get to other countries , or who fail in the countries to which they have migrated , are in a quandary . 
For them , the old world of traditional ties and customs is gone , but the new world of modernity remains out of reach . 
They are lost in a limbo of uncertainty and disappointment . 
It has been argued that this was one of the problems of &quot; belated nations &quot; like Germany a hundred years ago . 
Seductive leaders ( Hitler among them ) exploited the resulting sense of frustration . 
Whatever the value of such theories , it is evident that the frustration of young people &apos;s ambitions in modernizing countries makes them the object of preachers of hate and tempts them to leave the course of plodding progress and turn to more dramatic action . 
What we call &quot; terrorism &quot; has many causes , and one must beware of facile explanations . 
However , the politics of frustration , of ambitions raised and then thwarted , is clearly one such cause . 
It is thus also a challenge to those of us living in more fortunate circumstances . 
If we do not wish to be submerged in violence and authoritarian responses to it , international institutions must do for the modernizing world what the EU has managed to do for the postcommunist countries . 
For the world &apos;s democracies , there is no greater or more important task .
