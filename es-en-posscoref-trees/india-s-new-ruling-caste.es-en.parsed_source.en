India &apos;s New Ruling Caste 
CAMBRIDGE - The largest election in history , involving more than 700 million voters , has resulted in the victory of India &apos;s ruling alliance , led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the Indian National Congress . 
The verdict disproved gloomy predictions of a hung parliament and the further strengthening of regional parties . 
The new government will be far more stable than many of its predecessors , so the election results have elicited profound relief . 
But the fact remains that , like previous governments , the new administration will consist mostly of politicians unfit to hold ministerial office . 
While several provincial satraps have been cut down to size , new , aspiring ones have garnered significant support . 
Despite the manifest success of Indian democracy , its parliamentary system is not succeeding in giving India good governance . 
Obviously , India is not a failed state . 
Lant Pritchett of the Harvard Kennedy School has coined a new name for India : a &quot; flailing state &quot; - a state where the government &apos;s extremely competent upper echelons are unable to control its inefficient lower levels , resulting in poor performance . 
But this analysis gives credit where none is due : India &apos;s problem is its top political leadership &apos;s lack of competence . 
The inability of India &apos;s current political system to provide effective government places the country in a different category : a non-performing state . 
The idealism of India &apos;s freedom movement quickly evaporated after independence in the face of the opportunities for patronage that came with power . 
The way India &apos;s political system evolved has made politics the surest path to wealth . 
The money spent to win elections ( often including the purchase of a party &apos;s nomination ) is recouped many times over once the winner is in office . 
Half of India &apos;s legislators who stood for reelection this time around had tripled their assets in the last five years . 
Increasing corruption within governments run by the Congress party , which led India to independence and monopolized political power for decades , showed what a lucrative career politics had become . 
Given India &apos;s religious , caste , and linguistic divides , politicians saw how easily they could leverage even a small following into votes . 
Soon , Indian political parties began to break up , giving rise to a large number of regional and caste-based parties . 
Most of these parties are led by political dynasties that prize loyalty over merit . 
Because of the splintering of political parties , India has had only one single-party government and eight coalition governments in the last two decades . 
Members of the coalition governments have treated the ministries allocated to them as fiefdoms , to be milked for their benefit . 
Over time , India &apos;s government has become primarily a tool for advancing the personal interests of politicians rather than the entity responsible for running the country . 
The opportunity for personal gains through public office has made electoral politics an automatic career choice for Indian politicians &quot; progeny . 
Record numbers of sons and daughters of political leaders and millionaires ( and people with criminal backgrounds ) contested this election . 
We are seeing the formation of a new Indian caste - a caste of rulers different from India &apos;s traditional Kshatriya caste - before our very eyes . 
Like existing castes , the new caste specializes in one occupation : political office . 
Just as someone became a carpenter or a trader in an earlier era merely through birth , members of India &apos;s ruling caste now become leaders of parties , members of legislatures , and cabinet ministers solely because of their parentage . 
And , as with the older castes , there is no need for any qualification for the vocation ; birth alone is sufficient . 
Lack of vocational competence never barred Indians from remaining in their caste , and how well one performs in political office is , likewise , not a criterion for politicians to continue in positions of power . 
India &apos;s parliamentary system requires ministers to be members of the legislature . 
Party leaders select family members and other loyal followers as candidates for elections , with absolutely no consideration of their abilities to fulfill ministerial responsibilities , resulting in cabinets that are simply not capable of managing the problems confronting the country &apos;s national and state governments . 
Even with the best political leadership , governing India is no easy task . 
Successive governments staffed with unqualified politicians have failed dismally to carry out the core governmental functions of maintaining law and order , providing the basic services expected of modern societies , and promoting economic growth . 
India &apos;s high-performing private sector has so far masked the failure of the Indian state . 
In its current form , India &apos;s parliamentary system can produce only non-performing , corrupt governments . 
It rewards ambition , promotes office-at-any-cost politics , and devalues merit . 
Taking away the prize of ministerial office from elected representatives might discourage wealth-maximizing politicians from entering politics . 
It is time , therefore , for India to consider introducing a presidential system of government , which would reduce the scope for &quot; horse trading &quot; and allow the country &apos;s leader to select competent people for cabinet positions .
