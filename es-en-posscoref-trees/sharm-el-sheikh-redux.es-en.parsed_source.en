Sharm el-Sheikh Redux 
Driven by a common fear of Islamic fundamentalism , and by a false assumption that it is an illegitimate political force , the Middle East &apos;s so-called &quot; moderates &quot; have once again gathered at the Egyptian seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh , the traditional venue for emergency regional summits , to rally &quot; moderates &quot; against &quot; extremists . &quot; 
In the spring of 1996 , the so-called &quot; moderates &quot; - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Jordan &apos;s King Hussein , Yasser Arafat , and even some representatives of the Gulf dynasties - convened in Sharm el-Shekh with President Bill Clinton and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a desperate bid to block radical Islam &apos;s emergence . 
They were also expected to give an electoral boost to Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel who , severely undermined by Hamas &apos;s devastating campaign of suicide terrorism , was on the verge of electoral defeat at the hands of Benjamin Netanyahu . 
But Islamic fundamentalism remained unimpressed . 
Both its jihadist and political identity have , indeed , only gained momentum ever since . 
In October 2000 , Sharm el-Sheikh was the scene of another summit , with most of the same actors . 
This time , the call went out for an end to the Palestinian Intifada and for Israelis and Palestinians to reach a final peace agreement . 
Both objectives were endorsed by all the participants ; neither was implemented . 
As one of the players at that summit , I understand the reason for the gap between what was agreed by the &quot; moderates &quot; and the harsh realities that have driven the &quot; extremists &quot; forward . 
The only way Arafat could stop the Intifada and stem the advance of Hamas was through an especially generous peace deal from Israel . 
But such a deal became impossible precisely because the Intifada had raised Palestinian expectations to such heights that it became impossible for Israel to meet them . 
Notwithstanding Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s commendable gestures at Sharm el-Sheikh in 2007 , the summit &apos;s achievements are bound to be short-lived . 
It is unrealistic to believe that transferring to the Palestinians tax revenues that are owed to them , removing a limited number of checkpoints in the occupied West Bank , and even releasing 250 Fatah prisoners &quot; with no blood on their hands &quot; will calm the Palestinian volcano , and thus enhance Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s leadership and Fatah &apos;s edge over Hamas . 
Indeed , all indications are that Hamas might soon boost its popularity by exchanging Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit for even more prisoners , including some &quot; with blood on their hands . &quot; 
This alliance of Middle East moderates comes with a price that neither Israel nor the Bush administration seems ready to pay . 
The Israeli-American strategy of driving a wedge between Gaza and the West Bank while shunning negotiations on a peace settlement that could give Abbas the ultimate tool to undermine Hamas is a policy at war with itself . 
Moreover , no matter how critical the moderate Arabs may be of the Hamas coup in Gaza , the Arab leaders cannot afford the domestic fallout of shunning Hamas . 
Indeed , Mubarak has already called for a resumption of inter-Palestinian dialogue , which might lead to yet another attempt at a national unity government , the same kind of government with which both Israel and the US refused to do business . 
Abbas is being asked to play for high stakes - defeating Hamas and with it the cause of Islamic fundamentalism in the region - with inadequate resources . 
And , by mortgaging his entire Middle East policy to the concept of an &quot; ideological confrontation &quot; against the forces of evil , Bush is putting his entire strategy on the weary shoulders of a defeated Palestinian president without really providing him with the necessary tools . 
Worse still , by ladling money and arms to Abbas without offering him a political horizon that would deepen his support among ordinary Palestinians , while at the same time imprisoning all Hamas leaders in the West Bank , Israel and the United States are condemning Abbas to seeming a collaborator in the eyes of his people . 
Of course the Arabs are not free of blame either . 
No Israeli government will risk making a far-reaching peace offer to a Palestinian Authority whose rule is characterized by abdication and anarchy . 
Hamas &apos;s emergence as a formidable military force also reflects the Egyptians &quot; inept performance in preventing the smuggling of weapons into Gaza . 
Taming Hamas is in Egypt &apos;s interest , but it refuses to pay the price of a direct confrontation because that might lead Egyptian forces to be perceived as Israel &apos;s protectors . 
Indeed , Mubarak &apos;s strategic vision is desperately narrow . 
His role as a broker of sorts is mostly aimed at endearing himself to the US , where Congress is highly critical of his human rights record . 
On his home front , he needs to cultivate , at the lowest possible price , an image as a champion of the Palestinian cause . 
The latest Sharm el-Sheikh summit is also a message to the Saudis : Cairo , not Mecca , is the center of Middle East politics . 
Calling for Israeli concessions is perfectly legitimate , even necessary . 
But the credibility of such demands is undermined by the Arabs &quot; inability to alleviate Palestinian misery and , no less importantly , by their failure to help the Palestinians face the hard choices they will need to make if an orderly Palestinian state is ever to emerge .
