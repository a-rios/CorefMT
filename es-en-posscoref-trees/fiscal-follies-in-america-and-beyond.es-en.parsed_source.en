Fiscal Follies in America and Beyond 
Those of us who know that long-run fiscal imbalances are likely to end in disaster - high inflation , deep recession , financial crisis , or all three - scratch our heads in bemusement at the priorities of George W. Bush and his administration . 
The Social Security &quot; crisis &quot; that he wants to spend his political capital on &quot; resolving &quot; ranks no higher than third among America &apos;s fiscal problems in urgency and seriousness - and at a time when these problems have grown into a profound threat to global economic stability . 
America &apos;s gravest fiscal problem is the short- and medium-run deficit between tax revenues and spending . 
This deficit is entirely of Bush &apos;s own creation , having enacted - and now seeking to extend - tax cuts that are not cuts at all , because they merely shift the burden of fiscal consolidation onto future generations . 
The second most serious problem is the looming long-term explosion in the costs of America &apos;s health care programs . 
This is also partly Bush &apos;s doing , or , rather , not doing , as his first-term policy on health spending was to do virtually nothing to encourage efficiency and cost containment . 
Instead , he enacted a Medicare drug benefit that promises to spend enormous amounts of money for surprisingly little in the way of better health care . 
Surely a more competent administration would be worried about addressing these more severe and urgent fiscal problems . 
Let &apos;s pretend that the United States had such a government . 
What would it do ? 
Dealing with the short- and medium-run deficit would be fairly straightforward : decide how large a share of GDP the federal government should take up , set spending at that level , and set taxes so that the budget is balanced ( or so that the debt-to-GDP ratio is not growing ) over the business cycle . 
Determine whether , overall , you would rather have in the medium term a federal government that spends , say , 16 % , 20 % , or 24 % of GDP - and on what . 
What is not straightforward is how to address the imminent explosion of health-care costs . 
In fact , projections of rapidly rising Medicare and Medicaid spending in the US - and similarly rapidly-rising governmental health care expenditures elsewhere in the developed world - are not so such a problem to be solved as the side effects of an opportunity to be grasped . 
The opportunity stems from the fact that our doctors and nurses , our pharmacists and drug researchers , our biologists and biochemists are learning to do wonderful things . 
Many of these things are , and will be , expensive . 
Many of them will also be desirable : longer , healthier , and higher quality lives as we learn more about the details of human biology . 
Federal health-care spending will grow very rapidly over the next two generations because the things that health care money will be spent on will be increasingly wonderful , and increasingly valued . 
But it will be difficult to grasp fully this opportunity . 
It is highly likely that desired health expenditures will be enormous for some things and trivial for others . 
This calls for insurance . 
The problem is that private insurance markets do not work well when the buyer knows much more about what is being insured than the seller . 
Obviously , one &apos;s health is an area in which private information can be very private indeed . 
This is , of course , why state-run health-care systems came into being . 
But replacing private insurance with public insurance has its own problems : consider the parlous circumstances in which Britain &apos;s National Health System finds itself , the result of generations of politically driven underinvestment in health care . 
Moreover , the overall level of spending is likely to be large . 
That means that without ( and even with ) state-run health-care systems , the rich will be able to afford more and better care than the poor . 
To what extent do we accept a world where the non-rich die in situations in which the rich would live ? 
To what extent do we hold on to our belief that when it comes to saving lives , medical care should be distributed on the basis of patients &quot; needs , not their wealth ? 
Where and how would we tax the resources to put real weight behind egalitarian principles ? 
Sharply rising health-care costs will probably confront governments throughout the developed world with the biggest economic policy issues they will face over the next two generations . 
The Bush administration has yet to realize this , but other governments are not thinking hard enough , either . 
At best , they are seeking ways to keep health-care spending from rising , as though the genie of medical progress can be forced back into the bottle . 
Instead , governments should embrace the promise of wonderful innovations in health care , and ask how fast spending should rise , and how that rise should be financed .
