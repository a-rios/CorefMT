The Ayatollah Contemplates Compromise 
WASHINGTON , DC - The recent nuclear talks in Istanbul between the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , plus Germany , and Iran have shifted the world &apos;s focus to the possible terms of a deal when the sides meet again , probably in Baghdad on May 23 . 
So , what accounts for the new seeming willingness of Iran &apos;s leaders to reach an agreement ? 
Economic sanctions and political isolation have , of course , deeply hurt the regime , especially the Revolutionary Guards , whose leaders and industries have been directly targeted by the international community . 
But these are not the only factors . 
The regime &apos;s propaganda machine is already portraying the Istanbul talks as a triumph for the Islamic Republic and a setback for the West . 
Indeed , it is setting the stage for a significant compromise by preparing both the Iranian public and the global community . 
Iran , it must be remembered , cares as much about its image as it does about its nuclear achievements . 
A successful strategy must allow Iran to come out of talks with a smile on its face , even if it gives up the most sensitive parts of its nuclear program . 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran &apos;s Supreme Leader , has made an uncompromising nuclear policy central to his domestic authority . 
For years , he sabotaged the efforts of Iranian officials who might have cut a deal with the West because he doubted their loyalty to him . 
Those whom Khamenei did trust were not skillful enough to craft a policy of compromise that would preserve his ability to portray himself as a tough anti-American leader . 
As the talks move ahead , the United States and its allies must stick to a dual-track policy : intensifying political pressure and economic sanctions , while negotiating seriously . 
They should insist on transparency in Iran &apos;s nuclear program , while offering a gradual easing of sanctions in exchange for verifiable guarantees that the regime is not pursuing nuclear weapons . 
If things break down , the possibility of a pre-emptive military strike , whether by Israel or the US , remains an option . 
Regardless of their outcome , the new negotiations have put Khamenei in a perilous position . 
As the person in charge of Iran &apos;s nuclear policy , compromising is as dangerous for him as digging in his heels . 
This might be the last chance for Iran to change its nuclear policy , prevent military confrontation , and save the economy . 
But , for Khamenei , nuclear concessions might also undermine his monopoly over domestic politics . 
Khamenei is not a suicidal jihadist . 
In 23 years of leadership , he has avoided risky domestic and foreign policies . 
But he is not immune to miscalculation . 
In 2005 , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad relied on Khamenei &apos;s financial and political support to win the presidency . 
Today , however , Khamenei is profoundly regretful about that choice . 
Ahmadinejad disobeys his orders , tries to discredit him with the public by challenging his authority , and undermines key institutions , including the judiciary and the parliament . 
It is an open secret in Iranian political circles that Khamenei also regrets permitting volunteers of the Basij militia to attack the British embassy last November . 
The troubling conclusion to be drawn from these episodes is that even if Khamenei is not looking for a military confrontation , he may very well be susceptible to misjudgments about how to avoid one . 
Khamenei faces a deeper problem : he is not Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , his predecessor and the Islamic Republic &apos;s founding Supreme Leader , who shaped the system &apos;s identity . 
Khomeini was so self-confident , and his authority was so well consolidated , that he was not afraid to make concessions if he thought it necessary for the regime &apos;s well-being . 
Khamenei &apos;s political standing is closely associated with the current nuclear policy , and he lacks the charisma and authority necessary to move the political and religious elite toward compromise . 
For Khamenei , nuclear capability is not a goal but rather a means to force the West and its regional allies to recognize the regime &apos;s strategic interests . 
Moreover , he is convinced that the West is seeking to undermine the Islamic Republic through a &quot; soft &quot; assault of culture and politics , and that compromise on the nuclear program would lead inevitably to concessions on human rights and democracy , and eventually to regime change . 
Given this , a guarantee that the West , especially the US , is not seeking the overthrow of Iran &apos;s leaders would have to be a key component of a nuclear compromise . 
Indeed , Khamenei might well demand that this guarantee cover Farsi broadcasts , financial and political support to opposition groups , and censorship of the Internet . 
The nuclear crisis should be resolved through negotiations , before , in US President Barack Obama &apos;s phrase , the window closes . 
The problem for Khamenei - and thus for those negotiating with Iran - is that there is scant benefit for him in success . 
The biggest obstacle to a successful outcome is the contradiction of his situation : to compromise , he must save face ; but , to save face , he must not compromise .
