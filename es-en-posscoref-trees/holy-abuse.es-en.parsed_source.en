Holy Abuse 
NEW YORK - In his remarkable apology to the Catholics of Ireland ( most of that country &apos;s population ) , Pope Benedict XVI explained why he thought sinful priests were tempted to commit sexual acts with children . 
It was because of &quot; new and serious challenges to the faith arising from the rapid transformation and secularization of Irish society . 
Fast-paced social change has occurred , often adversely affecting people &apos;s traditional adherence to Catholic teaching and values . &quot; 
As we know , the abuse of children by Catholic priests did not just occur in Ireland , but in many other countries too , something the Pope preferred not to dwell upon . 
When the Pope blamed the sexual transgressions on these challenges , he may have been at least partly right , but not for the reasons he believes . 
In more traditional days , not so very long ago , when God reigned supreme and most people still turned to their priests ( or ministers , rabbis , etc . ) for moral guidance , sexual behavior was often dictated by power . 
Christians may have believed in sin . 
The values espoused by the Church were paid their due deference . 
But hypocrisy gave privileged people , including priests , a certain leeway . 
Wealthy men had mistresses , professors had affairs with students , and even the lowly village priest , a man of social and spiritual power , if not of great wealth , often enjoyed the sexual favors of a woman conveniently at hand to take care of his domestic needs . 
Such practices were accepted as facts of life , as they still are in many poor and southern countries , which might explain why the exposure of priestly abuse has taken place mostly in the north , where social change has been more rapid . 
This made the notion of celibacy , a perhaps noble , but for most people impossible ideal , bearable . 
After all , in Renaissance Italy , even the Popes had children . 
The life of women under such traditional arrangements tended to be tightly circumscribed . 
Except in small , libertine aristocratic circles , where women were able to take on extra-marital lovers too , the woman &apos;s role was to be a mother and domestic caretaker . 
Adults ruled supreme . 
To Pope Benedict , as well as other conservatives , the social and sexual revolutions of the mid-20th century may look like an orgy of libertinism . 
But this was hardly for everyone . 
It was no longer all right for men to have mistresses , teachers to have affairs with students , or priests to enjoy the favors of their chambermaids . 
People became less tolerant of hypocrisy . 
In a way , the social transformations of the 1960 &quot; s and 1970 &quot; s brought about a new form of puritanism . 
Especially in the US , a man can lose his job for making an &quot; inappropriate &quot; sexual remark , marriages collapse because of a one-night stand , and any form of sex with children is an absolute taboo . 
Perhaps because so many other taboos have fallen , the taboo on sex with children is guarded with almost fanatical zeal . 
Even fantasizing about it , in the form of pornographic cartoons , is illegal in certain countries . 
To be sure , the exploitation of children , whether sexual or otherwise , is deplorable , if only because children rarely have the power to resist . 
Even the Pope would agree that the emancipation of women , and the protection of children , are good things.Indeed , during his time as Cardinal it was part of his job to stop priests fromabusing minors.He does not appear to have been very successful . 
This may be because protecting the Church from scandal was held to be the more important task . 
Catholics have tended to be more tolerant of hypocrisy than Protestants . 
The rise of Protestantism was in part a protest against this . 
Strict Protestants make a virtue out of brutal frankness , because they believe they have a direct pipeline to God . 
Catholics confess to their priests , not to God himself . 
Sins can be dealt with , as long as proper ceremony is observed . 
This explains why the Vatican chooses to describe the pedophiliac transgression of its clergy as sins rather than crimes . 
That this will no longer do in a more emancipated world is not because secularization has destroyed people &apos;s sense of morality . 
After all , secularism never implies that abusing children is good . 
No , the problem for sinning priests is that power in democratic societies is no longer as privileged as it once was , and people are less willing to tolerate hypocrisy . 
As a result , the vow of celibacy has become an unworkable anachronism . 
There is a solution to this problem . 
Pope Benedict XVI , a strict conservative in doctrinal matters , is highly unlikely to countenance such an idea . 
If this cannot be done legally , crimes will continue to be committed against people who are least able to defend themselves .
