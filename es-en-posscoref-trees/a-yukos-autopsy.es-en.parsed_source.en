A Yukos Autopsy 
Yukos , once Russia &apos;s leading oil company and a favorite of international investors , is in its death throes . 
At what many perceived to be a rigged auction , the company &apos;s best assets were sold off to a previously unknown bidder and are now back in the hands of the Russian state . 
The shell of what remains continues to challenge the company &apos;s fate , notably in a Houston , Texas courtroom . 
What matters now is whether Russia &apos;s economy will share Yukos &apos;s fate . 
The damage to Russia &apos;s economic growth prospects from the Yukos affair may yet prove temporary , barring a repeat performance with other companies . 
One possibility is that Putin is not sincere about his aim of doubling Russia &apos;s GDP in a decade . 
Recent opinion polls suggest that this is the view of much of Russia &apos;s cynical public . 
On this view , the privatizations of the 1990 &quot; s were a scam serving only the powers that be . 
But any reversal of those privatizations - such as the effective expropriation of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his Menatep partners in Yukos - signifies not the dawn of social justice but rather a new group of bosses &quot; expropriating the expropriators , &quot; as Lenin used to say . 
A less nihilistic view is that the Yukos affair suggests above all a series of improvisations by Putin rather than a coherent agenda . 
Much evidence points to the affair originating not in a systematic nationalization project , but rather in the Kremlin &apos;s perception that Khodorkovsky aimed to use his wealth to privatize the Russian state itself . 
Such &quot; state capture &quot; occurred in Russia in the late 1990 &quot; s and to an even greater extent under the Kuchma regime in neighboring Ukraine which , ironically , Putin tried to preserve . 
Neutralizing the perceived threat from Khodorkovsky meant depriving him of the means to achieve his ambitions by separating his Menatep Group from Yukos &apos;s future cash flows . 
The massive tax claims against Yukos used for this purpose were precisely that - the means rather than the end . 
Had the goal been mere recovery of tax arrears , there would have been no need to break up the company : Yukos could have settled even these colossal liabilities on a civilized installment schedule . 
To be sure , expropriating Menatep made shares in Yukos - a company that by 2003 attracted more domestic and foreign savings than any other in Russia - virtually worthless . 
Much now depends on whether the same is true of the other major outcome , which is that Yukos &apos;s principal asset - Yuganskneftegaz - is now in state hands , while its remaining units appear doomed to nationalization . 
Is this another incidental by-product of the campaign against Khodorkovsky , or is it part of the core Kremlin agenda ? 
Nationalization certainly seems to appeal to the powerful faction comprising Putin &apos;s former KGB colleagues and associates from his native St. Petersburg , one of whom last year became the chairman of Rosneft , the wholly state-owned oil company which acquired Yuganskneftegaz . 
But if the influence of these so-called 
Even the nationalization of Yukos &apos;s assets may reflect little more than the absence of alternative buyers , given the obvious political obstacle passing those assets on to other domestic private-sector players ( i.e. , oligarchs ) , and the legal and reputational barriers to foreign investors . 
So the interpretation that best fits the facts so far is that the political aim of separating Khodorkovsky and Menatep from Yukos led in practice to nationalization , but that this was not the underlying goal . 
There is no green light for opportunistic predators in and around the Kremlin who now control Yuganskneftegaz to grab other companies &quot; assets at will . 
If so , the damage caused by the Yukos affair should be minimal . 
Yet , even on the assumption that Putin has no plans to nationalize key natural resource companies , he clearly desires strong state control over these &quot; commanding heights &quot; of the economy . 
In a speech marking the state gas monopoly Gazprom &apos;s tenth anniversary in 2003 , Putin stated his position explicitly , speaking of the company as one of the few strong geopolitical levers left to Russia after the Soviet collapse . 
Putin &apos;s geopolitical preoccupations could be accommodated by sensibly preserving state ownership of pipeline infrastructure in the hydrocarbons sector , while allowing private companies to extract , process , and sell Russia &apos;s oil and gas . 
Instead , Putin has allowed Gazprom &apos;s management to block proposals from his own government on the long overdue unbundling of the company . 
Putin has sought an economic transformation of Russia similar in kind , if not in degree , to China &apos;s boom . 
The prize is higher living standards for Russia &apos;s long-suffering people and a recovery in the country &apos;s international standing . 
Despite uncertainty about Putin &apos;s intentions , that prize is not out of reach . 
Indeed , at this point the only action more harmful than the Yukos affair would be another Yukos affair .
