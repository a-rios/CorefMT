China &apos;s Twin Challenges 
LONDON - This month &apos;s monetary-policy statement from the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) contained a striking statement : &quot; If endogenous momentum is inadequate and returns on investment low , growth must rely on debt to a great extent . &quot; 
Those words highlight the twin challenges - real and financial - that the Chinese economy now confronts . 
On the real side , China needs to achieve a transition away from unsustainable investment-led growth . 
Even before the 2008 crisis , China &apos;s investment rate of 41 % of GDP was extraordinarily high . 
But by 2010-2011 , it had soared to 47 % , as the authorities unleashed a real estate- and infrastructure-construction boom aimed at offsetting the threat to exports and employment arising from advanced-country deleveraging . 
The plan worked , with employment in construction industries rising from 28 million in 2007 to 45 million in 2013 . 
But much wasteful investment has inevitably followed : massive apartment blocks in second- and third-tier cities that will never be occupied , and heavy industrial sectors , such as steel and cement , that suffer from chronic overcapacity . 
From 2007 to 2013 , as average returns on investment fell , China &apos;s incremental capital-to-output ratio - the units of investment needed to achieve each additional unit of GDP - doubled to six . 
As China shifts to a more sustainable consumption-led growth model , it needs better investment - and less of it . 
Limited progress has already been made on this front : investment as a percentage of GDP has fallen slightly to 46 % in 2014 , while growth in retail sales and consumption have outpaced GDP growth . 
But with household consumption still below 40 % of national income , China has a long way to go . 
Moreover , there is a limit to how fast any economy can shift real resources - and especially labor - among sectors . 
Redeploying construction workers , for example , to service-sector jobs will be a slow , difficult process . 
In the meantime , China &apos;s financial challenge is intensifying . 
While the growth in services is generally desirable , the expansion of China &apos;s financial services - currently the economy &apos;s fastest-growing service industry - is generating serious risks . 
Financial services now account for around 8 % of Chinese GDP - a figure normally seen only in global financial centers , such as the United Kingdom and the United States . 
This reflects leverage far in excess of emerging-economy norms , with China &apos;s debt-to-GDP ratio up from around 130 % in 2008 to over 220 % today . 
Much of that leverage is held by local governments and companies that used it to fund investment projects - projects that are now , in many cases , earning low or negative returns . 
With operating cash flows inadequate to repay much of China &apos;s debt , borrowers have little choice but to finance payments with new credit . 
Chinese policymakers now face a dilemma . 
Constraining new credit would fuel a surge in defaults on bank loans and wealth-management products , and would cause investment to contract much more rapidly than consumption can feasibly grow . 
But allowing the credit boom to continue will create even bigger problems in the future . 
For now , China &apos;s leaders seem to be going with the &quot; more credit &quot; option , as the November PBOC statement confirmed . 
Bank lending has accelerated over recent months . 
Total debt is still growing at a faster pace than nominal GDP . 
And if current trends hold , the debt burden could amount to well over 300 % of GDP by 2020 . 
Until recently , a sanguine attitude toward this debt buildup was still possible . 
Most of the debts , it could be argued , are between different Chinese state entities - for example , owed by local-government financing vehicles or state-owned enterprises to state-owned banks . 
The Chinese authorities could therefore deal with emerging solvency problems , as they did in the late 1990s and early 2000s , with some combination of write-offs , bank recapitalization , transfers of liabilities to the central government balance sheet , and debt monetization . 
And , indeed , China has lately been employing just such an approach . 
Off-balance-sheet local-government debts are being transformed into state-guaranteed bonds , and the PBOC is lending money directly to commercial banks against the security of those bonds . 
But the larger the stock of debt already accumulated , the less convincing an optimistic story becomes . 
As the scale of bad loans becomes apparent , China &apos;s official government debt - still a relatively low 41 % of GDP in 2014 - could swell significantly . 
And financial stability could be threatened not only by the quality of bank assets , but also by the sheer scale of bank liabilities . 
If China &apos;s traditional and shadow banking systems end up holding loans amounting to more than 300 % of GDP , then somewhere there will be companies , households , and government entities with bank deposits or other fixed-income assets equal to over 270 % of GDP ( with the other 30 % or so being investments in bank equity ) . 
Those apparently low-risk claims cannot really be worth 270 % of Chinese GDP if a significant proportion are matched by loans to borrowers who cannot repay . 
One way or another , the real value of those claims will have to be reduced . 
In a closed economy with capital controls , that could be achieved through many years of financial repression , with interest rates on bank liabilities kept lower than the rate of inflation . 
That is essentially how the UK reduced its public-debt stock from around 250 % of GDP in 1945 to below 50 % by 1975 . 
But financial repression becomes less feasible the more China liberalizes its capital account , because investors can simply move their assets abroad . 
If a significant proportion of investors do so , the capital outflows will dwarf even China &apos;s massive foreign-exchange reserves , which amount to around 30-35 % of GDP . 
And if capital-account liberalization results in large foreign claims against China &apos;s financial system , Chinese asset-price and exchange-rate instability will have a far greater global impact than it does today . 
The entire world has a strong interest in China &apos;s successful management of the twin challenges its economy faces . 
But the PBOC &apos;s recent statement illustrates just how difficult that will be .
