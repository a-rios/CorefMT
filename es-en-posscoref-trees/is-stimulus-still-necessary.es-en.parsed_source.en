Is Stimulus Still Necessary ? 
LONDON - Have stimulus packages brought the world &apos;s traumatized economies back to life ? 
Or have they set the scene for inflation and big future debt burdens ? 
The answer is that they may have done both . 
The key question now concerns the order in which these outcomes occur . 
The theory behind the massive economic stimulus efforts that many governments have undertaken rests on the notion of the &quot; output gap . &quot; 
If actual output is below potential output , this means that total spending is insufficient to buy what the economy can produce . 
A stimulus is a government-engineered boost to total spending . 
Government can either spend more money itself , or try to stimulate private spending by cutting taxes or lowering interest rates . 
This will raise actual output to the level of potential output , thereby closing the output gap . 
Some economists - admittedly a diminishing number - deny that there can ever be an output gap . 
The economy , they argue , is always at full employment . 
If there are less people working today than yesterday , it is because more people have decided not to work . 
( By this reasoning , a lot of bankers have simply decided to take long holidays since last September &apos;s financial meltdown . ) 
So today &apos;s output is what people want to produce . 
Attempts to stimulate it will produce only higher prices as people spend more money on the same quantity of goods and services . 
A more sensible view is that today &apos;s economy is not producing as much as it could and that there are many more people who want to work than there are jobs available . 
But how large must such a stimulus be ? 
The United States Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates that American output will be roughly 7 % below its potential in the next two years , making this the worst recession since World War II . 
American unemployment is projected to peak at 9.4 % towards the end of 2009 or the beginning of 2010 , and is expected to remain above 7 % at least until the end of 2011 . 
The US government has pledged $ 787 billion in economic stimulus , or about 7 % of GDP . 
Superficially this looks about right to close the output gap - if it is spent this year . 
But it is in fact a three year-program . 
Some $ 584 billion is allocated for 2009-2010 , leaving perhaps $ 300 billion of extra money for this year . 
Even so , it is not clear how much of that will be spent . 
This can be illustrated by a simple example . 
Suppose the government distributes the extra cash to its citizens . 
Some of it will be saved . 
American household saving has shot up from 0 % to 5 % since the start of the recession , understandably to pay off debt . 
Another part of the extra money will be spent on imports , which does nothing to stimulate spending on US output . 
Let &apos;s subtract 20 % for these two items . 
The bad news , then , is that only 80 % of the $ 300 billion , or $ 240 billion , will be spent initially . 
The good news is that this figure is multiplied over successive rounds of spending , as one person &apos;s spending becomes another person &apos;s income , and so on . 
The value of the multiplier depends on assumptions about the size of the &quot; gap , &quot; &quot; leakages &quot; from the spending stream , and the effect of government programs on confidence . 
Estimates vary from a multiplier of about two all the way down to zero . 
A multiplier of two would generate $ 480 billion of extra spending , compared to a multiplier of one , which would generate just the initial $ 240 billion . 
If the multiplier is zero , as conservative-minded economists believe , there will be no effect on output , only on prices . 
A further source of stimulus is &quot; quantitative easing , &quot; or , more simply , printing money . 
By buying government securities , the central bank injects cash into the banking system . 
Extra hundreds of billions of dollars have been injected into banks worldwide by this means . 
But the stimulus effect of quantitative easing is far less certain than even that of fiscal stimulus . 
While the policy caused credit spreads to narrow and bond market liquidity to improve , many banks have been using the extra money to rebuild their balance sheets ( the equivalent of increased household savings ) rather than lending it to businesses and individuals . 
Several conclusions can be drawn from what admittedly are back of the envelope calculations . 
The first is that stimulus packages around the world arrested the slide into depression , and may have started a modest recovery . 
Second , it is too early to scale down the stimulus , as Japan and the US seem ready to do . 
As one British official said ahead of the G-20 summit in Italy in July , &quot; We should start to prepare exit strategies , but we should start implementing them only when &#91; we &#93; are sure &#91; we &#93; have got a recovery that is entrenched and self-sustaining , and I don &apos;t think anyone is saying we are at that point yet . &quot; 
Third , existing policy , even if maintained , will not produce self-sustaining recovery . 
At best , it offers the prospect of several years more of sub-normal activity . 
A double round of stimulus packages is needed to counteract the real prospect of a double-dip recession . 
The time to start worrying about inflation is when the recovery is entrenched . 
To pay back the debt without strain , we need a booming economy . Talk of government spending cuts is premature . 
&quot; A boom not a slump is the right time for austerity at the Treasury &quot; said Keynes . 
He was right .
