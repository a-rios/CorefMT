China &apos;s Not-So-New Not-So-Normal 
HONG KONG - I just spent a week in China , where I participated in the Boao Asia Forum , a conference similar to the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos . 
The topic of my panel was what President Xi Jinping has called the Chinese economy &apos;s &quot; new normal &quot; : an era of relatively slower growth , following three decades of double-digit economic expansion . 
But what strikes me most about China &apos;s economy is how remarkable it is . 
Indeed , its performance continues to astound me . 
Though it undoubtedly faces plenty of challenges , the key question is how likely they are to bring down the economy . 
Of the four BRIC countries - Brazil , Russia , India , and China - Xi &apos;s is the only one that has met my expectations for growth so far this decade . 
From 2011 to 2014 , the Chinese economy grew at an average annual rate of 8 % per year . 
If it continues to grow by around 7 % for the rest of the decade , as the authorities and many observers expect , it will achieve an average pace of expansion of 7.5 % , in line with my projections . 
The phrase &quot; new normal &quot; is a clever bit of messaging by China &apos;s leaders , who must explain to the country &apos;s 1.4 billion citizens why the economy will no longer be growing by 10 % a year . 
I was in China primarily in my role as Chair of the British government &apos;s Review on Antimicrobial Resistance ; but I also sought opportunities to speak to people about the challenges facing the economy . 
Many international observers have been worried about the country &apos;s oversupply of housing and the related credit boom , making me wonder whether I have been overly sanguine about these risks . 
To be sure , the housing market is in the doldrums . 
Some builders will experience problems with credit , and so might some local authorities . 
Foreign observers frequently speculate that the Chinese authorities may be deliberately overstating the economy &apos;s strength . 
After spending a few days in Beijing , it was abundantly clear that China is undergoing a boom in Internet use , including as a consumer platform . 
Online commerce is offsetting some of the other weaker areas of the economy , and its full impact might actually be underreported in official statistics . 
I do worry that the government is not moving fast enough to grant the country &apos;s millions of migrant workers official residency in the cities where they work and live . 
Migrants &quot; continued lack of access to public services might prevent a large rise in consumption as a share of GDP . 
Another area of serious concern is health care . 
At some stage , the central government will have to address the sector &apos;s deficiencies . 
I learned about one example when discussing antimicrobial resistance , to which the government has responded by attempting to limit the quantity of antibiotics a patient may take . 
The trouble is that many hospitals and doctors rely on drug sales for a large portion of their revenues , which creates a powerful incentive to find ways to circumvent the rules . 
But it must also be noted that China &apos;s carbon dioxide emissions declined notably in 2014 , offering what is perhaps the first tangible evidence that the country is making some progress on this front . 
Energy efficiency and renewable energy use are both on the rise as well . 
Most important , despite the challenges it faces , the Chinese economy &apos;s singular importance is now widely recognized . 
The country &apos;s recent international achievements - particular its ability to secure the backing of the United Kingdom , France , Germany , and Italy for its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in the face of opposition from the United States - imply a high degree of confidence that China will address its problems successfully . 
China &apos;s role within existing international financial institutions could change this year as well . 
In December , the International Monetary Fund will consider adding renminbi to the basket of currencies that comprise the Fund &apos;s unit of account , known as Special Drawing Rights , alongside the US dollar , the euro , the British pound , and the Japanese yen . 
And the world is still waiting for the US to implement a 2010 reform of the IMF that would strengthen the position of China and other large emerging economies in the institution &apos;s governance structure . 
Given the significance of the Chinese economy , continuing to leave this unaddressed is anything but normal .
