Is the European Dream Over ? 
NEW YORK - Were the Euroskeptics right after all ? 
Was the dream of a unified Europe - inspired by fears of another European war , and sustained by the idealistic hope that nation-states were obsolete and would give way to good Europeans - a utopian dead end ? 
On the surface , Europe &apos;s current crisis , which some people predict will tear apart the European Union , is financial . 
Jacques Delors , one of the architects of the euro , now claims that his idea for a single currency was good , but that its &quot; execution &quot; was flawed , because the weaker countries were allowed to borrow too much . 
But , fundamentally , the crisis is political . 
When sovereign states have their own currencies , citizens are willing to see their tax money go to the weakest regions . 
That is an expression of national solidarity , a sense that a country &apos;s citizens belong together and are prepared , in a crisis , to sacrifice their own interests for the collective good . 
Even in nation-states , this is not always self-evident . 
Many northern Italians fail to see why they should pay for the poorer south . 
Affluent Flemings in Belgium resent having to support unemployed Walloons . 
Still , on the whole , just as citizens of democratic states tolerate the government that won the last election , they usually accept economic solidarity as a part of nationhood . 
Since the EU is neither a nation-state nor a democracy , there is no &quot; European people &quot; to see the EU through hard times . 
Rich Germans and Dutch do not want to pay for the economic mess in which the Greeks , Portuguese , or Spanish now find themselves . 
Instead of showing solidarity , they moralize , as though all of the problems in Mediterranean Europe were the result of native laziness or its citizens &quot; corrupt nature . 
As a result , the moralizers risk bringing the common roof down on Europe &apos;s head , and confronting the nationalist dangers that the EU was created to prevent . 
Europe must be fixed politically as much as financially . 
It is a clich√© , but nonetheless true , that the EU suffers from a &quot; democratic deficit . &quot; 
The problem is that democracy has only ever worked within nation-states . 
Nation-states need not be monocultural , or even monolingual . 
Think of Switzerland or India . 
They need not be democracies , either : China , Vietnam , and Cuba come to mind . 
But democracy does require that citizens have a sense of belonging . 
Is this possible in a supra-national body like the EU ? 
If the answer is no , it may be best to restore the sovereignty of individual European nation-states , give up on the common currency , and abandon a dream that is threatening to become a nightmare . 
This is what the more radical Euroskeptics in Britain think , having never shared the EU dream to begin with . 
It is easy to dismiss this as typical British chauvinism - the insular attitude of a people living in splendid isolation . 
Still , even if disbanding Europe were possible , it would come at enormous cost . 
Abandoning the euro , for example , would cripple the continent &apos;s banking system , affecting both Germany and the affluent north and the distressed countries in the south . 
Quite apart from the financial aspects , there would be a real danger of throwing away the benefits that the EU has brought , particularly in terms of Europe &apos;s standing in the world . 
In isolation , European countries would have limited global significance . 
As a union , Europe still matters a great deal . 
The alternative to dismantling the EU is to strengthen it - to pool the debt and create a European treasury . 
But that depends upon a vital sense of European solidarity , which will not come from anthems , flags , or other gimmicks devised by bureaucrats in Brussels . 
For starters , affluent northern Europeans have to be convinced that it is in their interest to strengthen the EU , as it certainly is . 
After all , they have benefited most from the euro , which has enabled them to export cheaply to southern Europeans . 
While it is up to national politicians to make this case , the EU &apos;s governing institutions in Brussels , Luxembourg , and Strasbourg also have to be brought closer to European citizens . 
Perhaps Europeans could vote for members of the European Commission , with candidates campaigning in other countries , rather than just in their own . 
Perhaps Europeans could elect a president . 
Democracy may seem like a mad dream in a community of 27 nation-states , and perhaps it is . 
And who can say what is possible ? 
Consider football clubs , the modern world &apos;s most insular , even tribal institutions . 
Thirty years ago , who would have imagined that two of London &apos;s most popular clubs - Arsenal and Chelsea - would have a French and a Portuguese coach , respectively , and players from Spain , France , Portugal , Brazil , Russia , Serbia , the Czech Republic , Poland , Mexico , Ghana , South Korea , Holland , Belgium , Nigeria , and the Ivory Coast ? 
Oh , yes , they have one or two from Britain , too .
