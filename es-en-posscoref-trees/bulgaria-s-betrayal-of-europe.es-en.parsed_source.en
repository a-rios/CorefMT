Bulgaria &apos;s Betrayal of Europe 
When Bulgaria joined the European Union this past January , I believed that my country had finally left its repressive past behind . 
But the recent arrest and threatened deportation of Annadurdy Hadjiev , a dissident from Turkmenistan who sought refuge here , suggests that some things never change . 
If Bulgaria sends this man back to Turkmenistan - where he faces certain torture and the threat of a brutal death - our claim to be part of a democratic , rights-respecting Europe will ring hollow . 
Moreover , the EU &apos;s image as a defender of human rights around the world will be tarnished by its inability to hold member states to its own standards . 
The case evokes memories of the days when the KGB &apos;s influence was pervasive , and dissidents across Eastern Europe and Soviet lands like Turkmenistan lived in fear . 
Hadjiev and his family fled to Europe in 2001 , escaping one of the world &apos;s most repressive regimes : the absolutist dictatorship of the late Saparmurat Niyazov , who fancied himself &quot; Turkmenbashi , &quot; the father of all Turkmen . 
A former deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan and later an outspoken critic of Turkmenbashi &apos;s government , Hadjiev , a senior member of the exiled Watan ( Republican ) Party , received &quot; humanitarian parole &quot; - a protected category of individuals that falls short of refugee status - when he reached Bulgaria . 
But he has since been subjected to violent and arbitrary reprisals in this supposed &quot; safe haven . &quot; 
And , although Turkmenbashi died in December , his successor , Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov , has continued to imprison dissidents , stifle freedom of expression , and scoff at democracy , as February &apos;s rigged elections demonstrate . 
Bulgaria &apos;s persecution adds to the anguish and injustice that has befallen Hadjiev and his family . 
Last summer , Hadjiev &apos;s brother and sister were arrested after they collaborated on a documentary about Turkmenistan , and were tried on trumped-up charges of weapons possession . 
After a perfunctory closed trial , they were sentenced to seven and six years in prison , respectively . 
Hadjiev &apos;s sister , the journalist Olgusapar Muradova , died in prison several weeks later , under suspicious circumstances . 
Her grown children , who viewed her body , told relatives that they saw evidence of torture and that she had sustained a severe head wound . 
Hadjiev &apos;s two other brothers , as well as his brother-in-law and sister-in-law , have been in Turkmenistan &apos;s notorious penal gulag since 2002 , when they were sentenced to lengthy prison terms . 
In 2003 , his elderly father-in-law was beaten by police agents and forced into internal exile . 
On February 19 , the Bulgarian police arrested Hadjiev with the intention of sending him back to face a similar fate . 
This is not the first time he has been arrested in Bulgaria . 
After first arriving , Hadjiev and his wife were arbitrarily detained for several days , leaving their 13-year-old daughter without supervision or access to her parents . 
The police arrested Hadjiev again in 2002 , in response to a Turkmen extradition request . 
After the Varna City Court refused to allow the extradition , ruling that the charges were politically motivated , the Bulgarian authorities threatened to deport him . 
In 2005 , the Hadjievs &quot; car was incinerated by a bomb-like device , which they interpreted as a warning to cease their defiant challenges to the Bulgarian - and possibly Turkmen - authorities . 
The authorities that arrested Hadjiev last month made no pretense of due process : they offered no arrest warrant , and have repeatedly refused him access to relatives and legal counsel . 
Moreover , the court has given no explanation of why it is allowing him to be tried on the same embezzlement charge that of which he was acquitted in 2003 . 
Fortunately , Hadjiev is a fighter . 
Since the beginning of his travails in Bulgaria , he has battled the system by confronting the government branches responsible for his persecution . 
Indeed , he has sued the very prosecutor in whose hands his current extradition now rests - an act that may be jeopardizing his right to a fair hearing . 
My government has pledged its willingness live up to the legal norms that are the core of European Union membership . 
By releasing Annadurdy Hadjiev from jail and withdrawing the threat of extradition to Turkmenistan , Bulgaria would unequivocally demonstrate its commitment to fulfilling its obligations . 
By granting him political asylum , we can make a resounding statement that authoritarian regimes can no longer count on support within Europe &apos;s borders .
