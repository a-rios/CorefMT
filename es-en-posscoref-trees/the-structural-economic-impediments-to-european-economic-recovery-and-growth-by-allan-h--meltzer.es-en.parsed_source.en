What &apos;s Stopping Europe ? 
PITTSBURGH - On a recent visit to Greece , French President Fran√ßois Hollande declared that Europe &apos;s decline was over , and urged French companies to invest in Greece . 
Bad advice . 
French production costs are high , but Greek costs are higher . 
Despite the considerable decline in Greek ( and Italian and Spanish ) real GDP since 2007 , adjustment is far from complete . 
In fact , one would be hard pressed to find broad agreement with Hollande &apos;s assessment anywhere in Europe . 
Before the recent Italian election , financial markets showed signs of optimism , encouraged by the European Central Bank &apos;s policy of guaranteeing eurozone members &quot; sovereign debt , expanding its balance sheet , and lowering interest rates . 
Bondholders gain when interest rates fall . 
But unemployment continues to rise in the heavily indebted southern countries , and output continues to lag behind Germany and other northern European countries . 
The main reason for the lag is not simply low demand or large debts . 
There is a vast difference between unit labor costs - real wages adjusted for productivity - in Germany and in the heavily indebted southern countries . 
When the crisis began , production costs in Greece were about 30 % higher than in Germany , so Greece exported very little and imported very much . 
Production costs in other heavily indebted countries were 20-25 % higher than in Germany . 
Growth will not resume until production costs in the indebted countries decline , which requires either a substantial permanent increase in productivity , a reduction in real wages , or both . 
While some adjustment has occurred , much of the change is not permanent . 
Austerity reduced the number of employed workers , particularly those with low skill and productivity levels . 
But gains in measured productivity growth from this source are not permanent changes , so a large part of the reported reductions in unit labor costs are temporary . 
Indeed , major cost differences remain . 
In Greece , the private sector has been forced to adjust , but the government failed to keep its promise to reduce public employment . 
Large reductions in public-sector wages brought down the primary deficit , but employment maintenance lowers productivity , raises costs , and delays adjustment . 
In Italy , former Prime Minister Mario Monti &apos;s government undertook some reforms , but it continued to support unions and corporate monopolies . 
And Italy &apos;s parliament rejected many of Monti &apos;s proposed reductions in government spending . 
Labor and many product markets remain closed , despite the urgent need to increase competition , lower production costs , and raise productivity . 
After five years of slow growth and rising unemployment , voters in other indebted countries , like Italians ( and French voters before them ) , are likely to reject additional spending reductions , tax increases , and further painful deregulation . 
Europe must find more effective policies that reduce production costs toward German levels . 
The economic historian Harold James has shown in a recent book that in the 40 years of negotiations leading to the adoption of the common currency , all of the problems that now beset the eurozone were discussed repeatedly . 
Everyone understood that a monetary union would require enforceable fiscal and banking rules . 
Before the euro , countries adjusted misaligned production costs by devaluing or revaluing their exchange rates . 
It works slowly , if at all , because elected governments are often reluctant to implement their promises - and may not feel bound by those of previous administrations ( especially if they owe their victory to voters who are rebelling against years of belt-tightening with no evidence of renewed growth ) . 
Likewise , politicians are reluctant to adopt deregulation that eliminates state-sponsored special privileges . 
For several years , I have proposed a policy that combines growth and fiscal rectitude . 
Let all the heavily indebted southern European countries jointly agree to join a weak euro , which would float against the stronger northern euro . 
When the weak euro reduces the heavily indebted countries &quot; production costs by 20-25 % , they can rejoin the &quot; hard &quot; euro if they accept fiscal reforms that are subject to approval by the European Commission ( and thus by the hard-euro creditor countries ) . 
After all , a fixed exchange rate or common currency requires limits on fiscal independence . 
The Italian election sent a message . 
After five years of decline in living standards , voters oppose more austerity and further retrenchment without growth . 
Restoring a sound euro requires policies that revive growth , rein in government spending , and reform heavily regulated labor and product markets .
