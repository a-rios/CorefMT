A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health 
NEW YORK - Every year , millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases , especially in poor countries . 
In many cases , lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced , but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them . 
And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines , because so little of the world &apos;s valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor . 
This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected . 
The good news is that there are now opportunities for change , most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectual-property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs . 
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today . 
One is that they are very costly ; or , more accurately , the price charged for them is very high , though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount . 
Second , drug development is geared toward maximizing profit , not social benefit , which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare . 
Because the poor have so little money to spend , drug companies , under current arrangements , have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them . 
It doesn &apos;t have to be this way . 
Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development . 
But , in the United States , it is actually the government that finances most health-related research and development - directly , through public support ( National Institutes of Health , National Science Foundation ) , and indirectly , through public purchases of medicine , both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs . 
Even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market ; most individuals &quot; purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance . 
Government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good . 
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness . 
Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available . 
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles : when one is used to light another , it does not diminish the light of the first . 
On the contrary , everything becomes brighter . 
Yet , in America and most of the world , drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited . 
That is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create , which encourages them to hoard their knowledge , lest they help a competitor . 
While this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable , it allows drug companies to drive up prices , and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns . 
In the health-care sector , it may be more profitable to devote research to a &quot; me-too &quot; drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference . 
The patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation , because , while the most important input into any research is prior ideas , the patent system encourages secrecy . 
A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund . 
With a prize system , innovators are rewarded for new knowledge , but they do not retain a monopoly on its use . 
That way , the power of competitive markets can ensure that , once a drug is developed , it is made available at the lowest possible price - not at an inflated monopoly price . 
Fortunately , some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach . 
The Prize Fund for HIV / AIDS Act , a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders , is just such an initiative . 
His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research , which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing . 
But , globally , our innovation system needs much bigger changes . 
The WHO &apos;s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial . 
This spring , the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill , but on a global level . 
Importantly , the report , &quot; Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries , &quot; recommends a comprehensive approach , including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries &quot; health needs ; international coordination of health-care priorities and implementation ; and a global observatory that would monitor where needs are greatest . 
In late May , the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly - a moment of hope for public health around the world . 
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics . 
It is , in many cases , a matter of life and death . 
It is therefore essential to de-link R D incentives from drug prices , and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge . 
For America , the Sanders bill marks important progress . 
For the world , the WHO &apos;s recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care , and , more broadly , to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization . 
We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by .
