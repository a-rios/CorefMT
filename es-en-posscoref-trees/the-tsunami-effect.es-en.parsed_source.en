The Tsunami Effect 
The extraordinary international response to the tsunamis that devastated South Asia is a remarkable political phenomenon . 
Though it is too soon to predict all the effects , some good consequences are already evident , as are some that are troublesome and others whose impact will play out over time . 
One useful consequence is that wealthy countries &quot; low levels of assistance to those less fortunate has gained wider attention . 
Plainly , the comment by Jan Egeland , the United Nations official in charge of humanitarian assistance , calling the West &quot; stingy , &quot; hit home , especially in the United States . 
At that point , the Bush administration had committed a measly $ 35 million in aid . 
While condemning Egeland &apos;s comment , Bush quickly multiplied America &apos;s commitment ten-fold . 
In addition , he enlisted former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton to lead a private fundraising effort . 
This neatly fit a standard response to criticism of the level of American assistance : that private philanthropy exceeds government aid . 
Depending on what monies are included , this is true , although the British , Dutch , Germans , French , and other Europeans are also generous donors , despite lacking the tax benefits that encourage private philanthropy in the US . 
Moreover , like official US assistance , a relatively small share of American private philanthropy ordinarily goes to the poorest countries . 
In contrast , the countries that are most generous - Norway , Sweden , Denmark , the Netherlands , and tiny Luxemburg - give proportionately far more than American governmental and private assistance combined , and the lion &apos;s share of their aid goes to the world &apos;s most impoverished countries . 
In the wake of the tsunamis , it seems possible that the US and other wealthy countries will rethink their assistance programs and , possibly , step up their aid to those most in need . 
Perhaps even some oil-rich governments will be embarrassed by attention to their miserliness in doling out assistance . 
But there is also a risk that assistance for tsunami victims is diverting aid from disasters that are of a more chronic character or that are less amenable to sensational media coverage . 
In announcing that it would stop accepting donations for the victims of the tsunami after collecting € 40 million for that purpose , Médecins Sans Frontières noted its urgent need for funds for such man-made catastrophes as Darfur in Sudan and for the Democratic Republic of Congo . 
In recent years , many more people have died in the conflicts in Sudan and Congo than were killed by the tsunamis . 
Some were direct victims of the fighting in those countries , while a much larger number died from war-related hunger and disease . 
Similarly , the number of those forcibly displaced is a multiple of those who lost their homes and livelihoods due to the tsunamis . 
Yet MSF was able to collect only € 650,000 in two months of soliciting funds for Darfur , while it received € 40 million for the tsunami victims in just eight days . 
Given the limited number of skilled personnel available to humanitarian agencies , human resources could follow the money . 
Another question likely to loom large in coming months is whether assistance is politicized and free of corruption . 
Politicization is important because the two countries that were hardest hit , Indonesia and Sri Lanka , both suffer armed conflicts in tsunami-hit regions . 
Aceh province in Indonesia was previously largely closed to outsiders . 
It was ruled by the Indonesian army , which fought a brutal civil war against the separatist Free Aceh Movement . 
Similarly , northern Sri Lanka is the main battleground for the long-running conflict between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam . 
Despite headway towards settling that struggle , violence continues and could erupt again in full fury . 
Germany , where combined public and private aid for tsunami victims has reached $ 1.1 billion ( making it the largest international donor ) , says that it would like its aid to be used to foster peace settlements . 
A worthy goal , but successful models do not come readily to mind . 
More common is a situation like that of ex-Yugoslavia . 
During the wars in Croatia and Bosnia the UN was responsible for humanitarian assistance and also dedicated to peacemaking . 
Yet it was never able to use the former to advance the latter . 
It would not be the first time that a government misused aid intended for disaster victims . 
A notorious example is Nicaragua after the earthquake that leveled the capital , Managua , in December 1972 . 
Nicaragua &apos;s dictator , Anastasio Somoza , diverted much of the international assistance meant for the survivors into his own pockets and those of his cronies . 
In the process , he incited popular support for the left-wing Sandinista guerrillas who toppled his government later in the decade . 
The tsunamis provide an opportunity for the UN to reclaim the high ground that it lost recently . 
Battered by the Iraqi &quot; oil for food &quot; scandal , which , at the least , demonstrated mismanagement , and misdeeds by officials ranging from former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers ( now High Commissioner for Refugees ) , who faces allegations of sexual harassment , to rapes committed by UN peacekeeping troops in Congo , the UN has a chance to rehabilitate its reputation by managing the relief effort effectively . 
Doing so requires putting the right person in charge - someone like Paul Hoffman , the American industrialist who managed the Marshall Plan more than half a century ago and , subsequently , headed the UN Development Program . 
It also requires making sure that the person in charge gets the staff assistance and the political backing required to do the job well .
