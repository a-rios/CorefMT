Europe &apos;s Russia Problem 
NEW YORK - How should Europe react to the rise of a hostile Russia on its eastern flank ? 
Different countries have reacted differently , influenced by their historical experience and their economic interests . 
Yet it is essential for the European Union to develop a unified policy , reconciling these divergent national interests and attitudes . 
Europe cannot afford not to resist Russia &apos;s geopolitical aggression , and it needs to be unified to have any chance of success . 
Yet , the unified European policy must not be purely geopolitical , because if it were , the common interest would not be strong enough to override national interests . 
Russia could divide and conquer as it is doing already . 
In purely geopolitical terms , Russia holds the stronger hand . 
Europe &apos;s superiority lies in its values and principles as an open , democratic , peaceful , prosperous , and law-abiding society . 
These values hold great attraction for the people in the former Soviet Union - and that includes the leaders as well as the masses , in spite of the fact that the West did not back up its values and principles with deeds in the past . 
As a result , admiration of and aspiration to European values is mixed with disillusionment and resentment , and the Putin regime has been able to gather enthusiastic support by baiting the West and scoring well in the geopolitical game . 
Nevertheless , Russia remains susceptible to Europe &apos;s allure . 
Historically , Russia always aspired to be part of Europe , and the Putin regime recognizes that it would pay a big price if it sought to return to the Soviet Union &apos;s isolation . 
But Russia &apos;s strengthened geopolitical position vis-Ã -vis Europe obscures grave weaknesses in other areas . 
Its authoritarian political system stifles private enterprise and innovation . 
The rule of law is absent , and much more effort is spent on extortion and rent collection than production . 
Consequently , economic progress has not kept pace with the accumulation of oil revenues . 
These deficiencies became accentuated by the decline in the price of oil . 
Another great weakness is demography . 
Russia has immense territory but only 140 million people . 
A growing portion of the population consists of Muslim minorities with higher birthrates than ethnic Russians . 
Overall population is expected to drop by 10 million in a decade . 
Resource rich but sparsely populated Siberia is bordered by resource-deficient but teeming and rising China . 
If the Central Asian republics are cut off from the West , they are liable to turn to China in order to avoid becoming totally dependent on Russia . 
In the long run , Putin &apos;s baiting of the West may turn out to be as self-defeating as Saakashvili &apos;s baiting of Russia . 
But in the short run there is a real danger that Russia will pursue its age-old aspiration of becoming part of Europe by seeking to become the dominant entity . 
In these circumstances , Europe needs to pursue a two-pronged strategy . 
On the one hand , it must protect itself against the geopolitical threat posed by a newly assertive and adventurous Russia . 
On the other , it must seek to replace the rule of force with the rule of law , and geopolitics with the pursuit of democracy , open society , and international cooperation . 
The European Union could not possibly forge a common policy without such a two-pronged approach . 
There would be too many freeloaders and defectors in a purely geopolitical game , but in a two-pronged approach each member state could find its proper place . 
The key to neutralizing the geopolitical advantage that Russia enjoys is to establish a unified energy policy with a Europe-wide regulatory authority which has precedence over national regulators and a Europe-wide distribution network . 
This would deprive Russia of its ability to play one country against another , because a concession granted to one national distributor would immediately become available to customers in all the other countries . 
Energy companies are beginning to realize this and becoming less resistant to a common European energy policy . 
That would also serve another shared objective , namely helping to bring climate change under control . 
The other prong , promoting the rule of law , international cooperation , and the principles of open society has to be pursued indirectly , by reforming the international financial system and by paying special attention to Russia &apos;s near-abroad . 
Ukraine , in particular , is in a perilous state , but financing public works that would create jobs in eastern Ukraine , where the steel industry is in distress , could make a major difference both politically and economically . 
Georgia must also be helped to recover from the damage inflicted by the Russian invasion , but help should be contingent on the Saakashvili regime observing the principles of open society . 
Russia cannot be helped directly because of its excessive reliance on arbitrary state power , but when Russia sees progress in international cooperation , particularly with China , it will not want to be left out in the cold . 
Strengthening and supporting the former Soviet republics would serve both prongs of a unified EU policy towards Russia . 
It would be against open society values if Russia were allowed to turn these countries into satellites just because it has superior military force . 
And Europe has a geopolitical interest in keeping them open as sources of energy supply .
