The Way Out of Iraq 
At last the point has been reached in Iraq where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing : the departure of Coalition forces from the country . 
The recent leak from Britain &apos;s Ministry of Defense of a discussion paper on troop withdrawal highlights this desire . 
The only question is how to satisfy it . 
As long as the Coalition forces stay , violence is likely to escalate . 
But if they leave , it will also escalate , only faster . 
So the real question is how to get to the point where Iraq has a police force and army that can be trusted to maintain law as well as order . 
Much ground must be covered to get anywhere close . 
Notwithstanding the courage of the many Iraqis who join either the army or the police , no one should be surprised if some have motives that are less than pure . 
In northern Iraq , old scores are being settled and de facto ethnic segregation is being introduced in areas , such as Irbil , that were traditionally diverse . 
In other areas , sharia law is being introduced by force . 
So how can Iraq create uniformed services that can be trusted to enforce the law effectively and impartially , without consideration of ethnicity , religion and gender ? 
The traditional answer is to recruit , train , and instill the &quot; right values . &quot; 
But there is not enough time for that . 
Other ways are needed . 
In the absence of a deeply instilled value system , Iraq needs grassroots civil society organizations that will hold police and army to account . 
These could take different forms , but what is important is that they are truly inclusive at a local level , and that they get support from district , regional , and national power structures when they highlight abuses . 
If there is local scrutiny , and national reinforcement and recognition of the value of that scrutiny , then most members of the uniformed forces are likely to behave appropriately -and can be more easily identified and dealt with if they don &apos;t . 
This might appear excessively hopeful , yet in Afghanistan , a country akin to Iraq in many ways , there are groups working towards this goal . 
The Cooperation for Peace and Unity ( CPAU ) provides a model of how this can be done . 
In Afghanistan , as in Iraq , ordinary people &apos;s highest priority has been to achieve a reduction in violence . 
CPAU worked across the country in the last three years to set up District level Peace Committees , supported by satellite Peace Councils in villages . 
The initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children once learned arithmetic by counting numbers of dead Soviet soldiers . 
The Committees therefore seek to bring together all sections of the community - including teachers , tribal leaders , religious leaders , women , police , soldiers , judges , and businesspeople - to develop ways of resolving conflicts non-violently . 
Although monitoring has not been a formal part of the role of the committees until now ( it is planned for the future ) , the mere fact that the police , army , and judiciary are part of these committees brings them into contact with the rest of the community , provides feedback , and starts to build trust . 
Some results are remarkable . 
In one workshop , the local military commander came for a couple of hours , as a courtesy , and ended up staying for the whole week . 
At the end , he apologized for his violent past and made a commitment to disarm his 2,000-strong private army . 
He now visits the Committee offices regularly . 
In Iraq , projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center in Kirkuk are starting to fulfill a monitoring function by offering the ethnically diverse local population the opportunity to bring grievances and get help in having them resolved . 
But , too often , even if a court ruling is made , it is not enforced as a result of intimidation . 
Much good work on strengthening civil society has already been done by American and British forces . 
We don &apos;t hear about the workshops for women &apos;s empowerment , or the successful organization of small-scale local elections across the country . 
But mobilizing civil society is hugely challenging , particularly when , as in Iraq , it needs to be done quickly and on a large scale . 
Military force is still necessary , but so are incentives to disarm , including the prospect of economic opportunities that are more fruitful than crime and extortion . 
Fortunately , building the capacity of civil society is as cheap as it is important . 
The Humanitarian Liaison Center serves the whole of Kirkuk at an annual cost of just $ 75,000 a year . 
With $ 10 million , such centers could be replicated 100 times - with plenty of change left over . 
The challenge is to commit to this approach , to scale up and to support to the hilt the brave people who take on the challenge of holding power to account . 
Otherwise , the Iraqi people are unlikely to get the security that , after so many years of suffering , they so desperately need .
