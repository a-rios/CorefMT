Is China Overtaking America ? 
CAMBRIDGE - The twenty-first century is witnessing Asia &apos;s return to what might be considered its historical proportions of the world &apos;s population and economy . 
In 1800 , Asia represented more than half of global population and output . 
By 1900 , it represented only 20 % of world output - not because something bad happened in Asia , but rather because the Industrial Revolution had transformed Europe and North America into the world &apos;s workshop . 
Asia &apos;s recovery began with Japan , then moved to South Korea and on to Southeast Asia , beginning with Singapore and Malaysia . 
Now the recovery is focused on China , and increasingly involves India , lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the process . 
This change , however , is also creating anxieties about shifting power relations among states . 
In 2010 , China passed Japan to become the world &apos;s second largest economy . 
Indeed , the investment bank Goldman Sachs expects the Chinese economy &apos;s total size to surpass that of the United States by 2027 . 
But , even if overall Chinese GDP reaches parity with that of the US in the 2020 &quot; s , the two economies will not be equal in composition . 
China would still have a vast underdeveloped countryside . 
Assuming 6 % Chinese GDP growth and only 2 % US growth after 2030 , China would not equal the US in terms of per capita income - a better measure of an economy &apos;s sophistication - until sometime near the second half of the century . 
Moreover , linear projections of economic growth trends can be misleading . 
Emerging countries tend to benefit from imported technologies in the early stages of economic takeoff , but their growth rates generally slow as they reach higher levels of development . 
And the Chinese economy faces serious obstacles to sustainable rapid growth , owing to inefficient state-owned enterprises , growing inequality , massive internal migration , an inadequate social safety net , corruption , and inadequate institutions , all of which could foster political instability . 
China &apos;s north and east have outpaced its south and west . 
Almost alone among developing countries , China is aging extraordinarily fast . 
By 2030 , China will have more elderly dependents than children . 
Some Chinese demographers worry that the country will get old before getting rich . 
During the past decade , China moved from being the world &apos;s ninth largest exporter to its leader , displacing Germany at the top . 
But China &apos;s export-led development model will need to be adjusted as global trade and financial balances become more contentious . 
Indeed , China &apos;s 12th Five-Year Plan is aimed at reducing dependence on exports and boosting domestic demand . 
Will it work ? 
China &apos;s authoritarian political system has thus far shown an impressive capacity to achieve specific targets , for example , staging a successful Olympic Games , building high-speed rail projects , or even stimulating the economy to recover from the global financial crisis . 
Whether China can maintain this capability over the longer term is a mystery to outsiders and Chinese leaders themselves . 
Unlike India , which was born with a democratic constitution , China has not yet found a way to channel the demands for political participation ( if not democracy ) that tend to accompany rising per capita income . 
Communist ideology is long gone , so the legitimacy of the ruling party depends on economic growth and ethnic Han nationalism . 
Whether China can develop a formula to manage an expanding urban middle class , regional inequality , and resentment among ethnic minorities remains to be seen . 
The basic point is that no one , including the Chinese , knows how China &apos;s political future will affect its economic growth . 
Some analysts argue that China aims to challenge America &apos;s position as the world &apos;s dominant power . 
Even if this were an accurate assessment of China &apos;s intentions ( and even Chinese cannot know the views of future generations ) , it is doubtful that China will have the military capability to make this possible . 
To be sure , Chinese military expenditures , up more than 12 % this year , have been growing even more rapidly than its economy . 
But China &apos;s leaders will have to contend with other countries &quot; reactions , as well as with the constraints implied by the need for external markets and resources in order to meet their economic-growth objectives . 
A Chinese military posture that is too aggressive could produce a countervailing coalition among its neighbors , thereby weakening China &apos;s hard and soft power . 
In 2010 , for example , as China became more assertive in its foreign policy toward its neighbors , its relations with India , Japan , and South Korea suffered . 
As a result , China will find it more difficult to exclude the US from Asia &apos;s security arrangements . 
China &apos;s size and high rate of economic growth will almost certainly increase its relative strength vis-Ã -vis the US in the coming decades . 
This will certainly bring the Chinese closer to the US in terms of power resources , but China will not necessarily surpass the US as the most powerful country . 
Even if China suffers no major domestic political setback , many current projections based on GDP growth alone are too one-dimensional : they ignore US military and soft-power advantages , as well as China &apos;s geopolitical disadvantages in the internal Asian balance of power . 
My own estimate is that among the range of possible futures , the more likely scenarios are those in which China gives the US a run for its money , but does not surpass it in overall power in the first half of this century . 
Most importantly , the US and China should avoid developing exaggerated fears of each other &apos;s capacities and intentions . 
The expectation of conflict can itself become a cause of conflict . 
In reality , China and the US do not have deeply rooted conflicting interests . 
Both countries , along with others , have much more to gain from cooperation .
