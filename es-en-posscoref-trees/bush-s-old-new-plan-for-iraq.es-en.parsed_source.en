Bush &apos;s Old New Plan for Iraq 
Last November &apos;s Congressional elections dealt President George W. Bush a sharp rebuff over his Iraq policy . 
Shortly after the election , the Iraq Study Group offered a bipartisan formula for the gradual withdrawal of United States troops . 
But Bush rejected this , and persists in speaking of victory in Iraq - though it is unclear what that now means . 
Perhaps because Iraq will define his legacy , he has proven reluctant to let go at a point when his policy appears to be a disaster . 
Now Bush will increase the number of American troops in Baghdad and Anbar Province and try to stabilize both the rising sectarian civil war and the Sunni insurgency . 
He has removed generals John Abizaid and George Casey , who were skeptical of a troop &quot; surge , &quot; and moved Ambassador Zalmay Khalizad , who was supposed to negotiate a political agreement in Iraq . 
A number of the Democratic lawmakers who control the new Congress disagree with this approach . 
Some Democratic activists seek an immediate withdrawal and are pressing for Congress to cut off funding for the war , but that is unlikely . 
Congress is reluctant to be portrayed as failing to support troops in the field ; while they will criticize , they will not block Bush &apos;s plan . 
Bush has long claimed that the number of troops in Iraq was a military decision and that he simply followed the advice of his generals , but now this is clearly not the case . 
Ironically , there may once have been a point at which a large increase in troops might have made a difference . 
In April and May 2003 , polls showed a majority of Iraqis welcoming the overthrow of Saddam Hussein . 
But the Bush administration failed to control rioting , disbanded the Iraqi army , and allowed the security situation to deteriorate . 
In such chaos , it was difficult to do the reconstruction and development work that could have made Iraqi lives better and attracted support . 
It is not easy for a marine or soldier to construct a school or clinic when he is being fired upon , or for Iraqi moderates to risk their lives by being supportive when they have no protection against insurgents . 
Many military professionals foresaw this problem . 
US Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki warned that although it would be possible to win the war with the 160,000 troops that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld used , it would take double that number to win the peace . 
But because Rumsfeld wanted to prove a point about transforming American military strategy , and his neo-conservative advisors had ideological blinders that distorted their appraisal of Iraqi reality , Shinseki &apos;s advice was rejected . 
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz testified to Congress that Shinseki &apos;s estimate of the number of troops required was &quot; wildly off the mark . &quot; 
Now both are gone , and Bush is turning to troop increases . 
Too little , too late . 
Is there any reason to believe that an additional five brigades will succeed in stabilizing Baghdad now when similar efforts have failed in the past ? 
The new American operational commander in Iraq , Lt. General Raymond Odierno , says that the new efforts will be more evenhanded among Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods , and American troops will stay alongside Iraqi troops in areas that have been cleared . 
He hopes that with a few months , he can then withdraw American troops to the periphery of Baghdad and leave the policing of the capital to Iraqi forces . 
But this assumes that Iraqi forces are up to the task , and that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki &apos;s government , which rests upon Shiite militia support , can play a competent and evenhanded role . 
Bush administration officials argue that the new plan is &quot; not an open-ended commitment : we are putting real , specific requirements and expectations on the Iraqi government . &quot; 
Among the political benchmarks are provincial elections , enactment of an oil law that distributes oil wealth in a way that benefits the Sunnis , and reform of the de-Baathifcation policy , which has been so costly to those who worked in the Iraqi government under Saddam . 
But it may be too late for political compromise , and the Maliki government may not be capable of a broad non-sectarian policy . 
If Bush &apos;s new military plan is a temporary step to buy time to move in the direction of the Iraq Study Group &apos;s proposals of training Iraqi forces and gradually withdrawing American forces , there may be something to be said for it as one last chance , but only if it is accompanied by the diplomatic advice that the study group also suggested . 
It is too late to create a democracy in Iraq . 
At best , the overthrow of Saddam removed a threatening dictator , and substituted a tyranny of the majority for the tyranny of a minority . 
But the price has been high in terms of Iraqi lives lost in sectarian fighting . 
The goal now is regional stability . 
Each of Iraq &apos;s neighbors has its own interests , but none will benefit from chaotic violence there , which would increase Iran &apos;s influence , encourage Kurdish separatism to the worry of Turkey , and support Sunni terrorist movements that could spill back into Jordan , Kuwait , Syria , and Saudi Arabia . 
The US cannot leave Iraq precipitously , but neither can it solve the problem on its own . 
Establishing a contact group of Iraq &apos;s neighbors to help set rules of the road for stabilization and containment will be an important step . 
Iraq is not susceptible to a military solution . 
Only more politics and diplomacy can salvage US policy .
