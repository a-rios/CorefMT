The Greening of Bush 
The United States is usually regarded as an environmental laggard , with President George W. Bush perceived as being little better than the head of a gang of willful polluters who do everything they can to obstruct global action to protect the environment . 
Of course , there is some truth in this characterization of America ( and quite a lot in that of Bush ) , but the picture is not uniformly bleak . 
Indeed , the environmental movement - like most modern social movements - began in the US . 
The roots of America &apos;s &quot; environmental movement &quot; lie in the nineteenth century , when the damage wrought by the industrial revolution and the fragmentation of the natural landscape by individual property rights and tenures first became apparent . 
But it was the publication in 1962 of the book Silent Spring - a polemic against the use of pesticides in agriculture - by the biologist Rachel Carson that jump-started the modern ecological movement . 
Carson drew on scientific findings , but also voiced fundamental misgivings about consumer capitalism and a &quot; postmaterialistic &quot; belief in the primacy of the quality of life over economic growth . 
In Carson &apos;s wake , the &quot; Woodstock &quot; generation of the 1960 &quot; s , with its Earth Days , soon began to organize a broad campaign , which saw , in April 1970 , around 20 million Americans take to the street to defend the environment . 
In this new movement , the libertarian tendencies of the New Left and the protectionist tendencies of the traditional right became intertwined . 
Paul Ehrlich &apos;s bestseller The Population Bomb exerted an influence that lasts to this day . 
America &apos;s environmental movement was soon exported to Europe and elsewhere : on one hand , the pragmatic Friends of the Earth and the media-oriented organization Greenpeace , and , on the other hand , eco-fundamentalist groups like Earth First ! and the Environmental Justice Movement ( EJM ) or lobbying groups like the World Wildlife Fund . 
This movement managed to force the first environmental laws out of the conservative Nixon administration : the National Environmental Act of 1969 , the Clean Air Act of 1970 , the Clean Water Act of 1972 , and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 . 
Then as now , the focus in America was on &quot; green &quot; topics ( clean water , fresh air , and biological diversity ) rather than with the &quot; brown &quot; topics of ecological disasters such as the Chernobyl ( or Harrisburg ) disaster , which have played a dominant role in mobilizing Europeans . 
America &apos;s influential Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) also was established under Nixon . 
Environmentalists hired scientists , lawyers , and lobbyists who made sure that laws weren &apos;t just passed in Congress , but also implemented in practice . 
But the current Bush administration has been hacking away at these 1970 &quot; s laws from all directions . 
He approved oil exploration in closed nature reserves , and also systematically fought to suppress scientific evidence on climate change . 
Now , however , due to the surge in crude oil prices , even Bush has had to begin to consider alternative energy sources , and it won &apos;t be possible to limit these to nuclear power or ethanol , which is so popular among farmers , a key Bush constituency . 
Indeed , even Bush &apos;s own political base , the Christian fundamentalists , are becoming &quot; green , &quot; pressuring the administration to sign the Kyoto Protocol because they believe that the environment must be protected just like unborn life . 
&quot; Eco-theology &quot; and evangelical pro-life propaganda have become one of the liveliest branches of the US environmental movement . 
&quot; Green &quot; eco-activists , while feeling awkward about support from this quarter , nonetheless find them useful allies . 
Indeed , the greening of America is becoming a general proposition . 
Many Americans can only shake their heads at the energy lobbyists who surround Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney , and for a long time now a majority has been in favor of signing multilateral agreements , particularly in the area of climate protection . 
Catastrophic events like Hurricane Katrina have reinforced this stance . 
All this has caused Bush to seek to accommodate - verbally , at least - the will of an overwhelming majority of Americans to conserve energy . 
Moreover , although Bush has given mainly national security reasons for his seeming change of heart , America &apos;s federal system , helps the country get around even a roadblock as powerful as the president , as &quot; localism &quot; promotes eco-political initiatives at the state level and even within municipalities . 
It is not just California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger who has recognized the signs of the times and proclaimed bold Kyoto targets for his state that may become a pacemaker of All-American modernization again . 
Political climate change has also been brought about by people like Jerome Ringo , the president of the National Wildlife Federation ( NWF ) , whose 4.5 million members make it one of the largest environmental organizations . 
Ringo also heads the Apollo Alliance , a coalition of trade unions , environmentalist groups , managers , and local politicians that demands clean energy and good jobs . 
How green America will actually become remains to be seen , of course , but , as an ecological avant-garde , the US might even regain its lost influence in the world . 
Those who disdain environmental concerns have been ousted at the polls in large numbers , companies invest huge amounts in environmental technologies , states are suing car producers for their climate-adverse policies , and the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol have long been surpassed by some states - a lesson for German and European cities and municipalities . 
As in the past , the effectiveness of these initiatives ultimately will depend on whether these impulses reach Europe and Japan , as well as emerging nations like China and Brazil . 
It is time for Greens everywhere to start attending to ecological matters again - and , strange as it may sound , to look again to America for inspiration .
