Modernizing the Middle East &apos;s Economies 
AMMAN - Rather than speak of the Middle East or the Arab world , I increasingly prefer to use the term WANA , meaning West Asia-North Africa . 
But , whatever we choose to call it , the danger is that the global economic crisis is providing an almost perfect alibi for governments and others in the region to continue with &quot; business as usual , &quot; when what is needed is a loud wake-up call . 
The global economic crisis has merely helped to mask chronic structural imbalances within the region . 
Over-dependence on aid and oil revenues characterizes almost all the economies of WANA . 
Indeed , it is no exaggeration to say that they represent a form of life-support system . 
The problem of how to wean these countries off this addiction seems to be insurmountable . 
For the &quot; Dutch disease &quot; and a rentier spirit prevail in WANA , and have affected oil-producing and non-oil-producing countries , ranging from migrant workers &quot; remittances and financial investment flows from the oil countries ( mainly into real estate ) to stock-exchange bubbles and foreign aid . 
A side-effect of this has been the widening of income gaps , both within and between the WANA countries . 
Political scientists tell us that rentier economies , or economies that depend on oil and foreign aid , stimulate greed and grievances . 
Indeed , oil rents eventually weaken state institutions , and this hollowing out of the state often gives rise to growing discontent . 
In a non-oil economy , labor is the main engine of wealth . 
But in a rentier economy , huge revenues from oil or external financial transfers actually create a disincentive to work . 
Wealth and work are de-linked , and this applies to most industrial and agricultural activities . 
Social and political mobility become extremely limited , and societies turn from production to consumption . 
This helps to explain the high level of unemployment in the Arab world . 
According to World Bank figures , the Middle East North Africa ( MENA ) region suffered a 25 % fall in per capita incomes during the last 25 years of the twentieth century , when oil prices were low . 
In this decade , thanks to record-high oil prices , GDP growth rates soared . 
A recent study by India &apos;s Strategic Foresight Group entitled The Cost of Conflict in the Middle East suggested that the past 20 years of conflict have cost WANA countries some $ 12 trillion . 
Rent-seeking tends to lead to policy failure in the form of intense political competition aimed at gaining short-term access to revenues and benefits , as opposed to political competition over what policies might be in the long-term public interest . 
The politics of greed and grievance replace more far-sighted policymaking . 
So what , then , are the possible policy options ? 
The absence of a modern industrial base diminishes the WANA economies &quot; ability to absorb the surplus generated by oil revenues . 
As a result , many countries have established sovereign wealth funds to invest their surpluses in international markets . 
These funds &quot; managers rightly complain that insufficient investment opportunities exist in the region in agriculture and manufacturing . 
The question is how to increase the absorptive capacity of the region and build a modern industrial base . 
A precondition for any effective change is a shift in policy orientation from the national to the regional level . 
For this to be made concrete , new instruments are needed , such as a Regional Stabilization Fund , a Water and Energy Community , regional social cohesion , and a regional industrial policy . 
Without a regional focus , WANA countries risk sleepwalking into conflict and more pronounced economic decline . 
Indeed , funds for &quot; needy countries &quot; may never reach the neediest of individuals , such as internally displaced or stateless persons , because no one takes responsibility for them . 
How can this be done ? 
Three years ago , the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor considered ways of empowering the &quot; bottom billion &quot; by expanding and deepening the means by which they could pull themselves out of poverty . 
Its 2008 report Making the Law Work for Everyone argues that legal empowerment is not about aid , but about policy and institutional reforms that expand the legal opportunities and protection of the poor . 
It is an example of the methodology urgently needed to initiate a paradigm shift in WANA . 
The nations of WANA missed the first industrial revolution based on coal and the steam engine , and then the second industrial revolution based on oil and the internal combustion engine . 
The silver lining is that the absence of a modern industrial base means that , unlike more developed economies , WANA has no ailing industries to rescue . 
But what is needed now are policies that will allow WANA to join the third industrial revolution - the post-carbon economy of renewable energy and the fuel-cell plug-in car .
