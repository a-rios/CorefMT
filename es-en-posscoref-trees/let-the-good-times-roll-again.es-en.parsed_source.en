Let the Good Times Roll Again ? 
CAMBRIDGE - Goldman Sachs announced this month plans to provide bonuses at record levels , and there are widespread expectations that bonuses and pay in many other firms will rise substantially this year . 
Should the good times start rolling again so soon ? 
Not without reform . 
Indeed , one key lesson of the financial crisis is that an overhaul of executive compensation must be high on the policy agenda . 
Indeed , pay arrangements were a major contributing factor to the excessive risk-taking by financial institutions that helped bring about the financial crisis . 
By rewarding executives for risky behavior , and by insulating them from some of the adverse consequences of that behavior , pay arrangements for financial-sector bosses produced perverse incentives , encouraging them to gamble . 
One major factor that induced excessive risk-taking is that firms &quot; standard pay arrangements reward executives for short-term gains , even when those gains are subsequently reversed . 
Although the financial sector lost more than half of its stock-market value during the last five years , executives were still able to cash out , prior to the stock market implosion , large amounts of equity compensation and bonus compensation . 
Such pay structures gave executives excessive incentives to seek short-term gains - say , by making lending and investment decisions that would improve short-term earnings - even when doing so would increase the risks of an implosion later on . 
Jesse Fried and I warned about this short-term distortion five years ago , in our book Pay without Performance . 
Following the crisis , this problem has become widely recognized , including by business leaders such as Goldman Sachs &quot; CEO Lloyd Blankfein . 
But it still needs to be effectively addressed : Goldman &apos;s recent decision to provide record bonuses as a reward for performance in the last two quarters , for example , is a step in the wrong direction . 
To avoid rewards for short-term performance and focus on long-term results , pay structures need to be re-designed . 
As far as equity-based compensation is concerned , executives should not be allowed to cash out options and shares given to them for a period of , say , five years after the time of &quot; vesting &quot; - that is , the point at which the options and shares have been &quot; earned &quot; and may not be taken away from the executive . 
An executive &apos;s inability to cash out shares and options for a substantial period would tie his or her payoff to long-term shareholder value . 
The length of this period should be fixed , and should not depend on actions or conditions that are at least partly under executives &quot; control . 
By contrast , prohibiting executives from cashing out shares and options until they leave the firm would provide executives who have accumulated shares and options with a large monetary value with counter-productive incentives to depart . 
Similarly , bonus compensation should be redesigned to reward long-term performance . 
For starters , the use of bonuses based on one-year results should be discouraged . 
Furthermore , bonuses should not be paid immediately , but rather placed in a company account for several years and adjusted downward if the company subsequently learns that the reason for awarding a bonus no longer holds up . 
In addition to the excessive focus on short-term results , a second important source of incentives to take excessive risks has thus far received little attention . 
The payoffs of financial-sector executives were tied to highly leveraged bets on the value of their firms &quot; capital . 
Executives &quot; interests were tied to the value of their firms &quot; common shares - or even to the value of options on such shares . 
As a result , executives were not exposed to the potential negative consequences that large losses could bring about for preferred shareholders , bondholders , and the government as a guarantor of deposits . 
These structures provided executives with incentives to give insufficient weight to the possibility of large losses , which in turn motivated executives to take excessive risks . 
To address this distortion , the payoffs of financial executives should be tied not to the long-term value of their firms &quot; common shares but to the long-term value of a broader basket of securities . 
Such structures would provide incentives to take risks that are closer to the optimal level . 
Reforming pay arrangements in ways such as those proposed here would help ensure that firms and the economy don &apos;t suffer in the future from the excessive risk-taking that has contributed to bringing about the financial crisis . 
A thorough overhaul of compensation structures must be an important element of the new financial order .
