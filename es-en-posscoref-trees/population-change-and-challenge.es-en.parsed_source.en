Population Change and Challenge 
Like everything else in our world , change in population is swifter than ever . 
The most profound changes in population , however , are not demographic but social , and they go deep into personal and family life . 
Women are tasting new freedoms - new expressions of their fundamental human rights - and these have profound implications for both men and the social structures they traditionally dominate . 
Demographic change has certainly been swift . 
In 1970 , world population was less than 4 billion : today , it is over 6 billion and will stand at 8 billion by 2025 , with nearly all of that growth concentrated in what are still called &quot; developing countries &quot;  -  most of Asia and nearly all of Latin America and Africa . 
Hidden within those astounding numbers , however , are some more hopeful figures . 
Over the last 30 years , family size in developing countries has fallen by half , from 6 children to 3 ; there are many more women today , but compared with their mothers - or any previous generation - they have fewer children . 
On a scale unknown to history , women are making choices for themselves , and their choice is for smaller families . 
Back in 1970 , the issue of population growth was controversial . 
It divided north and south , developed and developing countries , in a way that few other issues did - with blame and counter-suspicions cast widely - and with the result that population concerns tended to sink toward the bottom of the agenda of most countries and international organizations . 
Few developing countries had family planning programs . 
The people who carried most of the responsibility for bearing and raising children - women - were not heard from at all . 
Nothing could be further from the way population issues are viewed today . 
There is a global consensus that population issues are part of daily life . 
Reproductive health and gender equality have become an integral part of the human rights agenda . 
The amazing though little-known fact is that this epochal change marks a real and visible success for the United Nations and its ponderous but painstaking way of reaching consensus . 
Slowly , over years of long discussion and hard-won practice , divisions between the various population camps have been closing . 
Or not so much closing as shown to grow from false premises . 
A generation of practice has shown that if women have choices - real choices - they will have smaller families than their parents &quot; generation . 
The reasons are complex and not completely understood , but the facts are clear . 
Family size and population growth rates thus become not so much a matter for high-level decision , but the results of many private decisions further down the power structure . 
Many things flow from this . 
In the past , policy and politics were a matter for men : now women increasingly play an equal part . 
In countries like India and Uganda , for example , women sit on local and regional legislatures by right . 
That women need access to health care for themselves and their children , in particular family planning , is more widely accepted every day . 
Nearly all countries now officially support family planning . 
Even this is not enough . 
If women are going to use contraception successfully , they must be able to make their own decisions about it . 
The implications of this are revolutionary for societies where women traditionally have not been allowed to make decisions for themselves . 
After all , if women can decide about family planning , why not about other things ? 
The whole power structure of the family , and the community in which the family lives , begins to change . 
In Bangladesh , for example , where women have traditionally been kept from public view , they now use cell-phones to contact one another , raise loans and do business . 
In some families , women are now the main earners . 
In many developing countries , there has been an explosion of women &apos;s groups in the last decade , and these assert themselves as never before . 
In Chile , for example , mothers went on the street in favor of a move by the education ministry , but opposed by the Church , to include sex education in school . 
Government , of course , is still needed : governments provide health care and education , the two most critical elements of the mix . 
And leadership is needed , though in new and unfamiliar ways . 
Political leaders must pay attention to social needs : economic growth by itself won &apos;t solve social problems ; in fact the realization is spreading that sustained economic growth depends on dealing with social issues . 
The &quot; Asian tigers , &quot; for example , made heavy investments in education and health , including family planning , early in their development . 
This investment paid off a thousandfold in terms of social stability , a healthy and educated workforce and faster economic growth 
Governments today must pay attention to women , though , granted , for many , this is proving hard to do . 
International agreements have been reached : human rights structures are in place . 
Agreement , however , is one thing : implementation another . 
Women are willing to make partnerships to make progress . 
The problem lies with men . 
Somehow men must learn that equal power for women does not threaten their own power : that being a man does not depend on controlling a woman ; that sharing power makes everyone more powerful . 
Men in all countries , from poorest to richest , at all levels of society , are learning that they must change . 
That is the lesson of the last 30 years , and the great success for all of us who have spent our lives in population and development . 
We have changed population concerns from a divisive political issue to a social force , behind which women and men can unite . 
In the process , the structures of both politics and society are changing . 
This is a quiet revolution : and it has only just begun .
