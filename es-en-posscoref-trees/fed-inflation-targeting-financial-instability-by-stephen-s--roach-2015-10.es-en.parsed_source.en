The Wrong War for Central Banking 
BEIJING - Fixated on inflation targeting in a world without inflation , central banks have lost their way . 
With benchmark interest rates stuck at the dreaded zero bound , monetary policy has been transformed from an agent of price stability into an engine of financial instability . 
A new approach is desperately needed . 
The US Federal Reserve exemplifies this policy dilemma . 
After the Federal Open Market Committee decided in September to defer yet again the start of its long-awaited normalization of monetary policy , its inflation doves are openly campaigning for another delay . 
For the inflation-targeting purists , the argument seems impeccable . 
The headline consumer-price index ( CPI ) is near zero , and &quot; core &quot; or underlying inflation - the Fed &apos;s favorite indicator - remains significantly below the seemingly sacrosanct 2 % target . 
With a long-anemic recovery looking shaky again , the doves contend that there is no reason to rush ahead with interest-rate hikes . 
Of course , there is more to it than that . 
Because monetary policy operates with lags , central banks must avoid fixating on the here and now , and instead use imperfect forecasts to anticipate the future effects of their decisions . 
In the Fed &apos;s case , the presumption that the US will soon approach full employment has caused the so-called dual mandate to collapse into one target : getting inflation back to 2 % . 
Here , the Fed is making a fatal mistake , as it relies heavily on a timeworn inflation-forecasting methodology that filters out the &quot; special factors &quot; driving the often volatile prices of goods like food and energy . 
The logic is that the price fluctuations will eventually subside , and headline price indicators will converge on the core rate of inflation . 
This approach failed spectacularly when it was adopted in the 1970s , causing the Fed to underestimate virulent inflation . 
And it is failing today , leading the Fed consistently to overestimate underlying inflation . 
Indeed , with oil prices having plunged by 50 % over the past year , the Fed stubbornly maintains that faster price growth - and the precious inflation rate of 2 % - is just around the corner . 
Missing from this logic is an appreciation of the new and powerful global forces that are bearing down on inflation . 
According to the International Monetary Fund &apos;s latest outlook , the price deflator for all advanced economies should increase by just 1.5 % annually , on average , from now to 2020 - not much higher than the crisis-depressed 1.1 % pace of the last six years . 
Moreover , most wholesale prices around the world remain in outright deflation . 
But , rather than recognize the likely drivers of these developments - namely , a seemingly chronic shortfall of global aggregate demand amid a supply glut and a deflationary profusion of technological innovations and new supply chains - the Fed continues to minimize the deflationary impact of global forces . 
It would rather attribute low inflation to successful inflation targeting , and the Great Moderation that it presumably spawned . 
This prideful interpretation amounted to the siren song of an extremely accommodative monetary policy . 
Unable to disentangle the global and domestic pressures suppressing inflation , a price-targeting Fed has erred consistently on the side of easy money . 
This is apparent in the fact that , over the last 15 years , the real federal funds rate - the Fed &apos;s benchmark policy rate , adjusted for inflation - has been in negative territory more than 60 % of the time , averaging -0.6 % since May 2001 . 
From 1990 to 2000 , by contrast , the real federal funds rate averaged 2.2 % . 
In short , over the last decade and a half , the Fed has gone well beyond a powerful disinflation in setting its policy interest rate . 
The consequences have been problematic , to say the least . 
Over the same 15-year period , financial markets have become unhinged , with a profusion of asset and credit bubbles leading to a series of crises that almost pushed the world economy into the abyss in 2008-2009 . 
But rather than recognize , let alone respond to , pre-crisis excesses , the Fed has remained agnostic about them , pointing out that bubble-spotting is , at best , an imperfect science . 
That is hardly a convincing reason for central banks to remain fixated on inflation targeting . 
Not only have they failed repeatedly to get the inflation forecast right ; they now risk fueling renewed financial instability and sparking another crisis . 
Just as a few of us warned of impending crisis in the 2003-2006 period , some - including the Bank of International Settlements and the IMF- are sounding the alarm today , but to no avail . 
To be sure , inflation targeting was once essential to limit runaway price growth . 
In today &apos;s inflationless world , however , it is counterproductive . 
Yet the inflation targeters who dominate today &apos;s major central banks insist on fighting yesterday &apos;s war . 
In this sense , modern central bankers resemble the British army in the Battle of Singapore in 1942 . 
Convinced that the Japanese would attack from the sea , the British defenses were encased in impenetrable concrete bunkers , with fixed artillery that could fire only to the south . 
So when the Japanese emerged from the jungle and mangrove swamps of the Malay Peninsula in the north , the British were powerless to stop them . 
Singapore quickly fell , in what is widely considered Prime Minister Winston Churchill &apos;s most ignominious military defeat . 
Central bankers , like the British army in Singapore , are aiming their weapons in the wrong direction . 
It is time for them to turn their policy arsenal toward today &apos;s enemy : financial instability . 
On that basis alone , the case for monetary-policy normalization has never been more compelling .
