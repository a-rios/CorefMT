The End of Peronism ? 
Jorge Luis Borges , Argentina &apos;s greatest writer , once said , &quot; Peronists are neither good nor bad , they are merely incorrigible . &quot; 
As Argentina prepares for its presidential election on April 27 th , the behavior of today &apos;s Peronist factions provides conclusive proof of that characterization . 
The Peronist Party has not rallied around a single candidate . 
Because Peronist politics is defined by pragmatism and opportunism , not principle , leading Peronists have felt free to pursue their own ambitions as their traditional enemy , the Radical Party , looks set to secure a mere 2-3 % of the vote . 
Three Peronist candidates - two former presidents , Carlos Menem and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá , and Néstor Kirchner , governor of the remote southern province of Santa Cruz - are competing for the post . 
None is allowed to use either the name or the symbols of the Peronist Party . 
But all claim to be Juan Perón &apos;s rightful heir . 
What a motley inheritance to claim ! 
Not even Argentina deserves the history Peronism bequeathed . 
From its first appearance in 1943 , Peronism was an unsavory mix of ingredients borrowed from European dictators - anti _ Semitism , parades , militarism , all stiffened by a corrupt trade union base . 
Juan Perón proclaimed that he chose to serve as Argentina &apos;s military attaché in Rome in 1937 so that he could study fascism up close . 
Deposed in 1955 and exiled in a string of Latin American dictatorships , Perón finally moved to Spain in 1962 , where General Franco named one of Madrid &apos;s most important avenues after him . 
In Panama , an astrologer named José López Rega introduced Isabelita , a singer / dancer 30 years Perón &apos;s junior , to the old general . 
The astrologer &apos;s influence with the couple was strong , as Perón attracted a heterogeneous group of acolytes comprising young , well-intentioned leftist enthusiasts , to delinquents and assassins of the far right . 
When Perón returned to power in 1973 , he was 78 years old , and his lucidity was failing fast . 
Isabelita , by then his third wife , became vice _ president . 
The Peronist movement soon disintegrated into rival factions , fighting it out in the streets of Buenos Aires . 
Isabelita &apos;s corrupt and weak administration was easily deposed by a military coup in March 1976 , inaugurating the sordid dictatorship of General Jorge Videla . 
More than 30,000 men and women disappeared - killed by the armed forces without even a parody of legality . 
Videla &apos;s regime saw annual inflation soar to over 350 % and real GDP shrink by 11 % in 1982 . 
To distract people from the economic shambles , another general ( Leopoldo Galtieri ) ordered the invasion of the British-governed Falkland Islands ( in Spanish Islas Malvinas ) . 
Disaster followed . 
Defeated and humiliated , the military returned to their barracks , and Raúl Alfonsín of the Radical Party was elected President in December 1983 . 
Alfonsín ordered military leaders tried for their crimes . 
So Carlos Saúl Menem , then an obscure governor of one of Argentina &apos;s poorest provinces , followed Alfonsín in 1989 . 
The Peronist lords regained power , and have misused it ever since . 
The roots of today &apos;s Peronist rivalries go back to Menem &apos;s term in office . 
But the differences between the candidates are not about ideas and programs , but about the power to hand out money , jobs , and patronage to party hacks . 
All three candidates will use any sort of dirty trick to win . 
Eduardo Duhalde , who became interim president after first Fernando de la Rúa and then Rodríguez Saá resigned at the height of the economic crisis in late 2001 , refused to call for a party primary , because he feared Menem &apos;s popularity with the rank and file . 
Menem believes that , with the party &apos;s official sanction , he can overcome the fact that most Argentines blame him for their current misery . 
Indeed , 60 % of voters say they will never vote for Menem . 
The second candidate is Adolfo Rodríguez Saá , who proudly announced during his farcical seven-day tenure as provisional president in December 2001 that Argentina would default on its commitments to international creditors . 
Duhalde &apos;s government openly supports the third candidate , Néstor Kirchner . 
Perón himself would be proud of the absurd demagogy of the three men who would claim his mantle . 
Menem promises to raise both private- and public-sector salaries by 30 % , while also slashing the budget . 
Rodríguez Saá says he will invalidate all 25,000 laws currently on the books - including the nation &apos;s civil , commercial , and penal codes - unless they are ratified anew by Congress within 180 days of his taking office . 
He would also revoke contracts of electricity , communications , and transportation providers . 
Finally , Kirchner promises to continue the Duhalde government &apos;s do-nothing policies , hoping to keep his heterogeneous political base intact . 
The disastrous legacy of de la Rúa &apos;s government has , meanwhile , severely handicapped the two other serious presidential candidates , Ricardo López Murphy and Elisa Carrió , as both are former Radicals . 
Even so , it is a measure of the exceedingly poor choice on offer from the Peronists that support for López Murphy , an honorable , well _ educated economist who was Defense Minister under de la Rúa , has climbed steadily since the beginning of the year . 
Indeed , pre-election polls put him just behind Menem and Kirchner . 
The tightness of the race makes a second-round run-off vote appear certain . 
If that contest , set for May 18 th , is between Menem and Kirchner , then Peronism &apos;s factions will , as in the past , quickly reunite afterwards , motivated by their lust for power and the spoils of victory . 
But if López Murphy advances to the second round , he could well win , particularly given Menem &apos;s negative image . 
This might not mean the end of Peronism , but it could allow Argentina to begin addressing the roots of its deep malaise .
