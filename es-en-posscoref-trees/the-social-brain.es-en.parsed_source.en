The Social Brain 
Imitation , as the saying goes , is the sincerest form of flattery . 
Indeed , imitation appears to be a vital key to understanding human development , from behavior and language to empathy and social skills . 
Compared with most other species , human beings are so immature at birth that they require an exceptionally long period of nursing and shelter . 
We spend our long infancy and childhood adapting to the widely varying and complex sociocultural environment that surrounds us . 
This allows us to interact and operate successfully within our environment throughout our lives . 
From the outset , even before we develop the ability to use spoken language , nonverbal communication drastically shapes our personality and sense of self . 
Children learn by watching adults and other children , developing important skills under continuous social feedback . 
This feedback enables proper production and , later , understanding , of emotion-related facial expressions that the subject herself cannot see . 
Fortunately for human development , healthy children find imitation enormously gratifying . 
They enjoy both imitating and being imitated . 
Imitation is so essential to mastering basic social skills and transferring cultural knowledge that it is likely to have an organic basis in the brain . 
Mirror neurons , first discovered in monkeys , may serve such a function , providing a common code between the sender and receiver of a nonverbal message . 
A monkey &apos;s mirror neurons are activated both when he himself is acting , say , taking a raisin from a tray , and when he is viewing another monkey ( or the human experimenter ) performing the same act . 
Brain imaging studies have now shown that the human brain contains a similar mirror-neuron system ( MNS ) . 
For example , merely viewing another person &apos;s movements activates our own motor cortex , which we normally use for precise control of our actual movements . 
As sports fans , musicians , and students of body language know , watching other people &apos;s movements and postures may facilitate the viewer &apos;s own motor schemes , sometimes resulting in unintended imitation . 
One can copy movements and motor acts without understanding their meaning . 
This happens when a flock of geese suddenly takes flight from a lake , &quot; blindly &quot; following the flock &apos;s first frightened member . 
For humans , the MNS may provide a more sophisticated copying mechanism that helps us to understand the intentions of other people - in a sense , to read their minds . 
Humans compute other people &apos;s intentions and emotions continuously , constantly observing their movements , postures , and gaze . 
These mind-reading skills are essential for successful social interaction . 
Researchers have found that a key part of the human MNS is Broca &apos;s region , an area of the brain that , when damaged , prevents the patient from speaking . 
Broca &apos;s region is the human counterpart of the monkey mirror-neuron area . 
As both human and monkey mirror neurons code hand manipulation and facial gestures , some interesting hypotheses have emerged . 
For example , the presence of mirror neurons in Broca &apos;s region suggests that human language co-evolved with hand and facial gestures rather than arising directly from vocalizations . 
In humans , Broca &apos;s region is found in the left brain hemisphere , whose dominance for speech is well known . 
But the corresponding area is larger also in the left brain of great apes , further indicating that the Broca &apos;s region evolved first for gestural communication and only later for speech . 
Behavioral studies , too , have shown that gesturing is closely related to speech production . 
To take a familiar example , we gesture even while speaking on the telephone , when others cannot see us . 
Indeed , congenitally blind persons gesture - even while speaking with people they know to be blind as well ! 
The existence of the human MNS means that the same brain areas may be activated when we perform a motor act and when we merely observe another person perform a similar act . 
This leads to an obvious question : how do we know that we actually performed a motor act rather than only seeing it ? 
For most people , physical feedback provided by muscle and tendon sensors helps in resolving this , as does proper communication between brain areas . 
But misattribution of one &apos;s own acts does , in fact , occur in some psychiatric disorders . 
Other disorders are associated with defective imitation skills . 
For example , autistic individuals imitate others less and in a different manner than healthy subjects . 
They also have poor mind-reading skills . 
Some patients , by contrast , suffer at the opposite extreme of dysfunction . 
They &quot; echo , &quot; imitating almost all movements of other people . 
Perhaps most intriguing , the MNS could provide a platform for mental simulation of future actions - one &apos;s own and those of others . 
It might also be part of a larger mechanism that allows intentions , emotions , and even the intensity of pain to be matched by gestures and communicated between individuals . 
New imaging tools enable us to study these and other questions about human brain function more productively than ever before . 
We can now accurately follow in both time and space the brain &apos;s processing routes , which are determined not only by genes , but also by all the experience that an individual has gained during her entire lifetime . 
In these studies , neurologists , psychiatrists , geneticists , and behavioral researchers all contribute to realizing their common interest in discovering how the human brain operates . 
Brain imaging , combined with the new conceptual framework implied by research on the mirror-neuron system , promises to uncover a more holistic &quot; social &quot; brain . 
This brain &apos;s functions and dysfunctions - its very structure - will broaden dramatically our understanding of the relationship between the self and others .
