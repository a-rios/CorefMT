The Dollar and the Dragon 
CAMBRIDGE - For several years , American officials have pressed China to revalue its currency . 
They complain that the undervalued renminbi represents unfair competition , destroying American jobs , and contributing to the United States &quot; trade deficit . 
How , then , should US officials respond ? 
Just before the recent G-20 meeting in Toronto , China announced a formula that would allow modest renminbi appreciation , but some American Congressmen remain unconvinced , and threaten to increase tariffs on Chinese goods . 
America absorbs Chinese imports , pays China in dollars , and China holds dollars , amassing $ 2.5 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves , much of it held in US Treasury securities . 
To some observers , this represents a fundamental shift in the global balance of power , because China could bring the US to its knees by threatening to sell its dollars . 
But , if China were to bring the US to it knees , it might bring itself to its ankles in the process . 
China would not only reduce the value of its reserves as the dollar &apos;s value fell , but it would also jeopardize America &apos;s continued willingness to import cheap Chinese goods , which would mean job losses and instability in China . 
Judging whether economic interdependence produces power requires looking at the balance of asymmetries , not just at one side of the equation . 
In this case , interdependence has created a &quot; balance of financial terror &quot; analogous to the Cold War , when the US and the Soviet Union never used their potential to destroy each other in a nuclear exchange . 
In February 2010 , angered over American arms sales to Taiwan , a group of senior military officers called for the Chinese government to sell off US government bonds in retaliation . 
Their proposal went unheeded . 
Instead , Yi Gang , China &apos;s director of state administration of foreign exchange , explained that &quot; Chinese investments in US Treasuries are market investment behavior , and we don &apos;t wish to politicize them . &quot; 
Otherwise , the pain would be mutual . 
Nevertheless , this balance does not guarantee stability . 
There is always the danger of actions with unintended consequences , especially as both countries can be expected to maneuver to change the framework and reduce their vulnerabilities . 
For example , after the 2008 financial crisis , while the US pressed China to let its currency appreciate , officials at China &apos;s central bank began arguing that America needed to increase its savings , reduce its deficits , and move toward supplementing the dollar &apos;s role as a reserve currency with IMF-issued special drawing rights . 
But China &apos;s bark was louder than its bite . 
China &apos;s increased financial power may have increased its ability to resist American entreaties , but despite dire predictions , its creditor role has not been sufficient to compel the US to change its policies . 
While China has taken minor measures to slow the increase in its dollar-denominated holdings , it has been unwilling to risk a fully convertible currency for domestic political reasons . 
Thus , the renminbi is unlikely to challenge the dollar &apos;s role as the largest component of world reserves ( more than 60 % ) in the next decade . 
Yet , as China gradually increases domestic consumption rather than relying on exports as its engine of economic growth , its leaders may begin to feel less dependent than they now are on access to the US market as a source of job creation , which is crucial for internal political stability . 
In that case , maintaining a weak renminbi would protect the trade balance from a flood of imports . 
Asymmetries in currency markets are a particularly important aspect of economic power , since they underlie global trade and financial markets . 
By limiting the convertibility of its currency , China is avoiding currency markets &quot; ability to discipline domestic economic decisions . 
Compare , for example , the discipline that international banks and the IMF were able to impose on Indonesia and South Korea in 1998 , with the relative freedom of the US - bestowed by denomination of American debt in dollars - to increase government spending in response to the 2008 financial crisis . 
Indeed , rather than weakening , the dollar has appreciated as investors regard the underlying strength of the US as a safe haven . 
Obviously , a country whose currency represents a significant proportion of world reserves can gain international power from that position , thanks to easier terms for economic adjustment and the ability to influence other countries . 
As French President Charles de Gaulle once complained , &quot; since the dollar is the reference currency everywhere , it can cause others to suffer the effects of its poor management . 
This is not acceptable . 
This cannot last . &quot; 
But it did . 
America &apos;s military and economic strength reinforces confidence in the dollar as a safe haven . 
As a Canadian analyst put it , &quot; the combined effect of an advanced capital market and a strong military machine to defend that market , and other safety measures , such as a strong tradition of property rights protection and a reputation for honoring dues , has made it possible to attract capital with great ease . &quot; 
The G-20 is focusing on the need to &quot; re-balance &quot; financial flows , altering the old pattern of US deficits matching Chinese surpluses . 
This would require politically difficult shifts in consumption and investment , with America increasing its savings and China increasing domestic consumption . 
Such changes do not occur quickly . 
Neither side is in a hurry to break the symmetry of interdependent vulnerability , but both continue to jockey to shape the structure and institutional framework of their market relationship . 
For the sake of the global economy , let us hope that neither side miscalculates .
