Is Europe &apos;s Housing Market Next ? 
A bubble in the American housing market - fueled in part by so-called &quot; sub-prime &quot; mortgages - was the catalyst for today &apos;s financial market turbulence . 
But the bubble was not confined to the United States . 
In Europe , house prices have also increased sharply over the last decade - more dramatically than in the US in many cases . 
The same is true of other OECD countries and emerging markets , where rapidly increasing incomes have put pressure on asset prices . 
Indeed , with a few exceptions ( essentially Germany and Japan ) , housing prices have risen almost everywhere to levels never seen before . 
How could such a global pattern emerge when real estate is the most local of all assets ? 
Recent research suggests that the global housing boom was closely linked to the unprecedented increase in the supply of liquidity by major central banks . 
To be sure , financial innovation , like lending to buyers who would not normally have qualified for mortgage loans ( sub-prime borrowers ) also played a role . 
But sub-prime mortgages would probably not have been supplied on the same scale if central banks had not created an environment of ample liquidity and persistently low interest rates . 
The sub-prime crisis has so far affected mainly financial markets in the US and Europe . 
This is not surprising if one considers that on both sides of the Atlantic prices have reached historical peaks and , until recently , had accelerated . 
This is no mere coincidence . 
There has always been a correlation between American and European house prices . 
Over the last three decades , prices in the US and Europe have tended to follow three slow-moving , related boom-bust cycles . 
All previous peaks were followed by several years of declining prices ( in real terms ) . 
There is no reason to assume that this cycle will be any different . 
Since last year , prices have declined in the US . 
Because data for the euro area will become available only much later , it is not yet possible to determine whether prices have already turned on the Continent as well . 
But if the past pattern holds , house prices should start to fall very soon in ( continental ) Europe as well . 
In both the US and Europe it seems that prices went 20-30 % above their longer-term average values . 
Such a large overshooting is likely to be followed by some undershooting . 
This would imply that prices will probably have to fall at least by 20-30 % , but possibly considerably more before they find a bottom . 
European policy makers thus have cause for concern . 
While there is little evidence in the euro area of large-scale sub-prime lending , there is considerable evidence to suggest that house prices have an important impact on domestic demand , albeit with wide variations among individual countries . 
Almost everywhere , higher house prices have been associated with strong consumption . 
Lower house prices throughout Europe are thus likely to be accompanied by weaker consumption demand , as in the US . 
In Germany , for example , house prices have remained relatively low and consumption weak . 
The impact of house prices on construction activity has been more varied . 
In Spain and Ireland , construction investment has increased to a level ( 18-20 % of GDP ) far above that of the US and not seen in any other OECD country except Japan before its bubble burst in 1989 . 
In these two countries , lower housing prices are likely to be associated with a sharp and prolonged drop in domestic demand , which should be stronger even than what can be expected in the US . 
By contrast , in France and Italy , where house prices have increased almost as much as in the US , there is no evidence of a housing overhang . 
The negative impact of a downturn in housing prices in these two countries should thus be limited to a drop in consumption . 
Germany should be affected the least , because both house prices and construction activity have been below trend for some time . 
In short , the downturn in house prices will not be limited to the US . 
And , on both sides of the Atlantic , that decline is likely to undermine consumer spending .
