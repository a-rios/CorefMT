The Decline of US Military Innovation 
NEW YORK - The United States is at risk of losing its military edge . 
America &apos;s armed forces may still be the most advanced in the world ; after all , the US spends more than twice as much on military research and development as major powers like France and Russia , and nine times more than China and Germany . 
But America &apos;s continued technological leadership is far from assured . 
Since 2005 , the US Department of Defense has cut R D spending by 22 % . 
In 2013 , as part of a deal to avert a showdown over the debt ceiling , the US Congress mandated some $ 1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts . 
The move , which requires reduced spending in numerous programs , including many defense research initiatives , was described by US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration as &quot; deeply destructive to national security . &quot; 
If US defense innovation continues to erode , not only will America &apos;s defense capabilities suffer ; the country will also risk slipping in terms of commercial innovation and competitiveness . 
Budget limitations pose some of the greatest challenges to the US military &apos;s efforts to maintain its technological edge . 
The Army and the Missile Defense Agency have been particularly hard hit , with R D spending nearly halved since 2005 . 
The Navy &apos;s research budget has been cut by some 20 % , and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) - the organization tasked with keeping the US military ahead of the technological curve - has had to slash R D spending by 18 % . 
Even the Air Force , where research spending has traditionally been a congressional priority , has been forced to cut its budget by roughly 4 % . 
When money does get allocated , cost pressures too often encourage investment in projects that promise quick results - a bias that comes at the expense of long-term innovation that could provide a strategic advantage . 
Even DARPA has fallen prey to pressure for research that can demonstrate immediate progress . 
To make matters worse , the US military &apos;s innovation efforts face several structural problems . 
Six decades of attempts to reform the defense acquisition process have yet to yield fruit . 
Most of the design , development , and production of military systems is carried out by civilian industry , but decision-making remains firmly in the hands of military officials , who may not be able to strike the right balance between cost-cutting and innovation . 
Rivalries within and among the military services once mimicked the role of competition in the private sector : they drove innovation . 
But with the end of the Cold War , the pressure to remain a step ahead has waned , depriving the defense sector of a crucial engine of progress . 
Moreover , top defense contractors &quot; R D spending as a proportion of sales plummeted by nearly a third from 1999 to 2012 . 
By contrast , America &apos;s technology giants invest 4-6 times as much in R D. 
Meanwhile , the US is suffering from the hollowing out of its defense industrial base . 
Increased competition from China and other large emerging economies has eroded US manufacturing capabilities , jeopardizing America &apos;s ability to develop the most technologically sophisticated defense platforms . 
The defense industry once created the new technologies - lasers , GPS , and the Internet , for example - that helped drive the American economy . 
Today , in most fields , civilian technology is likely to be leading the way . 
The result can be seen in the rise of foreign competition in the international arms market . 
American manufacturers are finding themselves increasingly vulnerable in areas that they once dominated - including unmanned aerial platforms , intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance , missiles , and satellites - as low-cost competitors gain market share . 
In 2013 , Russia &apos;s weapons exports surpassed America &apos;s by more than $ 2 billion . 
In November , US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced a new initiative to &quot; sustain and advance America &apos;s military dominance for the twenty-first century . &quot; 
In a time of shrinking budgets and shifting strategic challenges , he focused on innovation . 
&quot; Continued fiscal pressure will likely limit our military &apos;s ability to respond to long-term challenges by increasing the size of our force or simply outspending potential adversaries on current systems , &quot; he said . 
&quot; So to overcome challenges to our military superiority , we must change the way we innovate , operate , and do business . &quot; 
Nine days later , Hagel handed in his resignation , which will take effect as soon as the US Senate confirms his replacement . 
A policy aimed at restoring defense innovation and production in America would ensure that the US upholds its global technological leadership and commercial competitiveness . 
Unfortunately , Hagel &apos;s successor is likely to find that , in an era of limited budgets and automatic spending cuts , the type of comprehensive innovation strategy that Hagel envisioned may simply not be viable .
