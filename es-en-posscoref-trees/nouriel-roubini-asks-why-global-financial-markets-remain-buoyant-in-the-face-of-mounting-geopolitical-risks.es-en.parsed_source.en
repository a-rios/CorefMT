Markets &quot; Rational Complacency 
NEW YORK - An increasingly obvious paradox has emerged in global financial markets this year . 
Though geopolitical risks - the Russia-Ukraine conflict , the rise of the Islamic State and growing turmoil across the Middle East , China &apos;s territorial disputes with its neighbors , and now mass protests in Hong Kong and the risk of a crackdown - have multiplied , markets have remained buoyant , if not downright bubbly . 
Indeed , oil prices have been falling , not rising . 
Global stock markets have , overall , reached new highs . 
And credit markets show low spreads , while long-term bond yields have fallen in most advanced economies . 
Yes , financial markets in troubled countries - for example , Russia &apos;s currency , equity , and bond markets - have been negatively affected . 
Why the indifference ? 
Are investors too complacent , or is their apparent lack of concern rational , given that the actual economic and financial impact of current geopolitical risks - at least so far - has been modest ? 
Global markets have not reacted for several reasons . 
For starters , central banks in advanced economies ( the United States , the eurozone , the United Kingdom , and Japan ) are holding policy rates near zero , and long-term interest rates have been kept low . 
This is boosting the prices of other risky assets such as equities and credit . 
Second , markets have taken the view that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will remain contained , rather than escalating into a full-scale war . 
So , though sanctions and counter-sanctions between the West and Russia have increased , they are not causing significant economic and financial damage to the European Union or the US . 
More important , Russia has not cut off natural-gas supplies to Western Europe , which would be a major shock for gas-dependent EU economies . 
Third , the turmoil in the Middle East has not triggered a massive shock to oil supplies and prices like those that occurred in 1973 , 1979 , or 1990 . 
On the contrary , there is excess capacity in global oil markets . 
Iraq may be in trouble , but about 90 % of its oil is produced in the south , near Basra , which is fully under Shia control , or in the north , under the control of the Kurds . 
Only about 10 % is produced near Mosul , now under the control of the Islamic State . 
Finally , the one Middle East conflict that could cause oil prices to spike - a war between Israel and Iran - is a risk that , for now , is contained by ongoing international negotiations with Iran to contain its nuclear program . 
So there appear to be good reasons why global markets so far have reacted benignly to today &apos;s geopolitical risks . 
What could change that ? 
Several scenarios come to mind . 
First , the Middle East turmoil could affect global markets if one or more terrorist attack were to occur in Europe or the US - a plausible development , given that several hundred Islamic State jihadists are reported to have European or US passports . 
Markets tend to disregard the risks of events whose probability is hard to assess but that have a major impact on confidence when they do occur . 
Thus , a surprise terrorist attack could unnerve global markets . 
Second , markets could be incorrect in their assessment that conflicts like that between Russia and Ukraine , or Syria &apos;s civil war , will not escalate or spread . 
Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s foreign policy may become more aggressive in response to challenges to his power at home , while Jordan , Lebanon , and Turkey are all being destabilized by Syria &apos;s ongoing meltdown . 
Third , geopolitical and political tensions are more likely to trigger global contagion when a systemic factor shaping the global economy comes into play . 
For example , the mini-perfect storm that roiled emerging markets earlier this year - even spilling over for a while to advanced economies - occurred when political turbulence in a few countries ( Turkey , Thailand , and Argentina ) met bad news about Chinese growth . 
China , with its systemic importance , was the match that ignited a tinderbox of regional and local uncertainty . 
Today ( or soon ) , the situation in Hong Kong , together with the news of further weakening in the Chinese economy , could trigger global financial havoc . 
Or the US Federal Reserve could spark financial contagion by exiting zero rates sooner and faster than markets expect . 
Or the eurozone could relapse into recession and crisis , reviving the risk of redenomination in the event that the monetary union breaks up . 
The interaction of any of these global factors with a variety of regional and local sources of geopolitical tension could be dangerously combustible . 
So , while global markets arguably have been rationally complacent , financial contagion cannot be ruled out . 
A century ago , financial markets priced in a very low probability that a major conflict would occur , blissfully ignoring the risks that led to World War I until late in the summer of 1914 . 
Back then , markets were poor at correctly pricing low-probability , high-impact tail risks . 
They still are .
