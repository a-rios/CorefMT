Can Palestine Win the Peace ? 
RAMALLAH - The rollout of the war-ending ceasefire agreement between Israel and Palestine last month was impressive . 
With almost perfect synchronization , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced the end of the war on Gaza in a televised broadcast from his Ramallah headquarters , while Hamas leaders called on Palestinians in Gaza to take to the streets to celebrate their supposed victory . 
Of course , with more than 2,200 Palestinians - mostly civilians - killed , over 10,000 injured , and thousands of homes , schools , mosques , and other structures destroyed , the war &apos;s outcome can hardly be called a victory . 
Nonetheless , this is the first time that Palestinians have been able to create something close to mutual deterrence with the Israelis . 
Strengthening Palestine &apos;s position further is the United Nations General Assembly &apos;s recognition of Palestine as a non-member observer state , which Palestinian diplomats can use to exert political pressure on Israel to take their national aspirations seriously . 
Palestine &apos;s membership in UN agencies , not to mention the possibility of joining the International Criminal Court , has also boosted its leaders &quot; bargaining power . 
All of these levers - not to mention the tremendous sympathy and support Palestinians have received from international observers - will be essential to ensure that the high price Palestinians paid during the 51-day war was not in vain . 
The effectiveness of such a cooperative approach was apparent in the Egypt-sponsored indirect talks with Israel . 
The unified Palestinian delegation was convenient for Egypt and Israel , both of which consider Hamas a terrorist organization , and for Palestine , because it helped to bring an end to the violence . 
Having withstood the test of war , the Palestinian unity government that was created less than two months before the conflict began will now become the main vehicle for Gaza &apos;s reconstruction . 
More broadly , the unity government &apos;s success depends on the ability of the Fatah-led Palestinian government and Hamas - and , to whatever extent possible , Islamic Jihad - to cement their cooperation by agreeing on a path toward liberation and freedom . 
A clear , realistic strategy will be integral to Palestine &apos;s efforts to win support from regional and international actors eager to end the decades-old conflict with Israel . 
This will , of course , require compromises from all sides . 
Hamas must reconsider its refusal to recognize Israel . 
For its part , the Palestinian leadership must pursue active resistance alongside negotiations with Israel , while defending more vigorously Palestinians &quot; right of return , which it has often ignored in an effort to appease the Israelis . 
But establishing a unified strategy is only the first step . 
Ordinary Palestinians , who will undoubtedly have to make sacrifices , must be brought on board - especially given the heavy price they incurred during the recent conflict , in which they had no say . 
With broad public support , Palestine &apos;s unity government will be able to rally the international community behind its fair and reasonable demands for a truly independent state , free of sieges , separation barriers , and foreign settlements - demands that fall squarely within the realm of basic human rights . 
Just as the international community isolated South Africa until it abandoned apartheid , it can put pressure on Israel through boycotts , divestment , and sanctions , while calling upon Israel &apos;s allies to stop providing aid and arms . 
If Palestine &apos;s leaders truly want to end the cycle of violence in Gaza , they must begin by resolving their own internal disagreements and present themselves as a cohesive , reliable , and committed negotiating party . 
They must band together behind the simple but powerful goal expressed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the General Assembly in New York : &quot; We will build again , but this must be the last time to rebuild . &quot; 
For Palestine &apos;s unity government , the time to begin the rebuilding process is now . 
If Fatah and Hamas are willing to do what it takes to achieve peace , this may well be their best chance .
