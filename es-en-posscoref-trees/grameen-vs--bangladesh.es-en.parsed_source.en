Grameen vs. Bangladesh 
HONG KONG - The feud in Bangladesh between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Mohammed Yunus , the founder of the microloan-making Grameen Bank and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , is being portrayed as a modern-day replay of the famous battle between the wicked Kauravas and the virtuous Pandavas in the Indian epic , the Mahabharata . 
The suggestion is that a vindictive prime minister is playing politics in punishing the saintly Yunus , the man who pioneered microfinance , for having threatened to enter politics . 
Sheikh Hasina is even being compared to Russia &apos;s Vladimir Putin in his campaign against the oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky . 
But the Grameen case is more complicated , and carries a moral contrary to what Yunus &apos;s well-managed public-relations campaign suggests . 
First , Sheikh Hasina is no ordinary politician . 
She is the daughter of the first president of Bangladesh , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , a charismatic leader often described as the Father of the Nation , who was assassinated in August 1975 by the army . 
Hasina won office in 2009 after a landslide victory in an election that was free from fraud . 
She is also one of the few women to have gained the premiership not by inheriting it , but in her own right , long after her parents and some of her siblings were murdered . 
Sheikh Hasina escaped the massacre of her family only because she was in Germany at the time . 
Over many years , she patiently worked her way back into , and to the top of , Bangladeshi politics . 
Moreover , Sheikh Hasina has gained political power at the polls in an Islamic country , which is no mean feat for a woman . 
By getting the US to side with Yunus against the Bangladeshi prime minister , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seems guilty of arrogantly intervening in the domestic affairs of a friendly , democratic government - in direct contradiction of President Barack Obama &apos;s preferred modus operandi . 
Second , many of those now discounting Sheikh Hasina &apos;s credentials are guilty of inflating those of Yunus . 
Consider the frequent refrain that Yunus is the &quot; pioneer &quot; of the microfinance movement . 
In fact , the true pioneer of microfinance is a remarkable woman from Ahmedabad , India ( where Mahatma Gandhi had his ashram ) , Ela Bhatt , a follower of Gandhi who established SEWA ( Self-Employed Women &apos;s Association ) as a bank in April 1974 , two years before Yunus founded his Grameen Bank Project in Jobra , Bangladesh . 
Throughout its existence , SEWA has been regulated by India &apos;s central bank , the Reserve Bank of India , staying strictly within the law and seeking no special dispensations . 
Unlike the Grameen Bank , it has received no foreign money ( such as the grant of $ 100 million from Norway , the handling of which led to the initial charges of malfeasance against Yunus ) , and it has distributed dividends of 9-12 % annually each year since its founding . 
Yunus is suspected of covering up losses at Grameen with huge sums of money from abroad , whereas SEWA has demonstrated that poor , self-employed women can own and run a financial body in a self-sustained fashion without external largesse . 
Third , many Bangladeshis , jealous of the independence they secured in the crucible of the Pakistani army &apos;s genocide in East Pakistan 40 years ago , resent the vast influx of foreign money , which has turned Grameen and Yunus almost into a rival to the democratically elected government , a phenomenon that no government would tolerate . 
Indeed , Clinton &apos;s intervention in the feud between Yunus and the Sheikh Hasina highlights the danger of foreign influence in Bangladesh &apos;s internal affairs . 
Finally , there is the issue of microfinance itself . 
Microlending is certainly a useful supplement to tested anti-poverty policy instruments - and one that pays an extra dividend insofar as it aids women . 
But the fact is that India &apos;s massive economic reforms , which began in earnest in 1991 , have had a far greater impact on poverty , and indeed on the incomes of several disadvantaged groups , including women . 
This has been amply documented by recent empirical studies , which have shown that earlier assertions to the contrary were wrong . 
By contrast , Bangladesh has not experienced anything like India &apos;s acceleration in economic growth . 
As Sheikh Hasina has seemed to appreciate since returning to office two years ago , Bangladesh has for decades been handicapped by doctrines that undermine growth . 
Unfortunately , Bangladesh &apos;s most influential economists , and hence the country &apos;s policies , remain mired in the growth-killing socialist economics that they learned at Cambridge and the London School of Economics a half-century ago . 
Ela Bhatt &apos;s SEWA adds to the huge benefits to the poor and underprivileged that a reformed macroeconomic policy framework has brought to India . 
By contrast , Yunus &apos;s Grameen Bank puts at best a microeconomic finger in the leaky dyke of Bangladesh &apos;s largely unreformed macroeconomic policies . 
Can we hope that the Grameen affair will be a prelude to the fight for the liberal reforms that will transform the Bangladeshi economy ?
