Ending the Syrian Horror 
RIYADH - No issue in the world today is of greater immediate importance than the need to end the civil war in Syria . 
The past two and a half years have been a disaster for peace , stability , and our sense of common humanity . 
Gut-wrenching images of unspeakable , indiscriminate violence against civilians have shocked the world . 
According to the latest United Nations estimates , more than 100,000 Syrians , including many children , have lost their lives as a result of the criminal behavior of Bashar al-Assad &apos;s regime . 
There are now more than two million Syrian refugees in bordering countries and more than four million displaced persons inside Syria . 
With the murder of peaceful protesters , the shelling of residential quarters , the execution of soldiers who refuse to fire on their countrymen , and the use of chemical weapons , a picture has emerged of a regime that is systematically defying the most basic international moral and legal standards . 
Unless the world is content to watch the carnage continue , the Syrian regime and its instruments of oppression must be removed . 
The international community &apos;s shameful acceptance of impunity for Assad and his henchmen is a blot on the conscience of the world . 
Western leaders &quot; dithering , and the callous , cynical , and cavalier support of Russia and China for Assad , is a stigma that they will bear forever . 
Iran &apos;s support for the regime is nothing less than a war crime . 
The current charade of international control over Assad &apos;s chemical arsenal would be amusing if it were not so blatantly perfidious . 
While it has allowed US President Barack Obama to back down from his threat of military intervention in response to the regime &apos;s use of chemical weapons , it has also allowed Assad to continue to butcher his people . 
It is ludicrous to believe that US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s &quot; offhand &quot; comment about destroying Syria &apos;s chemical-weapons stockpile was anything but a well-choreographed opening for Russia to make its diplomatic play , thereby letting the US off the hook . 
If the world , and especially the American people , believe that removing Assad &apos;s chemical weapons will end his government &apos;s slaughter of innocent men , women , and children , then all semblance of rational thought , humanitarian care , and regard for national interest has been thrown to the wind . 
Preventing Assad from using his killing machine by any means , including targeted strikes on his air force and command-and-control centers , is the only way to end the bloodshed in Syria . 
Yet , despite public promises by Kerry to supply the Syrian opposition with weapons - and even after Obama declared that Assad must go - Martin Dempsey , Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , announced that the Pentagon had no such plans . 
Why make such a statement , when it can bring only chagrin and despair to the victims , and comfort and solace to a criminal regime ? 
How one can reconcile such contradictions is beyond me . 
If we continue to delay military action , we will have to intervene with greater force when the carnage spreads to Lebanon , Israel , Jordan , Turkey , and Iraq . 
Indeed , Lebanon , following the collapse of Najib Mikati &apos;s government , is already on the brink of civil war , as direct intervention in Syria by Hezbollah , Iran &apos;s Lebanese proxy , to prevent Assad &apos;s overthrow has exacerbated the country &apos;s own longstanding sectarian tensions . 
Witness the recent car-bomb attacks in a Hezbollah-controlled neighborhood of Beirut and in the northern city of Tripoli . 
If law and order are to prevail , Hezbollah must be neutralized , and the Syrian-dispatched assassins of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri must be brought to justice . 
Saudi Arabia is doing what it can to help . 
The Kingdom is providing financial aid to Lebanon in an effort to rebuild a stronger , more stable country , and to roll back the influence of Iran . 
We have long pushed for the disarming of Hezbollah , and we have assisted the government with nearly $ 1 billion in financial support and credit to purchase weapons for the Lebanese Army , and we will continue to do so in the coming decade . 
But , unless the international community -particularly the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - begins to fulfill its obligations in Syria , money will not be enough to prevent further chaos and destruction .
