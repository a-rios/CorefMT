Varoufakis &apos;s Great Game 
MUNICH - Game theorists know that a Plan A is never enough . 
As the Greek government &apos;s anointed &quot; heavy , &quot; he is working Plan B ( a potential exit from the eurozone ) , while Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras makes himself available for Plan A ( an extension on Greece &apos;s loan agreement , and a renegotiation of the terms of its bailout ) . 
In a sense , they are playing the classic game of &quot; good cop / bad cop &quot; - and , so far , to great effect . 
Plan B comprises two key elements . 
Greece &apos;s citizens must believe that they are escaping grave injustice if they are to continue to trust their government during the difficult period that would follow an exit from the eurozone . 
Second , the Greek government is driving up the costs of Plan B for the other side , by allowing capital flight by its citizens . 
If it so chose , the government could contain this trend with a more conciliatory approach , or stop it outright with the introduction of capital controls . 
But doing so would weaken its negotiating position , and that is not an option . 
Capital flight does not mean that capital is moving abroad in net terms , but rather that private capital is being turned into public capital . 
Basically , Greek citizens take out loans from local banks , funded largely by the Greek central bank , which acquires funds through the European Central Bank &apos;s emergency liquidity assistance ( ELA ) scheme . 
They then transfer the money to other countries to purchase foreign assets ( or redeem their debts ) , draining liquidity from their country &apos;s banks . 
Other eurozone central banks are thus forced to create new money to fulfill the payment orders for the Greek citizens , effectively giving the Greek central bank an overdraft credit , as measured by the so-called TARGET liabilities . 
In January and February , Greece &apos;s TARGET debts increased by almost € 1 billion ( $ 1.1 billion ) per day , owing to capital flight by Greek citizens and foreign investors . 
At the end of April , those debts amounted to € 99 billion . 
A Greek exit would not damage the accounts that its citizens have set up in other eurozone countries - let alone cause Greeks to lose the assets they have purchased with those accounts . 
But it would leave those countries &quot; central banks stuck with euro-denominated TARGET claims vis-à-vis Greece &apos;s central bank , which would have assets denominated only in a restored drachma . 
Given the new currency &apos;s inevitable devaluation , together with the fact that the Greek government does not have to backstop its central bank &apos;s debt , a default depriving the other central banks of their claims would be all but certain . 
A similar situation arises when Greek citizens withdraw cash from their accounts and hoard it in suitcases or take it abroad . 
If Greece abandoned the euro , a substantial share of these funds - which totaled € 43 billion at the end of April - would flow into the rest of the eurozone , both to purchase goods and assets and to pay off debts , resulting in a net loss for the monetary union &apos;s remaining members . 
All of this strengthens the Greek government &apos;s negotiating position considerably . 
Small wonder , then , that Varoufakis and Tsipras are playing for time , refusing to submit a list of meaningful reform proposals . 
The ECB bears considerable responsibility for this situation . 
By failing to produce the two-thirds majority in the ECB Council needed to limit the Greek central bank &apos;s self-serving strategy , it has allowed the creation of more than € 80 billion in emergency liquidity , which exceeds the Greek central bank &apos;s € 41 billion in recoverable assets . 
With Greece &apos;s banks guaranteed the needed funds , the government has been spared from having to introduce capital controls . 
Rumor has it that the ECB is poised to adjust its approach - and soon . 
It knows that its argument that the ELA loans are collateralized is wearing thin , given that , in many cases , the collateral has a rating below BBB- , thus falling short of investment grade . 
If the ECB finally acknowledges that this will not do , and removes Greece &apos;s liquidity safety net , the Greek government would be forced to start negotiating seriously , because waiting would no longer do it any good . 
But , with the stock of money sent abroad and held in cash having already ballooned to 79 % of GDP , its position would remain very strong . 
In other words , thanks largely to the ECB , the Greek government would be able to secure a far more favorable outcome - including increased financial assistance and reduced reform requirements - than it could have gained at any point in the past . 
And if Greece exits , a large share of the acquired resources measured by the TARGET balances and the cash that has been printed would turn into an endowment gift for an independent future . 
Many people in Europe seem to believe that Varoufakis , an experienced game theorist but a political neophyte , does not know how to play the cards that Greece has been dealt . 
They should think again - before Greece walks away with the pot .
